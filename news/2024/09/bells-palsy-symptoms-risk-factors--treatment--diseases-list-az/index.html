                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>What is Bell’s Palsy? Bell’s palsy is a temporary weakness that occurs on one side of the facial muscles.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The side of the face affected by Bell’s palsy will usually appear to droop.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Generally, this condition occurs in pregnant women, people with diabetes, and HIV.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This nerve condition is often misunderstood as cerebral palsy, or the meaning is often confused.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In fact, Bell’s palsy and cerebral palsy are two different conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Bell’s palsy is a condition where damaged nerves in the face affect the sense of taste and the way the body produces tears and saliva.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Bell’s palsy usually comes on suddenly and gets better within a few weeks.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Meanwhile, cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect muscle movement and coordination.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The condition occurs due to damage to the immature and developing brain, and most often occurs before birth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In many cases, cerebral palsy also affects vision, hearing, and sensation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Bell’s palsy will cause one-half of the face to appear to droop.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Smiles can only be done on one side, and the eye on the affected side refuses to close.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition is also known as acute peripheral facial paralysis, the cause of which is unknown, and can occur at any age.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The exact cause is unknown, but many experts believe the condition is the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Or it may be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Bells Palsy Symptoms Bell palsy causes different symptoms in each sufferer.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Symptoms of paralysis that occur on one side of the face can be divided into two types, namely: Partial paralysis (mild muscle weakness).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Total paralysis (no movement at all, but this is very rare).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Bell’s palsy also affects the sufferer’s mouth and eyelids, making it difficult for these two parts to open and close.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The following are the symptoms of Bell’s palsy that you need to know: Ear pain on the paralyzed side of the face.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Ringing in one or both ears.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Decreased or changed sense of taste.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The affected part of the mouth will drool easily.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Mouth feels dry.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Bell’s palsy is a disorder that occurs in the muscles and nerves of the face, so this condition does not impact the performance of the brain and other parts of the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If paralysis on one side of the face is also accompanied by paralysis in other parts of the body, the sufferer really needs serious treatment from a doctor.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Risk Factors A link was found between migraines and weakness in the face and limbs.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, they suspect that this condition occurs because the nerves that control the facial muscles are compressed or disturbed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In addition, the cause of paralysis occurs due to inflammation of a viral infection, one of which is the herpes virus.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> You need to know that Bell’s palsy has nothing to do with stroke.</p>
