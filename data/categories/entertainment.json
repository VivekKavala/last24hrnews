        "title": "'All The Travel, Drama, Pressure...': KL Rahul Breaks Silence On LSG Exit Ahead Of IPL Auction",
        "text": "Towards the end of Lucknow Super Giant\u2019s IPL 2024 campaign, they endured a 10-wicket thrashing at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad. The defeat was followed by visuals of the then captain KL Rahul involved in an animated discussion with the franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka raising speculations of a rift which they both denied.\nAhead of the IPL 2025 mega auctions though, LSG released Rahul, their captain of three seasons and on the day of the announcement, Goenka explained that they wanted players who \u201cput the team before their personal goals and aspirations\u201d and \u201chave a mindset to win\u201d.\nRahul says Goenka\u2019s comment didn\u2019t push him towards leaving the franchise but a desire to start afresh and play where he can find some freedom.\n\u201cNo, I mean, I think the decision was made already and I don\u2019t know what the comments are, but they must have come after the announcement,\u201d Rahul told Star Sports. \u201cI just felt like I wanted to start fresh, I wanted to explore my options and I wanted to go and play where I could find some freedom and the team atmosphere would be something much more balanced.\u201d\nUnder Rahul, LSG qualified for playoffs twice in a row before finishing seventh this season. Rahul hinted external factors played their role in the team\u2019s poor show in IPL 2024.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always ups and downs,\u201d Rahul said. \u201cYou need to be able to hold your nerves and be able to keep and you need to be able to keep putting up good performances after good performances. All the travel, all the drama outside, the pressure \u2013 all of it is there every year. But somehow this season, it felt like there was a lot more and somehow I think that affected the team and we couldn\u2019t put in performances when it really mattered.\u201d\nFor Rahul, being a captain isn\u2019t paramount, but he only wants to be part of a team with \u201cgood environment\u201d.\n\u201cI would never go and ask someone for it. If you feel that my leadership skills are good enough, and you find something good in the way I play my cricket and in the way I handle myself, the way that I handle the team that I\u2019ve captained in the last four to five years, and if you find it worthy, then of course I\u2019m happy to do it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not something that is a make or break for me. I just want to be part of a team that has a good environment. You feel loved, cared for and respected in that environment and everyone on that franchise has one single goal to win the idea. there then that\u2019s a perfect fit,\u201d he added.",

        "text": "Today, we will talk about Pranav Mohanlal, son of actor Mohanlal, who is currently living his best life on a farm in Spain. The Hridayam actor\u2019s mother, Suchitra, recently shared details about his adventures and how he is working to balance his life. She mentioned that he is enjoying a simple life away from stardom and embracing his true self. As we explore his travel stories, let\u2019s take a closer look at who Pranav Mohanlal is.\n\nWho is Pranav Mohanlal?\n\n Pranav Mohanlal was born to Malayalam superstar Mohanlal and his wife Suchitra in Kerala on July 13, 1990. He also has a younger sister named Vismaya. Pranav went to a boarding school in Ooty and completed his graduation from the University of New South Wales in Australia. \n\nHe made his acting debut as a child artist with the 2002 film titled Onnaman, starring his father Mohanlal as the main lead. In the same year, Pranav featured in the movie Punarjani, where he played the role of a troubled child named Appu. The film was a massive success, and fans began to refer to the actor as \"Appu.\"\n\nPranav's performance stunned the viewers, and he received the Kerala State Film Award for Best Child Artist for his role in the film. \n\nFollowing the success of Punarjani, Pranav took a break from acting to focus on studies. He maintained a low profile as he was not keen on returning to showbiz. The actor always loved to travel and read books.\n\n However, in 2014, he began working as an assistant director for Jeethu Joseph. After a while, he decided to make his comeback as an actor and featured in the film titled Aadhi. The movie was a success owing to good word-of-mouth. Some of Pranav's notable works include Hridayam, Varshangalkku Shesham, Irupathiyonnaam Noottaandu, and more.\n\nPranav Mohanlal's simple lifestyle\n\n Pranav Mohanlal is currently living away from his family on a farm in Spain. Instead of taking money, the actor is working in exchange for food and shelter. In an interview with FTQ with Rekha Menon, Suchitra said, \"Appu is in Spain now working on a farm or something. There's no money involved, only accommodation and food. Sometimes, the work involves looking after horses or lambs. It's an experience. He shares stories whenever he's back from his travels.\"\n\nShe further shared that Pranav has his own plans and thinks differently. He is happy doing a few films and traveling across the world. The actor last featured in the 2024 film Varshangalkku Shesham. \nALSO READ: Who is Sreeleela? Meet new South sensation who will be seen in Pushpa 2's dance number and has worked with Mahesh Babu",

        "text": "All eyes have been on Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan ever since speculations of their divorce have surfaced. The couple married in 2007, at the height of their careers, and welcomed their daughter, Aaradhya, four years later. However, more than a decade after their marriage, troubles seem to have struck their lives as the two have refrained from making any appearances together in the past. Both have chosen to maintain a dignified silence about the situation. Meanwhile, their fans have been concerned and seeking answers.\nRecently, Aishwarya and Abhishek\u2019s fans dug out a video where the Dhoom 2 actress sat for an interaction on the popular chat show Rendezvous with Simi Garewal. During their conversation, the host talked about the actress\u2019 \u201ctwo faces,\u201d highlighting that she has seen her public face as \u201cthe star\u201d and has also seen her \u201cprivate face\u201d with her family.\nSimi said, \u201cPeople would be surprised because there\u2019s the glamorous red carpet, and there are simple middle-class values at home,\u201d and asked, \u201cYour parents, they still cringe at scandals, don\u2019t they?\u201d Aishwarya, in a calm and composed way, answered, \u201cI\u2019m sure. We are all sensitive people. They get more upset if it hurts me.\u201d\nAs soon as Aishwarya completed her sentence, Simi played a video of an earlier interaction with the actress. In the clip, the Mohabbatein actress mentioned that she\u2019s \u201chypersensitive\u201d and added, \u201cIt\u2019s good because it keeps me rooted, but the negative is sometimes it really takes over. So, while I come across as cool, calm and composed, it\u2019s not a front. I think that\u2019s a facet to me.\u201d\nAishwarya also discussed that she wanted to be thicker-skinned. She said, \u201cSometimes I just wish I was more tough, more thick-skinned, which I am not.\u201d When the video ended, Simi asked her if she developed a thick skin. Aishwarya chuckled at the question and answered, \u201cNo, I wish.\u201d\n\nOn Aishwarya Rai\u2019s recent birthday, the Bachchan family did not share any posts wishing the actress a happy birthday, further intensifying the rumours of trouble in the family. Even her husband did not share anything on his wife\u2019s 51st birthday.\nFor the uninitiated, the speculations of Abhishek and Aishwarya\u2019s separation spread like wildfire when the Bachchan family entered Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant\u2019s wedding venue together. At the same time, Aishwarya and her daughter Aaradhya arrived separately, raising quite a few eyebrows.",

Who doesn't know who Orry is?\" Ananya interrupted, \"Someone didn't know that. Then I tried to explain what Orry is. And, he told me. I forgot the line. It was something like 'Loved, but misunderstood'. I think he's going by that now.\" KJo, who looked dissatisfied, added, \"No, but that's what you call a phenomenon, not a person. But that's another profession. What do you do? I am misunderstood and loved by misunderstood. But there is also a job people have.

        "text": "Shivankit Singh Parihar is currently receiving praise for his performance in Varun Dhawan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu\u2019s Citadel: Honey Bunny. Shivankit became popular on social media after one of his videos in which he mimicked Amitabh Bachchan went viral. However, this video worried Shivankit when he was making his debut in Dasvi with Abhishek Bachchan. He feared that Bachchan Junior might be offended if he saw the clip.\nIn a conversation with Digital Commentary, Shivankit Singh Parihar was asked if he worried about celebrities taking offence to his mimicry. \u201cI never used to think about it back then, but now, as I make inroads in Bollywood, I feel scared. In your 20s, you don\u2019t fear anyone; you think, \u2018I\u2019m doing mimicry, what\u2019s there to fear?\u2019 Now, though, I worry about someone watching those sketches, especially if Amit ji (Amitabh Bachchan) sees the video of me mimicking him\u2014particularly that Mowgli dubbing sketch. I wish that video would just disappear from the internet, but it\u2019s not happening.\u201d\nShivankit said, \u201cI reassured the director that Abhishek probably wouldn\u2019t recognize me since my appearance was quite different in the video. But I did ask, just in case Abhishek did recognize me, that they do not throw me out of the film since it was my first movie.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Shivankit plays Chako in Citadel: Honey Bunny. News18 Showsha\u2019s review of the film read, \u201cCitadel: Honey Bunny explores the main characters\u2019 backstories through frequent flashbacks, aiming to reveal the motivations and struggles that shaped them. While this adds some depth, the constant connection to the past feels a bit forced, slowing down the pace.\u201d\n\u201cThe twists, intended to deliver the show\u2019s climactic punches, often come across as forced and predictable. Many come abruptly in the final episodes, which are undeniably grittier but arrive too late to compensate for the show\u2019s lacklustre buildup. The finale attempts to tie too many loose ends, but it feels rushed. For a spy thriller, it lacks the gripping, edge-of-your-seat suspense that fans expect from the genre until the last few episodes,\u201d the review also mentioned.",

        "text": "There\u2019s one actor from the 1970s who began his acting career as a villain, rather than lead. He is very well-known among people. For a long time, this performer dominated the audience\u2019s hearts as a villain. Even though Dharmendra was in that one movie, but the known actor took centre stage in the 1971 release. Let\u2019s know more about the actor.The only actor in the business who has maintained his status as a superstar since the 1970s is Amitabh Bachchan. Not because there weren\u2019t any other stars. Several celebrities from that era like Shatrughan Sinha, Vinod Khanna, Sunil Dutt, Raj Babbar, Dharmendra, and Jeetendra, used to compete with Amitabh, but no one has been able to match him up to this point. Vinod Khanna was one of them, an actor, became another superstar by continuously competing with Amitabh Bachchan.\nVinod Khanna entered the realms of politics and film production in addition to appearing in films. He was the priciest performer in his era. He was also referred to as a fashion and style icon. He and Amitabh Bachchan dominated the big screen in the 1970s.\nVinod Khanna\u2019s career began with the Adurthi Subba Rao-directed movie Mann Ke Meet, which starred Sunil Dutt. He portrayed a villain in this movie as well. The filmmakers began contacting him for negative roles after this movie.\nVinod Khanna starred in the successful movie Mera Gaon Mera Desh with Dharmendra and Asha Parekh in 1971. At the time, this movie was a huge smash and this movie caused a commotion in the theatre. Vinod Khanna received a lot of praise for his portrayal of the antagonist in this movie. Even though legendary actor Dharmendra and Asha Parekh were in this blockbuster movie, Vinod Khanna took centre stage. The antagonistic part played by Vinod Khanna in the movie was favourably received. With his portrayal, Vinod Khanna gave Dharmendra a fierce fight.\nFollowing this, Vinod Khanna portrayed a villain in other films. He was a supporting character in a lot of films before becoming the main character. He quickly rose to the top of the makers\u2019 list. According to reports, Vinod Khanna\u2019s fame once reached a point where he charged Rs 35 lakh for a single day of filming or 20 days.\nFor the 1976 film Hera Pheri, Vinod Khanna charged more than Amitabh Bachchan. Amitabh received Rs 1.5 lakh for this film, while Vinod Khanna received Rs 2.5 lakh. Parvarish, a 1977 movie starring Shammi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan, gave his career a new direction. His career took off after this movie. He wasn\u2019t the first pick for the movie\u2019s part, though. Rajesh Khanna was previously promised this position while Vinod Khanna received it later.\nHera Pheri tells the story of Vijay and Ajay, two individuals who earn a living by defrauding others. When Vijay eventually learns who killed his father, their collaboration comes to an end. The connection and bond between the two performers on screen was adored by viewers, and the movie became a big success.\nSuperstars of their day, Vinod Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan worked together on six successful box office pictures. For Hera Pheri, Vinod Khanna was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at Filmfare. Asrani, Goga Kapoor, and Kimi Katkar were among the other actors who starred in the film. At the box office, Hera Pheri brought about Rs 1.6 crore.\nVinod Khanna was becoming extremely famous, but eventually, he quit films. At the height of his fame, Vinod Khanna quit the movie business and turned into a saint. Vinod Khanna eventually made a comeback to the movie industry, but he was unable to reclaim that name.",

        "text": "Sanjay Kapoor is the youngest brother of Boney Kapoor and Anil Kapoor. While the Kapoor family has made a name for itself in Bollywood and stands among the most well-to-do households in Mumbai, they had humble beginnings. Sanjay Kapoor recently recalled living with his family in a 2BHK in Chembur where he did not have a room for himself.\nOn the YouTube channel Timeout With Ankit, Sanjay said, \u201cWe lived in a two-bedroom-hall apartment in Chembur. After my grandmother passed away, my grandfather came to stay with us, taking over the room I shared with Reena (sister). We were already close-knit, but his arrival brought us even closer. We\u2019d sleep on mattresses in the living room. We only had one AC in the house, which was in my mom and dad\u2019s room, so I\u2019d sometimes sleep on the sofa in their room at night.\u201d\nHe opened up about his parents\u2019 sacrifices and said, \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t go abroad until they had sent the whole family overseas first. They gave us the best schooling. We were having the best food. All my friends would wait for the food made at our house.\u201d\nIn an earlier interview with Galatta Plus, Boney Kapoor recalled his family\u2019s struggle and said, \u201cMy father was brought to Bombay by Prithviraj Kapoor. My grandfather handed over my father to Prithviraj ji because my father left about 10-12 jobs. Left, in the sense, he was thrown out because he was siding with and supporting the workers, fought for their causes.\u201d\nWhile Boney Kapoor became a prolific film producer in the Hindi cinema industry, Anil Kapoor grew up to become one of Bollywood\u2019s top actors. However, Sanjay Kapoor\u2019s Bollywood career didn\u2019t prove to be as successful. While he had a good start, his career slowed down in the 2000s.\nMeanwhile, Sanjay\u2019s wife, Maheep Kapoor has had newfound stardom after the release of Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives. Three seasons into the show, Maheep has become a sensation on social media. Their daughter, Shanaya Kapoor, is also gearing up for her debut in Bollywood with Vikrant Massey for a love story.",

        "text": "New Delhi: India wicketkeeper batter KL Rahul has opened up on the animated chat between Lucknow Super Giants\u2019 owner Sanjiv Goenka during the 2024 IPL when LSG were hammered by Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).\n\nLSG were in a need of big win over SRH to qualfiy for the playoffs, but the team suffered a humiliating 10-wicket loss. Afterwards, LSG owner appeared visibly displeased after the match\u2019s outcome and was seen engaged in an intense discussion with skipper Rahul along the boundary line at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.\n\n\u201cAs a team, we were all in shock because we were at the stage in that tournament where every game was very important. We had to win, I think, three out of five games or two out of the last four games. When this happened, it was just a big shock for all of us,\u201d said Rahul on Star Sports.\n\n\u201cWhatever happened on the field after the game wasn\u2019t the nicest thing to be part of or something that anyone wants to see on the cricket field. I think it did affect the entire group. We still had a chance to make it into the playoffs. We had a chat as a team and tried to regroup, put everything aside, and try to put our best foot forward. We tried our best, but unfortunately, our best wasn\u2019t good enough always. It was a bummer that we couldn\u2019t really make the playoffs or win the season as we had hoped,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough the content of their conversation was inaudible, the animated exchange between the owner and captain captured by the broadcaster, gained traction on social media. Experts and fans had suggested that discussions about the loss should take place in private rather than in front of spectators.\n\nAfter LSG won the toss and opted to bat first, they posted a below-par total of 165, with skipper Rahul playing a sluggish knock of 29 off 33. Ayush Badoni\u2019s 55 and Nicholas Pooran\u2019s 48, in 99-run partnership gave the LSG a respectable finish. In reply, Openers Travis Head (89 off 30) and Abhishek (75 off 28) wreaked havoc on the LSG bowlers as SRH chased down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs without any loss.\n\nSpeaking about the particular match, Rahul said, \u201cI don\u2019t really know how much was made outside, but I just remember it was probably one of the worst games I\u2019ve been part of as a player. But also, just from behind the stumps, I was amazed at how Sunrisers battered us. We watched on TV how dominating or how dangerous Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma were.\n\n\u201cBut to see it from up close, anything that we did that day seemed to find the boundary. Any ball our bowlers bowled seemed to hit the middle of the bat and fly into the crowd. To get 160, 170 runs in nine odd overs was ridiculous. And almost like, we had to pinch ourselves to know what really happened.\u201d\n\nNotably, in the IPL 2025 retentions day, LSG let go of their captain Rahul, thus ending their three-year association with the right-handed batter. Instead of him, Pooran is their biggest retention at Rs 21 crore, followed by Ravi Bishnoi and Mayank Yadav at Rs 11 crore each, before Badoni and Mohsin Khan were retained at Rs 4 crore, respectively.",

        "text": "A historical sword associated with the 18th-century ruler Tipu Sultan was recently auctioned for approximately Rs 3.4 crore (around $430,000) in the United Kingdom. Known as the \"Sword of Tipu Sultan,\" this valuable artifact is highly regarded for its historical and cultural significance, as Tipu Sultan was a prominent figure in the resistance against British expansion in India during the late 1700s.The sword, beautifully crafted with intricate inscriptions and symbols, represents both Tipu Sultan's legacy and the craftsmanship of the period. It was part of a larger collection from Tipu's armory, seized after the British defeated him at the Siege of Seringapatam in 1799. These artifacts have since become rare collector\u2019s items, with strong appeal among historians and collectors alike.The successful bid underscores the continuing global interest in Indian historical artifacts and the enduring legacy of Tipu Sultan's resistance against colonial forces.",

        "text": "Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby announced his resignation following a damning report that criticized his delayed response in handling a severe abuse case involving John Smyth, a former church camp leader and serial abuser.\n\nWho Is Justin Welby?\n\nWelby, who officiated the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and presided over Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral and King Charles III\u2019s coronation, stated his decision to step down was due to his responsibility for not taking quicker action against Smyth\u2019s crimes.\n\nThe report found that Welby did not promptly report Smyth\u2019s abusive actions, which impacted many victims over decades.\n\nOn November 12, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the leading figure of the Church of England and the Anglican Communion, resigned amid a significant sexual abuse scandal. Welby, who had previously worked in the oil industry before entering ministry in 1989, served as the 105th Archbishop since taking the position in 2013.\n\nWhat Is The Controversy Around Justin Welby?\n\nThe controversy surrounding Welby\u2019s resignation stems from an independent report revealing that he did not report incidents of abuse linked to John Smyth, a volunteer at Christian summer camps, to the authorities when he first learned about them in 2013. Smyth reportedly abused over 100 boys and young men across multiple countries over several decades.\n\nThe investigation\u2019s 251-page report concluded that had Welby acted sooner, Smyth\u2019s actions could have been curtailed, sparing victims further trauma.\n\nIn his resignation statement, Welby acknowledged responsibility, both personally and institutionally, for the delays in addressing the abuse cases. Despite the scandal, his supporters noted that he made significant contributions to strengthening church safeguarding practices and improving its internal culture during his tenure.\n\nThe process to appoint his successor will be overseen by the Crown Nominations Commission, which will propose two candidates to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will in turn recommend a selection to King Charles III. This commission includes representatives from various sectors of the Anglican Communion and is chaired by a prime ministerial appointee.",

        "text": "Bollywood superstar Hrithik Roshan recently shared a heartfelt and nostalgic memory from the making of the iconic 1995 film \u2018Karan Arjun\u2019, as the action-drama gets ready for its much-anticipated re-release in theatres on November 22.The re-release of \u2018Karan Arjun\u2019 marks a significant moment for fans of the film, and Hrithik, who played an assistant director during its production, took to social media to reflect on the film\u2019s legacy and its impact on his own career.The Instagram post in Hrithik\u2019s voice-over shared a behind-the-scenes story from the film\u2019s brainstorming sessions.The actor recalled a moment in 1992 when he, along with his father, director Rakesh Roshan, and the film\u2019s writers, were working on the screenplay at his father\u2019s home.After a long period of contemplation, Rakesh suddenly broke the silence with a burst of inspiration that would go on to become one of the most memorable dialogues in Indian cinema.As Hrithik explained, his father envisioned the climactic fight sequence in the film and dramatically shouted, \u201cBhaag Arjun Bhaag\u201d\u2013a dialogue that would become a symbol of the film\u2019s epic storytelling.\u201cMy hair stood on end, the room was applauding like in a movie theatre! And I was addicted from that day onwards,\u201d Hrithik recalled, reminiscing about the electrifying moment that captured the spirit of the film.At just 17 years old, Hrithik was present at that defining moment in Indian cinematic history, and it left an indelible mark on him.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\u2018Karan Arjun\u2019, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, is an action-packed drama that blends themes of reincarnation, family loyalty, and revenge.The film follows the story of two brothers who are reborn to avenge their deaths in a previous life, and it features one of the most iconic on-screen pairings in Bollywood history.Hrithik\u2019s involvement in the film, though not in front of the camera, played an important role as he assisted his father as an assistant director.Reflecting on the film\u2019s significance, Hrithik said, \u201cEven after 30 years, I\u2019m eagerly awaiting its return to the big screen. *Karan Arjun* is where it all began for me.\u201dThe film, which became a massive hit upon its release, also marked the beginning of a cinematic legacy for the Roshan family, with Hrithik later making his acting debut in his father\u2019s directorial, \u2018Kaho Naa\u2026 Pyaar Hai\u2019, in 2000.The upcoming re-release of \u2018Karan Arjun\u2019 is sure to rekindle fond memories for fans who experienced its original theatrical run.Known for its high-energy performances, dramatic twists, and unforgettable dialogues, the film has remained a beloved classic in Bollywood\u2019s action-drama genre.Meanwhile, on the work front, Hrithik Roshan is currently busy filming for \u2018War 2\u2019, the much-anticipated sequel to the 2019 hit \u2018War\u2019.",

        "text": "Trigger Warning: This article contains references to substance abuse and an individual's death.\n\nThe highly anticipated return of HBO\u2019s Euphoria has been in the works for a while. Since the second season aired in January 2022, fans have eagerly awaited the next chapter of the hit show.\n\nNow, more than two years later, production for season three is finally set to begin in January 2025. However, a lot has changed since the last season aired, both on and off-screen.\n\nDespite the show\u2019s early success and the stardom of its lead cast, Euphoria has faced many controversies that have affected its momentum. The delays in production have stemmed from multiple issues, including the challenges of COVID-19 and the changing roles of main cast members.\n\nFan support for the series, while strong initially, has started to wane in recent months, with criticisms arising from how certain characters were handled in season two.\nOne of the first signs of trouble came during season two, when fans began questioning the treatment of some characters. A major point of concern was the portrayal of Cassie (Sydney Sweeney), who many viewers felt was reduced to a one-dimensional villain.\n\nIn addition, Barbie Ferreira's character Kat, a fan favorite in season one, had a limited presence in the second season. Ferreira's absence became more pronounced when she announced in August 2022 that she would not be returning for season three.\n\nThe announcement sparked rumors of creative differences between Ferreira and Euphoria creator Sam Levinson. Although neither Ferreira nor Levinson directly confirmed the reasons for her exit, many fans speculated that tensions on set led to her departure. The casting shake-up signaled the beginning of a series of controversies surrounding the show's production and creative direction.\nLevinson, who has been the mastermind behind Euphoria, faced even more scrutiny with the release of his controversial series The Idol in 2023.\n\nCreated in collaboration with musician The Weeknd (Abel Tesfaye), The Idol garnered attention for its highly sexualized content and divisive narrative. Despite receiving a standing ovation at Cannes, the show was met with harsh criticism from both critics and viewers.\n\nWhile the stars of The Idol defended the project, the backlash raised questions about Levinson\u2019s approach to storytelling, particularly in Euphoria. The controversy surrounding The Idol added to an ongoing debate about whether Levinson's character-driven narratives were groundbreaking or problematic.\n\nIn 2023, Euphoria faced another devastating blow with the sudden death of actor Angus Cloud, who played the beloved character Fezco. Cloud passed away at the age of 25 due to an accidental drug overdose. His death left a profound impact on both the cast and fans of the show, who mourned the loss of the actor as well as his character.\n\nFezco\u2019s storyline in season two ended on a major cliffhanger, and Cloud\u2019s passing has left many wondering how the show will handle his absence.\n\nThe loss of such a key cast member raises questions about how Levinson and the team will navigate the storylines of the remaining characters in season three. It remains to be seen how Cloud\u2019s character will be written out, but it is clear that his death will cast a somber shadow over the upcoming season.\n\nALSO READ: 'First Trump Now This': Netizens React As John Krasinski Is Named People's Sexiest Man Alive 2024",

        "title": "UK Priest Who Married Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Resigns Over Handling of Sex Abuse Scandal",
        "text": "Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.\nPressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when the archbishop\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for his failure to report the abuse in England and in Africa in 2013 kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church. By Tuesday afternoon, Welby acknowledged that mistake.\n\u201cIt is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,\u201d Welby said in the statement announcing his resignation. \u201cI believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve.\u201d\nWelby, who married Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and led King Charles III\u2019s coronation, submission of resignation will send ripples around the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries, including the Episcopal Church in the United States. While each national church has its own leaders, the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals.\nWelby, a former oil executive who left the industry in 1989 to study for the priesthood, was a controversial figure even before the scandal. A skilled mediator who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, he struggled to unite the Anglican Communion, which has been riven by sharply divergent views on issues such as gay rights and the place of women in the church.\nThe Church of England on Thursday released the results of an independent investigation into the late John Smyth, a prominent attorney who the report said sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa from the 1970s until his death in 2018.\nThe 251-page report of the Makin Review concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many victims could have been spared the abuse, the inquiry found.\nWelby said he didn\u2019t inform law enforcement agencies about the abuse because he was wrongly told that police were already investigating. Even so, he took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as \u201cenergetically\u201d as they should have been.\nAs late as Monday, Welby\u2019s office said he had decided not to resign, even as he expressed his \u201chorror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\u201d\nHelen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Welby\u2019s position had become \u201cuntenable\u201d after some members of the General Synod, the Church of England\u2019s national assembly, started a petition calling on him to step down because he had \u201clost the confidence of his clergy.\u201d\nBut the strongest outcry came from Smyth\u2019s victims. Andrew Morse, who was repeatedly beaten by Smyth over five years, said resigning was a chance for Welby to start repairing the damage caused by the church\u2019s broader handling of historical abuse cases.\n\u201cI believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign,\u2019\u2019 Morse told the BBC before Welby stepped down.\nWelby\u2019s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England. A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England \u201ca place where abusers could hide.\u201d\nWelby\u2019s supporters had argued that he should remain on the job because of his role in changing the culture of the church.\nChurch officials were first made aware of Smyth\u2019s abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into complaints about his behavior at Christian summer camps in England. The recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.\nSmyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later relocated to South Africa. He abused boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018, the investigation found.\nSmyth\u2019s actions weren\u2019t made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television station, which led police in Hampshire to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him.\nStephen Cherry, dean of the chapel at King\u2019s College Cambridge, said Welby could no longer represent the people.\n\u201cThere are circumstances in which something happens whereby a person in a position of prominent leadership essentially loses the trust and the confidence and the capacity to do that really wonderful thing that someone like an archbishop does, which is represent everyone at a certain moment publicly,\u2019\u2019 Cherry told the BBC before Welby resigned.\n\u201cAnd the pain in the victim community and the history of not listening to people and not responding to people who are profoundly hurt by those in positions of power means that this is no longer a person who can carry the representative role of that office.\u201d",

Ambika used to work in a tea estate in the landslide-hit region. She came to Chooralmala for the first time since the landslides on July 30. Another voter, Ramnat, who moved to Meppadi after the landslides, said: \u201cI am seeing friends after such a long time. I used to live in Attamala. I have come here only once in between. I came here just to vote.\u201dMost of these voters came in from other safer locations in the district to exercise their franchise. Some of them were visiting for the first time since moving away from the landslide-hit area.Some of the voters described how the people of Chooralmala and Mundakkai villages, which were completely destroyed in the landslides, used to celebrate festivals together and were asking each other where they were, instead of how they were.The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation plied special buses for people wanting to vote in this bypoll. Special free vehicle services were provided for landslide survivors to reach the polling stations from the various places they were temporarily residing at.Many of the residents of the area were relocated or rehabilitated to different parts of the district in the aftermath of the landslides.More than 200 people were killed in the July 30 landslides that destroyed three villages in Wayanad.with inputs from PTIPublished By: Preeja Published On: Nov 13, 2024",

        "text": "The last chapter of Chainsaw Man primarily centered on Denji having rather brief flashbacks involving Aki, Power, Reze, and Nayuta, all people who he thought of as family that have now left him. As he thought about these memories, Denji underwent a significant personal understanding on his desire to live.\n\nWith the boy having also figured out a plan to escape the Aging Devil\u2019s realm, fans can look forward to Chainsaw Man Chapter 184 seeing more of this changed Denji.

Given his discovery of still being linked to Pochita\u2019s powers, Denji may experiment with throwing up other Devils to find one potent enough to break their entrapment in Chainsaw Man Chapter 184.\nChainsaw Man Chapter 183 recap\n\nChainsaw Man Chapter 183 is titled \u2018Barf, Head, Perv.\u2019 The chapter begins as Denji is overwhelmed by memories of his trip to Hokkaido with Aki and Power, which leads him to vomit out the Bitterness Devil.

His mind drifts further into a vision of Nayuta, Meowy, and their dogs, reminding him of the connections he still cherishes.\n\nAmidst these thoughts, Pochita appears, and Denji realizes that Pochita consumed and puked up the Devils not to erase his traumas, but to help him remember why he continues living. Asa then pulls him out of the lake in Chainsaw Man Chapter 183, scolding him for his reckless behavior.\nhttps://twitter.com/tanijrou/status/1856352009475031263Denji acknowledges both Asa\u2019s and Pochita\u2019s encouragement, realizing that despite his despair over losing Nayuta, he still has things to live for, like food and girls. When Asa presses him about their surroundings, Denji notices the enormous head of the Bitterness Devil he had just thrown up.\n\nConcluding that his physical body must still be linked to Pochita\u2019s powers in the real world, he seems to have devised a plan to use this connection. Chainsaw Man Chapter 183 ends as Denji tells Asa that he will find a way to escape the Aging Devil\u2019s realm.\n\nStay up-to-date with news from the Chainsaw Man manga here, on Pinkvilla.\n\n*The release dates and times provided are accurate at the time of writing and are subject to change at the discretion of the creators.",

The 10-day festival, which begins on 1 December, is India\u2019s largest celebration of tribal heritage, drawing visitors globally for its diverse display of local traditions, music, and folklore.\n\nThis year, Wales has been chosen as a special partner for the Hornbill Festival, marking the conclusion of the Year of Wales in India 2024, a year-long initiative to foster cultural connections. The partnership, facilitated by the British Council, the British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, the Welsh Government, and Wales Arts International, was announced following a recent visit to Wales by Nagaland\u2019s chief minister.\n\nMari Mathias, known for performing in the Welsh language, will present her contemporary folk melodies in two solo sets and a collaboration with Indian musician Seyievinuo Chuzho, where she will add a Welsh verse to Chuzho\u2019s song. Gareth Bonello, who performs as The Gentle Good, is known for his intricate acoustic guitar work and will return to Hornbill after his debut there in 2013. Bonello expressed his excitement, saying, \u201cI hope our performances will encourage more people from around the world to engage with the creativity of Indigenous cultures.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the festival, the Year of Wales in India has enabled five cultural projects aiming to strengthen artistic ties between Wales and India, particularly in Northeast India. Bonello will also reunite with the Khasi-Cymru Collective in Meghalaya to record new music blending Khasi and Welsh languages.\n\nOther projects supported include a collaboration between theatre makers Sarah Argent and Kevin Lewis with Kolkata-based ThinkArts, focusing on creating multilingual stories for children. Welsh-Indian fusion band Khamira will undertake a tour across India, and the Page of Two Lands project will bring together female writers from Wales and Northeast India to create folk-inspired contemporary narratives.\n\nFurther, Canolfan Gerdd William Mathias will send Welsh music tutors to Shillong\u2019s Martin Luther Christian University, exploring Welsh and Khasi musical traditions. Textile artist Cefyn Burgess will participate in cultural projects between Meghalaya and Wales, delving into the region\u2019s Indigenous heritage.",

Vikrant\u2019s family stands as a testament to religious harmony\u2014his father is a devout Christian, his mother a Sikh, his wife, actor Sheetal Thakur, is Hindu, and his brother Moeen converted to Islam at 17. Together, they celebrate all faiths with equal respect, Vikrant shared.\nRecently, however, Vikrant faced trolling after a picture of him touching Sheetal\u2019s feet during Karwa Chauth went viral. While many applauded the gesture, some netizens took issue with it, criticising Vikrant for participating in a Hindu ritual. Responding to this backlash in an interview with Shubhankar Mishra, Vikrant explained that his family has always embraced interfaith practices. \u201cMy mother, born a Sikh, wore a bindi and stood beside us during Karwa Chauth. Since childhood, we\u2019ve gone to temples, and Mata Rani pandals were a regular part of Navratri,\u201d he shared, explaining that for his family, respecting all religions is normal.\nHe continued by mentioning his father\u2019s routine of visiting the Vaishno Devi temple in Katra six times while remaining a committed Christian who still attends church twice a week. \u201cThis is what India is about,\u201d he said, explaining that many Indian families have blended religious traditions. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our Hindustan, and yet people find it surprising.

        "text": "The last episode of Dandadan gave fans a deeper look into Aira Shiratori\u2019s life after she picked up Okarun\u2019s \u201ckintama.\u201d As she attempted to take down Momo, fans saw the girls and Okarun come face-to-face with a rather dangerous Yokai named Silky, who claimed to be Aira\u2019s mother.\n\nWith Okarun and Momo having dealt some damage to the Yokai, fans cannot wait to see how the confrontation comes to an end in Dandadan Episode 7. Don\u2019t miss it when it drops, and keep reading to discover the release date, where to watch it, and more. \nDandadan Episode 7: Release date and where to stream\n\nDandadan Episode 7 is scheduled to air on Japanese television networks at 12:26 am JST on Friday, November 15, 2024. International viewers can expect to watch the episode a day earlier, on Thursday, November 14, though release times may vary by region and time zone.\n\nFor global audiences, Dandadan Episode 7 will be available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Netflix with English subtitles during the Fall 2024 anime season. An English dub of the series is currently being made, though dubs in other languages have not been confirmed at this time. \nExpected plot in Dandadan Episode 7\n\nAccording to the title preview, Dandadan Episode 7 will be titled \u2018To A Kinder World.\u2019 The episode is expected to continue battling Silky, the red-dressed Yokai. Momo and Okarun will likely push their limits to separate Silky from Aira, which the Yokai has consumed.\n\nThis battle may further explore Silky\u2019s claim of being Aira\u2019s mother, potentially revealing previously unknown aspects of Aira\u2019s past. With Aira unconscious and Momo and Okarun fighting alone, this episode is a key opportunity for Okarun to demonstrate complete control over Turbo Granny\u2019s powers. \n\nDandadan Episode 7 could involve emotional and physical challenges for the two, especially if Aira\u2019s survival is uncertain. However, Momo and Okarun\u2019s combined efforts should eventually allow them to triumph over Silky, concluding this arc.\nDandadan Episode 6 recap\n\nDandadan Episode 6, titled \u2018A Dangerous Woman Arrives,\u2019 begins as Turbo Granny informs Momo and Okarun that spirits may have stolen his missing \u201ckintama\u201d due to their high spiritual energy. Frustrated, the trio returns to Momo\u2019s house, where Seiko warns Okarun about his newly gained powers. \n\nAt school, Okarun becomes agitated after overhearing classmates spreading false rumors about Momo, nearly transforming into Turbo Granny. Meanwhile, Aira Shiratori is revealed as the source of these rumors, using her newfound ability to see spirits, which is granted by holding one of Okarun\u2019s kintama.\n\nBelieving she\u2019s destined to defeat Momo, Aira challenges her by using exorcism tools supported by her friends. As Momo struggles to escape in Dandadan Episode 6, a mysterious red-dressed Yokai named Silky, who claims to be Aira\u2019s mother, abducts her.\nhttps://twitter.com/YS_ALN/status/1856650758063902970Despite Okarun\u2019s attempts to save Aira, Silky overpowers him and devours both girls.

        "text": "Dev Patel has had an extraordinary year, with the release of his directorial debut Monkey Man and a prominent feature in Vanity Fair\u2019s annual Hollywood Issue. The actor, who has earned recognition for his diverse roles, now shares the cover with Hollywood icons Nicole Kidman, Zendaya, Zoe Saldana, Glen Powell, Sydney Sweeney, and K-pop star Lisa from BLACKPINK.\nIn the stunning cover shot, Dev exudes elegance in a brown suit, his gaze direct and confident as he stands beside Nicole Kidman, his co-star from the critically acclaimed film Lion. In Lion, Nicole portrayed Dev\u2019s adoptive mother, and their moving performances earned Dev his first Academy Award nomination and a BAFTA win for Best Supporting Actor.\nDuring his interview with Vanity Fair, Dev opened up about the challenges he faced while working on Monkey Man, including the physical injuries he sustained during filming. He revealed that his hand was broken on the first or second day of the shoot. Despite the injury, he continued working with determination. \u201cI found a doctor online that was putting screws into bones in Jakarta. We managed to get a [medical] jet so that the insurance company wouldn\u2019t red flag it as breaking our [COVID] bubble. I came back to work the next day and we carried on,\u201d he explained. This resilience became part of his experience on set, where he avoided wearing a cast to prevent any complications in post-production. \u201cA baptism by fire,\u201d he called it.\nIn Monkey Man, Dev plays an underdog street fighter who rises from the depths of despair to become a vigilante superhero. His character seeks justice by fighting against the wealthy elite who not only oppress the less fortunate but are also responsible for the death of his mother. The film also features performances by Sharlto Copley, Pitobash, Vipin Sharma, Sikandar Kher, Sobhita Dhulipala, Ashwini Kalsekar, Aditi Kalkunthe, and Makarand Deshpande in key roles.\nWith Monkey Man and his feature in Vanity Fair, Dev Patel continues to make waves in Hollywood and beyond, solidifying his place among the industry\u2019s brightest stars.",

Hanumantha Rao, there was no tangible response from the authorities in the last 10 years.As per records, the total extent of the lake was 14.06 acre in 1962-63, which, along with the buffer zone, stood at 16.13 acres. Due to utter neglect, it has shrunk over a period of years.As part of the lake rejuvenation works that commenced on Wednesday, four heavy vehicles have been pressed into service for removal of bushes and to level the soil.\u201cFour JCBs have been deployed. We will clean the site and start excavation from Thursday,\u201d said an official from Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA).Its commissioner A.V. Ranganth visited the weaker sections colony located near the lake and comforted the residents that not even one house would be demolished during the exercise.He said that once the lake is rejuvenated their houses will no longer get inundated and with creation of lung space on the anvil, the health and living conditions of all locals will improve substantially. He sought their cooperation in the lake rejuvenation task.",

        "text": "BLACKPINK\u2019s Lisa is stepping into the world of acting with a highly anticipated role in the third season of HBO\u2019s The White Lotus. For her first acting gig, Lisa will be credited as Lalisa Manobal, her full name, and will bring her own energy to a show that has captivated audiences with its sharp humour and stunning visuals.\nLisa, who had been a fan of the show\u2019s first two seasons, expressed excitement about joining the ensemble. However, she admitted to feeling some anxiety when she first received the call to audition. \u201cIt was my first time, so I didn\u2019t really know if I would be able to get the role,\u201d Lisa told Vanity Fair. The chance to work with The White Lotus creator Mike White, however, was a major draw. And the fact that the season would be set in her home country of Thailand made the opportunity even more meaningful. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for people to see how beautiful Thailand is,\u201d she added.\nTo prepare for the role, Lisa took acting lessons, but due to her busy schedule, she wasn\u2019t able to continue for long. Despite this, the on-set environment was supportive, with her castmates offering encouragement. \u201cThey understood that it was my first time acting, so they tried to help me and give me advice, like \u2018Oh, you shouldn\u2019t stress. You\u2019re going to be fine,'\u201d she recalled.\nWhen it came to introducing her co-stars to Thailand, Lisa found herself learning just as much from them. \u201cI didn\u2019t give them any advice, because they actually introduced me to some places!\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt was kind of odd, but it was funny.\u201d She was glad to see her fellow cast and crew enjoy Thailand\u2019s food, culture, and hot weather, with some even picking up a few Thai phrases along the way.\nLisa\u2019s mother also joined her during the shoot. \u201cIt was so nice, and I have never spent that much time in Thailand after I left. I felt like I was home, and I got a lot of energy from that trip as well,\u201d she shared.",

The boy, whose father was a colonel in the Army, carried on the lucrative family business of running an educational institution at Indore. Both gave different accounts of how the \u2018rista\u2019 got finalised and the engagement took place in Gwalior in March 2018 and the marriage in Rishikesh a month later. But one fact was common. The bride was never taken to her matrimonial home amid disputes.The man filed a complaint against the girl and her parents for cheating his family of a large sum of money during the wedding.The woman retaliated with a dowry harassment FIR against the boy man and his family. But this FIR was quashed by MP HC. She moved SC challenging it. She said the man was so enamoured by the Rolls-Royce car that he and his parents demanded that as part of dowry along with a flat in Mumbai.Senior advocate Vibha Datta Makhija Wednesday told the SC bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan the woman is in a piquant position as \u201cin her old-fashioned royal community, there is no tradition of re-marriage.\u201d The bench appointed former HC judge R Basant as the mediator for conducting conciliation proceedings between the warring parties.",

        "text": "Channing Tatum had some fun playing with his fans' weak hearts on Wednesday, November 13, when he blessed their social media feeds with a shirtless selfie, featuring an edgy goatee he said he was sporting for an upcoming film.\n\nThe newly single actor wore a red beanie while showcasing the growing facial hair, neatly shaped over his upper lip, chin, and chiseled jaw. \u201cThe only fun thing about 7 am training sessions is when they are done, bro,\u201d Tatum wrote. \u201cAlso, I sort of can\u2019t stand this dirt goatee I have for this character, lol, but it\u2019s a vibe for the movie.\u201d\nTatum\u2019s post comes weeks after his split from Zo\u00eb Kravitz, his girlfriend of three years, to whom he also got engaged last year. Two weeks after their seemingly late October breakup, a source close to the ex-couple told People that the Magic Mike star has been doing well. \u201cHe\u2019s focused on a new movie project in [North Carolina], and he\u2019s spending time with his daughter when he\u2019s off.\u201d\n\nTatum, for those unaware, shares daughter Everly, 11, with ex-wife Jenna Dewan.\n\nAccording to WCNC Charlotte, Tatum is filming Roofman, a project based on a real-life rooftop robbery case, in NC until December.\n\nHe is also set to star in Alpha Gang alongside Kravitz. The former couple\u2019s involvement in the project was announced just hours after People confirmed on October 29 that they had parted ways. Production insiders told the publication at the time that Tatum and Kravitz would continue working together. The film, which also stars Cate Blanchett, Dave Bautista, Steven Yeun, and Riley Keough, is a project they\u2019re both excited about.\n\n\u201cThey will continue to work together and are excited about a new project. They both love filming and creating,\u201d a source said. \u201cChanning has a lot of respect for Zo\u00eb \u2019s focus and passion.\u201d\nTatum and Kravitz met in 2021 when he starred in her directorial debut flick, Step Up.

He added that he never planned to become an actor, but the universe seemed to have a different plan for him.\n\nWhen asked about how he landed the role in Kal Ho Naa Ho, Shivohaam explained that at the time, he was studying at Jai Hind College in Bombay and modeling.\n\nHe revealed that Puneet Malhotra, the casting director for the film and a school friend, invited him to audition because his look was a perfect fit for the character. Shivohaam went through three rounds of auditions, after which Malhotra told him that acting was not his strongest suit. \nALSO READ: Vicky Kaushal stayed on Chhaava set for 3 hours after his shot for THIS reason recalls co-star and Bigg Boss narrator Vijay Vikram Singh: \u2018He could have rested but\u2026\u2019",

        "text": "Shalini Passi has become a household name since the release of Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives, Netflix\u2019s reality show featuring her and fellow Delhi socialites Riddhima Kapoor Sahni and Kalyani Saha Chawla alongside Bollywood wives Neelam Kothari, Seema Sajdeh, Bhavana Pandey and Maheep Kapoor. While the trio brought a vibrant energy to the show, the Bollywood wives were often seen discussing how the Delhi group was not as close-knit as they were.\nIn response to the Bollywood wives\u2019 comments, Shalini exclusively told CNN-News18, \u201cHum hain hi aise\u2026 jahan hum jaate hain humaari baatein karte hain log. We\u2019re used to it. Kalyani, Riddhima and I are used to it.\u201d Riddhima and Kalyani, who also joined her in the interview, wholeheartedly agreed.\nRiddhima recalled an early scene where Bhavana questioned their closeness, saying, \u201c\u2018But you guys are not close?\u2019 And I replied, \u2018But we are friends!\u2019 We may not be the best of friends, but we are friends. We know each other, we\u2019ve hung out. Delhi has a small social circle.\u201d\nShalini also addressed her bond with her fellow Delhi socialites, adding, \u201cWe have love for each other. Kalyani is like family to me. Riddhima is like my little sister.\u201d\nShalini went on to talk about how she handles criticism and the calm approach she\u2019s learned over the years. She admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s about control. I know that if I lash out, it can really hurt someone deeply, and that\u2019s not something I want. I told Riddhima you can\u2019t use the \u2018brahmastra\u2019\u2014the ultimate weapon\u2014over small things. I may say things unintentionally, but when I say something with intention, it takes me months to get over it.\u201d\nShe elaborated further, saying, \u201cIf I do hurt someone, it stays with me. Even if I\u2019m angry at first, I find myself feeling guilty for months. It\u2019s like a pin inside me, constantly poking. I end up overcompensating, and I just can\u2019t sleep. I don\u2019t want that guilt because I want to focus my energy on other things. I\u2019ve come to see that maybe when someone says something hurtful, they\u2019re going through something too. I value friendships deeply, and I\u2019d rather find peace than hold onto negativity.\u201d",

        "text": "Lindsie Chrisley, star of Chrisley Knows Best, is getting used to living alone after moving into a new home. She recently closed on her previous house, marking a significant milestone in her journey.\n\nOn an episode of The Southern Tea podcast, which she cohosts with Karley Lane, Lindsie opened up about her transition and the challenges of adjusting to her new environment.\n\n\u201cIt kinda feels nice,\u201d Lindsie shared about her move, \u201cbut it kinda feels lonely.\u201d While the change brings excitement, it also comes with moments of unease.\n\nSpeaking candidly, she described her experience living solo and an anxiety attack she had recently. \u201cI would like to tell you about my panic attack that I had this morning and why my skin was crawling,\u201d she said.\n\n During the episode, Lindsie detailed how she felt physically uneasy one morning after trying to go back to sleep. She stated that she felt like she was itching everywhere and she immediately felt like she was going to throw up.\n\nInstead of letting the experience overwhelm her, Lindsie decided to analyze the situation and find ways to process her emotions. \u201cI was like, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m just gonna dissect some of this stuff on The Southern Tea,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe people will relate to it... there are these learning curves that make everybody uncomfortable for a period of time.\u201d\n\nHer cohost agreed, acknowledging how fast the move had happened. Lindsie reflected on her recent lifestyle, which had been filled with constant travel and little downtime.\n\nShe said that it\u2019s been a lot of hopping on planes, unpacking a bag, and repacking to go somewhere else, admitting that the fast pace likely contributed to her anxiety.\n\n In a November 7 episode of her other podcast, Coffee Convos, which she cohosts with Kailyn Lowry, Lindsie shared the emotional journey of selling her previous home. The house held significant memories from her life, including moments tied to her divorce from ex-husband Will Campbell in 2021.\n\nLindsie said that she went to her closing for her house, and a song that she listened to heavily through her divorce, Let That Pony Run, came on.

        "text": "Anupamaa actress Rupali Ganguly recently issued a defamation notice to her stepdaughter Esha Verma, demanding a compensation of Rs 50 crore for allegedly maligning her character.

You are incredible!\u201d\nIn another Instagram story, she said that if her followers want to chat with her or talk about something, she will be available. \u201cI might be a little bit limited with my responses because I am going to be a little bit offline for something.

        "title": "Financial Crisis To Comeback: Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s Journey With ABCL",
        "text": "India has a deep-rooted love for cinema and the classic Bollywood masala film can bring joy even to the most serious of viewers. Among the legends of Indian cinema, one name stands above the rest \u2013 Amitabh Bachchan. At 82, Amitabh Bachchan continues to be a part of consecutive hit films, winning the admiration of fans with each role. His journey to stardom wasn\u2019t easy. He faced numerous challenges at the beginning of his career and even after he became a household name, he encountered significant setbacks.\nAmitabh Bachchan began his acting journey in 1969 with the film Saat Hindustani but he struggled for years to establish himself in the industry. It wasn\u2019t until the success of Zanjeer that filmmakers took notice of his talent, leading to his rise in Bollywood. One misstep threatened to undo his hard-earned fame.\nThroughout his career, Amitabh experienced many highs and lows. After establishing himself as an action hero with films like Mard, Amar Akbar Anthony and Sholay, he was regarded as the second superstar of Indian cinema after Rajesh Khanna. Despite his tremendous success, not all of his films performed well at the box office and a major turning point came when he decided to venture into film production.\nSeeing his popularity soar, Amitabh attempted to expand his career by entering the world of film production. He launched his own company, Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Limited (ABCL), investing around Rs 60 crores in the venture. Although he initially earned a profit of Rs 15 crores, the company soon faced major financial troubles. Films produced under ABCL, such as Mrityudaata, Family, Saat Rang Ke Sapne, Aks and Major Saab, failed to attract audiences and were box-office flops. This period of financial strain left Amitabh nearly bankrupt, as his company accumulated massive losses.\nWhile his acting career was full of blockbuster hits and established him as Bollywood\u2019s Shahenshah, his foray into film production with ABCL proved to be one of the most challenging chapters of his life.\nIn 2000, Amitabh Bachchan made a remarkable comeback with Mohabbatein, portraying the stern yet emotionally complex Narayan Shankar. This marked the beginning of a new era in his career, where he embraced roles that suited his age but retained his signature depth and intensity. Movies like Baghban (2003) and Paa (2009) showcased a seasoned Bachchan, while Piku (2015) and Pink (2016) highlighted his ability to charm audiences with performances that questioned societal expectations and norms.\nA pivotal moment in Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s career reinvention was his television debut with Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) in 2000. More than just a game show, KBC became a nationwide phenomenon, bringing Bachchan into millions of homes. His warmth and empathy on screen made him not just a host but a mentor, offering encouragement and advice to contestants. KBC solidified his connection with a new generation, drawn to his wisdom and humility and established him as a beloved figure across India.",

        "text": "Red Hook, a neighbourhood in southwestern Brooklyn famous for its diverse community and unique geography today, was once among the most stigmatised places for its crime and extreme violence, according to a new book. The hardscrabble dock area played a pivotal part in Brooklyn's history, emerging as a place from where goods and contraband entered the city, the New York Post reported.\u201cWhen I was a kid, I not only dreamed of growing up to be a gangster; it was the only ambition I had, the only life path I could envision,\u201d Frank Dimatteo, who grew up as a youngster in the region, wrote in \u2018Red Hook \u2013 Brooklyn Mafia, Ground Zero' (Citadel), which he has co-authored with Michael Benson.Shockingly, Dimatteo mentioned that he witnessed his first mob murder when he was just five and was quick enough to learn in life that killing people \u201cis just business\u201d. During the early 20th century, the docks in Red Hook were under the control of an Irish gang -- the White Hand. \u201cAt first they robbed everyone blind, but there was little violence,\u201d Dimatteo wrote in the book. But \"things got rough\" with time. \"Young, savage White Hand goons, chips on their shoulders, fists clenched and ready to bust,\" they wrote.Later, the Irish gang was outnumbered by the Italians, while greater violence was witnessed in the region due to intense competition, especially at the time of 'Prohibition' when both groups worked their way to move illicit liquor. \u201cIn later years, there was cooperation between Italian and Irish mobs, but at the turn of the twentieth century, they couldn't be in the same room,\u201d read the book.A problem for the Irish was that they couldn't match their rivals. The writers said the Italian takeover of the piers was \"inevitable\u201d.The number rulers in Red Hook came to be known as 'la Mano Nera' \u2013 or the Black Hands.Soon, local youngsters got involved in the underworld. A major reason behind this was that any alternative jobs, like labouring, meant working for long hours for little compensation. \u201cBetter to rob cargo trucks...It was more lucrative and a hell of a lot easier on the back,\" Dimatteo stated.Among the five boroughs of New York City, Red Hook had the worst percentage of juvenile delinquency.Today, Red Hook is left with abandoned warehouses as well as underdeveloped tracts of land. While 'gentrification' is believed to have taken hold of the region, its process has been slow, the authors said.",

        "text": "BLACKPINK member Lisa made headlines back in September when she performed at the MTV VMAs 2024. At the time, she performed her solo songs. While fans celebrated her milestone, many social media users believed that she was lip-syncing. In a new interview, Lisa revisited the performance and shed light on it. While she did not address the criticism, she confessed she was nervous before performing on the international stage. \nSpeaking with Vanity Fair, she admitted she was shaking before she went on stage. \u201cLast time I went with my girls for Blackpink, but this time it was me alone. It was a big thing for me. I was shaking before I went onstage. I don\u2019t know if it was because the backstage was cold, or if I was nervous\u2026. But I think I was nervous!\u201d she said. \n\u201cWhen I\u2019m taking a risk, I always just believe in my gut! Like if my heart, my body, and my mind all tell me that I have to do this. I\u2019ll just go for it. I\u2019m also lucky that my family, my close friend, and the people that I work with are so supportive. They\u2019ve always supported my decisions. Even when they don\u2019t really agree and they\u2019re super worried, they still support me and take the risk with me, so I never feel like I\u2019m taking it alone,\u201d Lisa revealed. \nWhile Lisa has had a memorable year on the music front, she is all set to make her international acting debut. She will be seen in The White Lotus season 3. The new season is based in Thailand and Lisa will be seen playing a local in the series. She was seen in the trailer released recently. Lisa, who is also originally from Thailand, said that the show allowed her to spend time at home and with her mother.",

        "text": "The latest episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati 16 saw a delightful moment as host Amitabh Bachchan shared a funny anecdote from his childhood. The episode began with Hetvi Vasudev Patel successfully taking home Rs 12,50,000. His exit is followed by Ashi Singh taking the hot seat, ready to kick off the question-answer session with Bachchan and indulge in a candid conversation with the Bollywood veteran. As the duo involved in a light-hearted banter, the superstar also shared some precious moments from his mischievous childhood.\nThe fun-filled interaction began with Ashi Singh sharing that she enjoys chatting and gossiping. She also claimed to have inherited the quality from her mother. Her candid revelation prompted a reaction from Big B who started pulling her leg saying, \u201cAb aapke sare friends ko pata chal jayega ki aapko gossip karna bahut pasand hai (Now all your friends will know you love to gossip).\u201d The contestant then went on to share that her father loves dancing to the superstar\u2019s songs. Later, Ashi\u2019s father who joined her to encourage her during the game, requested the actor to recite his iconic dialogue, \u201cDon ko pakadna mushkil he nahi namumkin hai\u2026\u201d The actor happily obliged his request.\nAs the intriguing banter continued, Ashi also highlighted her achievements during her school days, revealing that she secured many medals and Awards in the International School General Knowledge Olympiads. Big B then asked the contestant which bench she used to sit on, in her school days. In response, she claimed to be a first bencher.\nThen came the most interesting revelation by Amitabh Bachchan. The actor admitted to being a backbencher who would not do his homework and spent most of the time chatting and gossiping. The actor continued to share that he would eat biscuits between the classes instead of waiting for recess. Big B said, \u201cHumare liye mind and body control karna zaruri nahi tha hum wahi se kuch sandwich yaa biscuit nikal ke khaa lete the chup chaap..Kitaab ko muh ke saamne rakhte the aisa lagta tha padh rahe hain par hum khaate the (We didn\u2019t control our mind and body and used to eat sandwiches or biscuits silently. We would keep the book in front of our mouth, it seemed as if we were reading but we were eating).\u201d\nAt the end of the game, Ashi took home Rs 25,00,000 and Big B continued with another Fastest Finger First round. Parth Upadhyay, winning the round, made it to the hot seat.",

        "text": "Any interview with Karthi and Suriya wouldn\u2019t be without the question about their possible collaboration. Earlier, in an interview, Karthi revealed that the two would team up for something substantial and they haven\u2019t found such a script yet. Though the brothers are part of Lokesh Cinematic Universe, which comprises both Kamal Haasan\u2019s Vikram and Karthi\u2019s Kaithi, the actors haven\u2019t shared screen space in a film to date. Even in Virkam, which had Suriya as Rolex, we only get to hear Karthi\u2019s voice and hints about his presence in the universe. With Kanguva, Karthi and Suriya have finally joined hands for the first time as the former has played an important cameo which could possibly make a huge difference in the possible sequel. \nSpoilers ahead\nKanguva, set in 1070 is about two warring tribes in an archipelago of five islands near the Indian sub-continent. Suriya\u2019s titular character heads the tribe of one island Perumaachi, while Bobby Deol\u2019s Udhiran heads one in Arathi. The feud between the two tribes has a long history, and in the film, it reaches its pinnacle when Udhiran tries to conquer Perumaachi along with Romanian imperialists. The film ends with Kanguva winning the war by slaughtering Udhiran after a brutal battle in the sea. As Udhiran\u2019s body is laid for cremation, it is discussed who will lit the pyre as all of his sons are also killed. When a relative steps in to do the deed, a sword flies in chopping his hands, and enters Karthi as a barbaric warrior, named Rathangusan. \nWe are told Rathangusan is an illegitimate child of Udhiran who gets shunned away by the king. With the dead king and deceased heirs, Rathangusan, dreaded by the whole tribe, returns in all his glory to do the ritual, having a last laugh over the body of his father. Immediately after setting the pyre on fire, he sets his eyes on the throne. Instead of taking the seat, he swears to kill Kanguva to make his claim to the throne a righteous one. The end hints at an epic clash between Suriya\u2019s Kanguva and Karthi\u2019s Rathangusan in the possible sequel to Kanguva.\nThis has opened the possiblities of the brothers not only crossing paths on screen but also having possible face-offs in the sequel. At the recent Mumbai press conference, while answering a question by News18 Showsha, Suriya had hinted at an epic end to the film and teased the sequel as well. \n\u201cWe also have Kanguva 2 in line. We leave you with a lot of questions in the climax of Kanguva 1. It will have a lot of questions and a lot of surprises. So Kanguva 2 is what I am looking forward to,\u201d he told us. \nMeanwhile, the two can also have a face-off in Lokesh Kanagaraj\u2019s Kaithi 2, which has all the potential to have Suriya\u2019s Rolex in an important role. It has to be seen whether it will be Kanguva 2 or Kaithi 2 that will become the first film of Suriya and Karthi sharing screen space.",

        "text": "Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Monday dismissed the claim of growing support for the Shiv Sena (UBT), claiming that the Muslim vote \"swelling\" in their favour would soon dissipate.Shinde, addressing a rally in Vaijapur for the party candidate Ramesh Bornare, emphasised that Shiv Sena's focus on community service, rather than caste-based politics, was the reason for the party's victory in the Aurangabad Lok Sabha constituency.The chief minister alleged the 'flaming torch' poll symbol of the Uddhav Thackeray faction was a medium to set houses on fire and create a rift among communities.\"They (Shiv Sena-UBT) call 'mashal (flaming torch) a symbol of revolution. But their torch sets homes ablaze and creates a rift among communities. This swelling of Muslim votes will go away,\" Shinde added.He claimed MLAs in the Marathwada region didn't receive a single rupee for the development of their constituencies in the 2.5 years after 2019 (when the MVA government was in power).\"Vaijapur MLA Ramesh Bornare received a huge fund for his constituency. I believe in giving and not taking back,\" Shinde added.Targeting the Shiv Sena (UBT), the CM said the morale of Shiv Sainiks was badly hit and they were left demoralised because Bal Thackeray's ideology was abandoned, a reference to Uddhav Thackeray joining hands with Congress and NCP (undivided) to form a government after the 2019 assembly elections.\"Had I not acted, the Congress would have sold the Shiv Sena and its bow and arrow (election symbol),\" Shinde said in an obvious reference to his revolt against Thackeray in June 2022 that led to the collapse of the MVA government.He attributed Shiv Sena candidate Sandipan Bhumre's victory in Lok Sabha polls from the Aurangabad seat to his work for various communities without caste discrimination.Bhumre had defeated Shiv Sena (UBT) and AIMIM candidates to score a victory.Voting for 288 seats in Maharashtra will be held on November 20 and results will be out on November 23.",

He identified a connection between the traits of geniuses and talented learners and between self-type and world-type egos. Immediately following this realization, fans saw Isagi confront Rin with his newly evolved mindset. \n\nDon\u2019t miss Blue Lock Chapter 283 to find out what happens next in the match between Paris X Gen and Bastard Munchen, and keep reading to discover the release date, where to read it, the expected plot, and more details.\nBlue Lock Chapter 283: Release date and where to read \n\nAccording to K Manga's official Twitter/X, Blue Lock Chapter 283 will premiere on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at 12:00 am JST. International readers may find it available as early as Tuesday, November 12, depending on their time zone differences.

Shortly after, he grasped the parallels between geniuses and talented learners, as well as the distinction between self-type and world-type egos.\n\nNow, as Isagi, fully awakened, goes up against Rin, fans look to the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers to get a sneak peak into the upcoming chapter\u2019s events.

The chapter begins with Rin Itoshi in possession, skillfully dribbling past Birkenstock and Mensah.\n\nRaichi Jingo and Hiori Yo, watching helplessly, urge Yoichi Isagi to stop Rin\u2019s relentless advance. At this point, Rin\u2019s sole focus is to break through Isagi, and their one-on-one showdown becomes inevitable.\n\nAs Rin speeds past the two defenders, he faces Isagi head-on. Isagi, fully aware of Rin\u2019s intentions, tries to poke the ball away but fails as Rin smoothly switches the ball to his other foot. Without hesitation, Rin attempts a powerful shot at the goal.\nHowever, Isagi had anticipated this move, positioning himself strategically to limit Rin\u2019s shooting angle. By doing so, Isagi sacrifices his position in the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers, becoming a decoy to force Rin into a narrower shot.\n\nThis strategy leads to a surprising turn of events when Michael Kaiser steps in, blocking Rin\u2019s shot. This unexpected collaboration between Isagi and Kaiser forms a \u201cchemical reaction\u201d between two skilled learners, a testament to their adaptability on the field.\n\nThe duo, often seen as rivals, combine their efforts for the first time to disrupt Rin\u2019s play in the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers. This maneuver catches Rin off guard, as he never imagined his opponents would unite to counter his attack.\nThe combined efforts of Isagi and Kaiser exemplify how talented learners can surpass geniuses through collaboration and strategic play. Despite their efforts, Kaiser\u2019s block is not perfect. The ball deflects off his attempt, heading dangerously toward Bastard Munchen\u2019s net.\n\nThe sudden redirection of the ball creates a tense moment as it seems destined to result in a goal for Paris X Gen. At this critical juncture, the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers shift to Gagamaru Gin, Bastard Munchen\u2019s goalkeeper.\n\nRealizing the impending danger, Gagamaru prays that the ball doesn\u2019t find its way into the net. As luck would have it, the ball strikes the goalpost and bounces off, narrowly missing a game-changing score. But the danger isn\u2019t over yet, as the deflected ball is still in play, hovering close to the goal line.\nGagamaru, using his remarkable reflexes, dives just in time to save the ball with his signature \u201cBear Claw Defense.\u201d His last-second intervention stops the ball from crossing the line, denying Paris X Gen a vital goal in the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers.\n\nThe crowd, along with the match commentators, erupts in astonishment at Gagamaru\u2019s heroic save. With Gagamaru\u2019s exceptional goalkeeping, Bastard Munchen manages to fend off a near-certain goal, giving the team a renewed fighting spirit as the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers end.\n\nFor more spoilers like this and updates from the Blue Lock manga, keep up with Pinkvilla.\n\n*The spoilers provided here are not official and should be taken with caution.

        "text": "Channapatna, Nov 11 (IANS) Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Monday that the Karnataka Congress government won\u2019t last beyond the coming month of January.\n\nSpeaking at a massive campaign rally for NDA alliance candidate Nikhil Kumaraswamy in Channapatna, Gowda appealed: \u201cI urge to people of Channapatna assembly constituency to ensure the victory of NDA candidate Nikhil Kumaraswamy (his grandson) to break the arrogance of Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar.\u201d\n\nHe added that Union Minister of State V. Somanna has said that the state government will collapse in January 2025. \u201cThis is not a prediction; it\u2019s the truth,\u201d maintained JD (S) National President Deve Gowda.\n\nDeve Gowda stated that there had been a conspiracy to target his entire family, using the Hassan case (sex video scandal involving his grandson Prajwal Revanna) as a pretext.\n\nReiterating Union Minister of State V. Somanna\u2019s statement about the government\u2019s collapse by January, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that, like me, Somanna also has a habit of consulting astrologers, but he has spoken the truth. This government will not last long.\u201d\n\n\u201cI once clashed with former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, but we are united now to uproot this corrupt Congress government,\u201d he declared, holding Yediyurappa\u2019s hand in solidarity.\n\nExpressing anger over Deputy Chief Minister Shivakumar\u2019s statement about arresting PM Narendra Modi and Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowda warned that D.K. Shivakumar\u2019s own words would backfire on him.\n\nReferring to an accusation that Kumaraswamy threatened a prominent figure for Rs 50 crore to support his son\u2019s candidacy, Deve Gowda argued, \u201cFor someone like Kumaraswamy, who once served as Chief Minister with the blessings of the people of Channapatna, such desperation is uncalled for.\n\n\u201cCongress has never been trustworthy, and I warned Kumaraswamy against forming an alliance with them. But under pressure, he joined them to form a government. Just eleven days ago, no one spoke of Nikhil Kumaraswamy as our candidate. Yet for six months, D.K. Shivakumar was openly claiming the seat for himself. Now, another has taken his place in the race,\u201d Deve Gowda said.\n\n\u201cI made Siddaramaiah the finance minister. I have nothing more to say about him. I don\u2019t need to emphasise that Nikhil is my grandson. I didn\u2019t even mention his name until he filed his nomination. Breaking the arrogance of Shivakumar is essential through Nikhil\u2019s victory,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe decision of the virtuous voters will answer everything, he asserted.\n\n\u201cI will return to the constituency on November 24. Ensure you cast your vote for number 1 on the ballot. On the morning of Nov 24, Yediyurappa and I will come together to thank the voters,\u201d announced Deve Gowda.\n\nSpeaking at the NDA mega gathering, candidate Nikhil stated, \u201cThis election is the litmus test in my life. People ask what role I will play. To me, caste is not important; the only thing I believe in is humanity. I appeal to you all\u2014this is not just about a regional party; it\u2019s about the honour of the NDA family. Once we are born, earning trust and gratitude is all that matters. Please give me one chance to serve you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch has changed since the seat fell vacant after Kumaranna\u2019s (his father, Union Minister Kumaraswamy) resignation. This election is decisive for me. I did not lose heart after two defeats, as I had the support of the people. I may have lost because of Congress\u2019s tactics, but the result was not my fault,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am contesting in Channapatna because of the wishes of the workers. The people here do not give in to coupons or fall for any temptations. When I filed my nomination and started campaigning, I spoke emotionally. I am a person of emotions. In the past 16 days, I have received immense blessings. Please bless me and give me a chance,\u201d he appealed.",

        "text": "Actor Vikrant Massey, fresh off the success of 12th Fail, is now taking on a new challenge with The Sabarmati Report, where he plays a journalist determined to uncover the truth behind the 2002 Godhra incident. Directed by Ranjan Chandel, the film also stars Raashi Khanna and Ridhi Dogra, and is backed by Shobha Kapoor, Amul V Mohan, Ektaa R Kapoor and Anshul Mohan. While anticipation builds for its November 15 release, the movie has stirred up polarising reactions, with Vikrant himself facing criticism over his perceived secularism due to his association with the project.\nIn a candid interview with Shubhankar Mishra on Unplugged, Vikrant addressed these criticisms head-on, questioning why people doubt his secular stance. \u201cA truly secular person stands by others regardless of religion, caste, or background,\u201d he shared. Reflecting on the polarised nature of social media, Vikrant explained that his values haven\u2019t changed. He considers himself a liberal, embracing diversity rather than extremes.\nWhen asked about his view of secularism, Vikrant described it as \u201cliving together and respecting each other\u2019s culture while taking pride in your own.\u201d He believes in understanding and not labelling everything in binaries. His approach to secularism, he said, involves accepting others without putting them down or elevating oneself to mock another.\nVikrant also shed light on his personal experiences, drawing parallels between his values and his family\u2019s diversity. \u201cMy parents had an inter-caste marriage, so did I. My brother even converted to another religion. What could be more secular than that?\u201d he remarked.\nIn the same conversation, he said, \u201cPehle mujhe lagta tha Hindu khtre mei hain, ab mujhe nahi lagta Hindu khatrein mein hai; pehle mujhe lagta tha Muslim khatre mei hai, ab mujhe nahi lagta Muslim khatrei mei hai.\u201d",

        "text": "Tom Cruise ought to be among the world's billionaires, along with Rihanna, Taylor Swift, and Kylie Jenner, but according to reports, Scientology is the reason the Mission Impossible star pretty much lives out of a suitcase as he moves from project to project in an attempt to recover his donations to the contentious organization, as quoted in a report by SheKnows.The economics of Tom's film career are still completely upside down because of his devotion to Scientology and his willingness to back that up with money right out of his pocket, despite all the hits and starring roles. Both War of the Worlds and Mission: Impossible 2 brought him $100 million. These are only two of his movies; he has appeared in 44. He also earned an estimated $745 million between 1983 and 2019 from his work as a producer. Also Read : Invincible Season 3: Here\u2019s release date, cast, episode count and plotThose who possess such wealth invest and compound their wealth rather than simply leaving it in the bank. According to math, Cruise ought to be a member of the billionaire club.His estimated 2024 net worth is $600 million, according to reports. Despite this enormous sum, Cruise's way of life appears to be more akin to that of a touring band than an established Hollywood star. Tom should have hundreds of millions of dollars from his decades of success, but that is not how he lives at all. In recent years, he has reduced his property holdings and essentially lives out of a suitcase while juggling several movie projects with little to no time off.The controversies surrounding Scientology help clarify this financial juggling act. Numerous former members of Scientology have criticized the organization for its alleged financial exploitation and secrecy.Since the mid-1990s, Tom has been earning over $20 million per film. You can't help but wonder where all the money he's making is going, even though he claims to be all about the work. By now, he ought to be a billionaire, but shockingly, he is not, as quoted in a report by SheKnows.Even though Tom isn't personally benefiting from his extremely high status, science is.Also Read : Monster Hunter Wilds: All we know about release date, platforms, gameplay and open beta testLeah Remini stated that she spent approximately $5 million on Scientology, including about $2 million on materials and classes, although Cruise's donations are still unknown. It's reasonable to assume that Cruise has spent more than that during his 38 years with Scientology, considering his wealth. FAQsWhy is Tom Cruise not a billionaire despite his successful career?Tom Cruise's devotion to Scientology is thought to have an impact on his finances. Insiders believe that his significant donations and continued investment in the organization have limited his wealth accumulation in comparison to other high-income celebrities.How does Tom Cruise's lifestyle relate to his financial situation?Despite his $600 million fortune, Cruise reportedly lives a nomadic lifestyle, moving between film projects without a permanent home base. His commitment to Scientology, as well as his substantial financial contributions, may contribute to this work-focused lifestyle.",

        "text": "Arjun Kapoor has been making headlines ever since Singham Again hit theatres, with audiences and critics alike applauding his portrayal of the villain Danger Lanka, aka Zubair Hafeez. Kapoor, who is \u201cgrateful\u201d and \u201cready to accept the tag of a comeback or 2.0,\u201d shared his excitement over the support he\u2019s received from friends in the industry. Directed by Rohit Shetty, the film also stars Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Tiger Shroff.\nThough the list of well-wishers is long, Kapoor mentioned a few of those who reached out. \u201cTo get a message from Adi sir (Aditya Chopra) is always nice and that means a lot. He is very correct that way; if he likes something, he will always tell me. If he doesn\u2019t like something also, he will always tell me. To get a praise from him means a lot. [Besides] Ranbir and Alia, they are my contemporaries, and I respect both of them professionally for the work that they do. Whether it\u2019s Varun, Balki sir, a lot of people reached out. List bann jaati hai phir naamo ki. In general, it is nice to have felt an emotion. For instance, I went to watch Citadel for Varun\u2019s premiere. You feel an energy and an emotion. People who might have not seen are also happy for you. That also matters. Vicky [Kaushal], when we met at a Diwali party, he hugged me and I could feel that he is happy because he is somebody I have spoken about the film, etc. You feel good when your contemporaries are cheering for you,\u201d he shared in an exclusive interview with News18.\nKapoor went on to reflect on the experience, adding, \u201cGetting compliments is always good. Sometimes you get it through the box office business and sometimes you get a message or two. There\u2019s just an energy that people are happy for you and they like your work. That combination is there. [Sometimes] they like you, but they will be like \u2018iska kaam pata nahi abhi dekhte hai\u2019. Or they are happy for you, but the film doesn\u2019t pan out beyond a point. Here it seems like an amalgamation of all of it.\u201d\nGiven the star-studded ensemble, was Kapoor ever skeptical about taking on the role? Not at all, he says. \u201cI was happy. It is the kind of film that I would want to go to watch in a theatre. I have grown up watching ensembles. Loved watching these summer blockbusters. I have an affinity towards them, and the child inside me was very excited to go watch this film regardless of it was offered or not, mein dekhne wala tha. I am a fan of Singham, Simmba, and Sooryavanshi. It just felt like a perfect fit for me. Also, because I was at that point in my career where I needed to take a chance and not think so much. Impulsively, I was excited when Rohit sir called me.\u201d",

        "text": "Dwayne Johnson has responded to recent allegations surrounding his on-set behavior, addressing claims that his conduct led to delays and cost overruns on his upcoming film Red One. The iconic actor and former WWE star admits to certain quirks, such as occasionally being late and using unconventional methods to save time on set, but he remains adamant that the extent of the controversy is exaggerated.Late to Set but Hardly Unprofessional, Says JohnsonIn an interview with GQ, Johnson acknowledged that he sometimes arrives to set after the scheduled time but firmly denied the scale of the alleged delays. A previous report by The Wrap suggested that Johnson\u2019s tardiness drove up the film\u2019s production costs, with insiders claiming he could be as much as eight hours late on some days. Johnson dismissed these claims as overblown. \u201cYeah, that happens,\u201d Johnson admitted, but clarified, \u201cNot that amount, by the way. That was a bananas amount. That\u2019s crazy. Ridiculous.\u201dAlso Read : Is Selena Gomez planning a secret wedding with Benny Blanco? Here\u2019s what we knowThe actor\u2019s director for Red One, Jake Kasdan, backed Johnson up, emphasizing the actor\u2019s reliability and dedication. \u201cHe never missed a day of work ever,\u201d Kasdan told GQ. \u201cHe has a lot going on. He can be late sometimes, but such is Hollywood \u2014 that\u2019s the case with everybody.\u201d Kasdan noted that he has worked on multiple projects with Johnson, never seeing him exhibit anything but respect and commitment to the entire crew.An Unconventional Habit: Peeing in Bottles to Save TimeAlongside his occasional tardiness, Johnson also addressed an unusual claim: that he sometimes uses water bottles instead of restrooms while on set to avoid losing time. He confirmed this quirk, explaining it as a practical choice given the fast-paced environment. \u201cYeah. That happens\u2026 I\u2019ve said a thousand times: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here. Come and ask me. And I\u2019ll tell you the truth,\u2019\u201d Johnson told GQ with a grin.While the practice might seem unusual, it reflects Johnson\u2019s dedication to efficiency and his desire to keep filming momentum. Johnson, whose disciplined lifestyle is well-known, often begins his days with rigorous workouts, which may lead to him arriving later than scheduled on certain mornings. However, his co-star Chris Evans downplayed any disruption this might cause, stating that Johnson\u2019s timing is generally coordinated with the production team. \u201cHe shows up when he\u2019s scheduled to show up,\u201d Evans explained.Known for Generosity: Johnson\u2019s Kind Gestures on SetBeyond the controversy, both Kasdan and Evans highlighted Johnson\u2019s genuine care for the people he works with. Evans shared an incident on set where Johnson spontaneously gave away significant sums of money to various crew members as part of a weekly giveaway.Also Read :God of War TV Series: All you may want to knowOn one occasion, Johnson increased the winning pool from $4,000 to $50,000, distributing a total close to $100,000 in a single day.

        "title": "Opinion: Good and bad of institutions",
        "text": "By Sushanta Kumar Mahapatra , AV Vedpuriswar\r\n\r\nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2024, awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A Robinson, reflects that out of the Americans who have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics since 2000, around 28% are immigrants to the US. However, it is important to note that they have the same opinion about the role of institutions in a country pertaining to its economic development.\r\n\r\nThe laureates found that the persistent gap between the rich and poor countries is because of the institutions of the societies of those countries. While assessing the importance of institutions for the prosperity of a country, they revealed that weak laws and institutions of society hinder the growth of the country thereby limiting the chance of improving the living condition of the population.\r\n\r\nTwo Aspects\r\n\r\nThey broadly discussed two aspects of the institutions: first, they evaluated the importance of institutions for the progress of a society or country, and second, they discussed the reason behind the change in political institutions. As defined by them, economic institutions or inclusive institutions enforce property rights for a large group of the population, provide opportunities for investments and enable various sections of people to participate in economic activities. Good political institutions give more power to the people to participate in the role of governance and support the purpose of democracy. Also, good political institutions play a crucial role in shaping economic institutions.\r\nOn the other hand, bad or extractive institutions lack the essential rule of law for the population and don\u2019t have proper property rights. When political powers are controlled by narrowly defined elite groups, it results in the formation of extractive institutions.\r\n\r\nRules and Policies\r\n\r\nA comprehensive study of the era of colonisation can be considered as a natural experiment to find details of institutional rules and policy changes. When the Europeans started their colonies in various parts of the globe, either they changed the institutions of those societies or influenced those societies resulting in change in the institutions. However, the change varied along with the colonies and the original society existing in that place. The regions, where the colonisers formed inclusive political and economic institutions for their own long-term benefits, changed for the better.\r\n\r\nWhen political powers are controlled by narrowly defined elite groups, it results in the formation of extractive institutions\r\n\r\nContrary to that, in some countries, the colonisers only aimed at exploiting the natives and capturing the resources of these countries. They used an extractive economy to gain short-term benefits as they had control over the indigenous population. Although there was progress for some time in those regions, later the living standards of the people deteriorated remarkably. Hence, institutions play a decisive role in influencing many features of the country, like education, profession of people and the political system.\r\n\r\nInfluencing Factors\r\n\r\nThere are many influencing factors that decide the type of institutions that develop in any colony. Population density is one of the key aspects \u2014 the denser the population of a region, the stronger the resistance of the people against the formation of any kind of new institution. Hence, less number of European settlers moved to that place. While in the sparsely populated places, the Europeans were able to dominate the natives and their resistance.\r\n\r\nPlaces, where resources were plenty, the colonisers developed such institutions so that they could exploit the local people and extract resources. The main aim was to provide benefits to a few elites of the places to take advantage of the maximum number of people living there. As a result of control over democratic rights of election and political rights, these extractive economic institutions became the reasons for the declining social and economic standards of the people.\r\n\r\nThe places that used to be rich and prosperous before the phase of colonisation declined in various aspects and now are among the poorest countries in the world. Compared to that, the places that were less densely populated and poor at that time became the preferred choice for the colonisers to start inclusive economic institutions which they had planned for their long-term benefits and eventually resulted in the prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nExtractive Institutions\r\n\r\nContrary to the popular notion that the countries nearer to the equator are poorer because people are less productive in these areas than the people of the countries with temperate climates, the laureates have found that it is the societal institutions of these countries that are responsible for productivity. Also, the approach of colonising nations in the colonies became another factor deciding the kind of institutions developed in those places.\r\n\r\nExtractive institutions are beneficial only for a small elite group. However, the introduction of a maximum number of inclusive institutions and the rule of law is capable of creating long-term benefits for everyone in society. When political institutions prioritise the interests of only a select elite while neglecting the general public, they undermine their own credibility, resulting in erosion of public trust in economic reforms. Sometimes populations of non-democratic countries take revolutionary ways to transition to democracy. The ways can be violent or peaceful. However, peaceful protests involve the largest number of people.\r\n\r\nAs the model developed by the laureates explains, there are compelling reasons why some countries switch from democracy to non-democracy and vice-versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Sushanta Kumar Mahapatra teaches at the Department of Economics, ICFAI School of Social Sciences, ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education, Deemed University, Hyderabad.

        "title": "ON A SNAIL TRAIL",
        "text": "Snails may be the last thing that one would recollect if one said skincare. Well, think again because the same humble creatures that leave glistening trails in gardens are now offering a surprising beauty boost to skin routines.Skin LoveSo, what is in this \u2018slime\u2019 that\u2019s captured the attention of skincare enthusiasts? Snail mucin is a powerhouse of skin-loving compounds: Allantoin, Glycolic acid, proteins, peptides, and antioxidants. These are key elements in achieving a smooth, hydrated, and youthful complexion. \u201cSnail Mucin naturally promotes collagen and elastin production, helping skin stay firm and bouncy. Additionally, its high Glycolic acid content gently exfoliates, reducing dead skin cells and lightening hyperpigmentation for an even skin tone. And for those who struggle with dry skin or minor irritations, allantoin, a natural compound in snail mucin delivers deep hydration and supports skin healing. It may sound unconventional, but snail mucin has transformed into a skincare rage, proving that nature\u2019s remedies sometimes come from the most unexpected sources,\u201d says Shahnaz Husain, Beauty Icon and Founder, Chairperson and Managing Director, The Shahnaz Husain Group. Advantages GaloreStudies by dermatologists and a rising tide of skincare enthusiasts all point to the impressive benefits this ingredient has for the skin, especially in the areas of hydration, anti-aging, and healing. Dr. Deepak Jakhar, Consultant Dermatologist, Dermosphere Clinic and Author \u2013 Good Skin Bad Skin, avers, \u201cI see a growing demand for skincare solutions that are natural yet effective, and snail mucin fits perfectly into this niche. Derived from the secretion of snails, this ingredient contains a rich mix of beneficial compounds like glycolic acid, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin. These elements are key players in skin hydration, anti-aging, and repair \u2014traits that are essential for maintaining a healthy and radiant complexion. The best part? Snail mucin is gentle enough for most skin types, including sensitive skin, making it versatile and accessible.\u201d Snail mucin\u2019s glycoproteins and zinc promote skin regeneration and repair; they are especially helpful in minimising inflammation and mending acne scars.Dr. Nirupama Parwanda, MD Dermatologist, Founder, Zolie Skin Clinic New Delhi, adds, \u201csnail mucin is rich in hyaluronic acid, a powerful ingredient to preserve the skin\u2019s suppleness and holds moisture in the skin. Snail mucin provides deep hydration, the skin becomes smooth, supple, and noticeably plumper because of the deep hydration. Snail mucin contains glycolic acid, which gently exfoliates your skin to remove damaged cells and increase collagen production. Collagen is essential for minimizing wrinkles and increasing the firmness of the skin. Copper peptides can hasten tanning and, when combined with glycolic acid, gently exfoliate your skin, giving you a healthy, radiant complexion.\u201dTake CarePeople with extremely sensitive skin, especially those who react to natural or bioactive ingredients, may want to avoid snail mucin, or consult a dermatologist first to ensure compatibility. Radhika Ghai, Founder & CEO, kindlife, says, \u201cbefore incorporating snail mucin into your routine, apply a small amount on a less visible area of skin to check for any adverse reactions. Snail mucin pairs well with hydrating products and can be used before serums and moisturizers to lock in moisture. Since snail mucin already contains mild exfoliating acids, using it with high-strength AHAs or BHAs can lead to irritation. While it is gentle, excessive application can lead to over-exfoliation, especially if other exfoliating ingredients are also part of the routine.\u201d Check the concentration on the product label. Not all snail mucin products are created equal, and the concentration can make a big difference in results. \u201cLook for products with a high concentration of snail mucin\u2014ideally 70% or more. Many serums and creams list concentrations between 70% and 96%, and the higher the percentage, the more effective it\u2019s likely to be for skin hydration, texture, and elasticity. Lower-concentration products may still offer benefits, but the real glow-getters are those with that higher dose of snail secretion filtrate,\u201d says Hussain. Snail mucin\u2019s gentle yet effective formulation is a wonderful addition to many skincare routines, especially for those looking for enhanced hydration, anti-aging, and barrier support. With mindful use and proper layering, it can be a beneficial tool in achieving healthy, glowing skin.SKIN-CREDIBLE TIPS \u2022 Applying it first helps prep the skin, allowing subsequent products to penetrate more effectively.\u2022 Avoid using snail mucin on open wounds or active acne breakouts, it may worsen irritation.\u2022 Snail mucin works best on clean skin because it maximises absorption.\u2022 Using high-quality, reputable products will ensure you can enjoy the full benefit of snail mucin in a balanced skincare routine.\u2022 Snail mucin can make...",

        "text": "HARIDWAR: A row erupted in Haridwar after the district administration invited three Muslim MLAs from the region for an event at Har-ki-Pauri ghat to mark the state foundation day, a move allegedly opposed by Ganga Sabha, the body administering the ghat. It argued that the three legislators should not have been invited as \u201cnon-Hindus are not allowed entry at the ghat since long, and the British had also made it a rule under the Haridwar Municipal Act of 1935.\u201dThe event, held on Monday in the presence of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and a host of other BJP leaders, featured cultural performances and a light show. As part of protocol, Haridwar district administration had invited Congress MLA from Piran Kaliyar Furqan Ahmed, BSP MLA from Laksar Mohammad Shahzad, and Congress MLA from Manglaur Qazi Nizamuddin. However, none of the MLAs attended.A Ganga Sabha member told TOI, \u201cSome issues were raised but it was confirmed that none of the MLAs were coming.\u201d He refused to comment further saying, \u201cEverything went well.\u201dState coordinator of Bajrang Dal, Anuj Walia, said, \u201cWe strongly opposed inviting the MLAs... The administration accepted the mistake and told us that the MLAs will not come.\u201dMohammad Shahzad said, \u201cWe don\u2019t care about the resistance by right-wing outfits... We know the sanctity of Ganga and Har-ki-Pauri and we respect it. I do not go to govt events as BJP leaders hijack them and elected representatives are not entertained.\u201dQazi Nizamuddin said that he and Ahmed were not in the state when the event took place. \u201cI have been campaigning in Maharashtra for the past few weeks. Furqan Ahmed is also campaigning in Maharashtra.\u201d",

        "text": "Children's Day, also known as 'Bal Diwas', is celebrated annually on November 14 in India. The day is celebrated to appreciate and acknowledge children as they are the future of the county. This date also marks the birth anniversary of the first Prime Minister of the nation Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Known for his affection towards children, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru believed that children are the true wealth of the nation. He often referred to them as \"the most precious resource\" of the country. So, his birthday is celebrated as Children's Day to affirm the commitment of the nation towards the betterment of the lives of its young citizens.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, India. He was a great advocate for children's rights and for an all-inclusive education system where knowledge is accessible to all. He considered every child as the future of the country and appreciated them to the fullest. \"Children are like buds in a garden and should be carefully and lovingly nurtured, as they are the future of the nation and the citizens of tomorrow,\" Nehru said in one of his famous speeches. \n\nIt is because of his love for children that Jawaharlal Nehru is also commonly known as 'Chacha Nehru' among kids. He not only loved children but also believed in providing them with proper resources for their growth. He was concerned about the development of the educational system in the country. Therefore, he oversaw the establishment of some of the most eminent educational institutions in the country, including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs). \n\nWhy is Children's Day celebrated on Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday? \n\nPreviously, Children's Day was celebrated in India on November 20 - the day 'World Children's Day' is celebrated globally by the United Nations. However, after the death of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1964, the parliament issued a resolution to establish his birthday as the official Children's Day in the country. Since then, India celebrates Children's Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India. The day is also known as 'Bal Diwas' in the country.\n\nChildren's Day Celebrations\n\nTo commemorate this day, children are showered with a lot of love, gifts and pampering. Schools across the country organise special events and programs for the children who are also showered with gifts that consist of eatables, books and cards. They also conduct games, debates, seminars, dance, music, essay, speech and painting competitions.",

The film is expected to give the franchise a grand conclusion; its first part (titled Dead Reckoning) underperformed in theatres last year.The trailer generated a lot of buzz among social media users.\"New Mission Impossible trailer... we are so very, very back,\" commented one user. \"A cool thing about that new Mission Impossible trailer is there's no sound effects - it's just score and dialogue,\" said another user.The film was originally set for 2022, but was delayed multiple times by the pandemic and SAG-AFTRA actors strike. It's scheduled to be released on May 23, 2025.This release follows Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, which saw high-intensity scenes but did not perform as strongly as expected at the box office.

As soon as the pictures from the Kansas City game went viral alongside the singer\u2019s video message at the EMAs, fans took to social media platforms to joke about her excuse.\n\n?| Taylor Swift just arrived to Kansas City for the game!\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/l1egrwE39u\n\u2014 The Eras Tour (@TSTheErasTour) November 10, 2024\n\nTaylor at the Kansas City Chiefs game supporting Travis #TaylorSwift #traviskelce #kansascitychiefs #ChiefsKingdom pic.twitter.com/0KE7kK9SMJ\n\u2014 Taylor Swift Fan (@SwiftTaylo45074) November 10, 2024\n\nIn reaction to Swift\u2019s EMA acceptance speech, a fan wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t be here tonight because of tour while being on a football match is killing me.\u201d\n\n\"I cant be here tonight because of tour\" while being on a football match is killing me\n\nAnother added, \u201cDitching an award show to support her boyfriend is such a Taylor thing to do honestly.\u201d\n\nditching an award show to support her boyfriend is such a taylor thing to do honestly\n\n\u201cHELP!

        "title": "Bengali Actor And Theatre Icon Manoj Mitra Dies At 86 Due To Age-related Ailments",
        "text": "Kolkata, Nov 12 (PTI) Bengali theatre personality Manoj Mitra, who died on Tuesday at the age of 86 in Kolkata, was known mainly for writing and directing farces and fantasies to highlight social and political issues.His plays also underscored the struggle of the oppressed common man. A legendary actor, he immortalised the character of Banchharam in Tapan Sinha's 1980 film 'Banchharamer Bagan' (The Garden of Banchharam). This dark comedy on the oppression of the peasants by the zamindars was adapted from a play by Mitra.Mitra had around 100 one-act and full-length plays to his credit besides film scripts.His major full-length plays include 'Narak Guljar' (The Great Hell), 'Aswathama', 'Chakbhanga Madhu' (Honey from Broken Hive), 'Mesh O Rakhash' (The Lamb and the Monster), 'Galpo Hekim Saheb' (Tale of a Hekim), 'Rajdarshan' (Visiting the King), 'Alokanandar Putra Kanya' (Alokananda's Son and Daughter), 'Sajano Bagan' (Decorated Garden), 'Chhayar Prashad' (The Palace of Shadows) and 'Jene Shune Bish' (Poison, Knowingly).Partition of the country, Naxalite movement of Bengal, tyranny of the ruling class, religious fundamentalism and other major issues were highlighted in Mitra's plays.Among his key one-act plays are 'Mrityur Chokhe Jal' (Tears in the Eyes of Death), 'Chokhe Angul Dada' (The Fault Finder), 'Ami Madan Bolchhi' (Hello I am Madan), 'Takshak' and others.According to academician and translator Mousumi Roy Chowdhury, in Mitra\u2019s plays, conscience has a major role.\"Not strictly restricted to an instrumental moral sense, conscience here is used in the larger sense of consciousness that reaches beyond the closures and binaries of the regulating norms of the political theatre,\" Roy Chowdhury said in an anthology of plays translated by her.He also acted in more than 80 films including Satyajit Ray's classics 'Ghare Baire' (Home and the World, 1984) and 'Ganashatru' (An Enemy of the People, 1989). Mitra also worked on projects of Tapan Sinha - 'Adalat O Ekti Meye' (The Court and a Woman, 1982) and 'Wheel Chair' (1995).After the 1984 superhit potboiler 'Shatru' (Enemy) in which he essayed the role of a notorious leader, Mitra got a chance to act in Bollywood films. He, however, rejected that proposal apprehending that it would impact his involvement in theatre.Mitra was born December 22, 1938, in a village in Khulna district of undivided Bengal. His father was a government officer.Interestingly, though plays were enacted at his family home during the festive days of Durga puja, children were not allowed to watch them. Backdrops, props, costumes and other articles associated with the staging of plays stored at home kindled his passion for plays.Mitra permanently came to India from East Pakistan at the age of 12. He cleared his MA in Philosophy in 1960.During the college and university days, he wrote short stories and plays. However, after his play 'Mrityur Chokhe Jal' earned him first prize at a statewide competition, he focused only on this field. His acting prowess mesmerised veteran actors of that time as the 21-year-old youth effortlessly metamorphosed into an elderly man in 'Mrityur Chokhe Jal'.Also in the film 'Banchharamer Bagan', adapted from his play 'Sajano Bagan' (1977), he essayed the role of the 90-year-old protagonist when Mitra was in his 40s. He bagged the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the movie.The playwright was conferred with the Sangeet Natak Award (1985) and the Asiatic Society Award (2005) for his overall contribution to theatre, among numerous other awards.Mitra also headed the theatre group 'Sundaram' for many years. He was a professor of philosophy in a college in West Bengal. PTI NN RG",

        "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan\u2019s divorce rumors have been swirling around for quite some time now. Abhishek\u2019s Dasvi co-star Nimrat Kaur recently grabbed headlines when reports of their alleged affair surfaced on the internet. Amid all this, an old letter written by Amitabh Bachchan in which he praised Nimrat\u2019s performance in Dasvi has gone viral.\n\nThe letter written by Amitabh Bachchan to Nimrat Kaur in 2022 has resurfaced and spread across social media. The actress had shared his letter in an Instagram post back then. A bouquet of flowers also accompanied the heartfelt note.\n\nIn the note, Senior Bachchan wrote, \u201cWe have hardly had any interactions or meetings. The last was a compliment I gave at an event at YRF - for the Cadbury ad. But your work in \u2018Dasvi\u2019 is exceptional - nuances, gestures, - all! My deep admiration and congratulations. Love, Amitabh Bachchan.\u201d\n\nHave a look at the post!\n View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nimrat Kaur (@nimratofficial)\nIn her caption, Nimrat Kaur had expressed her happiness at receiving such appreciation from a legendary actor. She stated, \u201c18 years ago when I set foot in Mumbai city, to imagine that Mr. Amitabh Bachchan would know me by my name, recall us meeting and him appreciating me in a television commercial and years later send a note and flowers for something I attempted in a film - all would\u2019ve been but a distant dream, perhaps someone else\u2019s for me, not even my own.\n\nThen, Nimrat extended her love and immense gratitude to Amitabh Bachchan. She wrote in Hindi, \u201cAaj Alfaz aur bhavnaye, dono kam pad rahi hai. Aapka yeh snehpurvak patra ajiwan mujhe prerit karta rahega aur aapke is amulya guldasta rupi ashirwaad ki mehak meri zindagi ke har kadam par bani rahegi. Aapse mili is shabashi se ek chuppi mehsus ho rahi hai....jaise kisi vishal parvat ya praacheen mandir ke samne hoti hain. Aapki shraddhapurvak, sadev aabhari Nimrat.\u201d\n\nIt means, \u201cToday my words and emotions, both are falling short. Your lovely letter will keep inspiring me my entire life and the fragrance of your blessings in the form of this priceless bouquet will remain at every step of my life. I am feeling speechless after getting this compliment from you, just like one feels in front of a huge mountain or an ancient temple. Sincerely, forever grateful, Nimrat.\u201d\n\nDasvi is a social comedy drama starring Abhishek Bachchan, Nimrat Kaur, and Yami Gautam. It was released on OTT in 2022.\nALSO READ: Singham Again: Rohit Shetty reacts to Arjun Kapoor being trolled on social media; \u2018People are only talking about\u2026\u2019",

        "text": "A controversy erupted in Haridwar after the district administration invited three Muslim MLAs to an event at Har-ki-Pauri ghat for the state foundation day. The move was reportedly opposed by the Ganga Sabha, which manages the ghat, says a TOI report. It argued that the three legislators should not have been invited as non-Hindus are not allowed entry at the ghat since long, and the British had also made it a rule under the Haridwar Municipal Act of 1935. The event, held on Monday in the presence of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and a host of other BJP leaders, featured cultural performances and a light show, with over 3.5 lakh diyas lit across 52 ghats. As part of protocol, the Haridwar district administration had invited Congress MLA from Piran Kaliyar Furqan Ahmed, BSP MLA from Laksar Mohammad Shahzad, and Congress MLA from Manglaur Qazi Nizamuddin. However, none of the MLAs attended.A Ganga Sabha member told TOI, Some issues were raised but it was confirmed that none of the MLAs were coming. He denied commenting further on the matter saying, Everything went well. State coordinator of Bajrang Dal, Anuj Walia, meanwhile said, We strongly opposed inviting the MLAs for the light show at the ghat. Har-ki-Pauri is a holy place for Hindus, and entry of Muslims is not allowed there. The administration accepted the mistake and told us that the MLAs will not come. They also assured that this type of mistake will not happen again. This issue is unique, as the Deepotsav was held at the ghat for the first time. Moreover, according to protocol, MLAs from the Haridwar district are invited to major government events, regardless of their religious background.When queried, BSP MLA Mohammad Shahzad told TOI, We don't care about the resistance by right-wing outfits as they are working on a propaganda to polarise the society. We know the sanctity of Ganga and Har-ki-Pauri and as residents of Haridwar district, we respect it. I do not go to govt events as BJP leaders hijack them and elected representatives are not entertained. Also, the govt should focus on development work, this type of event is a waste of money. Congress MLA Qazi Nizamuddin said that he and Ahmed were not in the state when the event took place. He told TOI, My party has given me a key role for the Maharashtra assembly elections and I have been campaigning for the party for the past few weeks. Furqan Ahmed is also campaigning in Maharashtra. Commenting on the issue, he said, I got a call from the additional district magistrate of Haridwar and the joint magistrate of Roorkee and they had invited me for the event. However, as both Furqan and I are in Maharashtra, it was not possible for us to attend the Deepotsav. Haridwar district magistrate Karmendra Singh said, We followed protocol for the MLAs and respected the beliefs of the Ganga Sabha. (With TOI inputs)",

The high-profile Delhiite looked upset during the interview and walked out. She returned for the interview shortly while wiping what seemed to be her tears but she exited the room yet again. Although she did not delve into the reason behind her behaviour at the time, Shalini now revealed that it was not a publicity stunt but she indeed walked out. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to do PR stunts like that. I just wanted to leave so I left and I came back when I wanted to,\u201d she said, while speaking with The Chill Hour. When the host, Deepak Pareek, tried to prod her into giving the details, Shalini shut him down. \u201cAapke paas aur koi kaam nahi hai, baal ki kaal nikalne ke liye?\u201d she asked. \nFor the unversed, Shalini was seated for an interview with Galatta India with Bhavana Panday, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, Seema Kiran Sajdeh, Neelam Kothari Soni, Kalyani Saha Chawla and Maheep Kapoor. During the chat, Shalini was being asked about the show when she cut the interviewer mid way and said that she wants to take a break. When her co-stars asked her what happened, she did not give them an explanation. Instead, she asked them to continue without her. \u201cI need a break,\u201d she said, and walked away. \u201cYou guys can carry on,\u201d she added as she left the room. \nShe returned to the room briefly but then decided to leave yet again. Although the reason behind her exit was unclear, fans believe it was because of Kalyani Saha\u2019s comment.

        "text": "Actor and filmmaker Aamir Khan, a towering figure in Hindi cinema for over three decades, recently shared how he nearly left it all behind to focus on his family, feeling that his devotion to the industry had come at a personal cost. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter India, Aamir and his ex-wife, Kiran Rao, reflected on the pivotal moment when he told his family he planned to step away from films for good.\n\u201cI decided to quit before Laal Singh Chadha,\u201d Aamir revealed. \u201cI was going through a personal journey of my own. Towards the end of Covid, I suddenly realised that I have spent the bulk of my adult life, starting from the age of 18 right up to now, all of my bandwidth and focus has been on cinema and films.\u201d\nAamir admitted feeling guilty about not being fully present in his relationships, explaining, \u201cI haven\u2019t been there enough for my relationships \u2013 my kids, siblings, and family. Whether it was Kiran or Reena, when I was married to them. I felt that I wasn\u2019t there for these people enough.\u201d This revelation hit midway through Laal Singh Chadha, as filming resumed after Covid. \u201cIn the middle of Covid, I went through an emotional moment where I felt that I have given my whole life to cinema and I haven\u2019t been there for my family. I felt a lot of guilt,\u201d he said.\nAt one point, Aamir even sat down with his family to break the news. \u201cSo, I told them that I want to quit films and spend time with you all. That was my reaction; it wasn\u2019t out of any disappointment from cinema. Junaid and Ira convinced me not to quit. My family knew I had quit, but when the time came to tell my potential directors, my kids sat me down. Junaid said, \u2018Why do you have to go from one extreme to the other? There is a space somewhere in the middle where you can be in\u2019.\u201d With their guidance, Aamir reconsidered, describing the decision as a \u201cpersonal journey.\u201d\nKiran also shared her thoughts on Aamir\u2019s decision, recalling a private moment. \u201cShe asked me to come to the balcony to talk alone. She said, \u2018You are leaving us.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I am not leaving you, I am leaving films.\u2019 She said, \u2018You are a child of cinema, and if you are leaving films, you are leaving us.\u2019\u201d\nWith humor, Kiran added that they weren\u2019t eager for him to stay home all the time. \u201cCan you imagine him sitting at home and not doing any films? In fact, his daughter told him, \u2018Please papa, you can\u2019t spend all your time with us, we will go crazy.\u2019 After that, he went straight into six films. 0-6, there is no moderation and balance,\u201d she joked.\nAamir explained his renewed drive, clarifying that he took on six films because he \u201cwanted to make the last 10 years of my active life as an actor to be the most productive.\u201d He added, \u201cHopefully, if I am fine, these 10 years will be the last active 10 years for me in the industry, and I want to work with creative people, including musicians, writers, and directors, people who I feel are really good.\u201d",

While the Stree star looked stunning in a casual ensemble, it was her caption that caught our attention. \u201cBade maathe vale log bhagyashaali hote hai\u2026 or vinarm bhi. [People with big foreheads are lucky\u2026 and humble too],\u201d wrote Shraddha. Earlier, Shraddha Kapoor shared a hilarious Reels on her Instagram Stories in which a man claimed that Shraddha's hoardings on an Expressway pose a threat to youngsters. The video featured a man riding a two-wheeler on an expressway as he stopped by the side of the road to record a selfie video. He said, \"Agar Expressway par aise advertisement honge toh yaar yuva thode khatre me hai. Aise ads nahi hone chahiye. Dangerous hai thoda (If there are advertisements like these on the Expressway, then the youth is in danger. Ads like these shouldn't be there. It's a little dangerous).\"Then, the man flipped the camera towards the object of his attention, which turned out to be a life-sized hoarding of a brand shoot featuring Shraddha Kapoor. The actress reposted this reel on her Instagram Stories with the sweaty face and face palm emojis. Read more about it here. Professionally, Shraddha Kapoor was last seen in Stree 2. The actress has also confirmed that the third instalment of the franchise is in the works. She said, \u201cWhen Amar sir told me he had a story for Stree 3, I got very excited because I know it's going to be something amazing. I can't wait to hear what it's about.\u201d",

        "text": "The lively track Chiggy Wiggy from the 2009 Bollywood film Blue paired Australian pop icon Kylie Minogue with Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, creating an unforgettable East-meets-West musical moment. With its catchy beat and fun choreography, the song became an instant hit and a fan favorite. Recently, Kylie looked back warmly on her whirlwind experience in Mumbai, adding that she hopes \u201cmaybe Akshay will invite her over for lunch again.\u201d\nIn a recent interview with ETimes, Minogue reflected on collaborating with Oscar-winning Indian composer A.R. Rahman for Chiggy Wiggy and shared fond memories of her time on set. She described the energy of her dance rehearsals with choreographer Farah Khan and lunch at Akshay\u2019s home, calling her Bollywood experience \u201cthrilling and memorable.\u201d Laughing, she added that she wouldn\u2019t mind another lunch invitation from Akshay.\nWhen asked about her lasting memories from the visit, Kylie said, \u201cAll of it, really. Mumbai was a complete whirlwind! Just to be on a Bollywood set was kind of crazy, in the best way. It was such a warm welcome. I only wish I could have stayed longer, and I only wish that I had been back sooner. I\u2019m working hard to rectify that. Maybe Akshay will invite me over for lunch again.\u201d\nKylie expressed her eagerness to return to India and hopes to one day perform Chiggy Wiggy live for Indian audiences, saying, \u201cOne day I will perform Chiggy Wiggy in India. I\u2019ve been saying it for a little while, that\u2019s my mission. I\u2019ll see if I can make it happen.\u201d Asked about current artists she\u2019d like to collaborate with, Kylie admitted her list is long: \u201cI know I should have a clear answer for that, but I never do, because there\u2019s so many artistes that I admire and look up to. Some are in my lane, which would make sense, and others are in another world of music. For those reasons, it would be great. I\u2019m just going to leave the gates open, and we will see what happens.\u201d\nWith an illustrious career that includes iconic hits like Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head, the vibrant Love at First Sight, and Spinning Around, Kylie continues to charm fans around the world with her music.\nMeanwhile, Akshay Kumar, who was last seen in Singham Again, has an exciting slate of upcoming projects.

        "text": "The borders between different regional film industries as well as Bollywood have become more faded now. Many stars have crossed over, trying to make a name outside their native industry. Actors like Bobby Deol and Sanjay Dutt are now acting in films down South, while actors like Naga Chaitanya, Rashmika Mandanna and Dulquer Salmaan are appearing in Hindi films. However, a few decades back, these kinds of transitions were not that profound and there was no guarantee of success. While actors like Kamal Haasan, Nagarjuna and Rajinikanth did appear in some successful Hindi films, there was one actress whom the Hindi film industry had written off after just one unsuccessful film. However, she went on to be one of the biggest stars of the Tamil industry.\nWe are talking about Jyothika, who has impressed with her impeccable skills in blockbuster South films like Poovellam Kettuppar, Mugavaree, Star, Chandramukhi, Dumm Dumm Dumm and Khushee. Jyothika\u2019s sister Nagma was already an established actress in both the Tamil and Hindi industries when Jyothika decided to make her debut. \nJyothika debuted in the Hindi film Doli Sajake Rakhna, opposite Akshaye Khanna in 1997, which was directed by Priyadarshan. The film, however, failed to make any impact at the box office and critical reception was not too good either. The setback made Jyothika turn away from the Hindi film industry for a long time and concentrated on Tamil cinema.\nIn a recent interview, Suriya shared that when he first met his wife Jyotika, she was already earning three times more than him. He revealed that for the movie Kaakha Kaakha in which both of them starred, Jyothika was paid three times the amount he was paid.\nAfter a very long absence from Hindi cinema, Jyothika recently made a comeback with the supernatural thriller Shaitaan, which also starred Ajay Devgn and Madhavan.",

        "text": "Being a couple means a lot. You have to take care of each other and stand beside your partner during times of need and through the storms of life. Above all, being a couple often means making sacrifices, much like the one Prince Harry once made.\n\nWe\u2019re not referring to the royal privileges he left behind to stay with his wife, Meghan Markle, but rather to something much closer to his heart\u2014something that runs in his blood.\n\nAccording to reports, Prince Harry had to part ways with a $65,000 possession in order to continue his relationship with Markle.\n\nThe Prince gave up a pair of Purdey firearms, according to The Sun.\n\nFor those who may not know, Harry is a royal who was raised as a fighter. This combination of royal blood and his warrior spirit made him the kind of prince any princess might dream of.\n\nHowever, a report from 2020 revealed that the Duke had to sell the aforementioned pair of handmade hunting rifles. The hunting tools, reportedly worth $65,000, were sold to a fellow hunter in a private deal.\n\nFor context, Prince Harry learned to hunt and shoot at a very young age. However, Meghan Markle has been opposed to violence ever since they met.\n\nIn order to keep her by his side, the royal gave up those two prized guns. Additionally, Prince Harry was notably absent from hunting events at Balmoral and Sandringham in 2020.\nAccording to conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall, who spoke to Radio Times, she speculated that Prince Harry would even leave blood sports behind, as his wife, Meghan Markle, is not in favor of them.\n\nRecently, both Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in a video message on November 7, addressing the first-ever Global Ministerial Conference on Violence Against Children in Colombia.\n\nDuring this event, Prince Harry launched The Parents\u2019 Network, which aims to serve as a support system for families whose children are suffering from online harm.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle tied the knot on May 19, 2018. The couple exchanged vows at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom.\nALSO READ: Meghan Markle Worries Prince Harry Will Rejoin the Royal Family As He Bonds With Kate Middleton; Source Claims",

The film is all set to make its way to OTT after an outstanding run in theatres. Originally released on September 12, timed perfectly with the Onam festivities, the film was produced on a reported budget of Rs 7 crore.\nTo everyone\u2019s delight, it went on to earn reportedly ten times its cost, collecting Rs 75.25 crore globally, making it not only a highlight in Asif Ali\u2019s career but also ranking as the ninth highest-grossing Malayalam movie of 2024 according to Sacnilk.\nAfter its phenomenal theatrical journey, the film\u2019s digital release on Disney+ Hotstar is scheduled for November 19, exactly 68 days after its initial release. Fans will also have access to dubbed versions in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada, broadening the reach of this Malayalam hit.\nDisney+ Hotstar teased fans with an Instagram post: \u201cLost memories.

Despite the competition, Kishkindha Kaandam won over audiences and critics alike, receiving special praise for its tightly-knit story, impressive performances, and captivating music.\nThe film\u2019s intriguing storyline, as described on IMDb, says, \u201cStrange events unfold in a monkey-inhabited village, prompting a newlywed pair and forest officials to embark on a mission to uncover the root cause of the peculiar disturbances.\u201d\nVeteran actor Vijayaraghavan, whose portrayal of the character Appupillai was widely acclaimed, had earlier shared his gratitude for the film\u2019s reception. Reflecting on his role, he reportedly said that Kishkindha Kaandam offers a fresh perspective with each viewing. \u201cThe film almost feels different when watched the second time, as viewers gain a deeper understanding of Appupillai\u2019s journey,\u201d he explained.

        "text": "Released on August 15, 1975, Sholay became a landmark in the history of Hindi cinema, blending themes of love, friendship, and revenge. Even after nearly 50 years, the film\u2019s iconic lines and scenes are etched in viewers\u2019 minds. Who could forget the line \u201cBasanti in kutto ke samane mat nachna\u201d or the memorable image of Dharmendra\u2019s character bound in chains, and Hema Malini\u2019s Basanti running from a thong? What many might not know is that the daring stunt scenes of Basanti were actually performed by Reshma Pathan, not Hema Malini.\nReshma Pathan, Bollywood\u2019s first female stunt artist, performed all the dangerous stunts for Hema Malini in Sholay. This revelation was made by director Ramesh Sippy. A viral video from Kaun Banega Crorepati shows Amitabh Bachchan praising Reshma\u2019s bravery, mentioning her performance in stunts like rescuing a girl from a galloping horse. Hema Malini herself acknowledged Reshma\u2019s vital contribution, calling her a key factor in the film\u2019s success. Reshma, in turn, expressed gratitude for being treated as a heroine, not just a stunt double.\nRamesh Sippy recalled the daring stunts Reshma Pathan performed in Sholay, emphasising how she executed difficult and dangerous shots. One memorable moment involved Reshma performing a stunt, where she rescued a girl from an oncoming horse, a scene that left a lasting impression. Hema Malini, recognising Reshma\u2019s contribution, acknowledged that it was her stunt work that made both of them famous, remembering all the challenging shots Reshma had done. In response, Reshma expressed that she never felt like a mere duplicate, as she was always treated as a heroine and appreciated for her work.\nPathan\u2019s career spans over four decades, where she has risked her life for the silver screen, participating in thousands of dangerous stunts across nearly 400 films. Her story, a testament to her courage and determination, is a source of inspiration for aspiring stunt performers and women in the film industry.",

The picture shows Ananya wearing a basic yet stylish black bodycon dress.

The kurta featured beautiful golden embroidery along the neckline and borders. While it is an old outfit, the design has several trendy elements like a halter neckline, a form-fitting silhouette that highlights her slim frame, and a front cut-out feature. She paired it with matching pants and a lovely dupatta, draped delicately over her arms. The dupatta also had intricate embroidery on the edge.\nAnanya kept her accessories classy. She wore a pair of chandbali earrings that matched the embroidery on her ethnic costume, and the bindi enhanced her overall appearance. For her makeup, she went for blushed cheeks, pink lips, bare eyeshadow, a sleek eyeliner, and mascara-coated lashes. To accentuate the look further, she styled her hair in a sleek straight look with a middle parting.\nOn the professional front, Ananya will next be seen in a love drama, Chand Mera Dil, in which she will co-star with Lakshya.

        "text": "Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Monday dismissed the claim of growing support for the Shiv Sena (UBT), claiming that the Muslim vote \"swelling\" in their favour would soon dissipate.Shinde, addressing a rally in Vaijapur for the party candidate Ramesh Bornare, emphasised that Shiv Sena's focus on community service, rather than caste-based politics, was the reason for the party's victory in the Aurangabad Lok Sabha constituency.The chief minister alleged the 'flaming torch' poll symbol of the Uddhav Thackeray faction was a medium to set houses on fire and create a rift among communities.\"They (Shiv Sena-UBT) call 'mashal (flaming torch) a symbol of revolution. But their torch sets homes ablaze and creates a rift among communities. This swelling of Muslim votes will go away,\" Shinde added.He claimed MLAs in the Marathwada region didn't receive a single rupee for the development of their constituencies in the 2.5 years after 2019 (when the MVA government was in power).\"Vaijapur MLA Ramesh Bornare received a huge fund for his constituency. I believe in giving and not taking back,\" Shinde added.Targeting the Shiv Sena (UBT), the CM said the morale of Shiv Sainiks was badly hit and they were left demoralised because Bal Thackeray's ideology was abandoned, a reference to Uddhav Thackeray joining hands with Congress and NCP (undivided) to form a government after the 2019 assembly elections.\"Had I not acted, the Congress would have sold the Shiv Sena and its bow and arrow (election symbol),\" Shinde said in an obvious reference to his revolt against Thackeray in June 2022 that led to the collapse of the MVA government.He attributed Shiv Sena candidate Sandipan Bhumre's victory in Lok Sabha polls from the Aurangabad seat to his work for various communities without caste discrimination.Bhumre had defeated Shiv Sena (UBT) and AIMIM candidates to score a victory.Voting for 288 seats in Maharashtra will be held on November 20 and results will be out on November 23.",

He identified a connection between the traits of geniuses and talented learners and between self-type and world-type egos. Immediately following this realization, fans saw Isagi confront Rin with his newly evolved mindset. \n\nDon\u2019t miss Blue Lock Chapter 283 to find out what happens next in the match between Paris X Gen and Bastard Munchen, and keep reading to discover the release date, where to read it, the expected plot, and more details.\nBlue Lock Chapter 283: Release date and where to read \n\nAccording to K Manga's official Twitter/X, Blue Lock Chapter 283 will premiere on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at 12:00 am JST. International readers may find it available as early as Tuesday, November 12, depending on their time zone differences.

        "text": "The last chapter of Blue Lock saw Yoichi Isagi figure out that Michael Kaiser shared his trait of being a talented learner. Shortly after, he grasped the parallels between geniuses and talented learners, as well as the distinction between self-type and world-type egos.\n\nNow, as Isagi, fully awakened, goes up against Rin, fans look to the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers to get a sneak peak into the upcoming chapter\u2019s events. Keep reading to find out more about the leaks.\nBlue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers\n\nAs per the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers, the upcoming chapter will be titled \u2018Field Offensive and Defensive.\u2019 The chapter begins as the Star Change System is set to end in just 10 seconds. The chapter begins with Rin Itoshi in possession, skillfully dribbling past Birkenstock and Mensah.\n\nRaichi Jingo and Hiori Yo, watching helplessly, urge Yoichi Isagi to stop Rin\u2019s relentless advance. At this point, Rin\u2019s sole focus is to break through Isagi, and their one-on-one showdown becomes inevitable.\n\nAs Rin speeds past the two defenders, he faces Isagi head-on. Isagi, fully aware of Rin\u2019s intentions, tries to poke the ball away but fails as Rin smoothly switches the ball to his other foot. Without hesitation, Rin attempts a powerful shot at the goal.\nHowever, Isagi had anticipated this move, positioning himself strategically to limit Rin\u2019s shooting angle. By doing so, Isagi sacrifices his position in the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers, becoming a decoy to force Rin into a narrower shot.\n\nThis strategy leads to a surprising turn of events when Michael Kaiser steps in, blocking Rin\u2019s shot. This unexpected collaboration between Isagi and Kaiser forms a \u201cchemical reaction\u201d between two skilled learners, a testament to their adaptability on the field.\n\nThe duo, often seen as rivals, combine their efforts for the first time to disrupt Rin\u2019s play in the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers. This maneuver catches Rin off guard, as he never imagined his opponents would unite to counter his attack.\nThe combined efforts of Isagi and Kaiser exemplify how talented learners can surpass geniuses through collaboration and strategic play. Despite their efforts, Kaiser\u2019s block is not perfect. The ball deflects off his attempt, heading dangerously toward Bastard Munchen\u2019s net.\n\nThe sudden redirection of the ball creates a tense moment as it seems destined to result in a goal for Paris X Gen. At this critical juncture, the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers shift to Gagamaru Gin, Bastard Munchen\u2019s goalkeeper.\n\nRealizing the impending danger, Gagamaru prays that the ball doesn\u2019t find its way into the net. As luck would have it, the ball strikes the goalpost and bounces off, narrowly missing a game-changing score. But the danger isn\u2019t over yet, as the deflected ball is still in play, hovering close to the goal line.\nGagamaru, using his remarkable reflexes, dives just in time to save the ball with his signature \u201cBear Claw Defense.\u201d His last-second intervention stops the ball from crossing the line, denying Paris X Gen a vital goal in the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers.\n\nThe crowd, along with the match commentators, erupts in astonishment at Gagamaru\u2019s heroic save. With Gagamaru\u2019s exceptional goalkeeping, Bastard Munchen manages to fend off a near-certain goal, giving the team a renewed fighting spirit as the Blue Lock Chapter 283 spoilers end.\n\nFor more spoilers like this and updates from the Blue Lock manga, keep up with Pinkvilla.\n\n*The spoilers provided here are not official and should be taken with caution.

        "title": "K\u2019taka govt won\u2019t last beyond January: Deve Gowda",
        "text": "Channapatna, Nov 11 (IANS) Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Monday that the Karnataka Congress government won\u2019t last beyond the coming month of January.\n\nSpeaking at a massive campaign rally for NDA alliance candidate Nikhil Kumaraswamy in Channapatna, Gowda appealed: \u201cI urge to people of Channapatna assembly constituency to ensure the victory of NDA candidate Nikhil Kumaraswamy (his grandson) to break the arrogance of Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar.\u201d\n\nHe added that Union Minister of State V. Somanna has said that the state government will collapse in January 2025. \u201cThis is not a prediction; it\u2019s the truth,\u201d maintained JD (S) National President Deve Gowda.\n\nDeve Gowda stated that there had been a conspiracy to target his entire family, using the Hassan case (sex video scandal involving his grandson Prajwal Revanna) as a pretext.\n\nReiterating Union Minister of State V. Somanna\u2019s statement about the government\u2019s collapse by January, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that, like me, Somanna also has a habit of consulting astrologers, but he has spoken the truth. This government will not last long.\u201d\n\n\u201cI once clashed with former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, but we are united now to uproot this corrupt Congress government,\u201d he declared, holding Yediyurappa\u2019s hand in solidarity.\n\nExpressing anger over Deputy Chief Minister Shivakumar\u2019s statement about arresting PM Narendra Modi and Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowda warned that D.K. Shivakumar\u2019s own words would backfire on him.\n\nReferring to an accusation that Kumaraswamy threatened a prominent figure for Rs 50 crore to support his son\u2019s candidacy, Deve Gowda argued, \u201cFor someone like Kumaraswamy, who once served as Chief Minister with the blessings of the people of Channapatna, such desperation is uncalled for.\n\n\u201cCongress has never been trustworthy, and I warned Kumaraswamy against forming an alliance with them. But under pressure, he joined them to form a government. Just eleven days ago, no one spoke of Nikhil Kumaraswamy as our candidate. Yet for six months, D.K. Shivakumar was openly claiming the seat for himself. Now, another has taken his place in the race,\u201d Deve Gowda said.\n\n\u201cI made Siddaramaiah the finance minister. I have nothing more to say about him. I don\u2019t need to emphasise that Nikhil is my grandson. I didn\u2019t even mention his name until he filed his nomination. Breaking the arrogance of Shivakumar is essential through Nikhil\u2019s victory,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe decision of the virtuous voters will answer everything, he asserted.\n\n\u201cI will return to the constituency on November 24. Ensure you cast your vote for number 1 on the ballot.

        "text": "Actor Vikrant Massey, fresh off the success of 12th Fail, is now taking on a new challenge with The Sabarmati Report, where he plays a journalist determined to uncover the truth behind the 2002 Godhra incident. Directed by Ranjan Chandel, the film also stars Raashi Khanna and Ridhi Dogra, and is backed by Shobha Kapoor, Amul V Mohan, Ektaa R Kapoor and Anshul Mohan. While anticipation builds for its November 15 release, the movie has stirred up polarising reactions, with Vikrant himself facing criticism over his perceived secularism due to his association with the project.\nIn a candid interview with Shubhankar Mishra on Unplugged, Vikrant addressed these criticisms head-on, questioning why people doubt his secular stance. \u201cA truly secular person stands by others regardless of religion, caste, or background,\u201d he shared. Reflecting on the polarised nature of social media, Vikrant explained that his values haven\u2019t changed. He considers himself a liberal, embracing diversity rather than extremes.\nWhen asked about his view of secularism, Vikrant described it as \u201cliving together and respecting each other\u2019s culture while taking pride in your own.\u201d He believes in understanding and not labelling everything in binaries. His approach to secularism, he said, involves accepting others without putting them down or elevating oneself to mock another.\nVikrant also shed light on his personal experiences, drawing parallels between his values and his family\u2019s diversity. \u201cMy parents had an inter-caste marriage, so did I. My brother even converted to another religion. What could be more secular than that?\u201d he remarked.\nIn the same conversation, he said, \u201cPehle mujhe lagta tha Hindu khtre mei hain, ab mujhe nahi lagta Hindu khatrein mein hai; pehle mujhe lagta tha Muslim khatre mei hai, ab mujhe nahi lagta Muslim khatrei mei hai.\u201d",

        "text": "Tom Cruise ought to be among the world's billionaires, along with Rihanna, Taylor Swift, and Kylie Jenner, but according to reports, Scientology is the reason the Mission Impossible star pretty much lives out of a suitcase as he moves from project to project in an attempt to recover his donations to the contentious organization, as quoted in a report by SheKnows.The economics of Tom's film career are still completely upside down because of his devotion to Scientology and his willingness to back that up with money right out of his pocket, despite all the hits and starring roles. Both War of the Worlds and Mission: Impossible 2 brought him $100 million. These are only two of his movies; he has appeared in 44. He also earned an estimated $745 million between 1983 and 2019 from his work as a producer. Also Read : Invincible Season 3: Here\u2019s release date, cast, episode count and plotThose who possess such wealth invest and compound their wealth rather than simply leaving it in the bank. According to math, Cruise ought to be a member of the billionaire club.His estimated 2024 net worth is $600 million, according to reports. Despite this enormous sum, Cruise's way of life appears to be more akin to that of a touring band than an established Hollywood star. Tom should have hundreds of millions of dollars from his decades of success, but that is not how he lives at all. In recent years, he has reduced his property holdings and essentially lives out of a suitcase while juggling several movie projects with little to no time off.The controversies surrounding Scientology help clarify this financial juggling act. Numerous former members of Scientology have criticized the organization for its alleged financial exploitation and secrecy.Since the mid-1990s, Tom has been earning over $20 million per film. You can't help but wonder where all the money he's making is going, even though he claims to be all about the work. By now, he ought to be a billionaire, but shockingly, he is not, as quoted in a report by SheKnows.Even though Tom isn't personally benefiting from his extremely high status, science is.Also Read : Monster Hunter Wilds: All we know about release date, platforms, gameplay and open beta testLeah Remini stated that she spent approximately $5 million on Scientology, including about $2 million on materials and classes, although Cruise's donations are still unknown. It's reasonable to assume that Cruise has spent more than that during his 38 years with Scientology, considering his wealth. FAQsWhy is Tom Cruise not a billionaire despite his successful career?Tom Cruise's devotion to Scientology is thought to have an impact on his finances. Insiders believe that his significant donations and continued investment in the organization have limited his wealth accumulation in comparison to other high-income celebrities.How does Tom Cruise's lifestyle relate to his financial situation?Despite his $600 million fortune, Cruise reportedly lives a nomadic lifestyle, moving between film projects without a permanent home base. His commitment to Scientology, as well as his substantial financial contributions, may contribute to this work-focused lifestyle.",

        "text": "Arjun Kapoor has been making headlines ever since Singham Again hit theatres, with audiences and critics alike applauding his portrayal of the villain Danger Lanka, aka Zubair Hafeez. Kapoor, who is \u201cgrateful\u201d and \u201cready to accept the tag of a comeback or 2.0,\u201d shared his excitement over the support he\u2019s received from friends in the industry. Directed by Rohit Shetty, the film also stars Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Tiger Shroff.\nThough the list of well-wishers is long, Kapoor mentioned a few of those who reached out. \u201cTo get a message from Adi sir (Aditya Chopra) is always nice and that means a lot. He is very correct that way; if he likes something, he will always tell me. If he doesn\u2019t like something also, he will always tell me. To get a praise from him means a lot. [Besides] Ranbir and Alia, they are my contemporaries, and I respect both of them professionally for the work that they do. Whether it\u2019s Varun, Balki sir, a lot of people reached out. List bann jaati hai phir naamo ki. In general, it is nice to have felt an emotion. For instance, I went to watch Citadel for Varun\u2019s premiere. You feel an energy and an emotion. People who might have not seen are also happy for you. That also matters. Vicky [Kaushal], when we met at a Diwali party, he hugged me and I could feel that he is happy because he is somebody I have spoken about the film, etc. You feel good when your contemporaries are cheering for you,\u201d he shared in an exclusive interview with News18.\nKapoor went on to reflect on the experience, adding, \u201cGetting compliments is always good. Sometimes you get it through the box office business and sometimes you get a message or two. There\u2019s just an energy that people are happy for you and they like your work. That combination is there. [Sometimes] they like you, but they will be like \u2018iska kaam pata nahi abhi dekhte hai\u2019. Or they are happy for you, but the film doesn\u2019t pan out beyond a point. Here it seems like an amalgamation of all of it.\u201d\nGiven the star-studded ensemble, was Kapoor ever skeptical about taking on the role? Not at all, he says. \u201cI was happy. It is the kind of film that I would want to go to watch in a theatre. I have grown up watching ensembles. Loved watching these summer blockbusters. I have an affinity towards them, and the child inside me was very excited to go watch this film regardless of it was offered or not, mein dekhne wala tha. I am a fan of Singham, Simmba, and Sooryavanshi. It just felt like a perfect fit for me. Also, because I was at that point in my career where I needed to take a chance and not think so much. Impulsively, I was excited when Rohit sir called me.\u201d",

        "text": "Dwayne Johnson has responded to recent allegations surrounding his on-set behavior, addressing claims that his conduct led to delays and cost overruns on his upcoming film Red One. The iconic actor and former WWE star admits to certain quirks, such as occasionally being late and using unconventional methods to save time on set, but he remains adamant that the extent of the controversy is exaggerated.Late to Set but Hardly Unprofessional, Says JohnsonIn an interview with GQ, Johnson acknowledged that he sometimes arrives to set after the scheduled time but firmly denied the scale of the alleged delays. A previous report by The Wrap suggested that Johnson\u2019s tardiness drove up the film\u2019s production costs, with insiders claiming he could be as much as eight hours late on some days. Johnson dismissed these claims as overblown. \u201cYeah, that happens,\u201d Johnson admitted, but clarified, \u201cNot that amount, by the way. That was a bananas amount. That\u2019s crazy. Ridiculous.\u201dAlso Read : Is Selena Gomez planning a secret wedding with Benny Blanco? Here\u2019s what we knowThe actor\u2019s director for Red One, Jake Kasdan, backed Johnson up, emphasizing the actor\u2019s reliability and dedication. \u201cHe never missed a day of work ever,\u201d Kasdan told GQ. \u201cHe has a lot going on. He can be late sometimes, but such is Hollywood \u2014 that\u2019s the case with everybody.\u201d Kasdan noted that he has worked on multiple projects with Johnson, never seeing him exhibit anything but respect and commitment to the entire crew.An Unconventional Habit: Peeing in Bottles to Save TimeAlongside his occasional tardiness, Johnson also addressed an unusual claim: that he sometimes uses water bottles instead of restrooms while on set to avoid losing time. He confirmed this quirk, explaining it as a practical choice given the fast-paced environment. \u201cYeah. That happens\u2026 I\u2019ve said a thousand times: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here. Come and ask me. And I\u2019ll tell you the truth,\u2019\u201d Johnson told GQ with a grin.While the practice might seem unusual, it reflects Johnson\u2019s dedication to efficiency and his desire to keep filming momentum. Johnson, whose disciplined lifestyle is well-known, often begins his days with rigorous workouts, which may lead to him arriving later than scheduled on certain mornings. However, his co-star Chris Evans downplayed any disruption this might cause, stating that Johnson\u2019s timing is generally coordinated with the production team. \u201cHe shows up when he\u2019s scheduled to show up,\u201d Evans explained.Known for Generosity: Johnson\u2019s Kind Gestures on SetBeyond the controversy, both Kasdan and Evans highlighted Johnson\u2019s genuine care for the people he works with. Evans shared an incident on set where Johnson spontaneously gave away significant sums of money to various crew members as part of a weekly giveaway.Also Read :God of War TV Series: All you may want to knowOn one occasion, Johnson increased the winning pool from $4,000 to $50,000, distributing a total close to $100,000 in a single day.

        "title": "Opinion: Good and bad of institutions",
        "text": "By Sushanta Kumar Mahapatra , AV Vedpuriswar\r\n\r\nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2024, awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A Robinson, reflects that out of the Americans who have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics since 2000, around 28% are immigrants to the US. However, it is important to note that they have the same opinion about the role of institutions in a country pertaining to its economic development.\r\n\r\nThe laureates found that the persistent gap between the rich and poor countries is because of the institutions of the societies of those countries. While assessing the importance of institutions for the prosperity of a country, they revealed that weak laws and institutions of society hinder the growth of the country thereby limiting the chance of improving the living condition of the population.\r\n\r\nTwo Aspects\r\n\r\nThey broadly discussed two aspects of the institutions: first, they evaluated the importance of institutions for the progress of a society or country, and second, they discussed the reason behind the change in political institutions. As defined by them, economic institutions or inclusive institutions enforce property rights for a large group of the population, provide opportunities for investments and enable various sections of people to participate in economic activities. Good political institutions give more power to the people to participate in the role of governance and support the purpose of democracy. Also, good political institutions play a crucial role in shaping economic institutions.\r\nOn the other hand, bad or extractive institutions lack the essential rule of law for the population and don\u2019t have proper property rights. When political powers are controlled by narrowly defined elite groups, it results in the formation of extractive institutions.\r\n\r\nRules and Policies\r\n\r\nA comprehensive study of the era of colonisation can be considered as a natural experiment to find details of institutional rules and policy changes. When the Europeans started their colonies in various parts of the globe, either they changed the institutions of those societies or influenced those societies resulting in change in the institutions. However, the change varied along with the colonies and the original society existing in that place. The regions, where the colonisers formed inclusive political and economic institutions for their own long-term benefits, changed for the better.\r\n\r\nWhen political powers are controlled by narrowly defined elite groups, it results in the formation of extractive institutions\r\n\r\nContrary to that, in some countries, the colonisers only aimed at exploiting the natives and capturing the resources of these countries. They used an extractive economy to gain short-term benefits as they had control over the indigenous population. Although there was progress for some time in those regions, later the living standards of the people deteriorated remarkably. Hence, institutions play a decisive role in influencing many features of the country, like education, profession of people and the political system.\r\n\r\nInfluencing Factors\r\n\r\nThere are many influencing factors that decide the type of institutions that develop in any colony. Population density is one of the key aspects \u2014 the denser the population of a region, the stronger the resistance of the people against the formation of any kind of new institution. Hence, less number of European settlers moved to that place. While in the sparsely populated places, the Europeans were able to dominate the natives and their resistance.\r\n\r\nPlaces, where resources were plenty, the colonisers developed such institutions so that they could exploit the local people and extract resources. The main aim was to provide benefits to a few elites of the places to take advantage of the maximum number of people living there. As a result of control over democratic rights of election and political rights, these extractive economic institutions became the reasons for the declining social and economic standards of the people.\r\n\r\nThe places that used to be rich and prosperous before the phase of colonisation declined in various aspects and now are among the poorest countries in the world. Compared to that, the places that were less densely populated and poor at that time became the preferred choice for the colonisers to start inclusive economic institutions which they had planned for their long-term benefits and eventually resulted in the prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nExtractive Institutions\r\n\r\nContrary to the popular notion that the countries nearer to the equator are poorer because people are less productive in these areas than the people of the countries with temperate climates, the laureates have found that it is the societal institutions of these countries that are responsible for productivity. Also, the approach of colonising nations in the colonies became another factor deciding the kind of institutions developed in those places.\r\n\r\nExtractive institutions are beneficial only for a small elite group. However, the introduction of a maximum number of inclusive institutions and the rule of law is capable of creating long-term benefits for everyone in society. When political institutions prioritise the interests of only a select elite while neglecting the general public, they undermine their own credibility, resulting in erosion of public trust in economic reforms. Sometimes populations of non-democratic countries take revolutionary ways to transition to democracy. The ways can be violent or peaceful. However, peaceful protests involve the largest number of people.\r\n\r\nAs the model developed by the laureates explains, there are compelling reasons why some countries switch from democracy to non-democracy and vice-versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Sushanta Kumar Mahapatra teaches at the Department of Economics, ICFAI School of Social Sciences, ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education, Deemed University, Hyderabad.

        "title": "ON A SNAIL TRAIL",
        "text": "Snails may be the last thing that one would recollect if one said skincare. Well, think again because the same humble creatures that leave glistening trails in gardens are now offering a surprising beauty boost to skin routines.Skin LoveSo, what is in this \u2018slime\u2019 that\u2019s captured the attention of skincare enthusiasts? Snail mucin is a powerhouse of skin-loving compounds: Allantoin, Glycolic acid, proteins, peptides, and antioxidants. These are key elements in achieving a smooth, hydrated, and youthful complexion. \u201cSnail Mucin naturally promotes collagen and elastin production, helping skin stay firm and bouncy. Additionally, its high Glycolic acid content gently exfoliates, reducing dead skin cells and lightening hyperpigmentation for an even skin tone. And for those who struggle with dry skin or minor irritations, allantoin, a natural compound in snail mucin delivers deep hydration and supports skin healing. It may sound unconventional, but snail mucin has transformed into a skincare rage, proving that nature\u2019s remedies sometimes come from the most unexpected sources,\u201d says Shahnaz Husain, Beauty Icon and Founder, Chairperson and Managing Director, The Shahnaz Husain Group. Advantages GaloreStudies by dermatologists and a rising tide of skincare enthusiasts all point to the impressive benefits this ingredient has for the skin, especially in the areas of hydration, anti-aging, and healing. Dr. Deepak Jakhar, Consultant Dermatologist, Dermosphere Clinic and Author \u2013 Good Skin Bad Skin, avers, \u201cI see a growing demand for skincare solutions that are natural yet effective, and snail mucin fits perfectly into this niche. Derived from the secretion of snails, this ingredient contains a rich mix of beneficial compounds like glycolic acid, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin. These elements are key players in skin hydration, anti-aging, and repair \u2014traits that are essential for maintaining a healthy and radiant complexion. The best part? Snail mucin is gentle enough for most skin types, including sensitive skin, making it versatile and accessible.\u201d Snail mucin\u2019s glycoproteins and zinc promote skin regeneration and repair; they are especially helpful in minimising inflammation and mending acne scars.Dr. Nirupama Parwanda, MD Dermatologist, Founder, Zolie Skin Clinic New Delhi, adds, \u201csnail mucin is rich in hyaluronic acid, a powerful ingredient to preserve the skin\u2019s suppleness and holds moisture in the skin. Snail mucin provides deep hydration, the skin becomes smooth, supple, and noticeably plumper because of the deep hydration. Snail mucin contains glycolic acid, which gently exfoliates your skin to remove damaged cells and increase collagen production. Collagen is essential for minimizing wrinkles and increasing the firmness of the skin. Copper peptides can hasten tanning and, when combined with glycolic acid, gently exfoliate your skin, giving you a healthy, radiant complexion.\u201dTake CarePeople with extremely sensitive skin, especially those who react to natural or bioactive ingredients, may want to avoid snail mucin, or consult a dermatologist first to ensure compatibility. Radhika Ghai, Founder & CEO, kindlife, says, \u201cbefore incorporating snail mucin into your routine, apply a small amount on a less visible area of skin to check for any adverse reactions. Snail mucin pairs well with hydrating products and can be used before serums and moisturizers to lock in moisture. Since snail mucin already contains mild exfoliating acids, using it with high-strength AHAs or BHAs can lead to irritation. While it is gentle, excessive application can lead to over-exfoliation, especially if other exfoliating ingredients are also part of the routine.\u201d Check the concentration on the product label. Not all snail mucin products are created equal, and the concentration can make a big difference in results. \u201cLook for products with a high concentration of snail mucin\u2014ideally 70% or more. Many serums and creams list concentrations between 70% and 96%, and the higher the percentage, the more effective it\u2019s likely to be for skin hydration, texture, and elasticity. Lower-concentration products may still offer benefits, but the real glow-getters are those with that higher dose of snail secretion filtrate,\u201d says Hussain. Snail mucin\u2019s gentle yet effective formulation is a wonderful addition to many skincare routines, especially for those looking for enhanced hydration, anti-aging, and barrier support. With mindful use and proper layering, it can be a beneficial tool in achieving healthy, glowing skin.SKIN-CREDIBLE TIPS \u2022 Applying it first helps prep the skin, allowing subsequent products to penetrate more effectively.\u2022 Avoid using snail mucin on open wounds or active acne breakouts, it may worsen irritation.\u2022 Snail mucin works best on clean skin because it maximises absorption.\u2022 Using high-quality, reputable products will ensure you can enjoy the full benefit of snail mucin in a balanced skincare routine.\u2022 Snail mucin can make...",

It argued that the three legislators should not have been invited as \u201cnon-Hindus are not allowed entry at the ghat since long, and the British had also made it a rule under the Haridwar Municipal Act of 1935.\u201dThe event, held on Monday in the presence of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and a host of other BJP leaders, featured cultural performances and a light show. As part of protocol, Haridwar district administration had invited Congress MLA from Piran Kaliyar Furqan Ahmed, BSP MLA from Laksar Mohammad Shahzad, and Congress MLA from Manglaur Qazi Nizamuddin. However, none of the MLAs attended.A Ganga Sabha member told TOI, \u201cSome issues were raised but it was confirmed that none of the MLAs were coming.\u201d He refused to comment further saying, \u201cEverything went well.\u201dState coordinator of Bajrang Dal, Anuj Walia, said, \u201cWe strongly opposed inviting the MLAs... The administration accepted the mistake and told us that the MLAs will not come.\u201dMohammad Shahzad said, \u201cWe don\u2019t care about the resistance by right-wing outfits... We know the sanctity of Ganga and Har-ki-Pauri and we respect it. I do not go to govt events as BJP leaders hijack them and elected representatives are not entertained.\u201dQazi Nizamuddin said that he and Ahmed were not in the state when the event took place. \u201cI have been campaigning in Maharashtra for the past few weeks. Furqan Ahmed is also campaigning in Maharashtra.\u201d",
        "summary": "Controversy arose in Haridwar when the Ganga Sabha allegedly opposed the district administration's invitation to three Muslim MLAs for a state foundation day event at Har-ki-Pauri ghat. The Sabha cited a long-standing tradition and a 1935 rule prohibiting non-Hindus' entry. While the MLAs did not attend, the incident sparked debate about religious inclusivity at the sacred site.",

        "text": "Children's Day, also known as 'Bal Diwas', is celebrated annually on November 14 in India. The day is celebrated to appreciate and acknowledge children as they are the future of the county. This date also marks the birth anniversary of the first Prime Minister of the nation Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Known for his affection towards children, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru believed that children are the true wealth of the nation. He often referred to them as \"the most precious resource\" of the country. So, his birthday is celebrated as Children's Day to affirm the commitment of the nation towards the betterment of the lives of its young citizens.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, India. He was a great advocate for children's rights and for an all-inclusive education system where knowledge is accessible to all. He considered every child as the future of the country and appreciated them to the fullest. \"Children are like buds in a garden and should be carefully and lovingly nurtured, as they are the future of the nation and the citizens of tomorrow,\" Nehru said in one of his famous speeches. \n\nIt is because of his love for children that Jawaharlal Nehru is also commonly known as 'Chacha Nehru' among kids. He not only loved children but also believed in providing them with proper resources for their growth. He was concerned about the development of the educational system in the country. Therefore, he oversaw the establishment of some of the most eminent educational institutions in the country, including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs). \n\nWhy is Children's Day celebrated on Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday? \n\nPreviously, Children's Day was celebrated in India on November 20 - the day 'World Children's Day' is celebrated globally by the United Nations. However, after the death of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1964, the parliament issued a resolution to establish his birthday as the official Children's Day in the country. Since then, India celebrates Children's Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India. The day is also known as 'Bal Diwas' in the country.\n\nChildren's Day Celebrations\n\nTo commemorate this day, children are showered with a lot of love, gifts and pampering. Schools across the country organise special events and programs for the children who are also showered with gifts that consist of eatables, books and cards. They also conduct games, debates, seminars, dance, music, essay, speech and painting competitions.",

The film is expected to give the franchise a grand conclusion; its first part (titled Dead Reckoning) underperformed in theatres last year.The trailer generated a lot of buzz among social media users.\"New Mission Impossible trailer... we are so very, very back,\" commented one user. \"A cool thing about that new Mission Impossible trailer is there's no sound effects - it's just score and dialogue,\" said another user.The film was originally set for 2022, but was delayed multiple times by the pandemic and SAG-AFTRA actors strike. It's scheduled to be released on May 23, 2025.This release follows Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, which saw high-intensity scenes but did not perform as strongly as expected at the box office.

        "title": "Bengali Actor And Theatre Icon Manoj Mitra Dies At 86 Due To Age-related Ailments",
        "text": "Kolkata, Nov 12 (PTI) Bengali theatre personality Manoj Mitra, who died on Tuesday at the age of 86 in Kolkata, was known mainly for writing and directing farces and fantasies to highlight social and political issues.His plays also underscored the struggle of the oppressed common man. A legendary actor, he immortalised the character of Banchharam in Tapan Sinha's 1980 film 'Banchharamer Bagan' (The Garden of Banchharam). This dark comedy on the oppression of the peasants by the zamindars was adapted from a play by Mitra.Mitra had around 100 one-act and full-length plays to his credit besides film scripts.His major full-length plays include 'Narak Guljar' (The Great Hell), 'Aswathama', 'Chakbhanga Madhu' (Honey from Broken Hive), 'Mesh O Rakhash' (The Lamb and the Monster), 'Galpo Hekim Saheb' (Tale of a Hekim), 'Rajdarshan' (Visiting the King), 'Alokanandar Putra Kanya' (Alokananda's Son and Daughter), 'Sajano Bagan' (Decorated Garden), 'Chhayar Prashad' (The Palace of Shadows) and 'Jene Shune Bish' (Poison, Knowingly).Partition of the country, Naxalite movement of Bengal, tyranny of the ruling class, religious fundamentalism and other major issues were highlighted in Mitra's plays.Among his key one-act plays are 'Mrityur Chokhe Jal' (Tears in the Eyes of Death), 'Chokhe Angul Dada' (The Fault Finder), 'Ami Madan Bolchhi' (Hello I am Madan), 'Takshak' and others.According to academician and translator Mousumi Roy Chowdhury, in Mitra\u2019s plays, conscience has a major role.\"Not strictly restricted to an instrumental moral sense, conscience here is used in the larger sense of consciousness that reaches beyond the closures and binaries of the regulating norms of the political theatre,\" Roy Chowdhury said in an anthology of plays translated by her.He also acted in more than 80 films including Satyajit Ray's classics 'Ghare Baire' (Home and the World, 1984) and 'Ganashatru' (An Enemy of the People, 1989). Mitra also worked on projects of Tapan Sinha - 'Adalat O Ekti Meye' (The Court and a Woman, 1982) and 'Wheel Chair' (1995).After the 1984 superhit potboiler 'Shatru' (Enemy) in which he essayed the role of a notorious leader, Mitra got a chance to act in Bollywood films. He, however, rejected that proposal apprehending that it would impact his involvement in theatre.Mitra was born December 22, 1938, in a village in Khulna district of undivided Bengal. His father was a government officer.Interestingly, though plays were enacted at his family home during the festive days of Durga puja, children were not allowed to watch them. Backdrops, props, costumes and other articles associated with the staging of plays stored at home kindled his passion for plays.Mitra permanently came to India from East Pakistan at the age of 12. He cleared his MA in Philosophy in 1960.During the college and university days, he wrote short stories and plays. However, after his play 'Mrityur Chokhe Jal' earned him first prize at a statewide competition, he focused only on this field. His acting prowess mesmerised veteran actors of that time as the 21-year-old youth effortlessly metamorphosed into an elderly man in 'Mrityur Chokhe Jal'.Also in the film 'Banchharamer Bagan', adapted from his play 'Sajano Bagan' (1977), he essayed the role of the 90-year-old protagonist when Mitra was in his 40s. He bagged the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the movie.The playwright was conferred with the Sangeet Natak Award (1985) and the Asiatic Society Award (2005) for his overall contribution to theatre, among numerous other awards.Mitra also headed the theatre group 'Sundaram' for many years. He was a professor of philosophy in a college in West Bengal. PTI NN RG",

        "text": "A controversy erupted in Haridwar after the district administration invited three Muslim MLAs to an event at Har-ki-Pauri ghat for the state foundation day. The move was reportedly opposed by the Ganga Sabha, which manages the ghat, says a TOI report. It argued that the three legislators should not have been invited as non-Hindus are not allowed entry at the ghat since long, and the British had also made it a rule under the Haridwar Municipal Act of 1935. The event, held on Monday in the presence of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and a host of other BJP leaders, featured cultural performances and a light show, with over 3.5 lakh diyas lit across 52 ghats. As part of protocol, the Haridwar district administration had invited Congress MLA from Piran Kaliyar Furqan Ahmed, BSP MLA from Laksar Mohammad Shahzad, and Congress MLA from Manglaur Qazi Nizamuddin. However, none of the MLAs attended.A Ganga Sabha member told TOI, Some issues were raised but it was confirmed that none of the MLAs were coming. He denied commenting further on the matter saying, Everything went well. State coordinator of Bajrang Dal, Anuj Walia, meanwhile said, We strongly opposed inviting the MLAs for the light show at the ghat. Har-ki-Pauri is a holy place for Hindus, and entry of Muslims is not allowed there. The administration accepted the mistake and told us that the MLAs will not come. They also assured that this type of mistake will not happen again. This issue is unique, as the Deepotsav was held at the ghat for the first time. Moreover, according to protocol, MLAs from the Haridwar district are invited to major government events, regardless of their religious background.When queried, BSP MLA Mohammad Shahzad told TOI, We don't care about the resistance by right-wing outfits as they are working on a propaganda to polarise the society. We know the sanctity of Ganga and Har-ki-Pauri and as residents of Haridwar district, we respect it. I do not go to govt events as BJP leaders hijack them and elected representatives are not entertained. Also, the govt should focus on development work, this type of event is a waste of money. Congress MLA Qazi Nizamuddin said that he and Ahmed were not in the state when the event took place. He told TOI, My party has given me a key role for the Maharashtra assembly elections and I have been campaigning for the party for the past few weeks. Furqan Ahmed is also campaigning in Maharashtra. Commenting on the issue, he said, I got a call from the additional district magistrate of Haridwar and the joint magistrate of Roorkee and they had invited me for the event. However, as both Furqan and I are in Maharashtra, it was not possible for us to attend the Deepotsav. Haridwar district magistrate Karmendra Singh said, We followed protocol for the MLAs and respected the beliefs of the Ganga Sabha. (With TOI inputs)",

The high-profile Delhiite looked upset during the interview and walked out. She returned for the interview shortly while wiping what seemed to be her tears but she exited the room yet again. Although she did not delve into the reason behind her behaviour at the time, Shalini now revealed that it was not a publicity stunt but she indeed walked out. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to do PR stunts like that. I just wanted to leave so I left and I came back when I wanted to,\u201d she said, while speaking with The Chill Hour. When the host, Deepak Pareek, tried to prod her into giving the details, Shalini shut him down. \u201cAapke paas aur koi kaam nahi hai, baal ki kaal nikalne ke liye?\u201d she asked. \nFor the unversed, Shalini was seated for an interview with Galatta India with Bhavana Panday, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, Seema Kiran Sajdeh, Neelam Kothari Soni, Kalyani Saha Chawla and Maheep Kapoor. During the chat, Shalini was being asked about the show when she cut the interviewer mid way and said that she wants to take a break. When her co-stars asked her what happened, she did not give them an explanation. Instead, she asked them to continue without her. \u201cI need a break,\u201d she said, and walked away. \u201cYou guys can carry on,\u201d she added as she left the room. \nShe returned to the room briefly but then decided to leave yet again. Although the reason behind her exit was unclear, fans believe it was because of Kalyani Saha\u2019s comment. During the interview, Kalyani said, \u201cWhen I am talking Shalini has to get up and get attention to herself because she is not getting attention!\u201d The comment, fans believe, might have pissed Shalini off.",

        "text": "Actor and filmmaker Aamir Khan, a towering figure in Hindi cinema for over three decades, recently shared how he nearly left it all behind to focus on his family, feeling that his devotion to the industry had come at a personal cost. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter India, Aamir and his ex-wife, Kiran Rao, reflected on the pivotal moment when he told his family he planned to step away from films for good.\n\u201cI decided to quit before Laal Singh Chadha,\u201d Aamir revealed. \u201cI was going through a personal journey of my own. Towards the end of Covid, I suddenly realised that I have spent the bulk of my adult life, starting from the age of 18 right up to now, all of my bandwidth and focus has been on cinema and films.\u201d\nAamir admitted feeling guilty about not being fully present in his relationships, explaining, \u201cI haven\u2019t been there enough for my relationships \u2013 my kids, siblings, and family. Whether it was Kiran or Reena, when I was married to them. I felt that I wasn\u2019t there for these people enough.\u201d This revelation hit midway through Laal Singh Chadha, as filming resumed after Covid. \u201cIn the middle of Covid, I went through an emotional moment where I felt that I have given my whole life to cinema and I haven\u2019t been there for my family. I felt a lot of guilt,\u201d he said.\nAt one point, Aamir even sat down with his family to break the news. \u201cSo, I told them that I want to quit films and spend time with you all. That was my reaction; it wasn\u2019t out of any disappointment from cinema. Junaid and Ira convinced me not to quit. My family knew I had quit, but when the time came to tell my potential directors, my kids sat me down. Junaid said, \u2018Why do you have to go from one extreme to the other? There is a space somewhere in the middle where you can be in\u2019.\u201d With their guidance, Aamir reconsidered, describing the decision as a \u201cpersonal journey.\u201d\nKiran also shared her thoughts on Aamir\u2019s decision, recalling a private moment. \u201cShe asked me to come to the balcony to talk alone. She said, \u2018You are leaving us.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I am not leaving you, I am leaving films.\u2019 She said, \u2018You are a child of cinema, and if you are leaving films, you are leaving us.\u2019\u201d\nWith humor, Kiran added that they weren\u2019t eager for him to stay home all the time. \u201cCan you imagine him sitting at home and not doing any films? In fact, his daughter told him, \u2018Please papa, you can\u2019t spend all your time with us, we will go crazy.\u2019 After that, he went straight into six films. 0-6, there is no moderation and balance,\u201d she joked.\nAamir explained his renewed drive, clarifying that he took on six films because he \u201cwanted to make the last 10 years of my active life as an actor to be the most productive.\u201d He added, \u201cHopefully, if I am fine, these 10 years will be the last active 10 years for me in the industry, and I want to work with creative people, including musicians, writers, and directors, people who I feel are really good.\u201d",

Recently, Kylie looked back warmly on her whirlwind experience in Mumbai, adding that she hopes \u201cmaybe Akshay will invite her over for lunch again.\u201d\nIn a recent interview with ETimes, Minogue reflected on collaborating with Oscar-winning Indian composer A.R.

Mumbai was a complete whirlwind! Just to be on a Bollywood set was kind of crazy, in the best way. It was such a warm welcome. I only wish I could have stayed longer, and I only wish that I had been back sooner. I\u2019m working hard to rectify that.

        "title": "Heretic Movie Review",
        "text": "\u201cHeretic\u201d opens with an unusual table setter: Two young missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are discussing condoms and why some are labeled as large even though they\u2019re all pretty much a standard size. \u201cWhat else do we believe because of marketing?\u201d one asks the other. That line will echo through the movie, a stimulating discussion of religion that emerges from a horror movie wrapper. Despite a second-half slide and feeling unbalanced, this is the rare movie that combines lots of squirting blood and elevated discussion of the ancient Egyptian god Horus. Our two church members \u2014 played fiercely by Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East \u2014 are wandering around trying to covert souls when they knock on the door of a sweet-looking cottage. Its owner, Reed, offers a hearty \u201cGood afternoon!\u201d He welcomes them in, brings them drinks and promises a blueberry pie. He\u2019s also interested in learning more about the church. So far, so good. Reed is, of course, if you\u2019ve seen the poster, the baddie and he\u2019s played by Hugh Grant, who doesn\u2019t go the snarling, dead-eyed Hannibal Lecter route in \u201cHeretic.\u201d Grant is the slightly bumbling, bashful and self-mocking character we fell in love with in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d but with a smear of menace. He gradually reveals that he actually knows quite a bit about the Mormon religion \u2014 and all religions. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be religious,\u201d he says jauntily and promises his wife will join them soon, a requirement for the church. Homey touches in his home include a framed \u201cBless This Mess\u201d needlepoint on a wall, but there are also oddities, like his lights are on a timer and there\u2019s metal in the walls and ceilings. Writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Wood \u2014 who also combined on \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d \u2014 have remarkably set us up for an unexpected theological debate here. Reed is not unlike an earnest professor of comparative religion set against two naive missionaries armed with talking points who are hiding their own doubts. Reed knows exactly where the weak points are and thrusts in the philosophical knife. \u201cHow do you feel about awkward questions?\u201d he asks before tackling the church\u2019s stance of polygamy. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s sketch, for sure,\u201d East\u2019s Sister Paxton finally admits. Soon the discussion turns on which religions are marketed better. Reed is, after all, facing a pair of walking and talking advertisements for Mormonism. So beautifully constructed and acted in the first half is \u201cHeretic\u201d that you won\u2019t really notice when it turns into a horror movie. You might be a step ahead of the missionaries, but not by much. Reed alternates between creepy and funny, well versed in Spider-Man and Voltaire, Radiohead and the Hollies, Wendy\u2019s and Taco Bell. Grant has gloriously weaponized his natural charm. Reed has his own grand theory about religion and you will learn it. And he may or may not have some creepy stuff in his basement. \u201cIt\u2019s all terrifying. It is scary. I\u2019m scared,\u201d he says adorably, but he\u2019s referring to organized religions. You\u2019ll find him utterly terrifying, a fanatical heretic in sheep\u2019s clothing who can cutely mimic Jar Jar Binks from the Star Wars universe. Beck and Wood take this fascinating premise as far as it can go before it becomes an airless stage play. By the halfway point, the audience who came for the horror \u2014 not the lectures on religious marketing \u2014 are baying for blood, and blood they will get. The plot by the end is a murky, muddled and disturbing mess, a combination of too many ideas and no clear ending. Grant, with his comfy cardigan and candles, is the movie\u2019s draw, but there\u2019s great work by Thatcher and East, who are trying to not act scared even when they\u2019re terrified. And they\u2019re no mere ingenue targets \u2014 they bite back with worthy criticism of Mr. Reed\u2019s beliefs through shaking teeth. Producers have added a little marketing manipulation with \u201cHeretic,\u201d adding to some screenings the scent of blueberry pie along with the gore. Don\u2019t be distracted. Keep your eyes on Hugh Grant and just, well, pray. \u201cHeretic,\u201d an A24 release that opens in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201csome bloody violence.\u201d Running time: 110 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

        "text": "World Test Championship Final 2025: India succumbed to a shocking 3-0 loss against New Zealand in their home conditions. The Asian Giants looked comfortably placed to qualify for the WTC Finals ahead of the IND vs NZ series, but now, things have changed drastically. India have been dethroned from the top spot of the WTC points table and have been virtually knocked out of the marquee final. This was the first time ever that India were clean swept in a three-match home Test series. Ravichandran Ashwin Admits Being Shattered After IND vs NZ seriesRavichandran Ashwin is undoubtedly one of the stalwarts of the game and is considered as one of the sharpest cricketing brains. In the past, Ashwin has won India many games with his bowling. Unfortunately, the story of the IND vs NZ Test series was pretty different for the Indian spinner. By Ashwin's lofty standards, he had a very underwhelming series.The spinner could take only nine wickets in three matches, and six innings. These are his worst home series figures where he bowled at an excess of 90 overs. Ashwin is an extremely crucial for India as far as home series are concerned. Prior to the India vs New Zealand series, Ashwin has averaged more than 30 in a home Test series only thrice in his career. Unfortunately, India lost two of them, one against England in 2012 and the other against New Zealand in 2024.

        "text": "HomeEntertainmentWhy Dia Mirza Never Had A Barbie Doll\n\nWhy Dia Mirza Never Had A Barbie Doll\n\nThe actress talks about her environment activism\n\nKabir Singh BhandariUpdated: Sunday, November 10, 2024, 06:16 PM IST\n\nThe India Clean-Up Confluence was a first of its kind event organised where leaders from clean-up movements, government bodies, corporations, and the public came together to initiate dialogue and foster collaboration on sustainable solutions for a cleaner, healthier environment. Actor and UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador Dia Mirza, as the founder of One India Stories partnered with India Clean Up Confluence (organised by Carter Cleanup and Greenmyna). During this time, Dia spoke to us about why a single event was essential to bring about change in India.\n\nCrazy people who can't sit still\n\n\u201cThere are several clean up groups which are largely volunteer citizen and youth led groups. Many of the founders of those clean up groups are just crazy people who can't sit still when they see something wrong and they get up and start doing the work themselves. And that\u2019s what\u2019s attracted the community that now continues to work and support them. And I can name so many of them, whether it's Harold who started Carter Clean-up, Afroz who started Versova Beach Cleanup, or the Plog man of India, Ripu, or Pradeep Sangwan, founder of Healing Himalayas, that works to preserve the Himalayas and promote responsible tourism. So every person who's started the movement has done so because they've seen an issue in their neighbourhood, backyard or region and said that they want to be part of the solution.\n\nNow, a lot of people say clean-ups are not the answer, and the industry needs to take more cognizance of the kind of waste they\u2019re generating. The plastics industry needs to put the tap on plastics. Yes, all of that is true. But the kind of environmental consciousness clean-ups generate, nothing else can. Because when young people start going and becoming a part of clean-ups, there is a conscious shift in them- they start noticing every chips or biscuit wrapper that they are using, and think about how they can be less wasteful, how can they innovate and come up with solutions.\n\nRohit Shetty Reveals Why Original Theme Music Wasn't Used in Singham Again: 'Woh T-Series Ne Strike Kar Diya...'\n\nDelhi Schools To Get Cybercrime Education Through Police-Made Brochures\n\nMaharashtra Elections: School Buses to Remain Off Roads for Two Days Due to Election Duty\n\nGATE 2025 Application Correction Extended To November 20, Apply Here At gate2025.iitr.ac.in\n\nThe confluence has been set up with the aim that these stakeholders, these people across the country who are doing all this phenomenal work, get one place to meet annually or biannually or as many times as they so choose to, to share their problems, to identify solutions that are working and scale them,\u201d Dia explained in detail.\n\nEnvironmental origins\n\nDia also recently received the Wildlife Advocate of the Year award and was appointed as jury for ALT Environmental Film Festival. But this concern for the environment isn\u2019t a new found fad for the actress, rather its something she grew up with. Dia\u2019s mother detested plastics and they would store everything in tin, metal or glass jars.\n\nThe alcohol bottles were used to store drinking water. No plastic bags were ever used, and her mother didn't even let her play with plastic dolls as a child, so she never had a Barbie. Even the school she went to held many classes outdoors under big trees, making the students interact with nature on a daily basis.\n\nAll this made her deeply aware that one\u2019s behaviour, choices, actions, impact everyone, everywhere. Then when she became an actor and started working in films, Dia was also associated with various social organisations, which is when she realised that mainstream society and media is just not focusing on environmental health and climate action. That is when she realised that she needs to be the conduit between the remarkable stories of people who are doing the work on the ground and hopefully through her own choices and her own learning and growth, inspire a conscious shift perfectly.\n\nIn the editor\u2019s shoes\n\nWith the recent spate of re-releases on cinemas, her romantic debut, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein also was back in theatres, 23 years after it was originally released. On the OTT front, she was seen in Anubhav Sinha\u2019s web series IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack, where she played the editor of a newspaper covering the incident, who on certain occasions is seen disagreeing with a journalist reporting on the hijack and the politics involved.\n\nHow did she prepare for that role and did she realise anything new about the media industry?\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of my female journalist friends who were in newsrooms at the time, and I was very curious to know what was the power role those days and how much has changed. The one thing that I understood was that not much has changed, newsrooms are still largely controlled by men, with very few women who are in positions of authority.\n\nThe ones who were there, have their own stories to tell. One friend of mine spoke about how she was nine months pregnant and she got a call at 3:30 am to drive into the office to read the news because the whole hijack had taken place. Another friend spoke about how she didn't go back home for 56 hours because they were tracking the news and they were trying to just get more details out and understand and make sense of what was happening. When you invest time in discovering the real stories of real people who were in the situation, it helps you not only connect more deeply with the character that you are essaying, but it just improves your own understanding of what shapes our world and people in certain spaces,\u201d Dia concluded.\n\nFollow us on\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\nWhy Dia Mirza Never Had A Barbie Doll\n\nRohit Shetty Reveals Why Original Theme Music Wasn't Used in Singham Again: 'Woh T-Series Ne Strike...\n\nPrateik Babbar Reveals His 'Complicated' Family Situation Made Him Consume Drugs At Age 13: 'It...\n\nThe Fairly OddParents: A New Wish OTT Release Date: All About Plot, Cast & Streaming Platform\n\nVivian Dsena's Wife Nouran Aly\nREACTS To Trolls Claiming Actor Consumes Gutka: 'He Imports His...",

Speaking on the Club Prairie Fire Podcast that he co-hosts with legendary Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist, Vaughan said, \u201cYou mention James Anderson, I would not be surprised if Jimmy Anderson ends up at Chennai Super Kings. You heard it here first. They are a team that like someone who can swing it in the first few overs. They had a swinger, be it Shardul Thakur. It would not surprise me if Jimmy Anderson ends up at Chennai.\u201dSpeaking to Sky Sports recently, Anderson said he wants to play cricket again and the 42-year-old added that he has got more to offer.\u201cThat is the whole point of going in the auction, I think, I want to play cricket again. Whether I get picked up or not is a different matter. There is definitely a feeling inside of me that I\u2019ve got more to offer, in some shape or form. So, however long down the line that might be, in whatever capacity that might be I\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d Anderson was quoted by Sky Sports as saying.Anderson added that he has been still bowling even after bidding adieu to international cricket.\u201cBut I am really keen to play.

Narayan Murthy forgot his 25th wedding anniversary; Sudha doesn't cook all: Let's take a look Sudha shared that Narayana's Murthy arrived two hours late to meet her dad. She said, \"He arrived two hours late to meet my father for the first time as his taxi broke down. My father was asking me what he does and other questions. And he came and told him that he wanted to join politics and open an orphanage. My father always thought that I was a prize because at that time not many women did engineering. And he came late thinking he would impress my father,\" she said, sharing that her father was very punctual about time. Joining the conversation, Narayan said, \"I had a little playfulness in me at that time. I was like, 'okay, let him be angry'. I was a little bit adventurous.\" Adding to which Sudha said, \" He was jawaan then...\" He even looked back meeting her for the first time. Narayan said, \"Meeting her was a breath of fresh air. She has always been positive, kind, and very talkative.... She wanted a good listener... So, she was happy and I was happy\". Naryana Murthy confessed he forgot his 25th wedding anniversary as he had a speech to deliver in Mumbai. He said, \"One morning, Sudha asked me, 'Is there anything special today?' I replied, 'No, nothing,' and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, 'Think of anything special today?' I still didn't realize.\" Narayana Murthy's daughter called him to \"hire a private plane..\" and fly back to Bangalore to wish Sudha Murthy. Narayana Murthy got a call from their daughter, Akshata Murthy, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. Murthy shared, \"She asked, 'What are you doing?'

If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!\" Sudha Murthy laughed it off, saying, \"It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn't happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work... For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I'm also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went 'In America this never happens!', but I went 'India main it happens though', who can remember these things??\" Their daughter is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Sudha confessed that she's not a great cook, though Narayana appreciates her efforts in the kitchen regardless. She said,\"Look at his weight, it's because of my cooking! If wives want their husbands to lose weight, they shouldn't cook too well,\" she laughed. When host Kapil Sharma asked if she frequently consults her husband on what he'd like to eat, Sudha said, \"I'm not a cooking expert, so I don't take that risk. I know what he likes, and luckily, he's not a foodie!\" She shared that once she forgot to add salt to a dish. But Narayana didn't complain, instead praised her for taking the time to cook. She added that young men need to learn cooking to share the load at home. She added that opposites attract, \"I have become a workaholic like him and punctual. I never complain about things in life.\" Sudha Murty added, \"All males should learn to do household chores to help their wives.\" Kapil Sharma replied, \"I've just washed the dishes this morning.\" Sudha asked to see his hands. Kapil laughed and said, \"I've washed my hands.\" Sudha said, \"If you had washed dishes, your hands would have shown different lines.

Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you\u2019d know that Ajay is the brand ambassador of an elaichi brand. The actor is often joined by Shah Rukh Khan. Previously, Akshay Kumar was also a part of the brand endorsement.

The Singham Again actor confessed it doesn\u2019t affect him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, in this meme culture, if someone is saying, \u2018Zubaan Kesari,\u2019 how do you does your brain process it?\u201d Ranveer Allahbadia asked Ajay Devgn.

Not only did they hurt someone who I truly love - my mother; they chose to hurt me. They chose not to acknowledge me.

        "text": "Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: As voting day nears, Maharashtra has turned into a political battleground with parties \u2014 national and regional \u2014 slugging it out to woo the electorate. Campaigns have hit new decibels and religion is a poll plank again.\r\n\r\nIn the latest war of words, AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has targeted Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis over his \"vote jihad\" remarks, claiming that the BJP leader's (ideological) ancestors wrote \"love letters\" to Britishers instead of fighting against them.\r\n\r\nDuring a public meeting here on Sunday, Owaisi also alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Ek Hai to Safe Hai\" slogan goes against the diversity ethos.\r\n\r\nFadnavis on Saturday claimed \"vote jihad\" had begun in poll-bound Maharashtra, which should be countered by \"Dharma yuddha\" of vote.\r\n\r\nHe had mentioned the BJP's narrow loss in the Dhule Lok Sabha constituency.\r\n\r\nCountering him, Owaisi said, \"Our ancestors did jihad against Britishers and Fadnavis is now teaching us about jihad. (PM) Narendra Modi, (Union Minister) Amit Shah, and Devendra Fadnavis together cannot defeat me in a debate.\"\r\n\r\nOwaisi claimed the \"dharmayuddha-jihad\" remarks amounted to poll code violation.\r\n\r\n\"From where did 'vote jihad and dharmayuddha' come in democracy? You purchased MLAs; should we call you a thief?\" the Hyderabad MP questioned.\r\n\r\nWhile Fadnavis talks about (vote) jihad, his hero was writing \"love letters\" to Britishers, whereas \"our freedom fighters did not negotiate with the foreign rulers,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We gave the method of fighting against the British. He (Fadnavis) said 'vote jihad' after they (BJP) didn't get votes in Malegaon (during Lok Sabha election). When they fail to get votes, they call it jihad. They lost in Ayodhya. How did that happen\"? Owaisi questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Our ancestors did jihad against Britishers, not yours. Fadnavis, whose ancestors were writing love letters to the British, will teach us jihad?\" he added in a veiled attack on Hindutva ideologues revered by the BJP.\r\n\r\nModi says 'Ek Hai to Safe Hai' because they (BJP) want to end the diversity of this country, the AIMIM leader said, adding the Maratha community was betrayed by rulers who failed to give them reservation.\r\n\r\nOwaisi claimed many industrial projects went to Gujarat but Fadnavis showed no courage to stop them. \"Was he afraid of Narendra Modi?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nReferring to a controversy over Hindutva seer Ramgiri Maharaj's statements, Owaisi said remarks against the Prophet won't be tolerated.\r\n\r\nHe appealed to people to come out to vote on November 20. \"Our victory in Aurangabad will be saluted by the people of India,\" he added.\r\n\r\nOwaisi addressed a public meeting in Jinsi area of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in support of AIMIM candidates Imtiaz Jaleel (Aurangabad East) and Naser Siddiqui (Aurangabad Central) for the November 20 Assembly elections.",

        "text": "Kangana Ranaut was reportedly at the premiere of Saawariya and she did not have a pleasant experience. It has been 17 years since Saawariya released. The Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial was one of the most highly anticipated film of 2007. The hype around the film was massive because it was launching two star kids \u2014 Rishi Kapoor\u2019s son Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor\u2019s daughter Sonam Kapoor. The film also starred Salman Khan in a crucial role and it clashed with Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s Om Shanti Om. \nMuch like most films at the time, Saawariya also had a star-studded premiere with the whose who was present in the room. A new report has claimed that Kangana was also present at the premiere and got into an argument with journalist Subhash K Jha. Writing for Free Press Journal, Subhash K Jha claimed, \u201cThe excitement at the premiere of Saawariya was palpable. Kangana Ranaut was determined to have a showdown with this writer over a miscommunication on the seating arrangement.\u201d News18 Showsha couldn\u2019t verify the claims at the time of reporting. \n\nHowever, he did not delve into his argument. Instead, he added that Rishi and Anil were nervous for their children\u2019s debuts. \u201cI met the two nervous fathers, Anil Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor, of the debutants in the lobby. They seemed more nervous than the debutants themselves. Sonam Kapoor confessed she was \u2018nervous as hell\u2019 while Ranbir told me he wasn\u2019t nervous at all,\u201d he recalled. \nAlthough the film was banked to perform well at the box office, the film did not live up to the expectations. The film not only failed to impress critics but also did not work its magic at the box office. Ranbir and Sonam haven\u2019t worked with Sanjay Leela Bhansali since the film. However, Ranbir has signed the director\u2019s film, Love and War, now. The director and actor have already begun working as well. The film also stars Vicky Kaushal and Alia Bhatt.",

        "text": "One of Kollywood\u2019s most successful directors, S. Shankar, is making his Telugu debut with Game Changer, and industry insiders are closely watching the film\u2019s production and release. \"Many directors and producers are eager to see if Shankar can connect with Telugu audiences on his first attempt,\" says a producer. \"Telugu films have a different sensibility compared to Tamil films, which are often more realistic. Shankar will need to balance both to appeal to the audience, especially Gen Z viewers, who expect a mix of commercial elements.\"There are some concerns after Shankar's last film, Indian 2, failed to impress Telugu audiences. However, producer C Kalyan defends the director, saying, \"This kind of talk happens after every release. People tend to write off big filmmakers and stars after one failure.\" He adds, \"Shankar has had an unmatched 30-year career, and no one else in India has had such a long run of success.\" Kalyan suggests that Indian 2's plot may not have resonated with the audience or aligned with current trends but believes Shankar\u2019s exceptional storytelling, casting, visual spectacle, and music have been a constant strength.Shankar has been a dominant force in both Kollywood and Tollywood since the early '90s, delivering major hits like Gentleman, Premikudu, Indian, Jeans, Aparachitudu, Oke Okkadu, and Robot. Hailed as the uncrowned king of commercial cinema, his versatile talent spans socio-political themes, star-studded casts, grand visuals, and chart-topping music. His collaborations with A.R. Rahman have produced timeless hits, cementing Shankar\u2019s legacy as a visionary director in the Indian film industry.",

        "text": "Movies have often tanked at the box office during initial release, but then have gone on to do well and become classics over time. Hollywood has seen some films like this, which today are considered masterpieces but were huge flops when they first hit the big screens. One such movie came out three decades back and failed to even make its budget. Today we consider it one of the best films ever made. It is hailed by many as the greatest piece of cinema created. Now that is coming a long way from not making a profit thirty years back. The film we speak of is The Shawshank Redemption. When it was released in 1994, it made just $18 million (Rs 1.8 crore) during its first run. The budget was $25 million (Rs 2.5 crore). That was close to a 30% loss. After being nominated for the Oscars, it was re-released in 1995. This time it grossed $73 million (Rs 7.3 crore) which was roughly three times its budget.\nBut the real popularity came thanks to reruns on TV and word of mouth. It became a cult classic in Hollywood and was ranked pretty high on IMDb\u2019s top 250 list. Its IMDb rating of 9.3 is the highest any movie has gotten till done.\nThe Shawshank Redemption stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in pivotal roles. The story is about a man wrongfully convicted of murder who slowly makes peace with himself while in prison. He eventually escapes and tells his friend where to meet him once he gets out.\nThe movie shows a lot about life inside prison and the difficulty for many convicts to adjust to life outside once they are released. Over the years, the film has won hearts and is recommended by people more often than not. Come 2024, it will also be available on OTT.\nMany, in fact, believe that the reason it did not do well initially was because people had a hard time remembering the name. To be fair, it does not come smoothly off the tongue. But now the name is one people will never forget.\nIf you have seen it, good for you, if you have not, what are you waiting for? The movie appeals to the hearts and minds of people of all ages. The odds of not liking this film are minimal and while it is a bit slow, the plot is such that you stay captivated from start to finish.",

        "text": "Rohit Shetty, the mastermind behind Singham Again, sees an epic story arc in Indian cricket player Hardik Pandya\u2019s journey over the past year. Comparing it to the twists and turns of a film, Shetty feels Pandya\u2019s last 12 months would make a gripping cinematic story. From setbacks to stunning comebacks, Hardik Pandya\u2019s tale has all the ingredients of a classic protagonist\u2019s rise against the odds. On Ranveer Allahbadia\u2019s YouTube show, filmmaker Rohit Shetty, talked about Pandya\u2019s emotional rollercoaster, viewing it through the lens of a storyteller.\n\u201cHardik\u2019s last year was nothing short of cinematic,\u201d Shetty said, describing the narrative of being booed only to later bring the nation a win, and return to applause. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a movie\u2014where the hero falls, even as 10,000-20,000 people are jeering. And then, when he comes back to the same stadium, they cheer, and he\u2019s crying. That\u2019s real cinema,\u201d Rohit Shetty, 50, said.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Ranveer Allahbadia (@ranveerallahbadia)\n\nHardik Pandya was appointed captain of the Mumbai Indians (MI) for IPL 2024. He took over from Rohit Sharma, who led the team for a decade. But fans were not thrilled. When he walked out on the Wankhede pitch, MI\u2019s loyal supporters made their displeasure clear with loud boos. The season didn\u2019t go as hoped, with Mumbai finishing at the bottom of the rankings. Battling immense pressure, Pandya found himself struggling with both bat and ball.\nBut fast-forward to the 2024 T20 World Cup celebration at Wankhede, and it was a completely different scene. The same crowd that had once jeered now cheered loudly for Hardik Pandya, who had played a vital role in Team India\u2019s T20 World Cup victory, even bowling the last nerve-wracking over against South Africa. Overwhelmed, Hardik Pandya couldn\u2019t hold back his tears and videos of the moment had gone viral on social media.\n\nNothing but massive respect for you, @HardikPandya7! \ud83e\udee1??\nAfter his recent setbacks, 'Kung fu Pandya' narrates how his unwavering spirit, hard work & belief led to his comeback in the #T20WorldCup! ?\nTune in to watch the entire celebrations, all day long, TODAY, only on Star\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lwxAowAD1A\n\u2014 Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) June 29, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, for Rohit Shetty himself too, this year has brought success as his directorial Singham Again has been pulling huge crowds to theatres. Since its Diwali release, the film\u2019s box office collections have reportedly crossed the 200 crore mark. When Ranveer asked Rohit Shetty how he felt about the movie\u2019s success and his plans for the earnings, the director said, \u201cYes, we are happy, but our minds have already switched on to work mode.\n Asked if he\u2019d thrown a big celebration, Rohit Shetty laughed, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think we even get out of the house if not for work or family. That is our chill.\u201d\nThe director also hinted at his plans to work on sequels of his comedy films like Golmaal and All the Best.",

Speaking at a campaign rally on Sunday, Khan stated, \u201cKaliya Kumaraswamy is more dangerous than the BJP,\u201d a comment that drew severe backlash from Khan's political opponents.The Janata Dal (Secular) [JDS] launched a scathing response, calling for Khan\u2019s dismissal from his ministerial role. Posting on X, the JDS questioned whether Congress would use similar language for other prominent party leaders.\u2014 JanataDal_S (@JanataDal_S) \u201cWhat is the colour of Shri Mallikarjun Kharge, who is a Kannadiga? What is the colour of Priyank Kharge? What is the colour of D K Suresh?\u201d the JDS posted.\u201cWhat difference does it make if a person\u2019s skin is black or white? Such a low-minded person like @BZZameerAhmedK should be immediately removed from the @INCIndia, @INCKarnataka, and @siddaramaiah cabinet.\u201dThe party\u2019s post continued, \u201cThe people of the state will give a fitting response to your words of disrespect and your negative mindset towards people of darker skin colour.\u201dThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also condemned Khan\u2019s remark, with party national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accusing Congress of fostering divisions.\u201cCongress minister Zameer Ahmad calls HD Kumaraswamy as \u2018Kaliya\u2019. This is nafrat ki dukan. First Congress divided on caste, and now on race, like Sam Pitroda did. Sam was given a promotion by Rahul for calling South Indians Africans, and now Rahul will promote Zameer too,\u201d Poonawalla said.",

        "title": "Meghan Markle \u2018Copyrighted\u2019 Lilibet Name Before Birth, Royal Expert Claims",
        "text": "New Delhi, India: A royal expert has revealed that Meghan Markle allegedly \u201ccopyrighted\u201d the name Lilibet before the birth of her daughter, a move that has sparked further controversy. The bombshell claim comes amid allegations that Queen Elizabeth II was deeply angered when Prince Harry and Meghan announced they had been given the late monarch\u2019s permission to name their daughter after her childhood nickname. Lilibet, a nickname that was used affectionately by the Queen\u2019s family, originated when she struggled to pronounce her own name as a child, and was later adopted by her family, including her grandfather, King George V. However, according to royal author Robert Hardman, writing in Charles III: New King, New Court, the Queen was reportedly furious when Harry and Meghan revealed that they had sought her blessing to use the name for their daughter. According to an insider the Queen was \u201cas angry as I\u2019ve ever seen her\u201d after hearing of the Sussexes\u2019 announcement. Though the couple reportedly consulted the monarch, they did not seek formal permission to use the name, a claim later backed by the foreign media, which quoted a Palace source stating that the name had been used without official consent. Everything you need to know about the copyright controversy Angela Levin, a royal biographer and critic of the Sussexes, took the controversy a step further, claiming that Meghan had gone to the lengths of copyrighting the name Lilibet before her daughter's birth. Speaking on the matter, Levin described the couple\u2019s actions as \u201cappalling,\u201d adding that the Queen had been left \u201cfurious\u201d over the situation. When asked by presenter Eamonn Holmes whether Meghan had copyrighted the name, Levin confirmed, saying, \u201cYes,\u201d suggesting that Meghan had taken legal steps to protect the name for personal use, including for business purposes. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's spokesperson had previously maintained that they received confirmation from the Queen regarding the name. However, when the BBC and other outlets reported that the Queen had not granted formal permission, the Sussexes\u2019 lawyers sent legal letters disputing the claim and accusing the media of defamation. The naming of Lilibet has become a symbol of the growing rift between Harry, Meghan, and the rest of the royal family. Following the birth of their daughter in California on June 4, 2021, the Sussexes were quick to announce the name, which some saw as a gesture of homage to the late Queen. However, the lack of clarity surrounding whether the Queen had given her blessing, and the subsequent revelation about the copyright, has only added fuel to the ongoing royal drama. According to Hardman\u2019s account, the Queen was deeply hurt by the use of her childhood nickname in such a public manner, telling aides that while she did not \"own the palaces or the paintings,\" her name was one thing that was entirely hers. \"And now they\u2019ve taken that,\" she was reportedly quoted as saying.",

Chunky Panday \u2018liked\u2019 a post on social media that threw shade at Ananya and Aditya\u2019s contract for an eyewear brand lasting beyond their relationship. Chunky Panday has left the internet in splits.\nA meme recently went viral on social media after Chunky Panday allegedly \u2018liked\u2019 it. The post read, \u201cWhen the brand\u2019s contract lasts longer than the relationship.\u201d The image featured Ananya Panday and Aditya Roy Kapur promoting an eyewear brand. Check out the viral post here:\nChunky Panday throwing shade at Aditya-Ananya relationship \nbyu/Cautiousoptimist909 inBollyBlindsNGossip\n\nAnanya and Aditya reportedly dated for nearly two years before calling it quits. Ananya Panday and Aditya Roy Kapur\u2019s breakup rumours made headlines in April after the actress shared a cryptic note on her Instagram stories which read, \u201cIf it is truly meant for you, it will come back to you. It will leave only for the sake of teaching you the lessons you could only learn on your own. If it is truly meant for you, it will return even if you\u2019ve pushed it away, even if you\u2019re in denial, even if you assume something so beautiful could never be truly yours \u2013 because if it\u2019s truly meant for you, it is never not a piece of you. It is never not intricately tied into the depths of your soul.\u201d\nLater, a close friend of the two actors told the Bombay Times, \u201cThey broke up almost a month ago. They were going quite well, and the breakup came as a shock to all of us. They are cordial with each other. Ananya is trying to move on; of course, there\u2019s hurt. She is spending time with her new furry friend. Aditya is also trying to deal with the situation maturely.\u201d\nHowever, it should also be noted that Ananya and Aditya have not reacted to their breakup rumours. They also never explicitly spoke about their relationship either. After their breakup, Ananya and Aditya continued to fulfil their brand commitments and Aditya even featured in a beverage ad with Chunky, leaving the internet divided.",

So many people said it. Nothing was ever good enough for her.\"Reports indicate that a senior aide confronted Meghan about her behavior, noting that it was causing difficulties for the staff. Meghan allegedly responded with a seven-word retort: \"It's not my job to coddle people.\"These allegations came to light as early as 2017, during the Sussexes' engagement. In October 2018, Jason Knauf, who previously served as communications secretary for the Cambridges and Sussexes, sent an email containing serious bullying allegations against Meghan.Knauf indicated he had obtained numerous accounts from individuals who had observed \"unacceptable behaviour\" by Meghan directed at a staff member, OK Magazine UK reported. The former television actress strongly refuted these claims.Meghan's closest friends and former acting colleagues also refused these claims, insisting they do not align with the \"kind\" person they know and love.A friend of the Suit actress told Bazaar.com: \"I hate to say it, but find me a woman of color in a senior position who has not been accused of being too angry, too scary... in the workplace.\"\"Let's just call this what it is - a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation. We are disappointed to see this defamatory portrayal of the Duchess of Sussex given credibility by a media outlet, a spokesperson for Meghan and Harry said The Mirror US reported.\"It's no coincidence that distorted several year old accusations aimed at undermining the duchess are being briefed to the British media shortly before she and the duke are due to speak openly and honestly about their experience of recent years,\u201d the spokesperson added.Jessica Mulroney, who shares a close relationship with Meghan took to social media and said: \"I don't know that anyone has ever had to deal with the pressure, the politics and the press like this woman. In the face of it all, I have never seen her waver from kindness, empathy, and love.\"Robert, who serves as a historical consultant for Netflix's The Crown, has chronicled various conflicts within the Royal household in his publication, with details accounting back to 2017, documenting numerous instances of internal tensions.",

        "text": "Has Khushi Kapoor made her relationship official with Vedang Raina? This question is on everyone\u2019s mind after fans spotted Khushi wearing a bracelet with Vedang\u2019s name on it in her tropical vacation photo dump. However, it is unclear in the photo whether Khushi\u2019s bracelet spells out Vedang\u2019s name.\nFans suspect that Khushi Kapoor has made her relationship official with Vedang Raina by wearing a bracelet that spelt out his name. Interestingly, Janhvi Kapoor also made her relationship with Shikhar Pahariya official by wearing a necklace with his name on it.\nCheck out Khushi\u2019s photos here:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by \u1d0b\u029c\u1d1cs\u029c\u026a \u1d0b\u1d00\u1d18\u1d0f\u1d0f\u0280 (@khushikapoor)\n\nRumours of Khushi Kapoor and Vedang Raina\u2019s alleged relationship have been floating on social media ever since they starred in Zoya Akhtar\u2019s film The Archies. While the pair has neither confirmed nor denied the speculations, they are often spotted together on various occasions. Recently, eagle-eyed fans noticed similarities in Khushi and Vedang\u2019s vacation pictures. The two did not post pictures of each other on their Instagram accounts, but the similar background of their posts made people believe that they were vacationing together.\nEarlier this year, Khushi Kapoor addressed her dating rumours with Vedang Raina in an interaction with Karan Johar on his chat show Koffee With Karan. When the filmmaker confronted her saying, \u201cConjecture goes that you are dating Vedang Raina,\u201d she responded with a witty answer. Khushi told him, \u201cYou know that scene in Om Shanti Om where there\u2019s a row of people just saying, \u2018Om and I were just good friends\u2019?\u201d\nHowever, in August, Vedang said in a chat with GQ that he had kept his dating life on the back burner to focus on his career. Vedang Raina told GQ, \u201cMy dating life right now is taking a back seat because I\u2019m focused on my career. I\u2019m clear about my priorities and want to keep these two aspects of my life separate. I\u2019m enjoying where I am, and there\u2019s a lot more I want to achieve. It\u2019s not that dating would necessarily hinder me, but it can become a major part of your life. So I\u2019m choosing to stay mindful of that and concentrate on what\u2019s most important.\u201d\nMeanwhile, on their work fronts, Vedang Raina was most recently seen opposite Alia Bhatt in the film Jigra. Whereas his rumoured girlfriend Khushi Kapoor has been roped in for Naadaniyaan, alongside Ibrahim Ali Khan.",

        "text": "Aishwarya Rai has long captivated audiences around the world, enchanting fans with both her remarkable talent and timeless beauty. Often hailed as \u201cone of the most beautiful women in the world,\u201d Aishwarya first gained international recognition by winning the Miss World pageant in 1994 before diving into a celebrated career in cinema. However, her journey has not been without its challenges. Like many prominent actresses, Aishwarya has faced her share of criticism, with misogynistic remarks attempting to belittle her appearance, physique, and acting abilities. She has, however, consistently risen above the negativity, paying no attention to detractors and continuing to thrive in the industry. On one occasion, though, her husband Abhishek Bachchan stood up in her defense, addressing those who label her \u201cplastic.\u201d\n\u201cActually if you go to see\u2026 and now I\u2019m not speaking like a husband, I\u2019m speaking as a co-star and an actor\u2026 she happens to have done some of the most daring kind of roles, that an actor, who\u2019s basically meant to have been known only for her beauty, could have done,\u201d Abhishek asserted in an interview with BBC Asian Network, as reported by Times of India. He went on to cite films such as Jag Mundhra\u2019s Provoked (2006), Rituparno Ghosh\u2019s Chokher Bali (2003), Raincoat (2004), and Mani Ratnam\u2019s Guru (2007) to highlight her diverse and courageous choice of roles. Abhishek\u2019s words encouraged the public to see Aishwarya as not just a beauty icon, but as a multifaceted talent worthy of respect and recognition.\nAishwarya began her acting career with a dual role in Mani Ratnam\u2019s epic political drama Iruvar (1997), which set the stage for her impressive career. Her contributions to Indian cinema have not gone unnoticed; in 2009, she was awarded the Padma Shri by the Indian government, and in 2012, she received the prestigious Order of Arts and Letters from the French government. Most recently, she appeared in the Ponniyin Selvan films, where her performance won her several accolades and reaffirmed her acting prowess.\nAmid her professional success, rumors have recently circulated about potential challenges in Aishwarya and Abhishek\u2019s marriage of 17 years. The couple, however, has chosen to remain silent on the matter, maintaining a dignified stance. Speculation intensified after they appeared separately for the media at a recent high-profile Ambani family wedding \u2014 Aishwarya with their daughter Aaradhya, while Abhishek posed with the Bachchan family, including his parents, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, his sister Shweta Bachchan, and her family.",

        "text": "Rockstar completes 13 years today. There are several ways the movie and its music changed Indian cinema. The most fascinating narrative that hangs out from the making of the film is that of Ranbir Kapoor, who went out of the way to embody Janardan Jakhar. This transformative experience includes his stay at the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi. For the qawwali scene in the song Kun Faya Kun, Kapoor stayed for nearly two days in Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah. Rich in spiritual atmosphere and vivid qawwali performances, this shrine allowed Kapoor to receive insight into the cultural and spiritual components reflected in the film.\nDuring his stay, Ranbir Kapoor was able to relate to the spirit behind the song, which in fact pursues the divine purpose. In a 2011 interview with the Hindustan Times, Ranbir himself called the experience \u201cextremely spiritual\u201d. \nKun Faya Kun, produced by A.R. Rahman with lyrics from Irshad Kamil, became one of the most appreciated tracks of the Rockstar album. \nInitially, there were concerns regarding the religious tone of this song, Imtiaz Ali, who directed the movie, told Ranveer Allahbadia on his podcast. But the trio \u2013 Imtiaz Ali, A.R. Rahman and Irshad Kamil \u2013 decided to include it in the movie after due consultations concerning the fact that it was sensitive.\nIt was sung by Mohit Chauhan, Javed Ali and A R Rahman himself contributed to it. The dynamics of the lyrics and musical tune of Rockstar have made it a cult classic.\nMeanwhile, Kapoor\u2019s devotion was not restricted to his stay at the Dargah. He also went to live with a Jat family for several days so that he could better understand how grounded his character was. Such deep involvement enabled him to get a richer insight into the details of Janardan Jakhar\u2019s opportunities and challenges, reports Pink Villa. More so, Kapoor worked very hard to master the guitar in order to look real on the screen.\nThe film was released on November 11, 2011, and has set a benchmark in the Indian film industry. It was further re-released in May 2024 and earned more than Rs 5.65 crores, Pink Villa adds. \nIn an earlier interview with Indian Express, Imtiaz Ali revealed his interpretation of Janardan Jakhar saying the character was more of a \u201cnon-cerebral.\u201d He added that upon rewatching the film, some of Janardan\u2019s actions may seem illogical but they are a way of capturing his free spirit.",

The superstar donned a blue shirt with dark pants.

In an old interview, Simi Garewal asked Gauri Khan if Shah Rukh Khan shared the pregnancy experience with her. Gauri said that Shah Rukh tried very hard. Recalling the time Gauri went into labour, Shah Rukh said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how a woman reacts when she goes into labour. I had heard that you\u2019re supposed to breathe with her, but she wasn\u2019t breathing. Yeah, she was screaming very strangely, nothing like how they show in films.\u201d\nGauri said, \u201cI hardly had any labour pain because I had a Caesarean.\u201d Shah Rukh added, \u201cThen they went for the Caesarean and it was very stupid because I was like when the baby\u2019s coming out, you\u2019re supposed to breathe. I didn\u2019t know that it didn\u2019t matter with a Caesarean. I was still breathing like that.\u201d\nRecalling the time of Aryan\u2019s delivery, Gauri said, \u201cHe was nearly pulling the baby out. The doctors were like, \u2018Let us do our work.'\u201d Shah Rukh said, \u201cI went in with my mask and everything and took the baby out. I saw the incision and everything, though she told me not to see it. I really enjoyed the moment. I\u2019m not trying to sound morbid or gruesome, but the sight of this, nature\u2019s colours of even redness of the blood or blue parts there or yellow fat, it\u2019s so translucent. It\u2019s not at all gruesome. You\u2019ll never see colours like that in your life.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Aryan will soon make his debut as a director with his web series based on the reality of the Hindi entertainment industry.",

Talking to India Today, the RRR actor had said that the audience has become quite negative these days. On Devara BO numbers \"We, as an audience, have become very negative these days. We are not able to enjoy a film in an innocent manner anymore,\" he said. \"I wonder why we are not able to be that innocent anymore? Every film today, we are watching it to analyse. We are all constantly judging, analysing, and overthinking about films. Maybe our exposure to cinema has made us like this,\" he further added. Janhvi's acting brilliance However, when it came to Janhvi Kapoor, Jr NTR had some of the best things to say. He recalled how there was unpredictability and fear of dance and acting before she gave her first shot. However, once the cameras started rolling, Janhvi just killed it. \"The first shot, she came and she gave. She just killed it. With so much pressure, it was a delight seeing her open up on camera,\" he told a website in an interview. When and where to watch Devara part 1 is now available for streaming on OTT giant Netflix. But, there is a catch. The film has now released just in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada only. The film is expected to be launched for the Hindi audience later or on some other platform.",

        "text": "Recently, Vivo finally launched its long-awaited X200 series. This is a landmark for the company in their search for new frontiers in smartphone technology. This innovation in design, better performance, and amazing camera upgrade, Vivo X200 series is sure to capture the hearts of both tech-savvy and casual users.\n\nSleek and Modern Design and Display\n\nThe Vivo X200 series is more mature, premium build quality with an aesthetic design. They are sleek, light in weight, and available in several sophisticated colors, such as Cosmic Black, Arctic Blue, and Midnight Silver. The X200 series is built around an amazing AMOLED display, which delivers vibrant colors and deep blacks for the most immersive viewing experience ever. The X200 Pro comes with a 6.7-inch curved display with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it a smooth navigator and great for fluid gameplay. The standard X200 model comes with a slightly smaller but still impressive 6.5-inch display.\n\nBoth the devices sport an in-display fingerprint scanner along with ultra-thin bezel design, which makes them look beautiful and feel great in hand. Additionally, their IP68-rated water and dust resistance features are included so as to give durability to their premium design.\n\nPerformance, Power, Speed and Efficiency\n\nUnder the hood, the Vivo X200 series is equipped with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, bringing premium performance to both variants. It pairs this heavy-duty processor with up to 12GB of RAM and internal storage up to 512GB. This sets the ground for each user to multitask without hesitation and store large amounts of data without compromising on speed and efficiency.\n\nThe X200 Pro makes a great product for mobile gamers who love high-performance applications. It comes with a 5000mAh battery, fast charging 120W that promises to fully charge the phone in under 30 minutes, which eliminates downtime and keeps a person connected all day long.\n\nPhotography and Videography Excellence\n\nThe camera setup on the X200 is the most spectacular feature from the camera-centric series by Vivo. On the standard model, while the similar ultra-wide lenses and 50MP telephoto setup complement a camera system similar to that featured on the top-end model but with less advanced, carrying a slightly reduced resolution to 64MP for this primary lens.\n\nA signature Gimbal Stabilization 2.0 system within Vivo ensures very stable shots, regardless of conditions, combined with amazing computational photography from enhanced AI capabilities, making it suitable for stills and video capture. Video recording, including 8K capabilities, means content capture at high-quality levels is always quite easy.\n\nSmooth Software Experience\n\nOn the software front, X200 series comes with Android 14 and is running on Vivo\u2019s Funtouch OS 15. That brings to you a clean and intuitive interface with plenty of options for personalisation. That seems to have improved their privacy feature, be better than previous task managers, and has more AI capabilities that give smarter interaction with devices.\n\nNew Benchmark\n\nThe X200 series indeed remains a Vivo push for innovation in smartphone form and functionality. Whether photography, gaming, or an all-around premium smartphone, the X200 series delivers well-balanced performance, design, and cutting-edge features in its package. As Vivo remains one of the leaders in mobile technology, the X200 series is evidence of such dedication towards new-age top-tier smartphones in global markets.",

        "text": "Dubbed as one of the most promising young Indian cricketers, Prithvi Shaw celebrates his 25th birthday today, November 9. Prithvi started his professional journey as one of the brightest prospects in the game. He drew several comparisons with Sachin Tendulkar due to his unique playing style. Despite all the hype, Prithvi failed to deliver on an individual level with unimpressive showings in the limited outings he had in international cricket.\nALSO READ: \u2018Even Legends Like Don Bradman Experienced Being Dropped\u2026\u2019: Greg Chappell Writes Letter To Prithvi Shaw\nMoreover, his career was marred with several controversies which further ruined his prospect of representing the national side on the biggest stages. On his special day, let\u2019s take a look at some of his best knocks, his career statistics and the controversies around him.\nCareer Stats\nPrithvi Shaw featured in five Tests, six ODIs and one T20I for India. He scored 339 Test runs and 189 ODI runs. He also had several opportunities to prove his mettle in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Prithvi has played seven seasons in the franchise tournament. He featured in 79 matches while adding 1892 runs.\nTop 5 knocks\n134 vs West Indies, 2018\nAlmost six years ago, Prithvi Shaw scored his maiden international century against the West Indies. The Indian batter contributed towards India\u2019s dominant victory as she scored a quick 154-ball 134 in Rajkot. He smashed 19 boundaries and won the Player of the Match award.\n99 vs Kolkata Knight Riders, 2019\nPrithvi Shaw fell one run short of his first-ever IPL ton in 2019 at the Feroz Shah Kotla (now Arun Jaitley Stadium). Competing against the Kolkata Knight Riders, Prithvi smashed a 55-ball 99 before losing being dismissed by Lockie Ferguson. He departed hitting 12 boundaries and three sixes.\n82 vs Kolkata Knight Riders, 2021\nPrithvi Shaw proved to be a nightmare for the Kolkata Knight Riders once again in 2021. He led a successful chase for the Delhi Capitals, scoring a 41-ball 82. He scored 11 fours and three sixes as Delhi won the fixture by seven wickets.\n66 vs Mumbai Indians, 2024\nPrithvi Shaw\u2019s most recent terrific performance came during the 2024 edition of the IPL. In a Delhi Capitals shirt, Prithvi scored 66 runs facing 40 deliveries while chasing a massive target of 234. He smashed eight fours and three sixes. His knock was eventually shadowed by his teammate Tristan Stubbs who scored a 25-ball 71.\n66 vs Kolkata Knight Riders, 2020\nKolkata Knight Riders faced the wrath of Prithvi Shaw on another occasion in 2020. The Indian batter had hit a quick-fire 41-ball 66. He scored four boundaries and four sixes. His heroics proved crucial as Delhi won the fixture by 18 runs.\nControversies\nIn February last year, Prithvi Shaw was caught up in a heated situation after allegedly denying a selfie to his fans.\nAhead of the 2022 IPL, it was mandated by the National Cricket Academy (NCA) that all centrally contracted players were to undergo a Yo-Yo fitness test. It was applicable to every player regardless of their health or injury status. Prithvi Shaw took part in the test but did not receive a clearance.\nDuring the 2019 edition of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Prithvi Shaw\u2019s reputation was ruined by a harmless cough syrup. Traces of a substance banned in WADA\u2019s illegal substances list, terbutaline, were found in his samples.\nAs per the norms, Prithvi received an eight-month ban from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for violating the doping regulations.",

        "text": "Back in the day, Rishi Kapoor couldn\u2019t help but laugh about all the fun that unfolded on the sets of his debut film Bobby (1973). Dimple Kapadia, fresh into the industry, would roll onto the set in a fancy imported car. Meanwhile, Rishi, just starting out at 16, had a very different experience. He joked about how Amitabh Bachchan, filming Bombay To Goa on a nearby floor, would tease him about Dimple\u2019s glamorous arrival. While Dimple had her posh ride, Amitabh Bachchan would show up in a humble Fiat, and Rishi had a \u201ctooti footi\u201d version of the same car. \nTalking to The Movie Moth, Rishi Kapoor had said, \u201cWhen we were working for the film, Dimple used to come in a huge imported car. Around the same time, Amitabh Bachchan was shooting for Bombay To Goa on the adjacent floor. And we had just met, so he used to say, \u2018Your heroine comes in a huge car.\u2019 Those days, Amit ji used to come in a fiat and we also had a tooti footi fiat.\u201d\nRishi Kapoor, known for teasing his co-stars, shared how he used to poke fun at Dimple Kapadia for her fancy imported car. He recalled, \u201cWe used to rag Dimple. And she used to tell us, \u2018I am Raj Kapoor\u2019s heroine, I am a star. If the film becomes hit, I am a star and even if not, I am still a star. I travel in a huge car.\u2019 Now that I look back, I think she was right, She is a star.\u201d\nBoth Neetu Singh and Dimple Kapadia reportedly auditioned for the lead role in Bobby. However, Raj Kapoor ultimately chose Dimple. According to film analyst Dilip Thakur, Neetu\u2019s mother, Raaji, wanted her daughter to be launched as the film\u2019s lead, but Raj Kapoor turned her down since Neetu had already worked as a child artist in a few films.",

        "title": "Setting fitness goals: Key to success with your trainer",
        "text": "Irv Rubenstein holds a doctorate in exercise science and has run a personal fitness training studio for 35 years in Nashville, Tennessee. Obviously, he speaks positively about the benefits of using a personal trainer, and this goes for grizzled-gym goers as well as beginners. \u201cMost anybody can teach you how to do a bicep curl,\u201d Rubenstein said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut only a few people can tell you how to do it if your shoulder\u2019s hurting.\u201d It can be a maze finding the trainer who is best for you, Rubenstein acknowledged. How much should credentials and education matter, or are personality and motivational skills more important? What about the cost? And how frequently should you use a personal trainer? These are just a few of the questions anyone who is searching for a trainer should ask. \u201cHow do you discern who is best?\u201d Rubenstein asked. \u201cThat which works best for you is the best. But finding that is the challenge Education and credentials In the United States \u2014 and in many other countries \u2014 there is no national or local government body that licenses trainers. Certification is typically issued by private entities, some more respected than others and many are in the business of generating income more than credibility. The American College of Sports Medicine is the best known in the United States. In Canada, it\u2019s the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine. \u201cYou probably should ask if the person is certified,\u201d said Rubenstein, who runs STEPS Fitness. \u201cI think that\u2019s valuable, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s essential. And you should ask about academic training.\u201d He also issued a caveat. \u201cIf a person is getting all their information off the internet \u2014 to the extent you can discern that \u2014 I would avoid that person,\u201d he said of a potential trainer. Personality and motivation Guy Andrews runs Exercise ETC. out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Like Rubenstein, he says trainers and clients have to jibe. Credentials are important, but a personality match is essential. \u201cPrimarily, it\u2019s a service relationship,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cSo, first you have to bond with the trainer. You\u2019ve got to like them. The personality of me is paramount. I don\u2019t care how well qualified someone is, how well educated they are. If you cannot enjoy working with them, the relationship is doomed to fail.\u201d Asking friends or gym operators for referrals could be helpful in your search. A good benchmark for a successful relationship is how many years has the referrer spent with their trainer? \u201cIf clients have been with a trainer for eight or 10 years, that\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cLooking good in a tank top is not enough.\u201d Rubenstein injected another truth and laughed: \u201cMost people who are working with a trainer for any length of time will tell you they are the best.\u201d Another good sign when rating trainers is whether they offer a \u201cnon-contractual relationship.\u201d Meaning, you would not lose money if you discontinue the service. \u201cThen you have a trainer with integrity and confidence and probably the skills to help you,\u201d Rubenstein said. There is also a trainer\u2019s style of motivation to consider. Rubenstein repeatedly said the quality of \u201ccompassion\u201d was key in choosing the right person. But some may want a basic training drill sergeant to push them. \u201cThe rah-rah military attitude might work for the young, the very fit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for the average person that type of behavior might not be motivating or stimulating.\u201d What\u2019s the price? Price is difficult to pin down. Costs vary by country and within countries by geographic region. In the United States you might pay $100-150 per hour in larger cities, maybe $50-75 in other areas. Rubenstein also said the cost compared favorably with manicures and similar personal-care services. The cost can be prohibitive for some, Rubenstein said. It often eliminates the young and might favor older clients who have more spending power and need the service more. \u201cIt weeds out the people who would like a trainer from those who need one,\u201d he said. How often with a trainer? Andrews and Rubenstein said that beginners should meet with a trainer two or three times per week for the first six weeks. After that, once a week might be enough, or even once or twice a month for maintenance and evaluation. \u201cIn terms of motivation, for the average person I don\u2019t believe once a week is enough at the start,\u201d Andrews said. Rubenstein elaborated: \u201cIf a person is not accustomed to being in a gym, not comfortable with it or not feeling safe, twice a week with a trainer is a basic routine that will give them benefits \u2014 muscular, cardiovascular, balance, etc. Once they learn it, a person can go once a week or once a month. But that means they have to be motivated.\u201d Setting goals So, you\u2019ve found your trainer and are ready to get to work. Now what? Set some goals. There are...",

        "text": "Kareena Kapoor\u2019s youthful glow and flawless skin have made her a beauty icon for many. She has, time and again, shared that her timeless radiance is due to a simple yet effective diet and skincare routine. Want to achieve a similar glow? In a 2018 interview with Vogue India, she revealed her \u201ctop three unbreakable skin commandments\u201d along with her morning routine for luminous skin. Let\u2019s explore the beauty secrets that keep her looking effortlessly ageless.\nKareena Kapoor\u2019s morning routine is refreshingly simple: she starts her day with a serving of fresh fruit and a large glass of room-temperature water.\nWhen asked about her diet and \u2018unbreakable skin commandments,\u2019 Kareena emphasised that a balanced diet is essential for glowing skin. She explained, \u201cI feel when you\u2019re well-nourished, you feel happy, and it shows on your skin. Strict diets often lead to binge eating, which can cause breakouts. Stick to three wholesome meals, or even four\u2014healthy, satisfying food that brings you joy.\u201d\nHer top three skincare rules are straightforward but powerful: First, never sleep with makeup on; second, drink at least three litres of water daily; and finally, always keep your moisturiser close by, no matter where you are in the world.\nIn the same conversation, Kareena also shared her go-to remedy for breakouts. She suggested that dabbing a bit of toothpaste on the affected area can sometimes work wonders.\nDuring the interview, the beauty also shared a skincare home remedy she and her family swear by. The actor said, \u201cAlmond oil\u2014on a lazy day at home we just soak ourselves up in it! A combination of that and yoghurt is great for the face too, if you have dry skin.\u201d\nWhen discussing her skincare routine, Kareena emphasised her minimalist approach to products, focusing on essentials rather than an elaborate regimen. \u201cMy skin tends to be on the dryer side, so I always have my moisturiser handy,\u201d she explained. She also shared her nightly ritual of applying a night cream to help repair her skin and incorporating a hydrating mask once a week.\nFor warmer days, she likes to spritz her face with mist to stay refreshed. Kareena also underscored the importance of hydration, both inside and out: \u201cI drink at least three litres of water every day. No matter where I am, hydration is my mainstay,\u201d she concluded.",

        "text": "Is BLACKPINK\u2019s Jisoo planning a grand return to the music scene this December? Well, fans hoping for another solo hit will have to wait a bit longer. According to her agency, BLISSOO, Jisoo isn\u2019t preparing for a solo comeback but is instead focussing on her acting career. The singer-turned-actress has set her sights on the screen and is reportedly preparing for upcoming projects rather than music. The rumours of Jisoo\u2019s December 2025 solo comeback had quickly made waves, with some reports even claiming that her new music was in its final stages. However, BLISSOO was quick to clear the air on November 8, with a representative saying, \u201cJisoo\u2019s solo comeback reports are not true.\u201d\n\u201cThe artist intends to focus on her acting career,\u201d BLISSOO stated, according to Allkpop. Although this may be a letdown for those who were waiting for her solo music, especially after the success of her single FLOWER. At present, Jisoo is working hard to keep fans engaged with her ventures in the acting world.\n\nJust recovered from my dental procedure today \ud83e\udd15 and I came back really excited reading all these things about a Jisoo comeback & then a news claiming that's it's not true? WHAT ?\n\u2014 sui (MANTRA) (@suiJENNIEris) November 8, 2024\n\nAfter parting ways with YG Entertainment in 2023 alongside her BLACKPINK sisters, Jisoo launched her own agency, BLISSOO. Since then, she has been prioritising her film and drama projects over music, building an impressive filmography.\nJisoo recently completed her first film project, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint, a screen adaptation of Sing Shong\u2019s web novel. Set to release in the summer of 2025, the film will see Jisoo alongside top actors Lee Min Ho, Ahn Hyo Seop and Chae Soo Bin. Fans eagerly anticipate her big-screen debut, which promises to show yet another dimension of her talents.\n\nJisoo during Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint script reading pic.twitter.com/m28gQHWEwz\n\u2014 jisoo (@jisoogaIIery) January 23, 2024\n\nJISOO as Lee Jihye on \u2018Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint\u2019 this summer of 2025! pic.twitter.com/wvUbR5d7WX\n\u2014 jisoo (@jisoogaIIery) May 28, 2024\n\n#JISOO will play the role Lee Ji-hye in the web novel movie \u201cOmniscient Reader's Viewpoint\u201d \nAbout the movie: Dokja was an average office worker whose sole interest was reading his favorite web novel 'Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse.'

        "title": "Actresses embrace maternal roles, Samantha joins bandwagon",
        "text": "In a notable shift in the Indian entertainment industry, several popular actresses are now taking on mother roles, adding depth to their filmographies and breaking traditional on-screen stereotypes. Samantha Ruth Prabhu, for instance, steps into her first maternal role in the Hindi web series Citadel: Honey Bunny. She joins Tamannaah, who portrayed a mother in her recent release Baak (titled Aranmanai 4 in Tamil). The trend continues with Anushka Shetty, who recently played a mother-to-be in Miss Shetty Mr Polishetty, encouraging more actresses to explore mature roles.Director Hemanth Madhukar believes these shifts reflect the actresses' versatility. \u201cTamannaah, known for her glamour in songs like Kaavaala and Aaj Ki Raat, took on the mother role in Aranmanai 4 because it fit her character in the sequel. Anushka Shetty, famed for diverse roles, also embraced a maternal character with conviction, showing that top actresses can handle these roles with grace and credibility,\u201d he explained.Producer Lagadapati Sridhar acknowledges that some actresses are hesitant about accepting mother roles, fearing it might alter their \"lover girl\" image and limit their opportunities for glam-centric or romantic roles. However, he sees positive changes driven largely by the expansion of OTT platforms, which have reshaped the boundaries of casting and storytelling. \u201cYoung actresses like Keerthy Suresh, Neha Shetty, and Shraddha Srinath have redefined these roles, showing that playing a mother can be just another powerful character. For instance, Shruti Haasan took on a maternal role in Krack, Keerthy Suresh delivered a remarkable performance in Mahanati, and Neha Shetty impressed audiences in Gangs of Godavari.\u201dEchoing this sentiment, actress Priyamani, who played a mother in The Family Man series, believes the stereotype is outdated. \u201cYears ago, actresses were cautious about being typecast as on-screen mothers, but now filmmakers are creating layered, interesting roles that are too compelling to ignore,\u201d she said. Priyamani added that, while she enjoyed her role in The Family Man, she will continue to choose roles that add to her growth as an artist.Director Hemanth Madhukar provided further context, pointing out that even established male stars are open to father roles. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Chiranjeevi play a father in Daddy, Venkatesh in Saindhav, and Nani in Hi Nanna and Jersey. With heroes like Vishwak Sen embracing fatherhood in Gangs of Godavari, actresses like Shruti Haasan, Nayantara, and Neha Shetty are also showing they\u2019re game for these kinds of roles,\u201d he noted.This new trend signals a refreshing shift in the industry, allowing actresses to broaden their roles and audiences to experience richer, more dynamic portrayals of family and relationships on screen.",

        "text": "Arbaaz Khan and Malaika Arora\u2019s son Arhaan Khan is celebrating his 22nd birthday today, November 9. To commemorate the special occasion, his doting mother shared a post on her Instagram account along with a sweet, heartfelt note for her \u201cbaby boy\u201d. Malaika\u2019s post featured several throwback pictures of her and Arhaan from over the years. The first picture was taken when Arhaan was a child. Malaika lovingly wrapped her son around her arms, and the mother-son duo flaunted their brightest smiles while posing for the camera.\nIn the next picture, a grown-up Arhaan was seen taking a stroll with his mother amidst beautiful autumn scenery. Following this, Malaika included a collage where her baby boy was seen swimming, and in another glimpse, she held him in her arms. The actress concluded her post with a single picture of Arhaan playing with their furbaby.\nSharing the post, Malaika wrote, \u201cHappy birthday, my baby boy, mama loves u the mostesttttttttttttttt @iamarhaankhan\u201d, and included several red heart emojis.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Malaika Arora (@malaikaaroraofficial)\n\nFollowing Malaika\u2019s post, many of her friends and fans started penning down their heartfelt birthday wishes for her son. Seema Sajdeh said, \u201cHappy birthday, my Arhaan,\u201d while Sussanne Khan wrote, \u201cHappy birthday Arhaan.\u201d Saba Pataudi added, \u201cHappy Birthday to a lucky son who has you for his mum,\u201d and Sophie Choudry penned, \u201cAww the pics. Happy bday @iamarhaankhan .. Biggest hug.\u201d\nSpeaking of Arhaan Khan, he recently hosted a six-part podcast titled Dumb Biryani with his friends Dev Raiyani and Arush Verma. The podcast featured guests like both his parents, Arbaaz Khan and Malaika Arora, along with Sohail Khan and the social media sensation Orhan Awatramani, aka Orry, among others.\nIn other news, Malaika Arora, who was previously married to Arbaaz Khan for almost two decades, parted ways with him in 2017. She then got into a relationship with Bollywood actor Arjun Kapoor. Initially, the couple kept their relationship under wraps but later launched it through Instagram. Arjun and Malaika dated for nearly six years before parting ways just recently.\nThe Singham Again actor confirmed their breakup while he was attending a Diwali party. He revealed that he had been single. While Arjun has spoken about the breakup, Malaika has refrained from sharing anything about the same. However, her cryptic Instagram posts since the confirmation of their breakup have caught people\u2019s attention.",

He also revealed that he knew Simmba was going to rock when he saw the final edit, saying it was evident the film would take things to another level.\n\nYes, you read that right! In an interview with Mashable India, Rohit Shetty shared his thoughts on Simmba and said, \"I think the most lovable is Simmba.\" (I think Simmba is the most lovable). \n\nWhen it was mentioned that Simmba was a crack, he replied, \"Aesa nahi hai ki it was a surprise for us. Jab hum ne final edit bhi dekha toh it was like jab second hald Simmba aayega toh film alag level pe chalega. (We knew that. It wasn\u2019t a surprise for us. When we saw the final edit, we knew that once the second half of Simmba kicked in, the film would take things to another level).\" \n\nIt was then pointed out that Ranveer Singh got all the best lines in Simmba, Rohit Shetty chuckled and added, \"Woh mera thoda favorite bhi hai. (It's actually my little favorite too).\" \n\nIn a recent exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, Rohit Shetty addressed fan questions, including one from a Simmba enthusiast asking if a sequel or a Simmba appearance in the Golmaal universe was on the cards. Laughing, the director joked, \"That will become too much. Mere pe taras khao. (Have mercy on me). This universe coming here, that universe going there. Simmba will happen, obviously; it\u2019s one of the most loved characters in the cop universe.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cBut as I said, we\u2019ll concentrate on comedy first and then come back to it, because constantly making cop films since Simmba in 2018 might be too much for the audience as well.\" \n\nSimmba, directed by Rohit Shetty, stars Ranveer Singh as Sangram Bhalerao, a police officer with a questionable moral compass who is transformed after a life-changing event. Paired with Sara Ali Khan, the film combines thrilling action sequences with a deep dive into moral conflicts.\nALSO READ: EXCLUSIVE: Is Rohit Shetty planning a standalone Chulbul Pandey Vs Singham film with Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn?

We used to stay in a one-room kitchen, one-bedroom hall. One day, papa said, \u2018Let\u2019s go for a walk\u2019. When we went downstairs, it was the first time we spoke openly.

How is it possible?\u2019 So, I eventually reached the sets at around 6:10 AM, and he ended up scolding me in front of the entire unit.

Earlier in a conversation with Siddharth Kanan, Vidhu Vinod Chopra revealed a fight with Amitabh Bachchan on the sets of Eklavya.

Based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1848 short story \u201cWhite Nights\u201d, the film also marked the Bollywood debut of Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor\u2019s son, Ranbir.\r\n\r\nWhile \u201cOm Shanti Om\u201d, Deepika's first Hindi release, went on to become the highest-grossing Bollywood film at the time, surpassing \u201cDhoom 2\u201d, \u201cSaawariya\u201d failed to make a mark at the box office.\r\n\r\nMade on a budget of Rs. 40 crore, Deepika led romantic drama grossed Rs. 152 crore worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2007 and the highest-grossing Hindi film ever at the time of its release.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, \u201cSaawariya\u201d was a commercial failure. Upon its release, the film received mixed to negative reviews. While the soundtrack, production design, artistic vision, and performances were praised, the story, screenplay, and pacing faced significant criticism. Salman Khan made a cameo as Imaan Pirzada, and the film marked the last appearance of both Zohra Sehgal and Begum Para before their deaths.\r\n\r\nMost recently, Deepika\u2019s latest release \u201cSingham Again\u201d clashed with Kartik Aaryan\u2019s horror-comedy \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3.\u201d Rohit Shetty\u2019s cop drama has surpassed Anees Bazmee\u2019s film at the ticket window. \u201cSingham Again\u201d has become Shetty's 10th film to cross the Rs.100 crore mark, making it the fastest to achieve this milestone.",

        "text": "The last chapter of Kagurabachi revealed more about the Makizumi family and Samura, while Uruha tricked the latter into escaping the battlefield. Hakuri Sazanami then put his life on the line to recover the Tobimune Enchanted Blade for Samura, which the blind swordsman then wielded to eliminate numerous Hishaku assassins.\n\nThe Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers reveal the current status of the battlefield at Senkutsuji Temple and the theatre, along with new insights into who likely betrayed the Rokuhiras three years ago. Keep reading for more details and a sneak peek at the upcoming chapter.\nKagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers\n\nAs per the Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers, the upcoming chapter will be titled \u2018Crumbling.\u2019 The spoilers begin with a shift of focus to a theatre where Hiruhiko is in turmoil upon realizing that the Tobimune blade is no longer under his control.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Senkutsuji temple, Samura wields the Tobimune Enchanted Blade with precision, cutting down numerous Hishaku assassins. The monks and other witnesses are awed by the blade\u2019s overwhelming power.\n\nDuring this battle, the Makizumi captain apologizes to Samura, expressing regret that he had to intervene to save them in the Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers. Samura, however, credits Hakuri for retrieving the blade.\nDespite being drained and losing a significant amount of blood, Hakuri expresses a desire to retrieve Uruha\u2019s blade next. A female Makizumi member advises him against it, emphasizing that the Hishaku forces seem weakened and reassures him that everyone will receive treatment at the next Sanzo location.\n\nFollowing a brief banter, Samura addresses the Makizumi members about his earlier statement of firing them. Although his tone is lighthearted, the conversation turns solemn when he speaks of the death of Fuura Ryou, a fellow Makizumi member, in the Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers.\n\nThe female Makizumi assures Samura that Fuura\u2019s sacrifice was meaningful, fulfilling his duty to protect him. Back at the theatre, where Hiruhiko is lamenting his failure to reclaim the Tobimune. However, he quickly regains his composure, acknowledging that although their plan has deviated, the overall objective remains unchanged.\nYura\u2019s desire to kill the Sword Saint to wield the Shinuchi blade still stands. In the Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers, Chihiro confronts Hiruhiko, asserting that none of the contracted sword bearers will perish under his watch.\n\nHiruhiko then questions Chihiro about the teachings concerning Enchanted Blades and their wielders. Chihiro recites the common belief that these sword bearers are akin to heroes, equal to the legendary Kunishige.\n\nHowever, Hiruhiko challenges this notion, implying that Chihiro\u2019s understanding is superficial. Hiruhiko presses further in the Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers, asking Chihiro about his observations of the Shinuchi\u2019s powers at the Rakuzaichi auction.\nChihiro admits that witnessing its destructive force made him question whether those wielding such blades were genuinely saviors. He reveals that during his battle with Kyora, who had acquired the Shinuchi blade, it felt as though another entity was awakened by the sword\u2019s powers.\n\nHe says he felt as though the true force behind the blade was the Sword Saint, not Kyora. This shakes Chihiro\u2019s beliefs in the Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers, especially when Hiruhiko discloses that three years ago, Samura made a pact with Yura, the Hishaku leader.\n\nAccording to Hiruhiko, Samura believed that the contracted swordbearers were destined to die. Chihiro is taken aback by this news but has no time to process it as Hiruhiko, without elaborating, uses the distraction to launch a surprise attack.\nA blade falls from the sky, diverting Chihiro\u2019s attention. In a swift move, Hiruhiko uses his mouth to pick up his severed arm and hurl it at Chihiro. The Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers then see something burst through the theatre\u2019s window.\n\nInitially, Chihiro believes it to be reinforcements, but he quickly realizes that it is Hiruhiko, now wielding the Kumeyuri blade. The Kagurabachi Chapter 57 spoilers conclude with two ethereal Geisha figures manifesting from the Kumeyuri blade, as Chihiro realizes something must have happened to Uruha, the blade\u2019s contractor.\n\nFor more spoilers like this and updates on the events within the Kagurabachi manga, keep up with Pinkvilla.\n\n*The spoilers provided here are not official and should be taken with caution.

        "text": "Gujarat\u2019s historic city of Vadnagar will host the annual Tana-Riri Festival on November 10 and November 11, bringing together celebrated artists in a tribute to the state\u2019s rich musical heritage.According to an official statement, this two-day event, held at the Tana-Riri Samadhi Sthala, will feature classical and folk performances by renowned artists, including Pandit Neeraj & Ami Parikh Group, Maithili Thakur, Osman Mir, Parthiv Gohil, and Shashank Subramaniam.The festival, named after the revered sisters Tana and Riri, has deep roots in Gujarat\u2019s musical history. Known for their mastery of the Malhar ragas, Tana and Riri inspired this festival, which began in 2003 as an initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat.\u201cIn the year 2003, as the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi started Tana-Riri Mohotsav from his hometown Vadnagar. This unique music festival is celebrated every year on Kartak Sud Nom and Dasham day in memory of Sangeet Samrajni Tana-Riri as a joint initiative of Gujarat State Sangeet Natak Akademi, Gandhinagar, and District Administration, Mehsana,\u201d stated an official spokesperson.The festival commemorates the sisters who, as legend holds, sacrificed their lives rather than perform at Emperor Akbar\u2019s court. As per the statement, \u201cBoth the Nagar sisters soothed the burning in their bodies with Deepak Raag sung by Sangeet Samrat Tansen. When Emperor Akbar came to know about this, Akbar ordered Tana and Riri to be presented to the court, but both sisters chose to sacrifice themselves instead of accepting this demand. To pay tribute to the artist sisters of Aaly Veerang, the Tana-Riri Classical Music Festival has been held every year since 2003 at the Tana-Riri Samadhi site, Ghaskor Darwaza, Vadnagar, where legendary singers and artists mesmerize the audience with their melodious music.\u201dIn addition to the live performances, this year\u2019s festival will honour Vidushi Padma Suresh Talwalkar and Dr Pradipta Ganguly with the Tana-Riri Award, which includes a cash prize of Rs 2.50 lakh, a copper plaque, and a shawl. Initiated in 2010 by Modi, the award aims to \u201cfelicitate art and artistes,\u201d and has been previously conferred upon prominent figures, including Lata and Usha Mangeshkar.Vadnagar, located in the Mehsana district, boasts a legacy of music and arts dating back 550 years, particularly within the Nagar Brahmin community. The Gujarat State Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Mehsana District Administration support the festival, which has gained national prominence and now aims to reach an international stage under Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel\u2019s leadership.This year\u2019s Tana-Riri Festival will feature performances by Pandit Neeraj & Ami Parikh Group and Maithili Thakur on November 10, followed by folk artist Osman Mir. On November 11, flautist Shashank Subramaniam and singer Parthiv Gohil will perform, concluding the event. Minister of Tourism Mulubhai Bera and Home Minister Harshbhai Sanghvi are also expected to attend.The Tana-Riri Festival remains a significant event in Gujarat\u2019s cultural calendar, celebrating the enduring musical heritage and honouring the legacy of Tana and Riri",

The couple exchanged vows today in a heartfelt ceremony held on the tranquil banks of the Ganges River in Shivpuri, Rishikesh\u2014an idyllic setting known for its serene spiritual atmosphere and breathtaking natural surroundings. This intimate celebration marks a beautiful new beginning for the couple. The wedding was an intimate affair, attended by close family members and friends, including Arun Pandian, Keerthi Pandian, and the couple Ashok Selvan and his spouse.\nRamya Pandian, the niece of actor Arun Pandian, made her acting debut in Tamil cinema with the film Dummi Tappasu in 2015. This marked the beginning of her career in the industry, where she quickly gained attention for her talent and screen presence.\nLast year, Ramya Pandian enrolled in a yoga centre in Bengaluru, where she met Lovel Dhawan, the yoga master at the facility. Over time, the two developed a deep connection, and their bond blossomed into love.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by SriRamya Paandiyan (@actress_ramyapandian)\n\nIn keeping with the rich traditions of a Tamil wedding, the bride and groom\u2019s outfits beautifully blended cultural sophistication with their flair. Ramya Pandian dazzled in a magnificent red pattu saree, a timeless and iconic choice for Tamil brides. The saree featured exquisite gold embroidery, accentuating her elegance and poise. She completed her bridal look with traditional jewellery that added a royal touch, further elevating her appearance. Lovel Dhawan, in contrast, opted for a more subtle yet equally refined ensemble, donning an off-white pattu vesti and shirt. His outfit perfectly complemented Ramya\u2019s, highlighting their harmonious style. The simplicity and natural beauty of the Ganges River backdrop, combined with the couple\u2019s attire, made the wedding ceremony not only deeply meaningful but also visually stunning. The couple has planned their wedding reception to take place in Chennai on November 15, where they will celebrate with friends and extended family.",

        "text": "Mick Schumacher, son of Formula 1 icon Michael Schumacher, opened up about the challenges and inspirations that have defined his racing career. Mick, who has been following in his legendary father's footsteps, revealed how he had to \u201cfind his own feet\u201d in Formula 1 after his father's skiing accident curtailed the guidance and support he once had.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Michael Schumacher, the seven-time Formula 1 champion, suffered life-altering injuries in a tragic skiing accident in December 2013 when Mick was just 14. The accident changed their lives, leaving Mick to navigate much of his professional racing journey independently. But even now, years later, Mick follows lessons his father instilled, often recalling both his father's competitive spirit and his challenging guidance.\u201cI was a crazy kid - everything my dad did, I did,\u201d Mick said in the latest insights shared through Matt Whyman's new book, Inside Mercedes F1.\u201cMy dad was always very open to me trying out whatever I wanted to do, and racing is all I wanted to do, because I enjoyed it the most.\u201dMick described the balance his father struck between encouragement and demanding excellence, recounting a memorable karting race where he attempted a bold late brake to save time. Michael's response wasn't just praise, but a challenge. \u201c'Yes, but you should have braked like that in every corner!' Such moments, Mick said, taught him the importance of commitment and precision in racing. Whenever he felt like I was not taking it seriously, he would say, \u2018Mick, would you rather go and play football with your friends?' If so, we do not need to do all of this. I insisted that I wanted to race, and he said, \u2018Okay, then let's do it properly.'\u201dHowever, everything changed in 2013, the year before Mick entered Formula classes. With his father no longer able to guide him through the critical transition from karting to more competitive racing, Mick faced new challenges. \u201cThen my dad had his accident,\u201d he shared. \u201cI started racing in the Formula classes the year after, and from that point onwards, I had to find my own feet.\u201dMick's talent and resilience eventually led him to F1, where he joined the Haas team in 2021. He made his F1 debut at the Bahrain Grand Prix, finishing 16th. Over two seasons, Mick gained invaluable experience but found himself navigating the tough realities of the sport alone.After his stint with Haas, he became a reserve driver for Mercedes, while simultaneously pursuing opportunities in the World Endurance Championship with Alpine. He continues to use his father's teachings, drawing from the technical insights and resilience he learned from Michael.Despite his drive and achievements, Mick's hopes of a 2024 return to F1 were recently dashed when Sauber, now owned by Audi, selected 18-year-old Gabriel Bortoleto over him.",

        "text": "Rohit Shetty\u2019s Singham Again has been receiving love from fans after its release on Diwali and is a successful addition to the filmmaker\u2019s cop universe. This unique cinematic universe includes films such as Singham, Singham Returns, Sooryanvanshi and Simmba. It is indeed difficult for fans to choose their favourite character, but it seems the filmmaker has made a clear choice. He recently revealed the \u2018most lovable\u2019 character from the realm is Ranveer Singh\u2019s Simmba. He also stated that when he viewed the final edit of Singham Again, he knew Simmba\u2019s entry would take the film to another level.\nIn an interview with Mashable India, Rohit Shetty mentioned, \u201cI think the most lovable is Simmba.\u201d Sharing about why the character is so special to him and its impact on Singham Again, the filmmaker stated, \u201cAesa nahi hai ki it was a surprise for us. Jab hum ne final edit bhi dekha toh it was like jab second half Simmba aayega toh film alag level pe chalega (It wasn\u2019t a surprise for us. When we saw the final edit, we knew that when Simmba entered in the second half, the film would be elevated to another level).\u201d\nDuring the conversation, the interviewer pointed out that Simmba was given some of the best lines in Singham Again and Rohit Shetty jokingly stated, \u201cWoh mera thoda favorite bhi hai (He is my favorite too).\u201d \nIn another interview with Pinkvilla, Rohit Shetty answered fan questions, including one asking whether Simmba would make an appearance in the Golmaal universe. However, Rohit quipped, \u201cThat will become too much. Mere pe taras khao (Have mercy on me). This universe coming here, that universe going there. Simmba will happen, obviously; it\u2019s one of the most loved characters in the cop universe.\u201d\nSimmba starred Ranveer Singh as Sangram Bhalerao, a police officer with a shaky moral compass who undergoes a life-changing incident. The film also starred Sara Ali Khan as the lead.\nMeanwhile, Rohit Shetty\u2019s newly released film Singham Again is doing well at the box office. The cop drama stars Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, Arjun Kapoor and Jackie Shroff.",

        "text": "When Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan decided to get married, they encountered significant challenges. Alongside the usual fanfare that surrounds Bollywood\u2019s most high-profile unions, the couple faced severe threats, including death threats and threats against their families. Nonetheless, the two stood firm in their decision, choosing to go ahead with a private ceremony in October 2012 despite these daunting warnings.\nReflecting on the time, Saif Ali Khan had revealed to Rediff that Kareena\u2019s father, Randhir Kapoor, had received anonymous letters filled with threats, claiming that the family would be harmed, and even suggesting that their wedding venue could be targeted. However, Saif remained undeterred, drawing strength from his family\u2019s history. He recalled that his parents, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Sharmila Tagore, had also faced similar resistance during their interfaith marriage in the 1960s. Saif explained, \u201cSome people were not happy with us getting married. My father-in-law had received some letters from anonymous people, claiming they will harm our family and bomb the place.\u201d But these threats didn\u2019t intimidate him. Saif remained unfazed, adding, \u201cMaking threats and carrying them out are two different things.\u201d\nSharmila Tagore, in a previous conversation with Mojo Story, had also shared memories of the challenges she and Saif\u2019s father, Mansoor Ali Khan, faced. During their wedding in Kolkata, her family received telegrams with threats, ominously stating that \u201cbullets shall speak.\u201d While Tiger\u2019s (Mansoor Ali Khan\u2019s) family grew increasingly worried, Sharmila recounted that they moved forward, holding a memorable wedding where, fortunately, \u201cnothing untoward happened.\u201d This legacy of resilience in the face of adversity seems to have inspired Saif and Kareena as well, providing a sense of stability and perspective during their own trials.\nSaif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan\u2019s marriage is a beautiful testament to their unwavering commitment to one another and to overcoming obstacles together. The couple first met on the sets of the film Tashan in 2008, sparking an instant connection that evolved over the years into a deep, abiding relationship. As one of Bollywood\u2019s most iconic couples, Saif and Kareena\u2014often affectionately known as \u201cSaifeena\u201d\u2014embody modern romance while respecting the deep-rooted traditions of their respective families. Their 2012 wedding, conducted in a simple yet elegant style, was a blend of traditional and contemporary values, honoring both Saif\u2019s Nawabi heritage and Kareena\u2019s illustrious Kapoor lineage.\nTheir union has been celebrated not only for its cultural symbolism but also for its warmth, intimacy, and authenticity. From raising two children, Taimur and Jehangir, to balancing demanding careers and family life, Saif and Kareena\u2019s journey has been a masterclass in partnership and resilience. Today, they remain one of Bollywood\u2019s most respected couples, inspiring fans with their down-to-earth values, steadfast support for each other, and a love story that transcends the silver screen.",

        "text": "Amaran, the gripping biographical war drama released on October 31, 2024, has stormed the box office, quickly surpassing Rs 200 crore in global earnings. This cinematic tribute to Major Mukund Varadharajan, an Indian Army hero, is captivating audiences with its powerful storytelling and record-breaking success, establishing itself as a must-watch blockbuster in Tamil cinema.\n\nDirected by Rajkumar Periyasamy and featuring Sivakarthikeyan and Sai Pallavi in lead roles, Amaran has earned widespread acclaim for its intense portrayal of courage and sacrifice. The film is setting new benchmarks, swiftly surpassing other Tamil hits and bringing Major Mukund\u2019s inspiring story to audiences worldwide.\n\nRelease and Box Office Success\n\nReleased on October 31, 2024, Amaran hit theaters across multiple languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, and Kannada, maximizing its reach and appeal. Within just 10 days, it broke the Rs 100 crore mark in Tamil Nadu alone, with its global revenue soaring to Rs 200 crore. This box office triumph came as no surprise after an exceptional first week, grossing Rs 89 crore and continuing to dominate with impressive day-to-day earnings.\n\nStoryline and Inspiration\n\nThe story of Amaran pays homage to the life and legacy of Major Mukund Varadharajan, an Indian army officer who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. The movie is based on a chapter from the acclaimed book series India\u2019s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes by Shiv Aroor and Rahul Singh, blending patriotism, human connection, and drama into a riveting narrative that deeply resonates with audiences.\n\nStellar Cast and Crew\n\nSivakarthikeyan shines in his portrayal of Major Mukund Varadharajan, embodying the bravery and dedication of the decorated army officer. Opposite him, Sai Pallavi brings depth to her role as Indu Rebecca Varghese, Mukund\u2019s wife, capturing the emotional struggles of a family behind the soldier. The movie also stars Rahul Bose and Bhuvan Arora in pivotal roles, enriching the storyline with their powerful performances. Directed by Rajkumar Periyasamy, Amaran features a stirring soundtrack by composer GV Prakash Kumar, whose music enhances the film\u2019s gripping narrative.\n\nProduction and Audience Reception\n\nThe high production quality of Amaran, from its intense action scenes to the emotional depth of its story, has won it widespread praise. Many fans and critics alike are calling it a \u201cmust-watch,\u201d applauding its strong performances, gripping storyline, and impressive direction. The overwhelming response is evident as audiences continue to flock to theaters, with ticket sales showing no signs of slowing.\n\nSetting New Records in Tamil Cinema\n\nThe film\u2019s ticket demand soared to unprecedented heights, with pre-sales for the second Saturday nearly doubling the full-day collections of previous Tamil hits like Vettaiyan. In fact, Amaran has already surpassed the lifetime earnings of Vettaiyan in Tamil Nadu, with the potential to double the earnings of Sivakarthikeyan\u2019s 2022 blockbuster Don. The film is also on track to become the second-highest-grossing Tamil movie of 2024, falling just behind The Greatest of All Time.\n\nMemorable Dialogues and Themes\n\nA standout moment in the film comes in a conversation between Major Mukund and his father, where his father asks, \u201cWhy is Kashmir always in trouble?\u201d Mukund\u2019s response, \u201cPeople who are supposed to talk don\u2019t. What else shall we do?\u201d reflects the soldier\u2019s unwavering sense of duty despite complex political realities. This moment captures the film\u2019s message that a soldier\u2019s actions are defined not by personal beliefs but by the courage to serve his nation.\n\nCompeting Diwali Releases\n\nDespite competing against Diwali releases like Lucky Baskhar, Bloody Beggar, and KA, Amaran has taken the lead this holiday season, setting itself apart as the top film choice for audiences. Its success showcases Tamil cinema\u2019s ability to deliver compelling stories that captivate and inspire.\n\nAs Amaran continues to break records and inspire audiences, it stands as a monumental addition to Tamil cinema in 2024. With its compelling storyline, outstanding cast, and record-breaking box office success, Amaran is undeniably a film worth watching\u2014both as a celebration of courage and as an unforgettable cinematic experience.\n\nALSO READ: Grammy 2025: Ricky Kej, Anoushka Shankar, Varijashree Venugopal Represent India Among Nominees",

        "text": "Earlier this year, Nikkhil Advani released his directorial venture, Vedaa. The film starred John Abraham, Sharvari and Abhishek Banerjee in key roles. Although the film generated enough buzz, it didn\u2019t perform as per expectation at the box office. This was primarily because the film clashed with Shraddha Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao starrer Stree 2. The director opened up about this in a recent chat.\nHe told PTI, \u201c\u2018Vedaa\u2019 released on August 15 and it hit us out, it gobbled us up. Four days later, somebody asked, \u2018What I could\u2019ve changed about \u2018Vedaa\u2019? I said, \u2018I could\u2019ve just changed that \u2018Stree 2\u2019 was not a good film.\u2019 \u201cI think I made a good film, my job is to tell the story that people have entrusted me to tell, as well as possible.\u201d\n\u201cWe made a very good film. It has certain things that make eyes wide open. People are saying in the second half there\u2019s action, otherwise, it would\u2019ve been an independent film about Dalit atrocities and rights. \u2018Stree 2\u2019 came, and it was incredible. I feel post lockdown and pandemic, the audience wants to be free, they want to enjoy freely,\u201d Advani said when asked if he regretted the clash.\n\u201cI think Sharvari was incredible, John is superb in the film, and a lot of people worked hard on it. I feel bad for them, not so much for me,\u201d Advani added. The filmmaker said that his films Batla House and DDay were also good but people didn\u2019t go to theatres to watch them.\nIn the box office battle which commenced this Independence Day, Abhishek Banerjee emerged as the real winner. He was seen in both Vedaa and Stree 2. In an exclusive conversation with News18, Abhishek said, \u201cAs an actor, it\u2019s a bittersweet experience. Nikkhil Advani has directed a beautiful film. I saw 60 per cent occupancy for Vedaa in metro cities. I don\u2019t know about the rest. I saw people clapping during the climax. The problem is that Stree is a juggernaut. Since it is also a sequel, the audience is already in sync with the characters. Nobody imagined Stree to be such a big monster. I knew it would be a monster but not that it would become Godzilla.\u201d",

        "text": "Rishi Kapoor, an iconic figure in Indian cinema, was renowned not only for his acting prowess but also for his candid and unfiltered nature, particularly in the social media era. Known for his bluntness and fiery personality, Kapoor was unafraid to voice his opinions, even when they ruffled a few feathers. His son, Ranbir Kapoor, was no exception to his critiques. Rishi Kapoor\u2019s frankness often created memorable moments that reflected his fiercely honest personality.\nRishi Kapoor passed away on April 30, 2020, after a battle with leukemia, leaving behind a legacy cherished by fans and a plethora of stories from those who knew him. Recently, in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, actor-filmmaker Ananth Mahadevan shared an anecdote that revealed the late actor\u2019s forthrightness, particularly when it came to his son\u2019s career choices.\nMahadevan recalled a visit to Kapoor\u2019s residence, where Rishi Kapoor passionately expressed his disapproval of one of Ranbir\u2019s film projects. \u201cI don\u2019t want to name the filmmaker or the film,\u201d Mahadevan began, \u201cbut Rishi was livid.\u201d He narrated how Rishi Kapoor had repeatedly warned Ranbir against participating in the film.\n\u201cHe was constantly saying that he tried his best to dissuade Ranbir from doing that film. I told him \u2018don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, this film will not run.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t listen,\u201d recalled Ananth.\nDespite Rishi\u2019s strong advice, Ranbir proceeded with the project. True to Rishi Kapoor\u2019s character, he didn\u2019t mince words. He even told the filmmakers directly that their movie would flop and that there was no point in making it.\nMahadevan described Kapoor as a \u201cpure delight\u201d in his honesty, someone who didn\u2019t hide his thoughts. Ananth Mahadevan recently also made headlines for drawing comparisons between Kiran Rao\u2019s Laapataa Ladies and his own film, Ghunghat Ke Pat Khol.",

        "title": "Aligarh Muslim University A Minority Institution? Big Top Court Verdict Today",
        "text": "The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on Friday on a vexed legal question whether the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) enjoyed a minority status under Article 30 of the Constitution which empowers the religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.\n\nA seven-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud will pronounce the verdict.\n\nThe bench also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Surya Kant, JB Pardiwala, Dipankar Datta, Manoj Misra and Satish Chandra Sharma had reserved its verdict on the question on February 1 after hearing arguments for eight days.\n\nOn February 1, grappling with the intractable issue of the AMU's minority status, the top court said the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act, which effectively accorded it a minority status, only did a \"half-hearted job\" and did not restore to the institution the position it had prior to 1951.\n\nWhile the AMU Act, 1920, speaks about incorporating a teaching and residential Muslim university in Aligarh, the 1951 amendment does away with compulsory religious instructions for the Muslim students at the university.\n\nThe vexed question has repeatedly tested Parliament's legislative acumen and judiciary's prowess in interpreting complex laws involving the institution that was founded in 1875 as Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College by prominent Muslim community members led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. Years later, in 1920, it transformed into a university under the British Raj.\n\n\"One thing which is worrying us is that the 1981 amendment does not restore the position as it stood prior to 1951. In other words, the 1981 amendment does a half-hearted job,\" Justice Chandrachud had said while proceeding to close the arguments.\n\n\"I can understand if the 1981 amendment had said... okay, we are going back to the original 1920 statute, confer complete minority character on this (institution),\" the CJI had said.\n\nEarlier, the BJP-led NDA government refused to accept the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act and insisted that the court should go by the five-judge constitution bench verdict in the S Azeez Basha versus Union of India case in 1967. The Constitution bench had then held that since the AMU was a central university, it cannot be considered a minority institution.\n\nThe top court had said it needs to see what the 1981 amendment did and whether it restored to the institution the status it enjoyed before 1951.\n\nThose who put forward the view favouring a minority status for the institution, including veteran lawyer Kapil Sibal, contended that the mere fact that only 37 members of the 180-member governing council are Muslim does not detract from its credentials as a Muslim minority institution.\n\nOthers like Solicitor General Tushar Mehta contended a university getting enormous funds from the Centre and having been declared an institution of national importance cannot claim to belong to a particular religious denomination.\n\nThey had also argued that once the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College transformed itself into a university after the 1951 amendment to the AMU Act and began receiving funds from the Central government, the institution surrendered its minority character.\n\nA lawyer disfavouring minority status to the AMU had claimed that it received over Rs 5,000 crore from the Central government between 2019 and 2023, nearly double what the University of Delhi, a central university, got.\n\nSome of them had even contended that prominent people from the Muslim community who had lobbied with the then British government for establishing the institution as a university wedded to the cause of promoting education among the Muslims did not consider themselves as a religious minority in undivided India and advocated a two-nation theory.\n\nMr Sibal had mounted a spirited counterattack, asserting that Article 30 of the Constitution which deals with the right of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions was applicable to the AMU.\n\nNotably, the Allahabad High Court had struck down the provision of the 1981 law by which the university was accorded minority status. Appeals were filed in the Supreme Court, including by the AMU, against the high court verdict.\n\nThe row over AMU's minority status has been caught in a legal maze for the last several decades.\n\nThe top court had, on February 12, 2019, referred to a seven-judge bench the contentious issue. A similar reference was also made in 1981.\n\nThe Congress-led UPA government at the Centre moved an appeal against the 2006 verdict of the Allahabad High Court that quashed the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act. The university also filed a separate petition against it.\n\nThe NDA government spearheaded by the BJP told the Supreme Court in 2016 that it would withdraw the appeal filed by the UPA dispensation.\n\nIt cited the Supreme Court's 1967 judgement in the Basha case to claim that AMU was not a minority institution since it was a central university funded by the government. \n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Shraddha Kapoor has already proved her acting prowess by starring in blockbuster hits like Aashiqui 2 and the Stree franchise.

        "text": "Hyderabad:At the Dr Y. Nayudamma Memorial Lecture, group vice chancellor of BITS, Pilani, Prof V. Ramgopal Rao said India\u2019s research must focus on real-world impact, guided by the needs of society and industry rather than being confined to academic repositories.The lecture was organised by the Telangana Academy of Sciences at the CSIR-IICT\u2019s Vivekananda Auditorium to honour Dr Y Nayudamma, a chemist who transformed India\u2019s leather industry. Born in Guntur, Nayudamma rose to become the director of the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI) in Chennai, where his groundbreaking work not only advanced the industry but also improved the lives of countless tanners. The lecture also brought together scientists, industry experts, and academics, with A.V. Rama Rao, chairman of AVRA Laboratories, as the chief guest along with Prof. Rao.In his lecture, Prof. Rao presented the reality of India\u2019s research and development (R&D). \u201cWe\u2019re third in the world in research output but 40th in innovation,\u201d he said, referencing data from the slides in his presentation. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re lacking. We\u2019re publishing papers, but we\u2019re not translating that knowledge into something useful.\u201dHe said that India spends less on R&D than other BRICS countries, allocating only 0.7 per cent of its GDP, most of which goes to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The slides displayed India\u2019s spending on R&D in comparison to other nations, showing India lagging behind countries like Brazil, which allocates 1.3 per cent of its GDP to R&D. On the other hand, countries like South Korea and Israel spend over 4.5 per cent.Rao said research projects in Indian higher education institutions should address problems relevant to society, industry, or strategic needs, rather than simply existing for academic records. \u201cOur research projects should come from society, industry or strategic agencies\u2014not libraries,\u201d he stated.He pointed out that India ranks 66th in industry-academia collaboration, describing this as a lost opportunity to connect academic research with practical applications. \u201cWhy are we so poor in working with industry? We need our research to connect with the real world,\u201d he questioned.Although India has one of the fastest-growing startup ecosystems, ranked third globally in the number of start-ups, Rao noted that most of these companies are business model innovations rather than genuine technological advancements.\u201cAll these unicorns are business model innovations, not technology innovations,\u201d he said, stressing the need for technology-driven solutions that address local challenges. Rao also drew attention to Amul as a successful example of a business model designed for grassroots impact, explaining that the Amul model worked because it was tailored to the needs of farmers and communities.\u201cAvailability of innovation is not the main problem, but adaptability is, especially in agriculture and grassroots issues,\u201d he remarked, suggesting that technology must be made more accessible by business model innovation which is lacking in India. \u201cOur management schools, for example, are trained based on the Harvard Business School model, so they\u2019re not equipped to handle issues specific to India,\u201d he observed.According to the slides, he suggested that a \u2018Morrill moment\u2019 could be beneficial for Indian academia, similar to how the US Land-Grant universities were established to serve the needs of the country\u2019s agricultural and mechanical industries.",

        "text": "The re-election of Donald Trump in the US could spell trouble for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as Trump's allegiance has always been to the late Queen. And the entire Trump family hate Harry and Meghan for their public criticism of the Royal family and their exit. Harry and Meghan, residents of California, have enough reasons to be unhappy over Donald Trump's re-election. Meghan Markle, who is a US citizen, once called Donald Trump divisive and misogynist. Coming to protection, Prince Harry has a visa issue in the US. A person involved in drugs is not granted US visa but Prince Harry was granted one in 2020 because he probably lied in the visa form. Two years later, he admitted to having drugs earlier -- in his memoir Spare which dragged him into this case of whether the ex-royal was given extra privilege in the visa application. Going by Donald Trump's son Eric's recent interview to DailyMail, no one in America cares about Prince Harry and his 'unpopular' wife Meghan Markle. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if he did drugs. It means nothing,\" Eric said. But Donald Trump earlier this year commented on the issue specifically without suppressing his disapproval of Prince Harry. A teetotaller himself, Donald Trump earlier said, \"I wouldn\u2019t protect him. He betrayed the Queen. That\u2019s unforgivable. He would be on his own if it was down to me\".Trump also blamed the Biden administration for being \"too gracious\" to Harry.Prince Harry acknowledged using cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms in his book but the Department of Homeland Security said he could have fabricated those information for the sake of the book. Harry and Meghan have a plan B as well -- though it's not certain what they had in mind before they purchased a new house in Portugal -- to flee the US or to flex their defiance near home (UK). According to the experts, Meghan will never shift her base to anywhere else as she has big Hollywood dreams which she is still pursuing despite losing her popularity every day.",

        "title": "Why Has FRIENDS Star Matt LeBlanc Isolated Himself After Matthew Perry\u2019s Death?",
        "text": "Matt LeBlanc, best known for his role as Joey Tribbiani on the NBC sitcom FRIENDS, has reportedly retreated from the public eye following the tragic death of his co-star and close friend, Matthew Perry.\n\nPerry, who played Chandler Bing on the popular series, passed away in October of last year, an incident that profoundly impacted LeBlanc and left him deeply saddened. The two actors had not only shared a decade-long on-screen friendship on the sets of FRIENDS but also developed a close bond in real life.\n\nLifestyle Away from Spotlight\n\nAccording to sources, LeBlanc has chosen to live a quiet, clean lifestyle, staying away from the spotlight and avoiding the pitfalls of fame. The Man With a Plan actor, who is now 57, has reportedly turned into a recluse to safeguard his mental health and well-being.\n\nRadarOnline reports that LeBlanc has been maintaining a disciplined lifestyle, with smoking cigarettes as his only vice, keeping his distance from the party culture and drug use often associated with Hollywood.\n\n\u2018I Was Burn Out\u2019\n\nThis approach to life is not new for LeBlanc. In an earlier interview, he revealed that he withdrew from the entertainment industry after the FRIENDS spin-off Joey was canceled in 2006, stating, \u201cFor years and years, I barely left the house. I was burnt out. Most actors call their agents and say, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I\u2019d call mine and say, \u2018Please lose my number for a few years.'\u201d\n\nSources close to the actor say that Perry\u2019s death only deepened LeBlanc\u2019s need for solitude. The two lived near each other in the Pacific Palisades, and LeBlanc was reportedly among the first to pay tribute following Perry\u2019s untimely passing.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow FRIENDS cast members Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston have reportedly been keeping a close eye on LeBlanc. According to sources, Aniston has been spending considerable time with him, visiting his home, watching movies, and simply keeping him company. Courteney Cox has also been in regular contact, with both women ensuring that one of them is around to offer him support as he copes with his grief.\n\nDespite recent speculation about LeBlanc potentially retiring from acting, his agents have denied these rumors, calling them \u201crubbish.\u201d However, insiders believe that his withdrawal from the limelight may continue as he processes this difficult chapter in his life.\n\nLeBlanc has previously shared that his off-screen personality is quite different from the exuberant Joey Tribbiani, describing himself as more reserved and laid-back. In a 2012 interview, he stated, \u201cPeople will always ask me if I\u2019m all right, because I\u2019m much more low-key and reserved than my character in FRIENDS. They think that I\u2019m depressed, or I\u2019m sad or upset \u2013 but I\u2019m just not amped up to go out in front of an audience and do a TV show. That\u2019s not who I am,\u201d he revealed.\n\nALSO READ: Liam Payne Death: Who Are 3 People Of Interest Detained In An Ongoing Investigation?",

        "title": "CJI Chandrachud\u2019s and Controversies",
        "text": "By K Raveendran\n\nIt is as though the most controversial, at times even messy, part of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud has been reserved for the last few days of his tenure. The revelation about his prayer to the deity to help the Supreme Court come up with a solution in the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute has had its political undertones as the deity was in a way a party to the dispute. But luckily, the claim did not lead to any clumsy results, although it may have created some distrust in the minds of the aggrieved parties. The invitation to prime minister Narendra Modi for the CJI\u2019s private Ganesh puja also had its share of doubts.\n\nJustice Chandrachud\u2019s tenure has also been punctuated by tensions with legal practitioners over court protocols, particularly regarding case listings. As Chief Justice, he has been vocal about the need for procedural integrity, often expressing frustration over lawyers attempting to bypass standard case listing processes. His stance has highlighted a recurring issue within India\u2019s judicial ecosystem, where the relationship between the bench and the bar has at times been strained by differing expectations on courtroom conduct and decorum.\n\nBut what stole the show really were his observations recorded in the majority verdict in the case relating to private property where Justice Chandrachud criticised former Justice V R Krishna Iyer, a judicial icon who is celebrated for his work in advancing social justice in India and has earned a permanent place in the heart and mind of every Indian, for his \u2018rigid economic theory\u2019. It can be safely assumed that these moments in his final days have overshadowed some of the broader judicial and institutional reforms that marked his tenure.\n\nKrishna Iyer\u2019s views have long been held in high esteem, particularly among progressive elements who view his economic philosophy as foundational to the judiciary\u2019s pro-poor ethos. By calling attention to what he termed Iyer\u2019s \u2018rigid economic theory\u2019, CJI Chandrachud has drawn the ire from some quarters, who view this critique as an affront to a cherished judicial legacy. Iyer\u2019s legal philosophy, which emphasizes the judiciary\u2019s role in championing the underprivileged, has inspired generations of Indian jurists and remains influential in contemporary judicial thought.\n\nFor some, this moment represents an overstep by Chandrachud. The criticism was so sharp that it seemed to risk tarnishing Iyer\u2019s legacy, something which many legal minds found troubling. After all, judicial critiques of former judges are rare and can sometimes seem like a personal or political attack, especially when it comes to figures as revered as Justice Krishna Iyer. Was it really necessary for Chandrachud to go after Iyer\u2019s economic views in a ruling that seemed to be focused more on property law than on a critique of ideological differences?\n\nThe criticism of Iyer may have been an attempt to push back against an outdated or overly idealistic notion of economics that doesn\u2019t necessarily align with current societal realities. It probably stems from a realisation that Iyer\u2019s ideas, though revolutionary in their time, may not be suited to a rapidly changing economic landscape. Chandrachud, from his own point of view, may have made this remark to assert that the court\u2019s role as a dynamic institution that must evolve with the times. However, the manner in which the criticism was delivered\u2014and the fact that it was directed at a figure as beloved and revered as Justice Krishna Iyer\u2014has led to debates about the appropriateness of such a critique.\n\nSome of his own colleagues have argued that by singling out Krishna Iyer\u2019s stand, the CJI not only diminished the intellectual legacy of his predecessor but also presented a one-sided picture. They viewed this as an unnecessary rehashing of ideological differences, especially when Iyer\u2019s approach was founded on the principle of social justice in an unequal society. They contended that the Supreme Court\u2019s judgments should be above partisan or individual critiques of past legal luminaries, as it risks introducing divisiveness within the institution.\n\nIn their view, such remarks\u2014especially from a sitting Chief Justice\u2014could fuel unnecessary controversy and divert attention from the substantive issues at hand in the judgment itself. The judiciary is meant to be an impartial arbiter of legal disputes, not a forum for public ideological clashes. Justice Iyer\u2019s economic theories may have been contested during his time, but his contributions to shaping India\u2019s jurisprudence, especially in advancing rights for disadvantaged groups, should not have been subjected to a public disparagement by a fellow judge. These criticisms reflect broader concerns about maintaining judicial collegiality and respecting the diversity of thought within the highest judicial body in the land.\n\nThey earnestly believe that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s remarks, while rooted in his interpretation of legal principles, may have crossed an unwritten line in judicial conduct. The need to uphold the dignity of the judiciary, they argue, must be balanced with the freedom to express legal opinions\u2014especially when such expressions can inadvertently lead to the undermining of past judicial giants or sow seeds of discord within the institution itself. This internal critique has added another layer of complexity to the legacy of Chandrachud. (IPA Service)",

        "text": "The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on Friday on a vexed legal question whether the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) enjoyed a minority status under Article 30 of the Constitution which empowers the religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions. A seven-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud will pronounce the verdict. The bench also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Surya Kant, J B Pardiwala, Dipankar Datta, Manoj Misra and Satish Chandra Sharma had reserved its verdict on the question on February 1 after hearing arguments for eight days. On February 1, grappling with the intractable issue of the AMU's minority status, the top court said the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act, which effectively accorded it a minority status, only did a \"half-hearted job\" and did not restore to the institution the position it had prior to 1951. While the AMU Act, 1920 speaks about incorporating a teaching and residential Muslim university in Aligarh, the 1951 amendment does away with compulsory religious instructions for the Muslim students at the university. The vexed question has repeatedly tested Parliament's legislative acumen and judiciary's prowess in interpreting complex laws involving the institution that was founded in 1875 as Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College by prominent Muslim community members led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. Years later in 1920, it transformed into a university under the British Raj.

In other words, the 1981 amendment does a half-hearted job,\" Justice Chandrachud had said while proceeding to close the arguments. \"I can understand if the 1981 amendment had said... Okay, we are going back to the original 1920 statute, confer complete minority character on this (institution),\" the CJI had said. Earlier, the BJP-led NDA government refused to accept the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act and insisted that the court should go by the five-judge constitution bench verdict in the S Azeez Basha versus Union of India case in 1967. The Constitution bench had then held that since the AMU was a central university, it cannot be considered a minority institution.

        "title": "The Bahmani dynasty and their architectural grandeur in Bidar",
        "text": "When the Bahmani Sultanate shifted its capital from Gulbarga (Now Kalaburagi) to Bidar (previously known as Muhammadabad) in 1422, the ninth ruler of Bahmanis- Ahmad Shah I, faced challenges and struggled with political unrest and factionalism. However, he was successful in maintaining the integrity of the Bahmani dynasty, which had seen impressive growth in the past.\n\nAccording to the historians, the kingdom was marred by internal strife for power. Despite several hurdles, Ahmad Shah I created an environment that attracted scholars from around the world. Besides promoting art and literature, the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa -an educational institution was established during his rule.\n\nHistorians say that shifting the capital of the Bahmani kingdom from Gulbarga to Bidar was a strategic move as it made easier to administer the kingdom and the Bidar\u2019s hilly terrain provided a security. Also its connectivity to trade routes encouraged trade and economic growth, and eventually helped it maintain distance from rival kingdoms, that brought political stability to the kingdom.\n\nThe Bahmani dynasty had 18 kings and ruled for almost 200 years . It made Gulbarga as its capital for the first 75 years followed by Bidar for over a century. Of the 18 Bahmani rulers, first eight rulers including - Allauddin Hasan Gangu Bahman Shah, Muhammad Shah I, Allauddin Mujahid Shah, Dawud Shah I, Muhammad Shah II, Ghiyas-ud-Din Tahmatan Shah, Shams-ud-din Daud Shah II and Taj-ud-Din Feroz Shah made Gulbarga as their capital from 1347 to 1422.\n\nAhmad Shah I, Ala-ud-Din Ahmed Shah II, Ala-ud-Din Humayun Shah, Nizam-ud-din Ahmad Shah III, Shams-ud-din Muhammad Shah III, Shihab-ud-din Mahmud Shah, Ahmed Shah IV, Ala-ud-Din Muhammad Shah, Wali-ullah Shah and Kaleem-ullah Shah ruled from Bidar as capital between 1422 and1538.\n\nThe Bidar Fort \n\nThe imposing Bidar fort is well protected with a three-layered fortification spread across 67 acres with a perimeter of 5.5 kilometres. Its outer walls measure 5 metres thick and 10 metres high, interspersed with seven gates and 37 bastions. The irregular rhomboid shaped fort houses palaces, mosques, and courtyards.\n\nThe Fort has seven grand arched gates- of which the Gumbad Darwaza and Sharaza Darwaza were the two most prominent entrance gates. The other five gates \u2013 Carnatic Darwaza, Mandu Darwaza, Kalyani Darwaza, Kalmadgi Darwaza, Delhi Darwaza were named based on their directions.\n\nRangeen Mahal\n\nIt is one of the preserved palaces in the Fort. The square timber columns at the entrance area support a beautifully carved wooden ceiling lying on wooden brackets with pendant banana-bud motifs derived from Indian traditional architecture. The inner walls of the hall are decorated with underglaze-painted tiles depicting foliate designs and flowering vases. The panels are framed by basalt colonnettes inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the carved wooden ceiling and dome with radiating motifs in Rangini mahal may be considered amongst the finest of all Deccani decorative arts.\n\nTakht Mahal (Throne Palace) once housed the splendid throne of the Bahmanis, and though in ruins , is indicative of the regality of the palace. Diwan-e-Aam has three storied structures. Both the palaces are built around rectangular courtyards.\n\nThe Solah Khamba Masjid (16 Pillars mosque) was originally a ceremonial audience hall, however, historians believe that the structure was renovated to convert into a space where prayers could be conducted. The roof of the structure consists of a large dome surrounded by small domes. The Fort Complex also houses Gagan Mahal and Tarkash Mahal which are in dilapidated condition.\n\nThe Hazar Kothari structure in the fort was built for safe exit of the rulers family during attack from the enemies. According to local historians, there is an underground hall which leads to the outer wall of the fort.\n\nCannons recovered\n\nFounder of Team Yuva, Vinay Malge, said that several cannons were scattered throughout the fort on each bastion, ramparts and gates. He recalled that nearly six small cannons were recovered from the moat during restoration taken up by his team members a few years ago. The Karez system (also known as Qanat system) - an ancient Persian technology used for water supply that was introduced by the Bahmani Sultans in the 15th century and the water management system was further expanded and modified by subsequent rulers that played a crucial role in Bidar\u2019s agricultural prosperity. Currently, the Karez system has been damaged or clogged and measures, and steps should be taken to revive and restore the Karez system, Malge says.\n\nThe fort\u2019s evolution showcases the cultural and architectural exchange between various dynasties that ruled Bidar. Historians and several authors claim that the Bidar fort was built by Kakatiya ruler-Madhav Varma II in the 10th century. However the Fort underwent significant modifications, expansions and renovations by subsequent rulers including Bahmani Sultanate (1347 -1518) Barid Shahi Dynasty (1527-1619), Mughal Empire (1619-1724) Nizam of Hyderabad (1724 -1948).\n\n \u201cIn every direction, great loops of bleak black crenelations swept over miles over hills and down steep valleys, a seemingly endless expanse of towers and walls, gateways and bastions, arch-shaped merlons and fortified escarpments.\u201d An India-based Scottish historian William Dalrymple in his book \u2013\u201cWhite Mughals\u201d describes the Bidar fort.\n\nContributions of Khaja Mahmud Gawan\n\nKhaja Mahmud Gawan has made great contributions to the Bahmani Sultanate; from education to the administrative sector, his initiatives have left a lasting legacy. Due to his honesty towards Bahmani\u2019s, Gawan was offered the post of mansabdar in Alauddin Ahmed Shah\u2019s court, further he was made minister during the reign of Humayun. Later, Muhammad Shah II made Gawan the Prime Minister. His administrative reforms, educational patronage and economic initiatives shaped the Deccan region during the 15th century.\n\nGawan introduced a streamlined revenue system, boosting trade and commerce. He also divided the kingdom into smaller administrative units for efficient governance and established a fair judicial system.\n\nMahmud Gawan Madrasa built in 1472, which was considered to be one of the oldest and most influential Islamic educational institutions in India.\n\nThe magnificent Madrasa structure reflects the blend of Persian, Arabic and Indian architectural styles. A large rectangular complex with a central courtyard, decorated with intricate stone carvings, calligraphy and ornate tile work on the minaret add to the structure\u2019s grandeur. The structure is protected by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI).\n\nThe Gawan Madrasa taught Islamic theology, philosophy and mathematics that attracted scholars from different regions. Historians claim that the Library in Gawan Madrasa houses a vast collection of rare manuscripts and books, and also has residential quarters for accommodation for students. Recently the Madrasa was adopted by Shaheen Group of Institutions under the Adopt-a-Heritage scheme and a MoU was signed by ASI in August 2024.\n\nAshtur Tombs\n\nThe Royal Necropolis of ten Bahmani rulers is situated in Ashtur village-3km from Bidar city. The first tomb belongs to Ahmad Shah; the interior of his tomb reveals its true magnificence-embellished with splendid paintings reflecting Deccani and Asian style of art. Similarly the tombs of Ala-ud-Din Ahmed Shah II, Ala-ud-Din Humayun Shah, Nizam-ud-din Ahmad Shah III, Shams-ud-din Muhammad Shah III, and Shihab-ud-din Mahmud Shah II were aligned. \n\nFlanking this tomb lie two incomplete domed tombs of Ahmed Shah IV, Ala-ud-Din Muhammad Shah; followed by two identical small tombs having pyramidal roofs belonging to the last two Bahmani rulers - Wali-ullah Shah and Kaleem-ullah Shah.\n\nOn the way to Ashtur tombs, you can find a majestic mausoleum (Chaukhandi tomb) built in honor of Hazrath Khalil Ullah, the spiritual advisor of Ahmad Shah. The Chaukhandi is an octagonal peripheral architectural magnificence covering the square inner tomb.",

She paired her white bodycon dress with the iconic Hermes Kelly bag, a symbol of ultimate luxury. The jaw-dropping price tag of the arm candy, USD 39,765 (Rs. 33 lakh), is enough to make anyone envious.\nThe series of pictures from her birthday celebration also captured sweet moments as she posed with her friends and cut her birthday cake. To complete her birthday look, she opted for other accessories, including multi-layered gold necklaces, a pair of diamond stud earrings, a golden bracelet, a sleek wristwatch and statement rings.\nFor makeup, the Archies star opted for a glam foundation based on an ample amount of highlighter on her T-zone. Defined eyebrows, and brown glittery eyes loaded with mascara and eyeliner added a charm to her overall look. She further went for blushed cheeks, nude lipstick and blushed cheeks. Finally, she left her hair loose, styled in a middle-parted wavy style to round off her OOTN.\nThis is not the first time Khushi has captivated our minds with her impeccable fashion sense. Previously, she shared a couple of photos from one of her vacations and served goals for beachwear. From a white bikini top with a colourful crochet shrug to a bold red bodycon, Khushi showcased her versatility, and each look was elevated by thoughtful accessories.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by \u1d0b\u029c\u1d1cs\u029c\u026a \u1d0b\u1d00\u1d18\u1d0f\u1d0f\u0280 (@khushikapoor)\n\nBut what maximised her beauty was her relaxed, sun-kissed attitude. The true beach enthusiast nailed each of her looks while embracing the simplicity of leaving the hair loose alongside a sun-kissed glow on her face and natural makeup. She was found suggesting fashion goals for a coastal cool look in a vibrant crochet shrug, then a striking red bikini look, followed by a sleek red high-neck bodycon dress and finally a black bikini top.",

Firstly, for the longest time, people would still be wishing us and what we were feeling with each other and that's what we received from the world around us. We were just newly married forever, which is great.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked if Abhishek's comment of her fighting with him every day was true, the actress said, \"That's what I mean when they say we've been together for 10 years. We were normal from the beginning, from the beginning. Throughout the day, I think we go through an entire movie. It all happens really, really quickly. Time is precious for us, so we have our little dramatics all day very quickly (sic).\"\r\n\r\nRumours are rife about Abhishek's entanglement with actress Nimrat Kaur during the shooting of their movie 'Dasvi'.\r\n\r\nAs per media reports Aishwarya has been living separately from her husband and his family.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two are very cordial to each other whenever they meet publicly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Abhishek is gearing up for his upcoming movie 'I Want To Talk'.\r\n\r\nThe film is directed by the National Award-winning director Shoojit Sircar.\r\n\r\nRecently, the actor took to the Stories section of his Instagram, and shared a video in which he shared his opinion on the rising use of artificial intelligence, and how it will never be at par with natural stupidity.",

She says, \u201cVivian mujhe itna toh haq hai aapko launch karne ke baad, kuch sawaal main khud kar sakun. Agar aapne 8-10 kaam kiya toh kya?? Toh kya? Ghar ke sare log aapko pedestal par chadha de?

Does that mean everyone in the house should place you on a pedestal?]\u201d Vivian, in his defence, says, \"Aisa maine kabhi nahi kaha. [I never said that].\" To this, Ekta Kapoor replies, \"Toh ye kaam ka ghamand aap kisko dikha rahe hain? Vivian Ghar ke conversation se door bhagta hai aur agar aisa he karna tha toh 8 saal baad aap kyun aaye Bigg Boss par?\" [So, who are you showing this arrogance about your work to?

Now, Bhoothnath 3 is reportedly in the works, with T-Series and BR Films teaming up for the project. \u201cBhoothnath 3 is in the development stage at the moment, and the producers are toying with the idea of bringing Bhoothnath back to the spectacle. If everything goes as planned, Bhoothnath 3 will go on floors in 2025, for a 2026 release. The script work has begun and the makers are happy with the germ that they have for Bhoothnath 3,\u201d a source close to the project shared with Pinkvilla.The insider further mentioned that casting for Bhoothnath 3 is still in progress, but the makers hope to bring back both Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, as seen in the first two films. \u201cWhile part one and two had a cameo of Shah Rukh Khan, the makers are aiming at bigger goals for the third instalment, though everything will boil down to the script eventually.

        "text": "Brianna 'Chickenfry' LaPaglia has opened up about her alleged rocky relationship with country music star Zach Bryan, sharing how he reportedly ruined her 2024 Golden Globes experience.\n\nSpeaking on the latest episode of the BFFs podcast, LaPaglia accused Bryan of emotional abuse, trying to control her image, and making her feel \u201ctwisted in the head.\u201d\n\nDuring the podcast, LaPaglia detailed her tumultuous time with Bryan, including claims of emotional abuse. She also alleged that Bryan asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which she refused.\n\n\"He made sure to ruin anything good I did for myself,\" LaPaglia said, claiming that her birthday, tour, and Golden Globes night were all negatively impacted by him.\n\nLaPaglia and Bryan had gone public with their relationship in July 2023 and dated for over a year. Bryan confirmed their breakup in October 2024, but their issues reportedly ran deeper than the split.\n\n One of the major moments LaPaglia shared was Bryan\u2019s reaction to her Golden Globes outfit. She shared that she attended the event in high spirits and posted a series of photos on Instagram, only for Bryan to criticize her attire.\n\n\"He said he didn\u2019t want to date someone that presents themselves that way,\" she recalled. Bryan\u2019s response reportedly escalated to him unfollowing her on social media and unfollowing others as well.\n\nLaPaglia described how her mood shifted drastically: \u201cThat was the first time he had really tried to control what I wore and what I posted. Everything was going great until I sent him pictures. Then it turns into, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re wearing this \u2026 blah blah blah.\u2019\u201d\n\nLaPaglia explained how Bryan\u2019s behavior affected her emotionally. \"It ruins the night,\" she said, adding that she cried to her friend Grace O\u2019Malley during the event. Despite the backlash, Bryan reposted one of her photos from the night on his Instagram Story, calling her \u201cso beautiful.\u201d\n\n The influencer felt confused and manipulated by his mixed signals. \"It was just such a tug of war with my emotions,\" she shared. Bryan\u2019s alleged demands included asking her to delete certain Instagram pictures and adjust her social media presence to align with his preferences.\n\nThe couple went public in mid-2023 but officially split in late 2024. While LaPaglia has been vocal about her side of the story, Bryan has not publicly responded to her claims.\n\nBoth LaPaglia and Bryan\u2019s representatives have yet to comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, LaPaglia continues to share her experiences with her audience, shedding light on the emotional toll of their time together.\n\nALSO READ: \u2018I'm Scared Of Him:\u2019 Brianna LaPaglia Alleges Ex Zach Bryan Abused Her",

        "title": "When Jaya Bachchan Called Aishwarya Rai Her Buddy, Said They Enjoy 'Talking Rubbish': 'I Don\u2019t Play Politics...'",
        "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan are dominating headlines with rumours that they might be headed for a divorce. This has left fans shocked and curious. The couple, who has been married for over sixteen years, have recently fueled speculation through their distant social media activity and fewer joint appearances. The whispers grew louder with reports suggesting that Aishwarya Rai may have even moved out of the iconic Bachchan residence, Jalsa. The Bachchan family \u2013 Jaya Bachchan, Amitabh Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan \u2013 has been tight-lipped about it.\nBack in the day, in a chat with Rediff, Jaya Bachchan had opened up on her relationship with daughter-in-law, Aishwarya Rai. Dubbing her a friend, she had said, \u201cShe is my buddy. If I don\u2019t like something about her, I tell her on her face. I don\u2019t do politics behind her back. If she disagrees with me, she expresses herself.\u201d\nShe went on to add, \u201cOnly difference is that I can be little more dramatic and she has to be more respectful. I am old, you know. That\u2019s all,\u201d she said.\nShe had also opened up about how they spend time together, given Aishwarya\u2019s busy schedule. \u201cWe really enjoy sitting at home and talking rubbish. Just the two of us. She doesn\u2019t have much time, but whatever she does, we enjoy. I have a great relationship with her,\u201d she had shared.\nOn November 1, fans noticed that neither Amitabh, Abhishek, nor Shweta Bachchan publicly wished Aishwarya Rai Bachchan a happy birthday. The lack of any acknowledgment from her in-laws and husband sparked curiosity and stirred up conversation online, leaving fans confused \u2014 and some even disappointed \u2014 by their silence on Aishwarya\u2019s special day.\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai\u2019s love story began as a friendship on film sets, with early collaborations like Dhai Akshar Prem Ke (2000) and Kuch Naa Kaho (2003). Their romance developed during the filming of Umrao Jaan (2005-2006), and the two tied the knot on April 20, 2007, in a lavish ceremony. Prior to their marriage, Aishwarya had been linked with Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi. In 2011, the couple welcomed their daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan.",

        "text": "Three individuals have reportedly been charged in connection with the death of singer Liam Payne, according to a press release from the National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor\u2019s Office on Wednesday. Payne, 31, tragically passed away in Buenos Aires on October 16 after a fall from a third-floor balcony at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel. Those charged include a friend of Payne, a hotel employee, and an alleged drug dealer.\nThe friend who reportedly claimed to be Payne\u2019s manager has been charged with \u201cabandoning him\u201d after his death. As per the reports when Payne fell, police tried reaching the friend using a contact number from the hotel managers but he did not respond. The friend later provided testimony as a witness which led a judge to decide that he had allegedly breached his duty of care with respect to Payne. If convicted, he could face a prison sentence of five to 15 years.\nThe hotel employee and a third individual have been accused of supplying Payne with narcotics during his stay. Both are facing charges related to the distribution of drugs.\nA report in The Daily Mail linked Rogelio \u201cRoger\u201d Nores, a close friend of Payne, to the case. In an exclusive interview with the outlet, Nores denied any involvement as a suspect in the singer\u2019s death investigation.\nNores, an Argentinian businessman who befriended Payne in 2020, clarified that he visited Payne\u2019s hotel on the day of the incident but left about 40 minutes before the tragedy occurred.\n\u201cI never abandoned Liam. I went to his hotel three times that day and left 40 minutes before this happened. There were over 15 people at the hotel lobby chatting and joking with him when I left,\u201d he said.\nNores further told the outlet that he never \u201cimagined something like this would happen.\u201d He also confirmed giving his statement to the prosecutor as a witness the day after Payne\u2019s death but hasn\u2019t spoken to law enforcement since. Nores also made it clear that he was never Payne\u2019s manager but rather a close friend.\nToxicology reports showed that in the 72 hours prior to his death, Payne had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system, as reported by NBC News. Earlier reports indicated that the singer had \u201cpink cocaine\u201d in his system when he died.\nOfficials reported that Payne was found to have a recreational drug in his system, commonly made with MDMA, ketamine, and methamphetamine, with minimal traces of cocaine. The pink colour of the drug was attributed to food colouring. According to the prosecutor\u2019s office, the cause of death was determined to be \u201cmultiple trauma\u201d and \u201cinternal and external hemorrhage\u201d resulting from the fall from the hotel\u2019s third-floor balcony.",

        "text": "\"Not sure about wiser, but older for sure\", that is how Virat Kohli described turning 36 on November 05, 2024. After Team India's humiliating 0-3 witewash against New Zealand in the Test series, the mood in the camp was understandably a gloomy one. Kohli didn't make any public appearance on the occasion and also stayed away from social media. Attending an event after his 36th birthday, Virat revealed how he, wife Anushka Sharma celebrated his birthday in a low-key manner.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In fact, kohli even called it the most chilled out birhtday he has ever had, spending quality time with his wife and the kids at home.\"I don't know about being wiser, but I'm older for sure,\" Kohli told Gaurav Kapoor at the event.\"This was probably the most chilled-out birthday I've had through all these years. It was just Anushka (Sharma) and our two kids at home. It was very relaxed.\"While it was Virat's birthday, the iconic batter said that the day was more for his daughter, just like a typical dad.\"The birthday was basically for my daughter. Happens so when you have kids,\" remarked Kohli.\r\n\u201cthe birthday was for my daughter\u201d pic.twitter.com/BTfeKqrDTY\r\n\u2014 (@manmarziiyaan) November 7, 2024\r\nKohli didn't have the best of New Zealand series that saw him fail to even cross the 100-run mark cumulatively in 6 innings. His form in the series has been labelled by many as one of the biggest factors behind the team's defeat.With India all set to travel to Australia next, the experts and fans are counting on Virat to produce an upturn in his form and lead the troops with the bat. Traditionally, Australia has been a happy hunting ground for Kohli, with some of his finest knocks coming Down Under. Since India's World Test Championship hopes rely on a series win in Australia, Kohli's form will be crucial to the target.",

Given how the previous chapter shifted focus to Zodyl\u2019s traumatic childhood, it\u2019s possible that Zodyl is the same friend Arkha mentioned.\n\nThis connection could reveal more about Arkha\u2019s motivations and his bond with Zodyl. Additionally, Arkha might provide Rudo with new instructions, possibly involving his next steps in their joint mission to unravel the world\u2019s secrets. \n\nMeanwhile, preparations for the upcoming Doll Festival could take precedence, with Rudo and Enjin focusing on their involvement in this significant event.

Arkha explains that the Cleaners\u2019 first leader noticed remnants of a lost civilization, such as the mural of the first Spellcaster, Macaca Icol, and relics tied to Rudo\u2019s ancestor, Canis Surebrec.\n\nThe Cleaners were then formed to clear Trash Beasts and discover hidden truths. In Gachiakuta Chapter 116, Arkha admits he withheld this information so Rudo could learn its value through his journey.\nhttps://twitter.com/DomoSenpaiTV/status/1853892197529083932He elaborates on the motivations of various Cleaners, acknowledging his own selfishness in using them for his goals.

        "text": "The last chapter of Hunter X Hunter brought about significant developments to the story, bringing the long-awaited rematch between two of the series' most powerful fighters that much closer. Now, the focus set to shift away from the ongoing battle among the Kakin Princes and Kurapika.\n\nThe upcoming Hunter X Hunter Chapter 406 will likely turn towards the mafia families, the Phantom Troupe, and Hisoka\u2019s movements, so don\u2019t miss it. Keep reading to find out everything you need to know about the release of the chapter, as well as where to read it and so on.\nHunter X Hunter Chapter 406: Release date and where to read\n\nHunter X Hunter Chapter 406 is scheduled for release on Monday, November 11, 2024, at 12 am JST, as announced by MANGAPlus. International readers will have early access on November 10, with release times adjusted to their respective time zones.\n\nThe chapter will be available across multiple platforms, including Viz Media\u2019s official website, Shueisha\u2019s MANGAPlus, and the Shonen Jump+ app. Additionally, a physical version of Hunter X Hunter Chapter 406 will be included in Weekly Shonen Jump Issue 50.\nExpected plot in Hunter X Hunter Chapter 406\n\nHunter X Hunter Chapter 406 will likely see Dogman\u2019s role become critical as he makes use of his ability to identify individuals' Nen capabilities amidst the large crowds gathered for Halkenburg\u2019s funeral. He will likely sniff out a target for Sodom to kidnap, aiming to bring this person back to Morena, who could then use her Nen ability to manipulate them into awakening their powers.\n\nThis development suggests that the Heil-Ly Family may be seeking to expand their ranks by forcefully turning more people into Nen users. Meanwhile, the real Hisoka\u2019s involvement in the Succession War arc appears to be growing. With Bonolenov impersonating him, there is potential for a deadly confrontation if Hisoka decides to eliminate the impostor.\n\nAdditionally, hints suggest Hisoka might be collaborating with a significant figure, possibly Morena, which could complicate matters for both the Phantom Troupe and the mafia families. This alliance may lead to further conflict in Hunter X Hunter Chapter 406, possibly resulting in another casualty among the Phantom Troupe members.\nHunter X Hunter Chapter 405 recap\n\nHunter X Hunter Chapter 405, titled Performance, begins with Hisoka gambling at a casino, where he wins a jackpot. Thinking about recent events, he reveals his awareness of the Chimera Ant incident and the chaos aboard the Black Whale, which he attributes to a group activity led by a Nen Beast.\n\nHisoka\u2019s primary goal, however, remains to find a worthy opponent. Nearby, Bonolenov observes him, uncertain if the person before him is the real Hisoka or an impostor. A flashback reveals Chrollo\u2019s instructions for Bonolenov to impersonate Hisoka to distract the mafia.\nhttps://twitter.com/BRATILLUMI/status/1853109519498269069Chrollo warns him that the real Hisoka may already be in Tier 1, advising caution. Meanwhile, Nobunaga, Feitan, and Phinks meet with Wang and Tajao, discussing their suspicions that the Heil-Ly Family\u2019s current behavior does not match a traditional mafia group in Hunter X Hunter Chapter 405.\n\nNobunaga suggests that Morena\u2019s leadership may involve manipulation through Nen. Hunter X Hunter Chapter 405 concludes with Morena planning to use Halkenburg\u2019s funeral for her own schemes and ordering Dogman to locate a specific individual.\n\nFor more updates from the Hunter X Hunter manga, keep up with Pinkvilla.\n\n*The release dates and times provided are accurate at the time of writing and are subject to change at the discretion of the creators.",

        "text": "The One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers were recently leaked online and is packed with a number of significant developments and dramatic reveals across its 17 pages. Keep reading to find out everything you need to know about them, including the state of the Straw Hats who escaped the diorama, as well as those on the way to Elbaph\u2019s shores. \nOne Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers\n\nAs per the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers, the upcoming chapter is titled \u2018Loki of the Underworld.\u2019 The cover story features Yamato in pursuit of the thief from the previous cover story. She is riding Komachiyo, followed by Tama and Speed.\n\nThe chapter then picks up from where the last one left off, with Luffy overjoyed to have finally reached Elbaph. He marvels at the massive size of the island and the grandeur of the giants, expressing his excitement nonstop. \n\nHowever, Loki, who is imprisoned in the Underworld, grows increasingly irritated as Luffy doesn\u2019t let him get a word in. Finally, Loki snaps, yelling for Luffy to be silent, his powerful roar scaring away the wolves patrolling the area.\nLoki\u2019s introduction is then officially shown with a title box revealing his epithet as the \u201cAccursed Prince of Elbaph\u201d and his impressive bounty of 2.6 billion berries, as set by the World Government. Loki proclaims himself to be the \u201cSun God\u201d of Elbaph, demanding that Luffy acknowledge his authority. \n\nLuffy remains unfazed, simply noting that Loki is clearly imprisoned. Loki then reveals in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers that he has been bound for six years by Sea Prism Stone chains, attached to the legendary \u201cTreasure Tree Adam,\u201d which forms the foundation of the Warland kingdom.\n\nHe is unable to break free from this imprisonment and proposes a deal to Luffy. If Luffy retrieves a key from the village above and frees him, Loki promises to annihilate any pirate crew of Luffy\u2019s choosing.\nIn the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers, Loki goes on to explain that this snowy area is known as the \u201cUnderworld,\u201d serving as both a prison and an execution ground for giants who have committed serious crimes. It\u2019s a desolate place where beasts, the \u201ckings of the mountains,\u201d roam freely.\n\nLoki claims these beasts have been his companions since childhood, issuing a veiled threat to Luffy that the creatures would not hesitate to attack if ordered. In a double-page spread, five enormous beasts\u2014reminiscent of the creatures Luffy trained with on Rusukaina Island\u2014emerge from the forest.\n\nThese include a polar bear, a gorilla, a wolf, a snake, and a mammoth. Loki\u2019s subordinates, who appear wearing gas masks and animal skins to protect themselves from the beasts in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers, watch in anticipation. \nHowever, Luffy quickly subdues all the beasts in a single panel, demonstrating his immense strength. The beasts, instead of attacking, respond affectionately to Luffy, much to the shock of Loki and his followers.\n\nThis unexpected turn prompts Loki\u2019s subordinates to start talking about a similar incident where Shanks had overpowered the giants and their creatures during a previous visit in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers. \n\nLuffy, intrigued by the mention of Shanks, begins questioning Loki\u2019s subordinates about his former mentor\u2019s presence in Elbaph. Loki mocks Luffy\u2019s evident admiration for Shanks by calling him a \u201cchicken pirate,\u201d a taunt that triggers Luffy into transforming into Gear 4th.\nLuffy launches a powerful punch at Loki, who narrowly dodges, though visibly startled. The scene then shifts to Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and others who are being pursued by the giant Road. Gerd and Goldberg are chasing Road, trying to stop him in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers.\n\nZoro contemplates cutting Road down, but Usopp suggests that they might be allies with Dorry and Brogy. The group decides to flee towards the Elbaph village above rather than engage in a fight. In another part of the Underworld, Hajrudin and Stansen are shown hunting a massive moose. \n\nThey successfully bring down the beast, which they plan to share with the Straw Hats as a token of gratitude for past help. The One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers briefly recap the formation of the New Giant Warrior Pirates, emphasizing their deep respect for Luffy and his crew.\nThe spoilers then cut to the Straw Hat crew aboard their ship approaching Elbaph. Robin, in preparation for a reunion with Jaguar D. Saul, asks Brook to cut her hair back to her pre-timeskip style. Brook nervously complies, turning Robin\u2019s appearance back to how she looked during her earlier adventures.\n\nThe rest of the crew, including Franky, Jinbe, and Bonney, are delighted by Robin\u2019s new (yet nostalgic) look. As the ship approaches the colossal island of Elbaph, the crew is awestruck by its sheer size in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers. \nhttps://twitter.com/Rexplorer/status/1854566931090870501The giants on board cheer in excitement, preparing for another round of celebrations once they land. The spoilers then conclude with a sudden shift in tone. Somewhere deep within Elbaph, a giant is seen panicking.\n\nThe giant then starts urgently calling for help as he reveals that Saul has collapsed and is unresponsive. The One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers end with this cliffhanger and reveal that no break is scheduled for next week. \n\nFor more updates and spoilers from the One Piece manga, keep up with Pinkvilla.\n\n*The spoilers provided here are not official and should be taken with caution.

On Friday in Bengaluru, Gupta encouraged women entrepreneurs to embrace their feminine leadership qualities and scale their businesses despite societal expectations.\u201cI have been told by people that I am \u2018too emotional\u2019 and that it would hurt my work as a leader. However, the same person, after seeing my performance, later acknowledged that being emotional is actually my core strength and helps me be a good boss,\u201d she said, adding that finding one's own voice is essential for entrepreneurs.Edelweiss CEO was speaking at an event organised by IIM Bangalore\u2019s NSRCEL business incubator and the Goldman Sachs \u201810,000 Women Finance for Growth\u2019 initiative, which focuses on supporting women entrepreneurs.Speaking about the need for women to stop being apologetic, Gupta said that displaying emotions should be acceptable. \u201cIf men on trading floors can express aggression during market volatility and use bad words, my occasional meltdown\u2014which hasn\u2019t impacted my team\u2019s performance for seven years\u2014is also valid,\u201d she remarked, admitting that she still cries at work on certain occasions.Advising women on how to scale their businesses in a competitive market, the Edelweiss CEO emphasised the importance of finding \u201cleverage.\u201d \u201cYou constantly need to find ways to leverage\u2014leverage people and leverage processes.

During the episode, Vikrant revealed that despite his two-decade career in the industry, this was his first time meeting the legendary actor. Manoj, too, shared personal memories about how the show played a role in his journey to becoming an IPS officer and the unique challenges of his profession.\nExpressing his admiration for the show, Manoj recalled how KBC impacted his preparation for the UPSC exams. He told Bachchan, \u201cI never imagined that this show would be so beneficial for students preparing for the UPSC. We used to stand at the pan shop or roadside eateries, waiting for 9 PM to prepare for the UPSC through the show. There were times when we felt like our preparation was complete. But as soon as you started asking questions, we realized our preparation was far from enough. Until then, general knowledge wasn\u2019t prioritised much in schools.\u201d\nManoj continued, \u201cWhat KBC did was make teachers and parents realize the importance of general knowledge and the need to teach it to children. I consider myself very fortunate to be sitting in front of you today!\u201d\nThe episode also touched on the challenges of being in law enforcement, as Manoj\u2019s mother humorously mentioned to Bachchan that her son rarely visits home for festivals. Responding to this, Manoj shared, \u201cSir, police cannot celebrate festivals. Till date, I haven\u2019t celebrated a single Diwali. Once you wear khakhee then you don\u2019t have a religion or caste, you dedicate your whole life to the country as a policeman.\u201d He added that police officers often work without fixed shifts, sometimes for an entire day or even three days straight.\nIn the same episode, Vikrant reflected on the significance of his first meeting with Big B, saying, \u201cSitting on this hot seat and meeting you in person is a huge moment for me. I\u2019ve worked in cinema for 12-13 years and spent 8 years in television. In my nearly 20-year career, this is the first time I\u2019ve had the chance to meet you in person.\u201d\nAmitabh Bachchan warmly replied, \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve met many times before. Watching your performances, it feels like you\u2019re one of us, like family.\u201d",

In recent developments Nayani Pavani was the ninth contestant to be evicted from the show and thus came to an end of her stay at the Bigg Boss house.The grouping of the contestants for week 9 was pleasing to the eyes with the most featuring five on the ringing Rhodes including Gautam Krishna, Yashmi Goud, Hariteja, Tasty Teja and Nayani Pavani. Fans noticed a trend in the fan voting procedure where Yashmi Goud had been first for the majority of the week but got off the umbrella towards the end. During the last days of the week near the latter stages this position was closely followed by Gautam Krishna. Eventually, the tassel was between Nayani Pavani and Hariteja with the latter managing to secure enough voting on the last day to get into space giving an exit to Nayani.Nayani Pavani was in the house for about one month at the most. As one who has always been busy and with energy, Nayani probably earned approximately Rs 1.5 lakh on a weekly basis so the end total for her on this was about Rs 6 lakh. Again, despite all of her strategic maneuvers and her narrow lenses that focused on objectives, she was not able to avoid being eliminated in week 9, hence went home with her head held high.Preparation as the next winner is about to be decided and eyes are on what more goes down in Bigg Boss Telugu 8.",

        "text": "Rumours about Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan\u2019s marriage have been circulating online, but recent news suggests a fresh chapter may be unfolding for the couple \u2013 this time on screen! Renowned filmmaker Mani Ratnam is reportedly planning a new Hindi film, set to star the iconic \u201cGuru\u201d couple, Abhishek and Aishwarya. This potential collaboration is generating excitement, hinting at a reunion that could squash any speculations surrounding their relationship.\nIn 2007, Mani Ratnam\u2019s Guru brought the couple together on screen just as they were about to tie the knot. The chemistry between them impressed audiences, and Ratnam later cast them again in Raavan. According to a TimesNow.com report, the filmmaker has finally found a compelling story to reunite the Bachchan duo for a third film.\nThis would be Abhishek\u2019s fourth collaboration with Ratnam, having first worked with him in Yuva. Reflecting on his deep bond with Ratnam, Abhishek once shared with Zoom, \u201cWhen he had come to our home for the first time to sign me for Yuva, I thought he had come to sign Pa (father Amitabh Bachchan). When I got to know it was me he wanted I was beyond ecstatic. Any actor would give a limb to work with Mani. I take great pride in the fact that he found me worthy of his cinema thrice, so far, and that too without losing any limbs.\u201d\nDespite recent whispers of trouble in their marriage, Abhishek and Aishwarya have faced such rumours before. Back in 2014, similar claims surfaced, but Abhishek dismissed them with humour, tweeting, \u201cOk. So I believe I\u2019m getting divorced. Thanks for letting me know! Will you let me know when I\u2019m getting remarried too?\u201d \nWith their electrifying on-screen presence and unwavering fan support, this reunion with Mani Ratnam could be an iconic moment for Abhishek and Aishwarya, rekindling the magic they\u2019ve created in their past films.",

        "text": "Actor-filmmaker Dhanush may be heading for a reconciliation with his wife, filmmaker Aishwarya Rajinikanth, if recent developments, including a meeting on Diwali day, are anything to go by. The couple, who separated in 2022 after 18 years of marriage, had filed for divorce by mutual consent in the Chennai Family Court. However, their divorce proceedings have seen multiple adjournments due to the absence of both parties. After they missed court dates on October 7 and 19, and November 2, November 21 has been set as the new date for a hearing. Speculation about their reconciliation surfaced when Dhanush acknowledged Aishwarya\u2019s social media post celebrating Onam. The couple\u2019s no-show at court hearings also led to talk about a reunion. Reports of a meeting on Diwali day at Rajinikanth\u2019s Poes Garden residence added strength to the rumours. The veteran star reportedly engaged in an open discussion with Dhanush on that day. Sources close to the family indicate that during the meeting, Dhanush shared his perspective with his father-in-law, and apparently made some commitments toward a reunion. The same sources reveal that Dhanush and Aishwarya subsequently celebrated Diwali together with their sons, Linga and Yatra. Both film personalities continue to maintain active professional lives. Dhanush recently appeared in Raayan and has completed his next directorial project, Nilavukku En Mel Ennadi Kobam. He is awaiting the release of Kubera, directed by Sekhar Kammula. Aishwarya\u2019s latest directorial work, Laal Salaam, featuring her father Rajinikanth, was released earlier this year.",

        "text": "In a recent viral video, Natasa Stankovic, ex-wife of cricketer Hardik Pandya, shares a light-hearted moment with fitness trainer Aleksandar Alex Ilic as he helps her with her saree. The video, posted by Alex, shows him meticulously stitching and draping Natasa\u2019s black saree before she heads out. He humorously captioned it, \u201cI should become a draper and tailor,\u201d capturing the friendly bond between them. Natasa later reposted the video on her Instagram story, adding, \u201cMy best friend is better than yours.\u201d\nHowever, the playful interaction didn\u2019t sit well with some of Hardik\u2019s fans, who quickly began trolling Natasa. Speculation around Natasa and Alex\u2019s relationship has been swirling for a while now. While some fans have speculated that they are cousins, Natasa has neither confirmed nor denied any of these assumptions. The video sparked renewed confusion among followers, with one user commenting, \u201cAre you guys a couple? I\u2019m confused.\u201d Another remarked, \u201cTwo-minute silence for all the tailors out there.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Aleksandar Alex Ilic (@iamaleksandarilic)\n\nDespite the online chatter, Natasa and Alex have often been seen together at social events, including the recent star-studded Diwali bash in Mumbai. The duo attended the event in coordinated outfits, with Natasa dressed in a glamorous black saree embellished with gold motifs, while Alex donned a matching ethnic ensemble. \nSince her separation from Hardik Pandya earlier this year, Natasa\u2019s life and relationships have been under intense public scrutiny. The former couple, who got married in 2020, announced their split earlier this year, stating that it was a mutual decision made in the best interest of their son, Agastya. Despite parting ways, Hardik remains a significant part of Agastya\u2019s life, while Natasa has primary custody of their child.\n\u201cAfter 4 years of being together, (we) have decided to mutually part ways. We tried our best together and gave it our all, and we believe this is in the best interest for the both of us. This was a tough decision for us to make, given the joy, mutual respect and companionship we enjoyed together and as we grew a family,\u201d Hardik and Natasa jointly said in a statement.",

        "text": "Ananya Panday and Sara Ali Khan are two Bollywood stars who\u2019ve managed to defy the cliche that \u201cfemale actors can never be friends.\u201d Although many assumed they would see each other as rivals, their appearance on Karan Johar\u2019s chat show last year showcased a surprisingly genuine friendship. However, there was a time when things were quite different between them. Ananya recently shared a story about how she used to be terrified of Sara\u2019s bold personality during their school days.\nIn a recent interview clip that surfaced online, Ananya opened up about her memories of Sara from their school years. \u201cThere was always this myth about Sara Ali Khan,\u201d Ananya said, laughing. \u201cI would actually hide from her in school because I used to be terrified. She\u2019s always been \u2018muhfat\u2019 (outspoken). Even now, she says whatever\u2019s on her mind, but in school, she was even more \u2018muhfat\u2019 and used to really say anything. I\u2019d be like, \u2018She\u2019s going to say something about me!\u2019\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Quirkisstan (@quirkisstan)\n\nAnanya clarified that while Sara didn\u2019t bully her, she also never bothered to remember her name, joking, \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what my name was and she didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d Recalling a school play where Sara had the lead role, Ananya mentioned that instead of learning her name, Sara would simply call her \u201cAye girl, come here.\u201d\nThe clip has since gone viral, sparking mixed reactions among fans. Some criticised Ananya, accusing her of using the story to gain sympathy or shade Sara. One comment read, \u201cAnanya trying so hard to act all cute but ends up defaming other actors for sympathy.\u201d Meanwhile, other netizens backed Ananya, calling Sara\u2019s behaviour pretentious and stating, \u201cShe\u2019s been putting on a \u2018goody-goody\u2019 image for too long. Good that her real personality is coming out.\u201d\nProfessionally, Ananya is currently riding high after the success of her thriller CTRL, while Sara is gearing up for her upcoming film Metro\u2026 In Dino.",

With the much appreciation he has been receiving for his role, Arjun has had his share of lows. In a recent interview, the Bollywood star opened up about dealing with failures in life. He revealed that he was undergoing the worst phase of his life \u2018personally, professionally, emotionally, mentally and physically\u2019 when he signed Singham Again.\nIn an interaction with The Hollywood Reporter, Arjun Kapoor talked about his struggles of living with an autoimmune disorder. \u201cMy health has always been, unfortunately, something which I\u2019ve not openly spoken about,\u201d he said. The actor added, \u201cI have something called Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis. It\u2019s an extension of having a thyroid issue. Your antibodies fight against you. It\u2019s almost like I can take a flight and gain weight because the body goes into stress.\u201d\nArjun highlighted that to deal with such an autoimmune condition, self-care and stress management are crucial. As he worked for 18 hours at a stretch, he often used to neglect his health. \u201cThe stress mode is when your antibodies believe something is wrong, and it goes into action. The more relaxed I am, the better I look \u2014 which is ironic, because in this profession, you\u2019re not really relaxed,\u201d he added.\nThe actor also discussed how therapy has helped him through the tough times. While he faced issues with his personal life, Arjun wasn\u2019t also satisfied with his professional endeavours. He asserted, \u201cI was not a happy person and the fire within me diminished.\u201d Arjun went on to add, \u201cAnd I\u2019m taking this opportunity to say that if I had not sought therapy, even if this film had turned out the way it did, I would still be a conflicted soul on a personal level.\u201d\nSingham Again, which released on November 1, features a stellar cast including Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone, among others. It is the third instalment of Rohit Shetty\u2019s Singham franchise and has been produced by Rohit Shetty Productions, Jio Studios and Reliance Entertainment. The first part of the franchise, Singham, released in 2011 while the second instalment, Singham Returns, hit the theatres in 2014.",

        "title": "BTS Star V To Release Special Version Of Bing Crosby's 'White Christmas'",
        "text": "BTS star Kim Taehyung aka V is ready with a surprise gift this Christmas. In a special collaboration, V will release a new version of Bing Crosby\u2019s timeless classic White Christmas, more than 80 years since its debut, his agency announced on Wednesday. The 28-year-old K-pop sensation will join the legendary singer posthumously on a new remix of the 1942 hit, which is set for release on December 6. This collaboration, which is a partnership among the Bing Crosby Estate, Primary Wave Music and Geffen Records, is said to be an \u201cera-bridging\u201d project.\nTo be released as a duet, the song comes almost 47 years after Crosby\u2019s last duet \u2013 his 1977 collaboration with David Bowie on \u201cPeace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Bing Crosby (@bingcrosby)\n\nSpeaking up about the collaboration, V shared that he feels very grateful to have had the opportunity to be featured in a song by his all-time favorite jazz artist. \u201cI grew up listening to his song \u2018It\u2019s Been a Long, Long Time\u2019 on repeat, so it feels like such an honor to sing alongside the voice of someone I admire so much on White Christmas. As a huge fan of his, I sang with deep respect and admiration. And I hope the listeners will enjoy the song as much as I did while recording it. Wishing everyone a wonderful holiday season!\u201d he said in a statement.\nFor those unaware, the song, originally recorded for the 1942 film Holiday Inn, was later featured prominently in the 1954 movie White Christmas. One of Crosby\u2019s beloved tracks, it is still regarded as the best-selling single of all time. \nCrosby passed away in 1977. \nMore On V\u2019s Music Plans\nThe collaborative song will arrive almost months after the release of V\u2019s solo single \u201cFRI(END)S\u201d and his duet, Wherever U R.\nThe K-pop star is currently serving his mandatory military service in South Korea alongside four of his BTS bandmates, SUGA, RM, Jimin and Jung Kook. The other eldest members, Jin and J-Hope, were recently discharged from the military. As suggested by HYBE, the entire group is expected to reunite in 2025 and resume future activities in 2026.",

        "text": "Ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle encouraged their followers to vote but stopped short of endorsing either of the two major candidates: Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump. Despite widespread speculation about their political leanings, particularly given Meghan\u2019s status as a U.S. citizen, the couple refrained from publicly supporting any candidate.\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s Displeasure with Trump\u2019s Re-election\n\nWhile Harry and Meghan did not formally endorse any candidate in the 2024 race, it is widely believed that they lean toward the Democratic Party. Meghan, in particular, is reportedly unhappy with Trump\u2019s re-election. The couple\u2019s stance on the election is seen as a continuation of their cautious approach to political matters since stepping back from their royal roles.\n\nEncouraging Voter Participation, but Avoiding Endorsements\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex released a video encouraging Americans to vote, with Meghan calling the race \u201cthe most important election of our lifetime.\u201d Although Harry, as a non-U.S. citizen, did not vote, he acknowledged the importance of participating in the democratic process. He also reiterated that he had never voted in the UK, given the royal family\u2019s tradition of political neutrality.\n\nPrevious Support for Democratic Values\n\nThe couple has a history of advocating for democratic values and civic engagement. Ahead of the 2020 election, Meghan and Harry appeared in a video urging Americans to \u201creject hate speech, misinformation, and online negativity.\u201d While they did not explicitly support a candidate, their message was widely interpreted as backing Joe Biden and the Democrats. This sparked criticism in the UK for allegedly violating the royal protocol of political neutrality, though they had already stepped down from their senior royal roles by that time.\n\nTrump\u2019s Comments on Harry and Meghan\u2019s Move to the U.S.\n\nTrump has made several remarks about Harry and Meghan since their move to California in 2020. He stated that the Biden administration had been \u201ctoo gracious\u201d in their treatment of Harry, particularly concerning his visa status. Trump added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t protect him. He betrayed the Queen. That\u2019s unforgivable. He would be on his own if it was down to me.\u201d He also threatened to deport Harry during his second term.\n\nIn addition, Trump criticized Meghan, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of hers. I wish a lot of luck to Harry; he\u2019s going to need it,\u201d after she encouraged Americans to vote for Biden in 2020.\n\nCivic Engagement Through Archewell Foundation\n\nThrough their charity, the Archewell Foundation, Prince Harry and Meghan have long championed the importance of voting and civic engagement. They emphasized that voting is not just a right but a crucial way to influence the future of communities. \u201cAt The Archewell Foundation, we recognize that civic engagement, no matter one\u2019s political party, is at the heart of a more just and equitable world,\u201d they stated. \u201cBy participating in initiatives like this, we aim to amplify the message that every voice matters.\u201d\n\nVisa Controversy and Trump\u2019s Criticism of Harry\u2019s Immigration Status\n\nThe couple\u2019s visa status has been a source of tension, with Trump and other Republicans criticizing the Biden administration for being \u201ctoo gracious\u201d with Harry since his move to the U.S. Some royal observers have suggested that Harry and Meghan\u2019s recent purchase of a home in Portugal might be a \u201cbackup plan\u201d in case further visa issues arise, particularly after Harry\u2019s public admission of drug use in his memoir Spare. Royal expert Hugo Vickers commented, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if Trump suddenly said: Right, I\u2019m sending Prince Harry out of this country. I think it\u2019s very wise to take all the possibilities into account [and consider living elsewhere].\u201d\n\nWith the uncertainty surrounding Harry\u2019s visa status, the couple\u2019s potential move abroad is seen as a pragmatic response to the ongoing controversy.",

        "text": "Just like usual, Ariana Grande swept us off the floor with her acting and comedic timing during her October appearance on SNL, including her Charades With Mom sketch with Bowen Yang. But something happened during that sketch, because of which the SNL star apologized to her. Yang said sorry to the singer for opening his mouth \u201ctoo much\u201d when they kissed during that.\n\nGrande appeared on Yang and Matt Rogers\u2019 Las Culturistas podcast, in which he said, \u201cJust to switch gears: I really have to apologize to you in person. I opened my mouth up too much when we kissed on SNL.\u201d\n\nThe pop singer quipped, saying that he absolutely did. Grande said that she was shaking with laughter, not in a negative way but in a disarmed way.\n\nYang said that he kissed her too much, to which Grande expressed that it was okay. She added that they \u201cdropped in,\u201d and she shared about feeling like those people did need that at that time and what those characters required and she was all for that.\n\nOriginally, the kiss was not part of the sketch; it was Grande who first thought about adding it after their initial rehearsal. She reflected, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything because I was like, \u2018Oh, everyone\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m absolutely insane and too comfortable.\u2019\u2019 But I was like, \u2018Oh, how funny would it be if we kissed at the end?'\u201d\n\n Grande then said that Bowen texted her a few hours late and said that it was totally okay if that sounded \u201ctoo crazy,\u201d but they thought that it would be hilarious if they locked lips at the end.\n\nTo which the pop artist said that she was thinking the same.

        "text": "Happy birthday, Kiran Rao! Today, November 7 marks her 51st birthday and on this special occasion, let\u2019s uncover her hidden liking for a Khan in the industry. Surprisingly, it\u2019s not her ex-husband Aamir Khan. Talking about Kiran\u2019s career at a glance, the filmmaker has produced a number of films, including Jaane Tu\u2026 Ya Jaane Na, Peepli Live, Delhi Belly, Talaash, Dangal and Laal Singh Chaddha. She made her directorial debut with Dhobi Ghat in 2011, and her 2024 release Laapataa Ladies made waves after hitting OTT platform Netflix.\nGoing down the memory lane, in an old interview with India TV, Kiran Rao was asked about her favourite Khan in the industry. She was even given the example of Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s doting wife, Gauri Khan, who credits Aamir Khan as her favourite Khan in the industry. However, the filmmaker made a startling revelation and took Salman Khan\u2019s name. Aamir, who was also present during the interview, quizzed his ex-wife about the reason. To this, Kiran said, \u201cI just enjoy watching him. I haven\u2019t seen all his films, but woh jab aate hai main dekhna chahti hu unko (I want to see him when he appears). He\u2019s got charisma.\u201d\nKiran further mentioned that she finds Salman entertaining. The Laapataa Ladies director revealed that she had seen his movies Dabangg and No Entry, and found his work extremely well. She also stated, \u201cMaine Pyar Kiya, way back to his first film.\u201d This revelation of her admiration for Salman adds an intriguing layer to her personality.\nSalman Khan also tends to be a big fan of Kiran Rao\u2019s works. When the filmmaker\u2019s Laapataa Ladies premiered, the superstar took to his X handle and penned a heartfelt note for the entire team of the film. Initially his tweet read, \u201cJust saw Kiran Rao\u2019s Laapataa Ladies. Wah wah Kiran. I really enjoyed it and so did my father. Congrats on your debut as a director, superb job. Kab kaam karoge mere saath?\u201d However, Salman\u2019s tweet made a huge goof up, and he had to face social media trolling.\n\nBhai, why did you delete your earlier post? Kiran Rao ka phone aaya ya Aamir Khan ka? Debutant Director nahin hain woh.? pic.twitter.com/gHeVoDlleG\n\u2014 Team Saath Official\ud83e\udd1d (@TeamSaath) March 14, 2024\n\nSince Salman congratulated Kiran for her debut directorial while talking about Laapataa Ladies, netizens reminded him that Dhobi Ghat was her first film. They even highlighted that the actor had also attended the premiere. One user wrote, \u201cBro u literally attended the function for her directorial debut Dhobi Ghat 14 years ago,\u201d while another joked, \u201cThis is Dhobi Ghat erasure.\u201d\nSoon, he had to delete the previous one and repost it with the note that read, \u201cJust saw Kiran Rao\u2019s Laapataa Ladies. Wah wah (Wow, wow) Kiran. I really enjoyed it and so did my father. superb job. Kab kaam karoge mere saath? (When will you work with me?).\u201d\n\nJust saw Kiran Rao\u2019s Laapataa Ladies. Wah wah Kiran. I really enjoyed it n so did my father. superb job. Kab kaam karogi mere saath ?\n\u2014 Salman Khan (@BeingSalmanKhan) March 14, 2024\n\nTalking about Kiran Rao\u2019s Laapataa Ladies, the comedy-drama is backed by Aamir Khan. The film was released in theatres on March 1, and it stars Sparsh Shrivastava, Nitanshi Goel, Chhaya Kadam, Pratibha Ranta and Ravi Kishan. The movie received immense praise from the audience and has even been selected as India\u2019s official entry to the 97th Academy Awards.",

        "text": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have kept a low profile regarding their political leanings during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. While they didn\u2019t officially endorse any candidate, their past comments and actions suggest a preference for Democratic policies.\n\n2024 Election: No Public Endorsement\n\nAhead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were vocal about encouraging Americans to vote, though they refrained from backing either Democratic nominee Kamala Harris or Republican incumbent Donald Trump. Meghan Markle, a U.S. citizen, is reportedly unhappy with Trump\u2019s re-election, but neither she nor Prince Harry officially declared support for any political party.\n\nDespite the election results being almost final, with Trump set to assume office in January 2025, the couple has yet to publicly comment on the outcome of the race.\n\nMeghan and Harry\u2019s Calls to Action\n\nIn a pre-election video for Time 100, Meghan Markle emphasized the importance of voting, calling the presidential race \u201cthe most important election of our lifetime.\u201d She urged Americans to exercise their right to vote.\n\nPrince Harry, however, who is not a U.S. citizen, acknowledged that he wouldn\u2019t be voting in the 2024 election, citing the royal family\u2019s long-standing tradition of political neutrality. \u201cI\u2019ve never voted in the UK either,\u201d he noted, staying true to the royal protocol.\n\nReflections on the 2020 Election: Implicit Support for Biden\n\nBack in 2020, during the previous U.S. presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made waves with their video message urging Americans to \u201creject hate speech, misinformation, and online negativity.\u201d While they did not explicitly mention a candidate, many interpreted the message as an indirect endorsement of the Democrats, especially given Meghan\u2019s known criticism of Trump.\n\nTheir 2020 intervention sparked controversy, with accusations that they violated the tradition of political neutrality expected from royals. However, by then, the couple had stepped down from their senior royal roles.\n\nTrump\u2019s Criticism of Harry and Meghan\n\nThroughout the years, Donald Trump has made several pointed remarks about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. In particular, he criticized Harry\u2019s decision to leave the royal family and move to California. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t protect him. He betrayed the Queen. That\u2019s unforgivable,\u201d Trump said in an interview with The Express. He even went so far as to suggest that Harry would be left to \u201cfend for himself\u201d if it were up to him, following the Duke\u2019s departure from the UK.\n\nIn 2020, Trump remarked that Harry and Meghan should pay for their own security costs now that they were living in the U.S. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of hers,\u201d Trump added, speaking about Meghan Markle. \u201cI wish a lot of luck to Harry; he\u2019s going to need it.\u201d\n\nThe Archewell Foundation\u2019s Stance on Civic Engagement\n\nThrough their charitable organization, Archewell Foundation, Meghan and Harry have always emphasized the importance of civic engagement. In a statement, they affirmed that voting is not just a right but a critical way for individuals to influence the course of their communities and society. The foundation stressed that, \u201cAt The Archewell Foundation, we recognize that civic engagement, no matter one\u2019s political party, is at the heart of a more just and equitable world.\u201d\n\nTheir message echoed their commitment to a more inclusive and participatory democracy, even though their political alignment remains unclear.\n\nVisa Controversy and Trump\u2019s Criticism\n\nAlongside their political views, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s visa status in the U.S. has sparked further controversy. In particular, Trump and his allies have criticized the U.S. government\u2019s handling of Harry\u2019s visa since his move to California. Some Republican figures, including Trump, have suggested that the Biden administration has been \u201ctoo gracious\u201d toward the couple, fueling speculations that Harry\u2019s immigration status may become a point of contention in the future.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump hinted that he might take action against Harry if given the chance. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t protect him,\u201d Trump remarked. \u201cHe betrayed the Queen. That\u2019s unforgivable. He would be on his own if it was up to me.\u201d\n\nCould Portugal Become a Backup Plan?\n\nGiven the ongoing political tension, some royal watchers have speculated that the couple\u2019s recent purchase of a home in Portugal could be a \u201cbackup\u201d plan in case their U.S. visa status becomes an issue. This follows growing concerns about the potential fallout from Harry\u2019s admission in his memoir Spare, where he openly discussed his past drug use, including marijuana, cocaine, and psychedelics.\n\nThe Prince\u2019s Memoir and Its Impact\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s memoir Spare has only added to the scrutiny surrounding the couple\u2019s life in the U.S. Harry\u2019s public admission of his past drug use was a key moment in his book, and it has sparked public debate about his eligibility to remain in the U.S. Critics argue that such revelations could complicate his visa situation, and some have speculated that Trump, if re-elected, could take advantage of this to push for Harry\u2019s deportation.\n\nRoyal expert Hugo Vickers commented on the matter, stating, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if Trump suddenly said: Right, I\u2019m sending Prince Harry out of this country. I think it\u2019s very wise to take all the possibilities into account [and consider living elsewhere].\u201d\n\nFinal Thoughts: A Royal Couple\u2019s Political Neutrality in the Spotlight\n\nAlthough Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have been vocal about civic engagement and the need for political participation, they have carefully avoided directly endorsing any candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential race. This has sparked curiosity and debate, especially considering the ongoing tensions between the couple and the Trump administration.\n\nALSO READ: US Election Results: Trump\u2019s Return, What It Means For U.S. Business, Tariffs & Global Trade",

It's an extension of having a thyroid issue. Your antibodies fight against you. It's almost like I can take a flight and gain weight because the body goes into stress. The stress mode is when your antibodies believe something is wrong, and it goes into action. The more relaxed I am, the better I look \u2014 which is ironic because, in this profession, you're not really relaxed,\u201d he disclosed.View this post on InstagramA post shared by The Hollywood Reporter India (@hollywoodreporterindia)Arjun Kapoor, on Instagram, expressed gratitude to fans for showering their love on his role as Danger Lanka aka Zubair Hafeez in Singham Again.

While the particular question has been removed from the community, it didn\u2019t stop fans from reprimanding the group for their behaviour.\n\n?Jaejoong Jaefriends Hint EP.60?\nnickname : Ariana Eunande, Sinnyang, Baby Park Chanhogroup hint : Uuu Uuu Uuu~first impression of JJ : \u201cit\u2019s you, the beauty from class 8\u201d\nstreet says they\u2019re VIVIZ?\u2728the girls really coming to jaefriends?\n\uc7ac\uce5c\uad6c EP.60?\ufe0f7/11, 6PM KST\u2618\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/D5QhMFAJQb\n\u2014 TVXQ!

Of course, since it was a popular meme, I don\u2019t think the guests knew about its origins and proceeded with it. The reason fans are currently taking issue is because of the production team\u2019s lack of response, so you should be careful when editing this episode.\u201d\n\u201cPlease respect the host. The content of the next episode must be carefully reviewed and checked to ensure that there are no mistakes that affect the image of Jaejoong and the guests,\u201d another comment read.\n\nST7 PD Team Apologize\u2026It Is Clearly The Production Team Mistake Not ViViZ \u2757\ufe0f\u2755\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/h5W4Q4C9BP\n\u2014 Knight Friend (@KnightFriend6) November 7, 2024\n\nFollowing the intense backlash, the community also issued an apology. Mentioning that it was their failure to censor the controversial remarks, the statement added, \u201cWe apologize for causing concern to many fans by exposing it as is. The part was just in the introduction. No further comment was made at the time of filming. Therefore, we specify that this content will not be included in the main story that will be uploaded later.

Known for his player-management skills, Sammy has encouraged a number of players, including Andre Russell and Evin Lewis, to return to the international game. He is confident in his approach, even with difficult conversations.\u201cI pride myself on having the difficult conversations,\u201d Sammy said. \u201cBut in a way that everybody understands what is needed to be done. To see guys going out there and slowly progressing in the right direction makes me proud.\u201dDespite Joseph's controversial exit, West Indies went on to secure the ODI series 2-1. The team now turns its attention to the upcoming T20 series against England, beginning Saturday. Sammy hinted that star players like Nicholas Pooran and Akeal Hosein, who were absent in the recent series against Sri Lanka, would return for the T20Is.\u201cOur T20 team is our most successful team and our most settled team. So, yes, we incorporate some new guys\u2026but our T20 team normally picks itself,\u201d he remarked.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "It looks like Mickey 17 is getting a little extra time to fine-tune its cosmic thrills before blasting off. Oscar-winning Parasite director Bong Joon Ho\u2019s much-awaited sci-fi adventure, initially set to land in theatres on January 31, 2025, has now been pushed back to April 18, 2025. But don\u2019t worry\u2014it\u2019s all for the best. The film is now getting a global Imax release, and who doesn\u2019t want to see Robert Pattinson in IMAX-quality detail as he navigates space? This announcement comes just a day after Lionsgate decided to give its high-profile film, Michael, a new release date, moving it from April 18 to October 3, 2025.\nThe trend here? Everyone is scrambling for those premium large-format screens that are proving to be an essential revenue booster in today\u2019s movie market.\n\u201cWe were quick to secure the April 18 date when it became available for Mickey 17. We\u2019re thrilled with the new release and excited that audiences will get to experience the film in IMAX,\u201d a spokesperson for the studio said, as per The Hollywood Reporter (THR).\nPattinson stars in the adaptation of Edward Ashton\u2019s 2022 novel Mickey 7, where he plays the titular character, Mickey, an expendable space colonist. Mickey\u2019s job involves taking on the deadliest of tasks, knowing that when he dies, he\u2019ll just be brought back to life via cloning. (Yes, really, he\u2019s the seventh Mickey, to be exact!) But the story doesn\u2019t end there. Ashton\u2019s sequel novel Antimatter Blues was released just last year, so there\u2019s plenty of material for Bong to sink his creative teeth into.\nWatch the trailer here:\n\nWith a talented cast including Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo, Mickey 17 is already looking very exciting. And with Plan B Entertainment, Dooho Choi of Kate Street Picture Company and Bong\u2019s Offscreen, Inc. all backing it, we\u2019re in for a ride like no other.\n\u201cFrom the Academy Award-winning writer/director of \u201cParasite,\u201d Bong Joon Ho, comes his next groundbreaking cinematic experience, \u201cMickey 17.\u201d The unlikely hero, Mickey Barnes (Robert Pattinson) has found himself in the extraordinary circumstance of working for an employer who demands the ultimate commitment to the job\u2026 to die, for a living,\u201d reads the official description of the film from Warner Bros.

        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan starrer Buckingham Murders has received positive responses from the audience. The mystery thriller, directed by Hansal Mehta, will be finally released on OTT. Kareena took to her social handle and made the announcement. The film will be released on Netflix on November 8.\nTaking to her Instagram handle, Kareena shared the poster and wrote, \u201cHere\u2019s a tip-off: The Buckingham Murders is coming to Netflix on 8 November.\u201d Released exclusively in cinemas on September 13, 2024, the film boasts a stellar cast, including Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ash Tandon, Ranveer Brar, and Keith Allen. Directed by Hansal Mehta and written by Aseem Arrora, Kashyap Kapoor, and Raghav Raj Kakker, The Buckingham Murders is produced by Mahana Films and TBM Films, presented by Balaji Telefilms. The production is helmed by Shobha Kapoor, Ektaa R Kapoor, and marks Kareena Kapoor Khan\u2019s debut as a producer.\nTake a look here:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in)\n\nOne of the fans wrote, \u201cnoway i was just thinking about when this movie will come to Netflix,\u201d Another wrote, \u201cAaaaah!! That\u2019s the kind of news I wanted to hear today Waiting!!\u201d\nDespite being a niche offering with its unique genre and language format, The Buckingham Murders has managed to carve out a strong presence at the box office. The film opened to a collection of \u20b91.62 Cr. on Day 1, followed by an impressive 90% surge on Day 2, bringing in \u20b92.41 Cr. With continued positive feedback, Day 3 saw the film rake in \u20b92.72 Cr., bringing the total weekend collection to \u20b96.75 Cr.\nNews18 gave the film 4 out of 5 stars for its powerful performances, intention and brilliant cinematography. Our review read, \u201cThe Buckingham Murders is a slow-burn police procedural, mounted on the able shoulders of Kareena Kapoor Khan. It is a two-hour testament to Kareena\u2019s brilliance as an actor. Mehta brings out the best in her. The actress, who once called herself \u2018the most commercial heroine\u2019, impresses with her unglamorous, nuanced expression of unresolved grief and devastation. Her silent desolation and subtle ways of rebellion become the film\u2019s driving force.\u201d",

        "text": "Vijay Sethupathi is a man of all seasons when it comes to his craft and its sheer versatility. Over the years, he has shared the screen with everyone- from a debutant to an experienced actor. In one of his older interviews, the Maharaja star had opened up about whether he had any hesitancy to romance actresses who are about his son\u2019s age. In this article, let us revisit what he had to say.\n\nIn an earlier interview with Rediff, just after the release of his film Maharaja, Vijay Sethupathi was asked to reveal if he had any reservations about romancing actresses half his age on-screen. In reference, the actor was reminded of his previous statement about not wanting to work with Anushka Shetty, who was his son\u2019s age. \n\nClarifying his stance regarding the Baahubali actress, he said, \u201cWhy is this such a talking point? I wasn't saying anything controversial. It was twisted out of context. What I meant was, I felt awkward pairing with her on-screen because previously she had played my daughter in a film. She even calls me Dad in real life. So that was a problem.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he also revealed whether he found it awkward about the age of the leading lady opposite him in any film. Vijay shared, \u201cOtherwise it doesn't matter what my heroine's age is. It is all acting.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Vijay Sethupathi in the same interview was even asked if he felt that South superstars like him follow a tradition of working with actresses half their age. To this, the actor refused to give any response, citing that he didn\u2019t wish to create any unnecessary controversy.\n\nFor the unversed, throughout his filmography, the 46-year-old actor has worked with a number of actresses, including Aishwarya Rajesh, Nayanthara, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Krithi Shetty and most recently with Bollywood diva Katrina Kaif. Not only were his on-screen pairings appreciated, but the fact that he built a great rapport and chemistry with each one of them was also noticed. \n\nIn one of his older interviews during a press event for the film Jawan, Vijay Sethupathi made an interesting remark about his crush and how he could not pursue her. The actor mentioned that even after doing so many positive roles in films, he could not muster up the courage to approach his crush, all because of Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nExplaining his stance, the Merry Christmas star revealed that his crush was a die-hard fan of SRK, and wasn\u2019t able to see him past the Bollywood icon.\n\nOn the work front, Vijay has quite a few projects panned out, including Viduthalai Part 2, Gandhi Talks, Ace and Train.\nALSO READ: Mahesh Babu\u2019s stylish new look in beard teases excitement for SSMB29 with SS Rajamouli; twins in white with wife Namrata as he enjoys fam-jam",

        "text": "Shalini Passi has recently hogged significant limelight, particularly after her appearance on the reality show Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives. The philanthropist, art collector, and wife of businessman Sanjay Passi has been one of the biggest highlights this season. Known for her elegant sartorial sense, philanthropic endeavours, and impressive personality, Shalini has become a subject of fascination for many. Despite being a new face in the showbiz industry, she is all over the Internet these days for her skincare and lifestyle tips.\nHaving said that, the social media sensation made a surprising revelation recently while speaking to an entertainment news portal. She admitted that she abstains from taking medicines or antibiotics. Sharing valid reasons for the same, Shalini Passi went on to say that she wants her body to heal itself and her immunity to fight infections.\nDuring a conversation with Pinkvilla, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t take any medicines, like no; I have not taken antibiotics since like the last 25 years. I would have 103 fever and not take anything because I want my body to heal itself and I want my immunity to fight the infection.\u201d\nElaborating further, she recalled the days when she got infected by the Omicron virus. The art collector revealed that instead of relying on modern medicinal facilities, she used to take Ayurvedic medicines due to her belief in that theory. Explaining the reason, she said, \u201cI mean, when you take a medicine, then it shuts down your entire system; your digestive system is gone.\u201d\nAdding one more insight into her list of skincare tips, she said that she starts her day by drinking ghee (clarified butter) in lukewarm water for good skin care. She also shared that she includes different juices and soups in her diet.\nIn the same conversation, the philanthropist added that she consumes raw food more at room temperature for good health and skincare. On being asked about her weight loss plans, Shalini mentioned that she focuses on being healthy more than anything else.\nShalini Passi is a passionate art collector by profession who also runs the Shalini Passi Art Foundation and My Art Shalini Pahal. The art foundation provides Indian artists a platform to showcase their talent. The reality TV star also loves to dance, sing, do gymnastics, and do social work. Talking about her personal life, Shalini is married to businessman Sanjay Passi, the owner of the Pasco Group, which works with Tata and Maruti dealerships.\nComing to Fabulous Lives Vs. Bollywood Wives season 3, the Netflix show premiered last month. It marked the debuts of Shalini Passi, Kalyani Saha Chawla and Riddhima Kapoor Sahni. Meanwhile, Bhavana Pandey, Maheep Kapoor, Neelam Kothari and Seema Sajdeh remain to be part of the series.",

Their unwavering loyalty to him eventually led them to sacrifice themselves for the swordsman. However, with Hakuri Sazanami\u2019s timely retrieval of the Tobimune blade, the worst outcome seems to have been thwarted. \n\nNow armed with this weapon, Samura was able to launch a powerful counterattack against the Hishaku assassins, but the Hishaku may yet have more up their sleeves. Don\u2019t miss Kagurabachi Chapter 57 to find out how the battle plays out. Keep reading to discover the release date, where to read it, and more details.\nKagurabachi Chapter 57: Release date and where to read\n\nKagurabachi Chapter 57 is set to release on Monday, November 11, 2024, at 12 am JST. Internationally, this translates to a daytime release on Sunday, November 10, though the exact time may vary due to time zone differences. \n\nFans can access Kagurabachi Chapter 57 through various Shueisha-affiliated platforms, including the MANGAPlus website and app, the Shonen Jump+ app, and VIZ Media's official website. The physical copy will also be made available in Weekly Shonen Jump Issue 50.\nExpected plot in Kagurabachi Chapter 57\n\nKagurabachi Chapter 57 may likely center on Samura\u2019s confrontation with the Hishaku\u2019s main sorcerer at the Senkutsuji Temple, showing more of Tobimune\u2019s abilities. Samura\u2019s blade will be used at its full potential, likely unleashing further devastation against the enemy forces.\n\nMeanwhile, with Hakuri exhausted from his prior use of sorcery, it\u2019s improbable he can retrieve Uruha\u2019s Enchanted Blade as well. This puts Uruha in a precarious position, especially if the Hishaku manages to create an ambush to eliminate him. Kagurabachi Chapter 57 may also update fans on Chihiro whereabouts. \nKagurabachi Chapter 56 recap\n\nTitled \u2018Daybreak,\u2019 Kagurabachi Chapter 56 begins as Hakuri Sazanami pushes himself to the brink, knowing he\u2019s the only one yet to risk his life. He attempts to use his sorcery by touching Samura or Uruha to register them in his Storehouse, but his powers falter, causing him to collapse again.\n\nA Makizumi member urges Hakuri to conserve his energy, and she engages the Hishaku assassins alone. These assassins move relentlessly, some even activating Datenseki stones, rendering them like possessed zombies. \n\nThe Makizumi, overwhelmed by sheer numbers, needed to evacuate contracted sword bearers. A flashback in Kagurabachi Chapter 56 reveals that the Makizumi clan is an ancient ninja family who, during the Seitei War, served a precursor to the Kamunabi.\nhttps://twitter.com/__zatch__/status/1854261514527719667Three years ago, they chose Samura as their master, though he rejected the notion of merely seeing them as tools. In the present, Uruha uses his bloodlust to guide Samura to the Mandala, apologizing as they are transported to safety. \n\nOutside, Hakuri, using his last reserves of strength, returns Samura\u2019s Tobimune Enchanted Blade, which Samura unleashes in a powerful attack that overwhelms Hishaku forces.

        "text": "Shalini Passi has taken the Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives audience by storm with her bold personality and vibrant fashion choices. Since her appearance on the show, she has continued to make headlines with her unique approach to life. In a recent interview, Shalini shared insights about her signature detox powder, which she provides to over 100 people. She also humorously revealed how her son often warns her against bringing the detox powder to parties.\nIn conversation with Pinkvilla, Shalini Passi said, \u201cWe prepare a lot of things and send them to people, including our detox powder. The detox powder is a mix of several spices designed to cleanse the system. I send it to about 100 people or more, and everyone loves it.\u201d Shalini also shared the heartwarming story of receiving late-night messages from people, including a quirky text: \u201cMy sister took it, I\u2019m really desperate, sorry to message!\u201d\nShalini\u2019s son, Robin Passi, however, has his reservations about her bringing the detox powder to parties. \u201cYou cannot take these \u2018dabbies\u2019 to parties and have saag, it looks bad,\u201d he tells her. Shalini went on to describe her detox powder, which can be mixed with water and lemon juice as a refreshing morning drink. She also recommended using Kala Namak (black salt) mixed with water and lemon as a natural detox . \nIn the same interview, Shalini acknowledged that she carries her own vegetables from Delhi when she travels to Mumbai. She explained, \u201cI carry my own vegetables from Delhi when I come here like beet and all. It\u2019s terrible. The quality of vegetables is so much better in Delhi. Of course, it\u2019s better as we are next to Punjab. Our beetroots look like beetroots.\u201d\nIn terms of personal life, the reality TV star is married to businessman Sanjay Passi, who owns the Pasco Group.

        "title": "Horror fiction: Tara has written some (in)famous romances featuring monsters. Now one is hunting her",
        "text": "Tara gets home and makes herself a large pot of coffee. With a deep breath, she opens the Word doc on her Mac, and pops a piece of nicotine gum into her mouth. She chews rabidly, ignoring the chaos in her rented Vasant Kunj apartment a la \u201cA Hovel of One\u2019s Own\u201d. \n\nPlants lifelessly droop in their unwatered pots, which double up as dustbins. She sits on her unmade bed, using a pillow and a balled-up blanket as an impromptu desk. A pile of her unsold books is stacked against one of the ugly mustard-coloured walls, while the other has a pin-up board that\u2019s plastered with covers of Victorian bodice rippers \u2013 a shrine to all the dysfunctional romances that have shaped her writing. Each features a variation of the same archetype: the Bewitching Rake, the Wandering Wolf, the Philandering Count, the Reckless Viscount \u2013 shirtless and clutching catatonic semi-clad women on the brink of orgasm. \n\nTara can\u2019t seem to conjure up any words today. She silently stares at her laptop until the screen goes dark, shuddering at her own reflection \u2013 spotty, dark-circled, hair like a bird\u2019s nest \u2013 staring back at her. \n\nShe can\u2019t help but recall Ahana\u2019s worried words from last night, and her own disturbing dream of the beast taunting her. It chuckles in her head now, Just give up, Tara. You\u2019re not just a talentless hack, but an emotionally damaged one at that. \n\nShaking off the negativity, Tara finishes her coffee and reawakens her laptop. \n\n\u201cChapter 1\u201d. The desolate words mock her from the screen. Tara glares back at them till they blur into foggy squiggles. Minutes later, hypnotized by her own lack of productivity, she finds herself on Twitter, masochistically curious to see what the trolls are saying today. \n\nShe\u2019s been tagged over a hundred times in a bizarre article titled \u201cRussian Tourist\u2019s Tragic Death Gets Plot Twist With Werewolf Killer Theory\u201d. \n\nShe clicks on it to find a cheerful photograph of the twenty-three-year-old blond woman named Oksana Petrova, who was visiting Goa for a yoga teacher training course, next to the beach where her body was discovered. The article adds that she was found washed up on the shore with her throat ripped out. The Goa police initially thought a wild animal had attacked her because of the bite marks on her body. However, at least five eyewitnesses had sworn to have seen a strange \u201cwolf-like\u201d creature on the beach the same night, walking on two legs \u2013 just like a man. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first such incident; three months prior, the body of an Israeli woman, Sofiya Galil, who also came down to Goa to learn yoga, was found underneath a cliff on the same beach, impaled on a rock, carrying similar wounds to the other victim. \n\nScrolling down, Tara sees they\u2019ve even included a sketch of said perpetrator \u2013 a black Hound of the Baskervilles-like creature standing on its hind legs, with blazing yellow eyes piercing through the page.\n\nShe glances through the comments accompanying the article:\n\n\u201cThis murderer is right out of a @TaraT novel.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey @TaraT, come and get yo boy, Waris!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Goan police have to be smoking the same stuff as @TaraT!\u201d\n\nAs she mutes and blocks each of the commenters, Tara can feel the beginnings of an idea form in her brain. \n\nInstead of channelling her demons, like Herpes had said, maybe it\u2019s time she exorcizes herself. \n\nShe knows what she needs to do. Start afresh. \n\nTara begins untacking all the romance posters from her pin-up board, gathering them into a pile on the balcony. There, she lights a cigarette, taking a deep, dramatic drag before flicking it onto the heap. She watches as the fire licks at her heroes and heroines, distorting their conjoined groins, before making its way to their perfect abs, swelling breasts and faces frozen in half-moans, slowly reducing them all to ash. \n\nBy evening, the board is transformed. A printout of the Hound of the Baskervilles creature has taken centre stage, flanked by headshots of its two victims, a sticky note detailing their backgrounds and all the clues related to the murder.\n\nThe beast visits her again in her dreams that night. \n\nThey\u2019re alone in a cave, somewhere dark and deep. All Tara can see are its yellow eyes, shining in mid-air. Its growls, low and guttural, echo off the walls. \n\nSlowly but surely, her eyes make out the shape of the terrifying creature crawling towards her. There\u2019s a hyena-like grin on its face now, both ferocious and mocking. \n\n\u201cLet me take a bite of you,\u201d the beast teases and implores, as its mouth drips drool, its eyes glittering with hunger. \n\nA hunger\u2026for Tara. \n\nDespite the fear slowly paralysing every inch of her body, Tara can\u2019t help but be drawn to the beast. It looks at her like no other man has ever looked at her before. As though, despite all her flaws, it wants to possess her in a way no one else has ever wanted to. Like it wants to claim her flesh and tendons and bones and soul for itself. \n\nAnd Tara\u2019s so grateful it does. She wants to give herself up to it, so badly. \n\nBut she\u2019s afraid. Not about the fact that it will hurt, but that the beast won\u2019t like how she tastes. What if she\u2019s too bitter or sour? What if she can\u2019t live up to the other girls it has eaten before? Girls who were born sweeter, softer, naturally delicious. \n\nTara feels a desperate urge to season herself before the beast does whatever it plans to do with her. To sprinkle herself with salt and pepper, dip herself in exotic herbs, turn herself into a flavour that it will never forget. \n\nBut the creature looks like it\u2019s in no mood to wait, so she ends up offering her arm to it, nervously. \n\nIt nibbles tentatively, then gnaws hungrily. She delights in the noises it makes \u2013 little growls and groans of pleasure. She finds herself getting wet at the sight of her flesh being ripped away, her soft tissues spilling out, the way her shining white bone glistens underneath. \n\n\u201cYou taste exquisite,\u201d the beast whispers, moaning in satisfaction. And Tara feels her heart dance in her ribcage. \u201cBetter than I had imagined in my head. I could eat you all night, in fact. But I won\u2019t.\n\nBecause I want to savour you, Tara.\u201d\n\nThose words make Tara\u2019s head and body explode into white, hot streaks of pleasure. She trembles uncontrollably with the knowledge that it\u2019s going to rip her apart. \n\nAnd all she wants is more, more, more\u2026\n\nExcerpted with permission from Wolfish, Kritika Kapoor, Pan Macmillan India.",

She said that he makes sure to ask them about their academics and studies, however, he is a bit particular about their outfits. While he doesn\u2019t mind Esha and Ahana wearing jeans, he prefers to see them in salwar kameez.\nIn an episode of Rendezvous With Simi Garewal, which aired in 1999, Hema Malini shared that whenever Dharmendra comes to Bombay, he makes sure to visit his children, and even discusses their academics. \u201cIn terms of outfits, he is very particular. He likes them to always be dressed in salwar kameez. The moment he is supposed to come home, my daughters change into salwar kameez,\u201dshe said.\nShe further added that Dharmendra doesn\u2019t mind his daughters wearing jeans and western outfits, but he prefers salwar kameez. \u201cI tell them that if your father likes this, wear it for him,\u201d she said. Hema then said that he is very traditional as a person, further adding that he hasn\u2019t seen any of her stage performances yet. When asked why, she replied, \u201cHe feels I look very different on stage. He feels that I don\u2019t belong to him whenever I am performing. Apparently, I look very different. So, he doesn\u2019t want to see my shows.\u201d\nOn the chat show, Hema Malini was also joined by daughter Esha. When Esha was asked whether she plans to foray into the film industry, she said that she is interested, but it all depends on what her father has to say about it.\nDharmendra married Prakash Kaur in 1954. This was before he had entered films. They had two sons and two daughters from this marriage. Dharmendra tied the knot with Hema Malini in 1980. The couple has two daughters- Esha and Ahana Deol.",

        "title": "Bhootnath 3 In The Works, Amitabh Bachchan And Shah Rukh Khan To Be A Part Of Film? What We Know",
        "text": "In 2008, Amitabh Bachchan starred as the lovable ghost in Bhoothnath, directed by Vivek Sharma, with Shah Rukh Khan making a special cameo. Six years later, Bachchan returned in Bhoothnath Returns, directed by Nitesh Tiwari, which strengthened the franchise\u2019s popularity. SRK also made an appearance in the second part. Now, Pinkvilla has exclusively revealed that producer Bhushan Kumar and BR Films are planning to revive the Bhoothnath franchise with a new installment.\nT-Series and BR Films are collaborating on Bhoothnath 3, according to sources close to the development. The source told Pinkvilla, \u201cBhoothnath 3 is in the development stage at the moment, and the producers are toying with the idea of bringing Bhoothnath back to the spectacle. If everything goes as planned, Bhoothnath 3 will go on floors in 2025, for a 2026 release. The script work has begun and the makers are happy with the germ that they have for Bhoothnath 3.\u201d\nThe casting for Bhoothnath 3 hasn\u2019t been finalised yet, but the filmmakers are hoping to bring back Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan. While both actors had cameos in the first two films, this time the makers are aiming for a bigger approach. \u201cWhile part one and two had a cameo of Shah Rukh Khan, the makers are aiming at bigger goals for the third instalment, though everything will boil down to the script eventually. It\u2019s too early in the day to discuss casting, as the makers are presently focusing on getting the script right. A director will be associated once the script is locked,\u201d the source added.\nBhoothnath will be Bhushan Kumar\u2019s second horror-comedy franchise after Bhool Bhulaiyaa. He is confident about expanding the Bhoothnath franchise, as there is a lot of potential. The source explained that the unique aspect of Bhoothnath is its lovable ghost, who returns for personal reasons. \u201cWhat separates Bhoothnath from all other horror comedies is the fact that the ghost in Bhoothnath is lovable and comes back for a personal reason. The idea is to create a franchise where the part of the ghost is loved by one and all, especially the kids,\u201d the source said.\nBhoothnath (2008) is a supernatural comedy directed by Vivek Sharma. The story follows a young boy named Banku (played by Aman Siddiqui), who moves with his family into an old, supposedly haunted bungalow in Goa. The ghost of Kailash Nath (Amitabh Bachchan), the former owner, haunts the house and initially tries to scare them away. However, Banku befriends the ghost, whom he calls Bhoothnath, believing him to be more of an angel than a ghost.",

The actress was asked if the statement she made still held any truth.\n\nTo which she expressed, \u201cYes. Absolutely. Absolutely. I love him. I loved him with all my heart, and I tried the best I could to make a deeply broken relationship work. And I couldn't. I have no bad feelings or ill will towards him at all. I know that might be hard to understand, or it might be really easy to understand if you've ever loved anyone.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, she stood firm to the allegations she made against Depp. During her conversation with the journalist, the Aquaman star said that till the day she dies, she will continue to stand by each word of her testimony.\n\nAfter the trial was done, with time many netizens seemingly forgot about it as the discussion on the same topic became less. Since then, Heard has not been much out there, and many people question where she is these days.\n\n To answer the question, the actress has reportedly been staying in Spain. Due to her fluency in the language, she surely is adjusting well. In a previous interview, she expressed her love for Spain. She was asked if she would go on to stay in the region, and she said, \u201cYes, I hope so. Yes, yes, I love living here.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to her personal life, the actress reportedly birthed a daughter, Oonagh Paige Heard, in 2021 via the route of surrogacy.\n\nAs far as her professional front goes, she was seen in an independent movie titled In the Fire, which was released in 2023.

        "text": "Indian TV commercials can sometimes get downright goofy and over the top but they provide pedestals to many aspiring actors and models. One such commercial was that of Fogg perfume which featured Bollywood hottie Angira Dhar.\nThe commercial depicted a cyclone blowing away a man\u2019s clothing while Angira comes up to him and says,\u201d Baki sab toh udd gaya\u2026lekin aapka perfume reh gaya\u201d The commercial became an instant hit and people were blown away by the charm and beauty of Angira. Although she had appeared in small films and web series earlier, it was this ad that made her a well-known face and launched her into the world of entertainment.\nAngira Dhar was born on May 25 1988 in Jammu and Kashmir.

However, she played a pivotal role in Thugs Of Hindostan. Recently, the actress opened up about her experience working with Amitabh Bachchan. Fatima praised the actor and revealed that he did not get tired.\nIn a recent chat with Filmfare, Fatima Sana Shaikh shared how Amitabh Bachchan spent an entire day submerged in water and said, \u201cWe were doing a scene in Thugs where Amitabh Bachchan sir was in the water for one full day. He had worn a heavy armour and was giving a monologue. That man did not get tired! He would himself ask (the director), \u2018Sir should we have one more take? Did you get what you wanted?\u201d Thugs of Hindostan starred Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif, alongside Bachchan and Fatima. The film was a big flop at the box office. It was made on a whopping budget of Rs 300 crore and managed to earn only Rs 150 crore at the box office.\nIn a recent interview, Fatima also revealed that she was diagnosed with epilepsy during Dangal. She mentioned how she was afraid of having a seizure in public and how she has learnt to cope with the disease over time.\nIn a conversation with Filmfare, Fatima Sana Shaikh revealed how she struggled to accept her diagnosis. She mentioned that she was aware of the stigma and said that she was afraid that people might label her as an attention-seeker. The actor said, \u201cI was diagnosed with epilepsy during the Dangal shoot. At first, I was in denial and wasn\u2019t willing to accept that I had a neurological disorder, so I didn\u2019t take any medication. I was scared I might have an episode in front of people. Epilepsy carries a lot of stigma. People think you\u2019re either on drugs, seeking attention, or possessed and should be avoided.\u201d\nOn the work front, Shaikh was last seen in Sam Bahadur.

She recently shared about receiving a piece of advice about trimming her eyelashes.\n\nBarbaro appeared at Entertainment Weekly\u2019s Breaking Big Panel at the Savannah College of Art and Design\u2019s Savannah Film Festival. She shared, \u201cThere's definitely a lot of that. There's just a lot of opinions and you just kind of have to filter through what works for you and not.\u201d\n\n The actress recalled the \u201cweirdest advice\u201d she ever got was during the very initial commercial she shot. She said that there was a woman, who did her makeup, told her that she had long eyelashes and that she should \u201cprobably trim them.\u201d\n\nThe actress added, \u201cI didn't take it like that. I mean, I was just like, 'Oh, okay.'\" Barbaro continued that in her mind she said that she would not be doing that. The Fubar star said that when one hears an advice that they are not sure of taking it, they should just trust that instinct. She added that one could be told to do \u201ccrazy\u201d stuff like trimming their eyelashes off.\n\nDuring the conversation, she also spoke about how little control actors have. While seemingly giving examples, the actress said that one could find out later that the producer actually decided to hire their friend.\n\nShe said that she did not believe that before expressing that she felt it was all within her control. Barbaro added that it was essential to pay attention to what can be controlled, which includes preparing, one\u2019s vision as an artist, and one\u2019s connection with oneself. She added, \u201cSo important to have because it can be so impersonal.\u201d\n\n The actress expressed that one has to be familiar with the artist they want to be, \u201cbut there's so much about it that just also has nothing to do with you.\"\n\nDuring the event, other actors, including Nicholas Alexander Chavez, Savannah Lee Smith, Austin Abrams, Ethan Herisse, and Ebony Osidiab, also spoke during the discussion to garner a spot on the set in the first place, per Entertainment Weekly.\nALSO READ: Throwback: When Taylor Swift Opened Up About Her Battle With Eating Disorder",

        "text": "The rumours of Khushi Kapoor and Vedang Raina have been in the air for a while and even though the two actors have never addressed it publicly, they have not denied it either. From attending wedding bashes together to being spotted in and around the city, netizens love that they look so much in love with each other. The dating rumours started after the release of their first movie together, 'The Archies' directed by Zoya Akhtar, and it has only gotten stronger with time. Recently, Khushi Kapoor rang in her 24th birthday, and of course, Vedang was a part of the celebrations. The actress took to Instagram to share snippets of the 'pajama party' and in the caption mentioned, \"Chapter 24. My favourite people with the most ideal surprise celebration.\" In the pictures, Khushi can be seen celebrating not only with rumoured beau Vedang Raina but also with her father, Boney Kapoor, and some of her closest friends, including Shanaya Kapoor and Aaliyah Kashyap. She had a 'Princess Diaries' themed pajama party celebration where all her girlfriends were seen wearing pink matching outfits that had the initials of the actress 'KK' stitched on the pocket. On the other hand, Khushi wore a striped blue pajama set along with a tiara and had Vedang twin with her, creating an adorable moment. The celebrations were laid back, cosy and intimate, where Khushi and her friends enjoyed sips of wine and cake along. In one of the pictures, the actress was also spotted sitting in front of a canvas, suggesting that might have been one of the activities everyone indulged in that night. The house was decorated with pink and golden balloons that gave an absolute royalty and princessy feel. Fans are speculating that this could be a sign that Vedang and Khushi's relationship is only getting stronger with time. While Vedang was last seen in Alia Bhatt starrer 'Jigra' Khushi has not been in a film since her debut movie 'The Archies'- the rumoured couple have done quite a few advertisements together, but their fans and followers would like to see them in a movie soon.

        "text": "Second quarter earnings of India Inc show that post-pandemic buoyancy is waning. Listed companies benefitted from the pandemic, using the disruption in the unorganised sector and in medium and small businesses to grow their market share. The generous liquidity supplied by the RBI coupled with low interest rates also helped, fuelling leveraged domestic consumption and increasing demand. But all that\u2019s petering out.\n\nA host of factors including geopolitical tensions, slowing global growth, shift in consumer preferences and tighter financing conditions have begun to hurt listed companies. An analysis of around 1,130 companies which have declared their results for the second quarter of FY25 so far reveals that year-on-year revenue growth was the slowest in the last four quarters, at 8 per cent. Of greater concern is the 2.8 per cent decline in net profit compared to the corresponding quarter last year. If stocks in the BFSI sector are excluded, net profit has declined 12.8 per cent. The headline numbers have been primarily marred by the weakness in oil and gas and commodity companies. Reliance Industries\u2019 O2C (oil to consumer) segment and the large PSU oil refiners were hurt by weak gross refining margins as crude oil prices fell 20 per cent in the quarter on excess supply and weak global demand. Profitability of steel and other metal producers was also hit due to weakness in global prices. Larger FMCG producers reported decline in profitability due to lower urban demand and changing consumer preferences. \n\nThe automobiles sector witnessed a slowdown in passenger vehicle demand, forcing players to offer lucrative discounts to customers and eroding profitability. Two-wheeler volumes, however, remained healthy due to rural demand and exports. Many private sector banks reported sharp compression in net interest margin as they focused on deposit mobilisation and raised interest rates on deposits. Many NBFCs reported lower business growth as well as deterioration in asset quality, as RBI began cracking down on sharp practices. While IT companies reported stable growth on a sequential basis, the outlook remains cautious, given the uncertainty around North American markets.\n\nGrowth challenges for Indian companies are likely to persist through FY25, as global demand could remain muted owing to geopolitics and a slowing Chinese economy. Slowing domestic credit growth, especially in personal loans, indicates that urban demand is being hit by high interest rates. Investors need to temper their return expectations from equities. A raging bull market over the last two years has taken valuations to very high levels. Though the Nifty50 has declined around 7 per cent from its recent peak, its price-earnings multiple of 23.4 on a trailing basis is still very expensive compared with other emerging markets. With the Nifty Midcap 100 index trading at a PE multiple of 43.7 and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index trading at 31, there appears to be froth left in many segments.",

Prince Harry in his memoir 'Spare' revealed that he took drugs which should have disqualified him for a US visa but he got one. And that started the row which is yet to be resolved. But Harry and Meghan had had rough trysts with the US election.In the 2020 US election, Harry and Meghan appeared in a video message and urged Americans to \"vote against hate speech\" which was seen as an apparent dig against Donald Trump and a veiled endorsement for Joe Biden. The video was broadcast as part of Time 100 magazine's annual list of the top 100 most influential people. In the video, Harry said he never voted during his time in the UK. Do working Royals not vote?There is no law but working royals in the UK usually stay away from commenting on politics or voting in elections to remain above politics. What Harry and Meghan did in 2020 was seen as a violation of the royal agreement but then both of them quit their royal duties.Harry-Meghan's message urging for votingAccording to reports, this time Harry and Meghan issued a message on National Voter Registration Day in September through their Archewell website. \"Voting is not just a right; it's a fundamental way to influence the fate of our communities. At The Archewell Foundation, we recognize that civic engagement, no matter one's political party, is at the heart of a more just and equitable world.\"\"By participating in initiatives like this, we aim to amplify the message that every voice matters.\" They continued: \"We invite you to join us in this important effort. To volunteer your time and write letters to potential voters, sign up at Vote Forward's website.\"For those who wish to take immediate action, you can register to vote today by visiting Vote.gov.\" Meghan and Harry finished their powerful message by saying: \"Together, let's make sure every eligible voter is informed and empowered to participate in shaping America\u2019s future.\"Will Harry's visa be cancelled if Donald Trump wins?There was speculation that if Donald Trump becomes the president again, Prince Harry's US visa will be cancelled.

        "text": "In the landscapes of Jammu, there lies a hidden treasure-the ancient \u2018Baolis\u2019 or step-wells, intricately crafted marvels of water conservation and cultural heritage. These \u2018Baolis\u2019, integral to Dogra culture, are more than just reservoirs; they are emblematic of architectural ingenuity, communal identity, and a rich spiritual legacy. Yet, despite their historical and practical significance, these \u2018Baolis\u2019 are gradually slipping into oblivion, victims of time, neglect, and modern development. This unfortunate decline calls for an urgent intervention to revive and preserve these bastions of our heritage.\nThese \u2018Baolis\u2019 are rapidly deteriorating. In the face of urbanisation and piped water supply systems, the relevance of these structures has diminished, and many have fallen into disrepair or complete disuse. Sadly, some have even become dumping sites, losing both their utility and their cultural value. This decline is also a result of a cultural shift where fast-paced modern life has pushed traditional practices to the margins. Younger generations, with little connection to these \u2018Baolis\u2019, often lack awareness of their historical importance. Thus, it is no surprise that they have become an afterthought, neglected by both local communities and Government agencies.\nYet, there are compelling reasons why these \u2018Baolis\u2019 should be preserved. The \u2018Baolis\u2019 serve as reminders of Jammu\u2019s rich heritage, revealing clues about the past through their carvings, idols, and architecture. They highlight the craftsmanship and aesthetics valued by the Dogra rulers and earlier patrons, and their architectural diversity reflects the region\u2019s historical exchanges with neighbouring cultures and influences.\nRecognising the significance of these \u2018Baolis\u2019, the Government has begun restoring some, such as the Chirayi \u2018Baolis\u2019, which is commendable but insufficient. A more robust and inclusive approach is needed. Efforts to restore and maintain the \u2018Baolis\u2019 should actively involve local communities, heritage conservation groups, and the Panchayati Raj Institutions. Community-led initiatives can revitalise these structures, making them places of collective pride and preserving them as living heritage sites. Youth groups, who once played a key role in cleaning and maintaining the \u2018Baolis\u2019, should be encouraged to take up these practices again. Furthermore, schools and cultural organisations can play a critical role by educating the younger generation about the historical and ecological significance of these \u2018Baolis\u2019, fostering a sense of responsibility towards their preservation.\nThe Government is emphasizing the preservation of heritage structures and has instructed district administrations to compile lists of monuments for restoration. District authorities could similarly be directed to focus on restoring these \u2018Baolis\u2019. Public sector undertakings could also contribute significantly under corporate social responsibility, setting an example for heritage conservation. If the intent is strong, numerous ways exist to achieve these goals. With Government focus, the restoration of these \u2018Baolis\u2019 could yield swift and impactful results.\nAdditionally, restoring the \u2018Baolis\u2019 can serve broader environmental and social goals. In an era when water scarcity looms large, these structures can be revitalised as rainwater harvesting systems. Promoting such traditional methods aligns well with sustainable development goals and offers a way to combat modern water issues by utilising ancient, proven techniques. If properly maintained, \u2018Baolis\u2019 could again become functional reservoirs that serve communities in times of water scarcity.\nThese \u2018Baolis\u2019 are not mere relics; they are living symbols of Jammu\u2019s cultural identity. They stand as testaments to the ingenuity, spiritual life, and artistic sensibilities of past generations. Their preservation is a matter of respect for heritage and responsibility toward future generations. It is important to revive these priceless structures, ensuring that they remain more than forgotten ruins. The \u2018Baolis\u2019 must be treasured as assets, restored to their former glory, and cared for by the people whose lives they once sustained. It is still not too late to act. By restoring the \u2018Baolis\u2019, a new life can be given to these irreplaceable heritage sites, safeguarding them as symbols of sustainable living and cultural continuity. The challenge is significant, but so is the reward.",

Abhishek and Aishwarya have been tackling divorce rumours for months now. The rumours were further fuelled after Abhishek or the Bachchan family did not wish Aishwarya on her birthday earlier this month. Aishwarya has also not been spotted with the Bachchan family members for a while now. \nAmid these growing rumours, Simi took to Instagram on Tuesday night to show her support to Abhishek Bachchan. The Karz star shared a snippet from her talk show, Rendezvous with Simi Garewal, featuring Abhishek and called him the \u2018nicest men\u2019 in Bollywood. \u201cI think everyone who knows Abhishek personally will agree he is among the nicest men in Bollywood. Good values and innate decency,\u201d she captioned the post featuring Abhishek. \nDirector-choreographer Farah Khan agreed with Simi. She took to the comments section and wrote, \u201cI fully agree! He is just the nicest guy.\u201d \nThe post did not go down well with several social media users, especially those who are fans of Aishwarya. Several comments called out Simi for sharing the post amid speculations of their troubled marriage. One of the comments read, \u201cVery controversial time to put out this\u2026 Not fair yaa.\u201d Another social media user accused her of \u2018protecting\u2019 Abhishek while staying tight-lipped about Aishwarya. \nSoon, Simi pulled down the post. A screenshot of the now-deleted post has been shared on Reddit. \nSimi Garewal posts an old interview clip with Abhishek where he says he will never cheat; calls him the nicest guy, and deletes the post after facing wrath of public byu/Xixiq inBollyBlindsNGossip\n\nMeanwhile, Abhishek and Aishwarya are yet to address the claims about their troubled marriage. \nAbhishek and Aishwarya have been married for 17 years now. The couple shares a daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan. Their divorce rumours began earlier this year when Aishwarya chose to skip walking into the Ambani wedding with the Bachchan family. Instead, she made a solo appearance with her daughter by her side. Abhishek fuelled the speculations by liking a post about divorce. The actors have been spotted separately lately.",

        "title": "This Abhishek Bachchan And Aishwarya Rai Film, Remake Of A Classic, Bombed At Box Office",
        "text": "Rumours regarding Abhishekh Bachchan\u2019s split with his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan continue to dominate social media, while they are, in all probability, baseless. The couple have time and again brushed off such rumors. Abhishek and Aishwarya fell in love while filming the super hit movie Dhoom 2 together. While another of their films, Guru received a great response, their first film together titled Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke failed at the box office.\nHowever, one film in which Abhishek and Aishwarya appeared together 18 years ago unexpectedly failed. The period romantic drama was a remake of a cult classic that was a big success during its time and hence expectations were high from the remake. If you have not guessed it yet, we are talking about the film Umrao Jaan.\nThe 2006 film Umrao Jaan, directed by JP Dutta, turned out to be a flop at the box office. Known for his blockbuster hits like Border, Dutta attempted to recreate the classic story of Umrao Jaan, which is based on the life of a courtesan in Lucknow. Despite high expectations and a star-studded cast, the film struggled to resonate with audiences and critics alike.\nAlthough Umrao Jaan boasted lavish sets, intricate costumes and a soulful soundtrack, it ultimately failed to capture the magic of the original 1981 version starring Rekha. Many attributed this to a slower narrative and the inevitable comparisons to Rekha\u2019s iconic performance, which had left a lasting impression. JP Dutta\u2019s version, while visually appealing, didn\u2019t perform well at the box office and received mixed reviews, with some critics pointing out that it lacked the emotional depth needed to connect with audiences.\nStars like Shabana Azmi, Suniel Shetty, Divya Dutta and Kulbhushan Kharbanda also appeared in important roles in this film. However, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was not the first choice for Umrao Jaan. Director JP Dutta wanted to cast Priyanka Chopra, but things did not work out and then Aishwarya was cast. In an interview given to PTI in 2005, JP Dutta said, \u201cI had reached a point where I had to take a decision. I wanted to work with Priyanka. I had envisioned her as Umrao Jaan.\u201d Priyanka rejected this film because her dates were already booked.\nAfter the failure of Umrao Jaan, JP Dutta was so disappointed that it took him 12 years to make his next film Paltan. The film released in 2018 featured actors like Jackie Shroff, Arjun Rampal, Sonu Sood, Harshvardhan Rane, Sonal Chauhan and Esha Gupta. However, this movie also flopped badly at the box office.",

His signature dialogue from the film, \u201cWhat a joke,\u201d resonates with fans to date. Recalling his experience as Suraj Singh in the action masala film, Aasif shared an intriguing behind-the-scenes detail that is currently garnering everyone\u2019s attention. Recently in a media interaction, he said, \u201cWhen Karan Arjun director Rakesh Roshan first told me about this role, he emphasised that \u2018What a joke\u2019 is not just a line but the core of Suraj\u2019s character. He wanted it to be Suraj\u2019s reaction to everything, bringing an unexpected charm to the character. From day one, I included \u2018What a joke\u2019 in every scene. I said this line with different tones as per the director\u2019s imagination.\u201d\nAasif Sheikh further said, \u201cI was not the first choice for this role. Initially Gulshan Grover was cast in the role of Suraj Singh. He had repeated this scene many times and also spoken the lines of the character, but I got this role. It was a game of fate or something else, but it gave me the opportunity to make \u2018What a Joke\u2019 a memorable part of Bollywood history.\u201d\nKaran Arjun was directed and produced by Rakesh Roshan, starring Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Raakhee Gulzar, Mamta Kulkarni, and Kajol in lead roles. Amrish Puri portrays the main antagonist, while Johnny Lever, Arjun, Jack Gaud, Ranjeet, and Aasif Sheikh appear in supporting roles.\nThe film revolves around the story of the two titular brothers who seek revenge from their greedy uncle for murdering their father but are killed by him and are reincarnated to complete the revenge.\nKaran Arjun was theatrically released in India on January 13, 1995. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed Rs 450 million, emerging as an \u201call-time blockbuster.\u201d\nAasif Sheikh is popularly known for the sitcom Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain!, one of the longest-running Indian comedy sitcoms. The show revolves around two neighbouring couples, the Mishras and the Tiwaris, in which the husbands are attracted to each other\u2019s wives and attempt various ultimately unsuccessful and hilarious techniques to impress them.

Meenakshi made her acting debut with the film Painter Babu in 1983, produced by Manoj Kumar, and her second film Hero in 1983, which catapulted her to instant stardom. Meenakshi Seshadri was among the most popular actresses in the Hindi film industry. She has been a part of some of the biggest and most popular films in the 80s and 90s. She had a massive fan following and was known for her impeccable acting skills and beautiful looks. Her acting career was not just limited to Bollywood; she had worked in many South Indian films as well.\nHowever, she quit the film industry in 1996 to focus on her personal life and settled in the USA. Meenakshi Seshadri has featured in films for nearly 13 years. After her hiatus from 1996, she made a guest appearance in Swami Vivekananda in 1998 and then in the 2016 film Ghayal: Once Again.

        "text": "Indian cricket stalwart Virat Kohli turned 36 on Tuesday, and received an outpouring of wishes from people worldwide. One of the people to wish Kohli on his birthday was French footballer Paul Pogba. In an amusing appearance on a livestream with popular American YouTuber 'IShowSpeed', Pogba wished Kohli on his birthday. Pogba has been out of football action for more than a year, having last played in September 2023 for Juventus. Pogba is currently serving an 18-month ban due to doping.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");During the livestream, Speed (real name Darren Jason Watkins Jr) asked Pogba whether he knew who Kohli is. Upon showing his picture and mentioning to him that he's a cricketer, Pogba appeared to recognize.\r\nSpeed & Paul pogba wished Happy Birthday to Virat Kohli pic.twitter.com/nYH60pg7AQ\r\n\u2014 Gaurav (@Melbourne__82) November 5, 2024\r\n\"Happy Birthday bro (brother), long life!\" said Pogba, while wishing Kohli on his birthday. Kohli turned 36 on Tuesday, November 5. Speed also told Pogba that Kohli is one of the best cricketers in the world, describing Kohli as a \"legend\".Pogba's wish to Kohli was one of the highlights of his surprise appearance on Speed's channel. The duo also engaged in football and video game challenges during the collaboration.Pogba had been handed a four-year ban due to doping, which was later reduced to 18 months. He is eligible to resume training from January, and can appear competitively from March.Meanwhile, Kohli's form has come under intense scrutiny following India's 0-3 home Test series whitewash at the hands of New Zealand. The batter managed just 93 runs in three Tests in the recently-concluded series.As per a report by Hindustan Times, Kohli chose to spend his birthday with wife Anushka Sharma at his restaurant chain One8 Commune.Kohli is next set to play in the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia in Australia.

        "title": "The Simpsons' Kamala Harris prediction goes horribly wrong",
        "text": "As the 2024 US election approaches, many have been drawn back to The Simpsons and its reputation for making eerily accurate predictions about future events. While the show has occasionally hit the mark, some of its forecasts have been wide of the target.What The Simpsons Got Wrong About the US Election ResultIn the 2000 episode \u201cBart to the Future,\u201d The Simpsons depicted Lisa Simpson as president, assuming office after a Trump administration. In an Oval Office scene, Lisa comments, \u201cAs you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.\u201d This line sparked interest when Donald Trump later became the 45th president of the United States, with fans seeing a connection between his presidency and the \u201cbudget crunch\u201d in the episode. However, The Simpsons also implied that this \u201ccrisis\u201d would directly follow Trump\u2019s tenure, leading to a swift shift in power. In reality, there was no immediate succession by a female president after Trump left office in 2020.\u2014 Darrel97_ (@Darrel97_) The episode has continued to spark speculation, especially as Kamala Harris became the first female vice president. Fans noted that Lisa\u2019s purple suit and pearls in the episode bore a strong resemblance to Harris\u2019s style, creating excitement about a potential prediction. However, while Harris has risen to a historic office, The Simpsons\u2019 portrayal of a direct Trump-to-female-president transition didn\u2019t play out in 2020 or 2024, showing the show's limitations in predicting the finer details of political events.10 Times The Simpsons Got It Wrong in Their Predictions1. Female President After TrumpIn the 2000 episode \u201cBart to the Future,\u201d The Simpsons depicted Lisa Simpson as president following Trump\u2019s tenure, with fans speculating it foreshadowed a female president succeeding him. However, Trump was succeeded by Joe Biden in 2020, and the US has yet to see a female president.2. Robot LibrariansIn a 1995 episode, The Simpsons imagined libraries run by robots. While technology has greatly advanced, human librarians still play a key role, with AI and automation supporting rather than replacing them.3. Hover Cars by 2013In the 2005 episode \u201cFuture-Drama,\u201d The Simpsons showed hover cars becoming a common form of transportation by 2013. Despite recent advances, hover cars remain in the realm of sci-fi, with prototypes still in development.4. Big Ben Digital ClockThe episode \u201cLisa\u2019s Wedding\u201d envisioned London\u2019s iconic Big Ben sporting a digital clock by 2010. Big Ben still displays the traditional clock face, showing the endurance of historical elements.5. Mind-Controlled Robots for Domestic TasksIn \u201cFuture-Drama,\u201d mind-controlled robots do household chores, implying they would be widespread by the 2010s. While smart home tech exists, mind-controlled robots haven\u2019t entered mainstream homes.6. US Winning a World CupIn a 1997 episode, The Simpsons predicted the US would beat Portugal in a World Cup. Although the US has improved in soccer, it hasn\u2019t claimed a World Cup title, let alone beaten Portugal in a final.7. Prince's Music Coming to Life as a HologramThe 2002 episode \u201cTreehouse of Horror XIII\u201d depicted a hologram concert featuring Prince. Although posthumous holograms of musicians have happened, Prince\u2019s estate has resisted creating a hologram tour.8. The Colonization of Mars by 2026The Simpsons once suggested humans would have a colony on Mars by 2026. Although space programs are developing plans for Mars, human colonization is still years, if not decades, away.9. Apple\u2019s Technology StrugglesThe show predicted that Apple products would be rendered obsolete by other tech advances, yet Apple remains a global tech leader with record-breaking revenue and consistent innovation.10. Rise of a \"New York City\"-Style Springfield with Sky-high Real Estate PricesOne episode humorously suggested that Springfield would become like NYC with soaring property values. Springfield\u2019s setting as an affordable town is still central to the show, and it hasn\u2019t become a pricey urban hub.These misses highlight that while The Simpsons has a knack for pop culture predictions, even this iconic show can't foresee every twist in reality.",

        "text": "Hogwarts Legacy sequel will have narrative ties with the Harry Potter television series currently in the works at HBO, Warner Bros. has confirmed. The studio behind the game has been coordinating with the team working on the Max Original series based on the Wizarding World IP, David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, said in an interview published Tuesday. The Hogwarts Legacy sequel remains a \u201cvery big priority\u201d for WB, Haddad said, echoing comments made by Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels in September.\r\n\r\nHogwarts Legacy Sequel to Have Ties With Harry Potter Series\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Variety, Haddad said that the massive success of Hogwarts Legacy motivated WB to lean heavily into the Harry Potter IP with the new HBO series, video games and merchandise. The executive confirmed that the Hogwarts Legacy sequel, currently in development, will have ties to the Harry Potter Max TV series. According to the report, Hogwarts Legacy developer Avalanche Software has been \u201ccoordinating some of the big-picture storytelling elements\u201d in the game's sequel with narrative elements in the Harry Potter HBO series.\r\n\r\nHaddad reiterated that the Hogwarts Legacy sequel was a \u201cvery big priority\u201d for Warner Bros., as the first game signalled the potential of the franchise. \u201cWe have known for some time that fans are looking for more things in this world, and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that,\u201d Haddad told the publication. \u201cThe rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with Hogwarts Legacy last year,\u201d he added.Warner Bros. Banks on Hogwarts Legacy Sequel After Suicide Squad Failure\r\n\r\nIn September, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels had said that a direct sequel to Hogwarts Legacy was a major goal for the studio in the coming years. \u201cObviously, a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road,\u201d Wiedenfels had reportedly said at the Bank of America's 2024 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference at the time.\r\n\r\nHogwarts Legacy, an open world action-adventure title that tells an original story set in the world of Harry Potter, was a major success for Warner Bros. Games. The Variety report confirmed that the game had sold over 30 million copies as of October 2024. Hogwarts Legacy was the top-selling game of 2023, with 22 million copies sold by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe Harry Potter HBO TV series, announced last year, will be based on the seven Harry Potter books, ushering in a new era for the franchise. The series will reportedly run for ten consecutive years and will land on HBO in 2026.\r\n\r\nThe Hogwarts Legacy sequel, on the other hand, does not have a confirmed launch timeline. Warner Bros. Games has, however, continued to launch other games based on the Harry Potter IP. In September, the studio released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, a game focussed on the magical sport from the Wizarding World, across PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series S/X.\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

The film marks Ayushmann's first venture into the genre. It is scheduled to release on Diwali 2025. The film marks a departure for the universe by incorporating a love story element. It also stars Rashmika Mandanna, Paresh Rawal, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Aditya Sarpotdar directs from a screenplay by Niren Bhatt, Suresh Mathew, and Arun Fulara, with Dinesh Vijan and Amar Kaushik producing. The actor emphasised the unique positioning of \"Thama\" within the horror-comedy universe. \"The fact that 'Thama' is the first love story of the horror comedy universe is all the more exciting,\" he said. \"The promise of it being a 'bloody' love story is also a supremely unique and a compelling pitch for today's audience who want clutter-breaking theatrical experiences. 'Thama' is that project, a total wildcard, a film that no one has seen in India. I'm really pumped to join the sets of this film and create a huge big screen experience with Dinesh and his entire team of fellow visionaries like Amar Kaushik, my director Aditya Sarpotdar and the writing genius Niren Bhatt.\" The actor is thrilled to be part of this universe's legacy as it moves forward and also feels responsible to give audiences a theatrical experience that they will remember for years to come. Khurrana, who previously collaborated with Vijan on \"Bala,\" sees \"Thama\" as another opportunity for innovation. \"Dinesh and I have a similar passion for disruption. 'Thama' is our second collaboration and it is so new that I can't wait for the reaction of people when they see it in theaters next Diwali.\" \"The manner in which Dinesh is crafting this universe's every beat is truly commendable and he deserves all the love and adulation that he is receiving. As a friend, collaborator and admirer of his work, I can only see this universe growing from strength to strength given the grand ideas of expansion that he has.\" The film follows Maddock's recent successes with \"Stree 2\" and \"Munjya,\" further cementing the production house's reputation for blending horror and comedy elements. For the actor, this represents an addition to his diverse filmography, reports variety.com. \"'Thama' is a project of a lifetime for me and I know that I will give my heart and soul for people to hopefully shower it with unanimous love,\" he added.

        "text": "Saif Ali Khan reclaimed ownership of his ancestral home, the Pataudi Palace, some years ago. The property was leased out to a hotel chain by his father, the late Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi. But it was his mother, Sharmila Tagore who adorned the palace with her charming aesthetics. In an earlier chat with Rediff, Saif Ali Khan spoke about how his mother influenced the royal residence.\nSaif Ali Khan said, \u201cMy mother never throws away anything. She patches things up, fixes them, and they live on in another incarnation.\u201d He added, \u201cMarrying into a royal family, she\u2019s played a huge part in preserving, restoring and turning Pataudi into arguably the prettiest little palace in India.\u201d\nHe further said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a single picture of hers in the palace \u2014 just one of her receiving the National Award in the corridor, tucked away under the bookcase \u2014 but her aura is everywhere.\u201d He explained, \u201cFrom the gardens to the blinds, she\u2019s there in every little detail. So there is no need for pictures to stamp her presence.\u201d\nSaif Ali Khan said, \u201cIt\u2019s rare for an actor to run a home as well as my mother has. She has all the graces of an excellent host. She\u2019s like a finishing school, she trains her staff impeccably. And she would get really upset because the business family who lived opposite us would then double their salary and poach them away.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen we are in Pataudi, she organises trampoline jumps for Taimur, and gives him thoughtful presents which are a balance of fun and education.\u201d\nIn a previous conversation with Rediff, Sharmila Tagore said, \u201cMy three children \u2014 Saif, Saba and Soha \u2014 have been located in Mumbai for a while now. But I don\u2019t feel like leaving Tiger and the rest behind, so I stay there (in Delhi). Pataudi is quite close and I visit Mumbai occasionally, but I always go back.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cAll three of my children love Pataudi; they come to Delhi and head straight there. The house has a history, there are vibrant memories there. Like Suraj Sharma\u2019s character Aditya in Gulmohar, my children also go through the albums there and remember. When they see their children playing around, they are reminded of their own childhood.

        "text": "Finding an ideal spot to celebrate a birthday seems like a hassle. However, Visakhapatnam being true to its name, City of Destiny, has several spots that locals love. Some of them have serene backdrops of beaches while others have the best scenic views of the city. So, on that note, let's take a look at the birthday points in Visakhapatnam that Vizagites love!\r\n1. RK Beach\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a no-brainer. There is no better way to celebrate your birthday than going to the beach. If you are Vizagite, you will definitely have seen a picture of your friend celebrating their birthday here. (If you don't have one, you are missing out!)\r\n\r\nBeing one of the best tourist attractions and a much-adored spot in Visakhapatnam, the sea and sand in RK Beach have been witness to many birthday celebrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palm trees near YMCA are more than just summer saviours. With a cool shade even during the hottest days, this spot makes for a laid-back birthday celebration. An easily accessible food court nearby would be a cherry on top for your special day.\r\n3. Vizag Square\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98911\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Credits: NewsMeter[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe artsy open space near Dutt Island dedicated to pedestrians is another adored spot for celebrating birthdays in Visakhapatnam. Imagine gathering here with friends and capturing Instagram-worthy moments that will be perfect for your memory books. (Consider this spot only if you like crowded places.)\r\n4. Kailsagiri Viewpoint\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98912\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Credits: go2india.in[/caption]\r\n\r\nKailsagiri is the ultimate birthday gateway, packed with lush greenery and breathtaking views of the city.

Tenneti Park,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis park is more than just a view of the Bangladeshi Cargo Ship anchored nearby. With a flight of stairs leading up to a stunning viewpoint and another going down to the beach, it is the ultimate destination for a one-of-a-kind cake-cutting ceremony.\r\n6. VMRDA City Central Park\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ligh House in VMRDA park was once a famous spot for cake-cutting ceremonies, but now that it is closed, the park has stepped up its celebration game with many more festive amenities! With colourful flowering plants, a musical fountain, and a panoramic sea viewpoint, this place is another great spot for a picture-perfect celebration.\r\n7. Thotlakonda Park\r\n\r\n\r\nFor birthdays mixed with a bit of history and beauty, Thotlakonda is the place to be. Situated right next to an ancient Buddhist Complex, this park is situated 128 metres above sea level and has a stunning view of the sea. Prettily decorated, this park offers a cosy birthday adventure.\r\n\r\nWhether it's a serene park, a scenic hilltop, or an art-filled walkway, Visakhapatnam has the perfect spot for every kind of birthday celebration.

        "title": "Why Kamala Harris lost despite Taylor Swift endorsement",
        "text": "Taylor Swift means business, we know that. And Kamala Harris also knew that. Thus getting Swift's support was itself a big boost to her team. Swift has a loyal fan base, they call it \"Swifties.\" They are young and energetic. So, it usually comes to mind that their idol's discourse would influence them. But what happened? Has Taylor Swift's endorsement actually affected the US election as the candidate she has given support to got beaten by Donald Trump.Celebrity endorsement history in US electionUsing or bringing celebrities to support the candidates have been a common practice in US election's history. In the light of a recent presidential debate, the globally acclaimed musician Taylor Swift followed this tradition when she voiced her support for Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate. But Harris lost the election. This now definitely brings questions regarding the actual impact on voter turnout and eventual election outcomes that celebrity endorsements have.Her call to action produced a vigorous response, as 10.4 million \"likes\" piled up. In fact, a US government official said that the website vote.gov got 405,999 unique visitors in the 24 hours after Swift's pushed to send her followers there.Swift's action helps highlight a longer-running question: how much clout do celebrities actually have when they endorse political candidates? Historical data is very mixed on how well endorsements work. For instance, Oprah Winfrey's 2008 endorsement of Barack Obama allegedly added at least a million votes to his campaign. However, a 2007 Pew Research Center poll indicated that 69% of people said Oprah's endorsement had no effect on how they voted and only 23% of Democrats said her support made them more likely to vote for Obama.On the other hand, a 2010 study conducted by North Carolina State University maintained that celebrity endorsements, be it from George Clooney or Angelina Jolie, did little to change the minds of voters. It simply means that while celebrities can trigger a debate and even grab media attention, that does not make them the potential game changers in bringing about a sea change in political results.Also Read: Rookie NFL player says Mom's support was key to getting ready for his first gameTaylor Swift\u2019s star power did not workPast political endorsements by Taylor Swift have met mixed success. In 2018, she came out in support of Democrat Phil Bredesen for the Tennessee Senate seat in a historically Republican state, where Swift has lived since she was 14. Again, via Instagram, she asked her followers to vote. Immediately afterwards, Vote.org reported a remarkable increase in voter registration: 65,000 new registrations within 24 hours, and another 250,000 over the following three days. But irrespective of all this noise, Bredesen did eventually lose the race. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI9fbbQ-aToWhich begs the question as to any more lingering impacts of Swift's endorsements. The general tendency of younger voters not to vote as much as those in older age brackets may result in their being motivated and registering themselves for voting. This may be especially true if they had been inspired by some celebrity figure such as Swift. It is difficult to know how many such registrations were a result of the artist's endorsement. Interestingly, a survey taken in Tennessee by the Beacon Center-a free-market think tank-showed that 81 percent of the people polled said an endorsement by Swift would not influence their vote. Just 12 percent would be more likely to vote for the candidate Swift preferred, while 5 percent said they would be less likely to vote for them.Interestingly, Kamala Harris lost in Taylor Swift\u2019s home state to Trump where there are a total 19 electoral votes.We can see, Swift may be popular, but her endorsement and the huge fan following did not bring the result to Harris as she would have expected. Where celebrity endorsements, such as by Taylor Swift, stir enormous media interest and add to voter engagement, most of the actual effects are usually impossible to take into account in election results. Swift's previous endorsements have seen mixed results, and her support for Kamala Harris also turned out to be a failure. There is no surefire formula for success, and bringing a superstar does not give you the guarantee of coming victorious. And, Kamala Harris surely knows this by now\u2013 she has got most of the celebrities behind her.",

        "text": "Since its release on Netflix, Fabulous Lives vs. Bollywood Wives has captured the attention of fans with its thrilling mix of luxury, drama and star-studded moments. Across the eight-episode season, viewers were treated to intense confrontations, lavish parties, and unforgettable scenes. Among the new cast, Shalini Passi emerged as a standout. However, a recent accusation by Shalini against fellow stars Riddhima Kapoor Sahni and Kalyani Saha Chawla has left fans in suspense.\nIn a video shared from a recent virtual chat between the 7 cast of the show along with ace filmmaker Karan Johar, Shalini can be heard accusing Riddhima and Kalyani of \u201cganging up\u201d against her. The discussion began when Karan asked Riddhima and Kalyani if they felt that Shalini was holding some kind of resentment towards them. In response, Kalyani mentioned that she treats Shalini like her real sister. However, she felt the art curator was a bit \u201cmiffed\u201d with them. Kalyani stated, \u201cI said it into the camera; I said Shalini is like my real sister. I will always tell her off.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Riddhima opined that if there were any resentments from Shalini\u2019s side, she would appreciate it if the latter had opened up about them. Neetu Kapoor\u2019s daughter said, \u201cLike, I say things to your face. If at all I have genuinely made a mistake, I will tell you about it.\u201d But Shalini made a cancelling action, making Karan say, \u201cShalini is cancelling you for some reason.\u201d\nSoon, Shalini opened up, saying, \u201cI\u2019m saying cancel. Why should anybody say anything to me?\u201d To this, Riddhima asked, \u201cWhat is the resentment for then?\u201d Shalini then explained her point of view and made strong accusations on Riddhima and Kalyani. Shalini replied, \u201cThe thing is, you don\u2019t gang up against your team member. I felt like you guys had ganged up. I was relying on you for a lot of things, but I felt\u2026\u201d\nRiddhima interrupted, \u201cBut Shalini, you say you don\u2019t want us to tell you. You don\u2019t want any advice. You are okay. You shut us out, and then you say,\u2019 We are here telling you, \u2018Listen, if you think that they are putting you in a spot\u2019.\u201d\nShalini then shared, \u201cYour apologies came the next night,\u201d pointing towards the incident that happened on the first night of their tour to Mauritius. For context, on that day, Riddhima mistakenly spilled her drink on Shalini\u2019s clothes while they were enjoying their meal. However, Riddhima didn\u2019t apologise to Shalini right at the moment, making it a topic of discussion amongst the other cast.\nListening to Shalini, Riddhima added, \u201cThey were not talking about my apology. The day after that.\u201d Karan intervened in the conversation and tried to make it light-hearted. He said, \u201cI think, may I intercept by trying to be the voice of reason here and say that the idea I think of this was that we put out our feelings and also accept\u2026\u201d\nHowever, Shalini mentioned, \u201cYeah, I accept. I didn\u2019t want to bring up this. This is too new for me. I need time.\u201d Karan continued, \u201cBoth Kalyani and Riddhima have expressed their love for you. And Riddhima rightfully says that you are not the best of friends and may never be.\u201d\nAs the video neared its end, Maheep Kapoor lightened the mood with a humorous comment, \u201cI feel like we\u2019re shooting season four. When does the shoot stop, guys?\u201d Sharing it, Shalini wrote in the caption, \u201cDrama, apologies, and a side of a fabulous reunion.

        "text": "Austin Swift, the younger brother of pop superstar Taylor Swift, has been a constant figure in his sister\u2019s journey to superstardom. Recently, he gained more attention when he joined Taylor at a Kansas City Chiefs game on November 4, 2024, where she was supporting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce.\n\nFans are eager to know more about Austin, who has mostly stayed out of the spotlight. Here\u2019s a look at everything we know about Taylor Swift\u2019s brother.\n\nAustin Swift was born on March 11, 1992, in West Reading, Pennsylvania, and is two-and-a-half years younger than his famous sister, Taylor. Growing up, the Swift family lived on a Christmas tree farm.\n\nThe family eventually moved to Nashville, Tennessee, when Taylor was a teenager so she could pursue a career in country music. Austin, on the other hand, chose a different path that eventually led him to a career in film.\n\n Austin attended the University of Notre Dame and graduated in 2015 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in film studies. His passion for film was ignited at a young age, and he found comfort in the characters on the big screen during his school years, especially since he didn\u2019t have many friends.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Austin shared, \u201cI would go to the movies, and Daniel Craig was my friend, and Christian Bale was my friend, and Clive Owen was my friend, and Viggo Mortensen was my friend.\u201d\n\nAfter college, Austin pursued acting and landed his first role in the 2016 crime thriller I.T., followed by a role in the Ben Affleck-directed gangster film Live by Night. His acting career continued to grow, and in 2018, he took on his first leading role in the film Cover Versions.\n\nAustin\u2019s most recent acting role was in the 2019 film Braking for Whales. He also ventured into television, making appearances in two episodes of Still the King, a CMT comedy starring Billy Ray Cyrus, as well as in the political comedy Embeds in 2017.\n\n While Austin did enjoy his time in front of the camera, his true passion extended beyond acting. He became involved in film production, working behind the scenes for his sister Taylor's music videos and projects.\n\nAustin served as a producer on the 2009 music video for Taylor\u2019s hit song You Belong With Me and was credited as an executive producer for her 2011 video for Mean.\n\nIn 2020, Austin took on a larger role as an executive producer for Taylor Swift: Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, a special where Taylor performed the songs from her Folklore album in order, offering behind-the-scenes insights into the creative process.\n\nAustin continued his production work, serving as a producer for Taylor\u2019s 2021 music video for I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor\u2019s Version), which was directed by Taylor\u2019s close friend, actress Blake Lively.\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s lyrics have often paid tribute to her brother. On her 2008 album Fearless, she sings about her brother in the song The Best Day, with the line: \"God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he\u2019s better than I am.\" Later, on her 2010 album Speak Now, Taylor sings about Austin in the track Never Grow Up, with the lyrics, \u201cAll your little brother\u2019s favorite songs.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: 'A Beautiful, Emotional Journey': Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo Share Insight on Their \u2018Wicked\u2019 Set Bond",

        "text": "Nitesh Tiwari\u2019s Ramayana is one of the most eagerly awaited films and the excitement has only intensified with the recent release of the movie\u2019s first poster. After a long wait, the makers have finally revealed the title and confirmed the release dates for the film which will be split into two parts. The first part is set to release in Diwali 2026, followed by the second part in Diwali 2027. The stunning poster features a golden, magical arrow with the release dates.\nIn a statement shared along with the poster, Namit wrote, \u201cMore than a decade ago, I embarked on a noble quest to bring this epic that has ruled billions of hearts for over 5000 years to the big screen. And today, I am thrilled to see it taking shape beautifully as our teams work tirelessly with only one purpose: to present the most authentic, sacred, and visually stunning adaptation of our history, our truth, and our culture \u2013 our \u201cRAMAYANA\u201d\u2013 for people across the world. Join us as we fulfill our dream of bringing our greatest epic to life with pride and reverence\u2026 Part 1 in Diwali 2026 and Part 2 in Diwali 2027.\u201d\nAs anticipation builds for the epic movie, here are the full details of the cast and their roles:\nRanbir Kapoor \u2013 Lord Ram\nSai Pallavi \u2013 Goddess Sita\nYash \u2013 Ravana\nSunny Deol \u2013 Hanuman\nLara Dutta \u2013 Kaikeyi\nSheeba Chaddha \u2013 Manthara\nThe role of Lakshman has not been officially confirmed yet but reports indicate that TV actor Ravi Dubey will portray the character. Reports also suggest that Arun Govil, known for playing Lord Ram in Ramanand Sagar\u2019s Ramayana, will take on the role of King Dashrath in the movie.\nSeveral images of Ranbir and Sai from the Ramayana film set had gone viral, leading the producers to take action. In response, producer Namit Malhotra decided to cover the sets from all angles and move the shooting indoors to prevent further leaks. \u201cThe producers didn\u2019t want any glimpses of the film to come out before an official announcement and despite trying their best \u2013 including opting for a no-phone policy on set \u2013 shutterbugs managed to click pictures of Ranbir and Sai\u2019s looks from the film. Curtains have been put all around and the surveillance has been tightened to avoid further leaks,\u201d a source told News18.\nRamayana Part: I is scheduled for release on Diwali 2026 which falls on November 8, while Ramayana Part: II will be released on Diwali 2027, set for October 28.",

        "text": "A part of the Straw Hat crew has made it to Elbaph, where they escaped the massive diorama created by Road of Hajrudin\u2019s New Giant Warrior Pirates and got separated from Luffy. With the crew\u2019s captain having stumbled upon the infamous Loki, the Prince of Elbaph, fans have been looking forward to the upcoming chapter to find out what happens next.\n\nFortunately for eager fans, the One Piece Chapter 1131 brief spoilers have recently been leaked online by reliable leaker Pew (@pewpiece), so don\u2019t miss it! Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the spoilers.\nOne Piece Chapter 1131 brief spoilers\n\nAs per the One Piece Chapter 1131 brief spoilers, the upcoming chapter will be titled \u2018Loki in the Underworld.\u2019 The chapter continues the encounter between Luffy and Loki, who remains imprisoned deep within Elbaph\u2019s Underworld.\n\nLocked in Sea Prism Stone chains and under the watchful eye of animal guards, Loki finds himself in a vulnerable yet dangerous position as he converses with Luffy. In an attempt to gain his freedom, Loki promises Luffy that he will eliminate any pirate crew he chooses as a reward.\n\nThis offer sparks curiosity in Luffy but also raises questions about the truth of Loki\u2019s intentions and his mysterious power. As the conversation continues, Loki unexpectedly refers to Shanks as a \u201cchicken\u201d in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers.\nThis insult visibly angers Luffy, who activates his Gear 4th form to strike Loki. Although the effectiveness of the attack is not explicitly detailed in the spoilers, it is implied that Loki\u2019s insult serves as a significant catalyst, increasing the tension between the two.\n\nDuring this clash, fans also learn that the World Government has placed an immense bounty of 2.6 billion berries on Loki in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers, making it clear the threat he poses despite his current captivity.\n\nMeanwhile, Loki\u2019s words have only heightened Luffy\u2019s interest in understanding the connection between Loki and Shanks. However, Loki refuses to divulge any information unless Luffy agrees to release him from his restraints.\nThe One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers leave this interaction unresolved, keeping fans guessing about whether Luffy will ultimately choose to free Loki and risk unleashing a potential new threat on the world. The focus then shifts to Zoro and the group of Straw Hats he was tasked with leading after Luffy separated from them.\n\nThe group narrowly avoids a dangerous encounter with Road and a band of pirates. These attackers remain unnamed in the spoilers, but they could be either discontented members of the New Giant Warrior Pirates or Elbaphian locals who disagree with Hajrudin\u2019s alliance with the Straw Hats.\n\nElsewhere, Robin prepares for a potential reunion with her old friend, Jaguar D. Saul, whom she believed dead until recently. With Brook\u2019s help, Robin cuts her hair back to its pre-time skip style, hoping this appearance will help Saul recognize her if they meet in the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers.\nhttps://twitter.com/KomplexDays/status/1853481681791111289However, just as Robin readies herself, the chapter delivers an unsettling twist: Saul is reported to have mysteriously collapsed. This sudden event shocks the onlookers, and the sight of a giant shouting about Saul\u2019s condition brings a tense close to the One Piece Chapter 1131 spoilers. Lastly, there will be no break next week.\n\nFor more spoilers like this and updates from the One Piece manga, keep up with Pinkvilla.\n\n*The spoilers provided here are not official and should be taken with caution. Fans are advised to wait for the official release of canonical content.",

        "text": "The 1998 classic Dil Se, directed by Mani Ratnam, remains a fan favorite. Recently, Manisha Koirala revealed an intriguing twist about the film\u2019s original script, where Shah Rukh Khan's character wasn\u2019t initially meant to make the sacrifice seen in the final cut. The ending was altered at the last minute, adding a dramatic shift to the storyline.\n\nIn Dil Se, set against the backdrop of insurgency in Assam, Manisha Koirala portrays a female terrorist, a suicide bomber, while SRK\u2019s character ultimately sacrifices his life alongside hers when she attempts to set herself on fire while wearing a bomb. In a recent interview with ANI, Manisha revealed that the original ending of the film was quite different. \n\nShe explained that in the initial script, the cause was more significant than love for both characters, and Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s character was meant to let her die. However, she added, \"They changed it last minute.\"\n\nThe Heeramandi actress expressed her preference for the original ending of Dil Se, which she felt emphasized the impossibility of the characters' union. She explained that in the final version, the film focused on showcasing the intensity of SRK's love, where he stops her from dying but ends up sacrificing his life in the process. \n\nShe felt that this change, designed to highlight the sacrifice, deviated from the original script. She said, \u201cBack then only I had liked the original because there was no way they would have become one. Sometimes unrequited love is more interesting than a completed loved story.\u201d\n\nManisha Koirala also reflected on her decision to take on the complex role in the film, sharing that she had initially been slated to work with Ram Gopal Verma before the offer for Dil Se came her way. Although other actresses were initially considered for the role, she was drawn to it because she wanted to explore new and challenging areas as an artist. \n\nShe also discussed how Mani Ratnam\u2019s vision shaped her portrayal of the character. Instead of playing her in a typical manner, he encouraged her to embody a \u2018normal\u2019 girl with deep pain and anger that went beyond reason, adding layers of complexity to the role.\n\nOn the professional front, Manisha Koirala was last seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s Heeramandi, where her portrayal of Mallikajaan was highly appreciated by audiences. \n\nThe series featured a talented ensemble cast, including Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sanjeeda Sheikh, Sharmin Segal Mehta, and Taha Shah Badussha. Additionally, Manisha shared the screen with Kartik Aaryan in the 2023 film Shehzada.\n\nMeanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan will next be seen in Sujoy Ghosh's action film King, where he stars alongside his daughter Suhana Khan. The movie also features Abhay Verma and Abhishek Bachchan in pivotal roles.\nALSO READ: Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s Dil Se co-star Manisha Koirala reveals real reason for them not uniting on screen: \u2018Heroes decide whom they...",

        "text": "Aishwarya Arjun, daughter of renowned actor Arjun Sarja, made her debut as a leading lady in Kannada cinema with the film Prema Baraha in 2018. Aishwarya, who has worked in both Sandalwood and Kollywood films, has not appeared in any recent movie projects, leading fans to wonder about her career plans. Recently, she was in the spotlight due to rumours and discussions surrounding her marriage, adding to the curiosity about her personal life. Aishwarya Arjun and Tamil actor Umapathy Ramaiah recently tied the knot in a traditional ceremony. The couple exchanged vows in an intimate ceremony at Arjun\u2019s Sri Yoga Anjaneyar Temple in Gerugambakkam, Chennai. Their grand wedding, held just a few months ago, was attended by numerous celebrities and politicians, who extended their heartfelt wishes to the newlyweds. Aishwarya, known for her active presence on social media, frequently shares photos and videos, giving her followers a glimpse into her life and updates about her journey.\nActress Aishwarya Arjun, currently vacationing in Paris, has shared some stunning photos on her Instagram. Her choice to write the title in Kannada delighted many fans, though some netizens playfully pointed out minor misspellings in her post. One follower commented, appreciating her use of Kannada and noting that Paris truly is romantic.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Aishwarya Arjun (@aishwaryaarjun)\n\nShortly after posting the photo, Aishwarya Arjun quickly corrected the spelling error, updating the caption to accurately read \u201cParis Romance.\u201d Fans applauded her attentiveness, praising her for promptly fixing the mistake. Many supporters commented that other actresses who seem to have distanced themselves from their Kannada roots could take inspiration from Aishwarya\u2019s pride in the language.\nAishwarya Arjun made her film debut in 2013 with Pattathu Yaanai, where she starred alongside Vishal. She later took on her first leading role in 2018 with the Kannada film Prema Baraha. This movie was also released in Tamil under the title Sollividava, with certain scenes reshot to suit the Tamil audience. Despite the anticipation, the film didn\u2019t achieve the level of success initially expected in either language. Her husband, Umapathy Ramaiah, also has a budding career in cinema. Entering the industry in 2017, he has appeared in just four films so far, but his performances have managed to capture audience attention, gradually building him a fan base in Tamil cinema.\nIt appears that Umapathy Ramaiah and Aishwarya Arjun had been in love for quite some time before they decided to tie the knot. After receiving a warm approval from their families, the couple happily celebrated their marriage. Now, they are cherishing their new journey together as a married couple.\nIn 2021, Aishwarya participated in the Survivor reality show hosted by her father, actor Arjun, on Zee Tamil, where Umapathy also appeared. This show became the starting point of their friendship, and it was during this time that Umapathy grew closer to Arjun\u2019s family. Over time, this friendship blossomed into a romantic relationship.\nWhen the two decided to marry, their families met at the Hanuman temple, which was built by Arjun himself, to discuss the marriage plans. Following this, Aishwarya and Umapathy were married on June 10 in a ceremony held at the Hanuman temple in Chennai, surrounded by close friends and family.",

Keep reading to find out the release date, where to read it, the expected plot and a recap of the last chapter\u2019s events.\nChainsaw Man Chapter 183: Release date and where to read\n\nChainsaw Man Chapter 183 is scheduled to debut on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at 12 am JST. For the majority of international readers, this translates to a daytime release on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, in their local time zones. However, keep in mind that the exact release time will vary depending on individual time zones.\n\nFans can read Chainsaw Man Chapter 183 on Viz Media's official website, Shueisha's MANGAPlus service, or Shueisha's Shonen Jump+ app. The former two platforms offer complimentary access to the initial and most recent three chapters of the series, while the latter requires a subscription for full access to the entire series.\nExpected plot in Chainsaw Man Chapter 183\n\nChainsaw Man Chapter 183 will likely continue where the last chapter left off, as the flashback of the snowy memory of Aki and Power continues.

He explains that he can\u2019t reflect on his mistakes while distracted by his libido, which leaves him feeling helpless.\nhttps://twitter.com/er__cl/status/1853816697058103727Yoru tries to encourage him by comparing their pasts, sharing that she too lost family but managed to move on, implying he can as well.

She has impressed audiences with her impeccable on-screen acting prowess in the films Life of Pi, Haider, Drishyam, etc. Do you know her sister, actress Farah Naaz\u2019s success in Bollywood motivated her to act in films? Yes, that\u2019s right. The actress had talked about it in an exclusive interview with a media portal. Tabu said that she was very fond of Hyderabad and her school. Due to this reason, she stayed there with her aunt for three years. Till that time, Tabu said that her sister (actress Farah Naaz) had acted in many films and had become a top-notch star. The Life of Pi actress said it is because of Farah Naaz, her interest in films increased.

One of her films, Prem, directed by Satish Kaushik, starring Sanjay Kapoor in the lead flopped at the box office. According to the reports, it took the producer Boney Kapoor 8 years to produce the film. Despite the failure of Prem, Tabu\u2019s performance was noted and she became famous as an actress. After that, there was no turning backwards. She managed to amass a massive fan base with her acting in the films Chandni Bar, Hera Pheri, etc.\nTabu will next play an important role in the Dune\u2019s prequel, Dune: Prophecy, an American TV series. She will play Sister Francesca in this prequel series to the 2021 film Dune. Based on Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson\u2019s novel, this series will premiere on Jio Cinema in India on November 17, 2024. This series stars an ensemble star cast of Emily Watson, Olivia Williams, Travis Fimmel, Jodhi May and others in important roles. Cunning Hand, HBO Max and Legendary Television have backed this series.\nOn the work front, Tabu will next play an important role in the film De De Pyaar De 2, directed by Anshul Sharma.

        "text": "Imagine being a kid and stepping into a world filled with magic, fame and spells \u2014 a dream for many, but a real-life experience for Harry Potter star Matthew Lewis. Now 35, the actor who brought Neville Longbottom to life reflected on why he and his co-stars including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, managed to escape the fate of many child stars who struggle as adults. Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t just because they had wands and cloaks. Recently, in a Q&A session at Rhode Island Comic Con on November 3, Lewis shared that it was the cast\u2019s strong friendships that kept them grounded, even with the immense fame that came with the wizarding world.\nWhile discussing his decade-long journey on the Harry Potter set, Lewis didn\u2019t hold back on the ups and downs they faced as young actors transitioning into adulthood. \u201cWe\u2019re very good at hiding all of those stories,\u201d he joked, but then he got a bit more serious about the \u201ctricky\u201d reality of growing up in the industry.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Matthew Lewis (@mattdavelewis)\n\nLewis revealed that stepping out of the Harry Potter bubble was daunting. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure how he\u2019d fit in as an adult actor. \u201cThere was absolutely a lot of trepidation,\u201d he said, adding that he worried if he\u2019d be able to make it in the wider acting world. He admitted, \u201cAfter 10 years in Harry Potter, I was ready to do something else and also was not keen to do anything that was going to lead to multiple series.\u201d\nBut it wasn\u2019t all magic and charm spells. Lewis explained that he and his castmates shared a unique bond that kept them sane amid the chaos of child stardom. He believes their strong friendship helped them avoid the pitfalls that so often ensnare young actors. \u201cOne of the questions that was asked earlier about the pitfalls of being a child actor that we seem to have avoided, I would posit that a large degree of that was because we were all there together,\u201d he said.\nUnlike many young actors who feel the weight of carrying a movie alone, Lewis and his co-stars had each other to lean on. \u201cA lot of the fears that we had were all shared,\u201d he explained. The tight-knit Harry Potter cast experienced both the highs and the challenges of their journey together, creating an unbreakable bond. Lewis added that only they could understand what each other had gone through, \u201cAnyone else in the world will never be able to understand really what we went through and how it affected our personal lives except each other. Working together wasn\u2019t just wonderful, it was lots of fun,\u201d he added.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Harry Potter (@harrypotter)\n\nWhile some might rewatch the movies or re-read the books, Lewis shared that it\u2019s the friendships, not the story itself, that still hold a place in his heart. \nWith Harry Potter set for a reboot on Max as a television series, fans are already curious if we\u2019ll see Lewis return as Neville Longbottom. For now, though, Lewis isn\u2019t in a rush to dive back in. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m looking at or want to do but would not turn my nose up at,\u201d he shared, noting that playing an adult Neville would be a fresh and intriguing angle.",

The film is reportedly based on a true and disturbing incident.\n\nA source close to the development informed the publication that the actor will be seen as a cop in the film. \"After Ayushmann Khurrana and Sidharth Malhotra exited Daayra due to scheduling conflicts, Prithviraj was approached. He connected with the script and the film's message,\" the source was quoted as saying.\n\n\"His role is essential in driving the narrative, while Kareena's character will show her in a new light, exuding strength, vulnerability, and intuition,\" the source further added. The shooting of Prithviraj\u2019s first collaboration with Kareena and Meghna is expected to start soon.\n\nAn earlier report in Midday revealed that Khurrana couldn\u2019t allot his dates to the film due to the packed second half of 2024. The film is supposed to go on floors by the end of the year and will clash with the actor\u2019s music tour and his cinematic ventures.\n\nNotably, our source reflecting on the film\u2019s subject earlier this year shared that after Talvar, it would be a hard-hitting project that Meghna had researched through the last few years. She also has strong source material in place for her screenplay.\n\nOn the work front, Prithviraj\u2019s last Bollywood film was Ali Abbas Zafar\u2019s Bade Miyan Chote Miyan alongside Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff. Meanwhile, Meghna\u2019s last directorial was Sam Bahadur led by Vicky Kaushal and Kareena Kapoor is currently enjoying the release of Rohit Shetty\u2019s Singham Again led by Ajay Devgn alongside Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Tiger Shroff, Jackie Shroff and Arjun Kapoor.\nALSO READ: Sidharth Malhotra expresses excitement about stepping back into \u2018romantic genre\u2019 in Param Sundari with Janhvi Kapoor: \u2018It\u2019s a new chapter that\u2026\u2019",

Nutritionist Lovneet Batra offers a practical approach to enjoying Diwali without compromising on health. In her recent Instagram video, she answers 20 questions, sharing tips on how to celebrate while staying fit. Let's dive into her insights on balancing festive enjoyment with wellness.\r\nLovneet Batra kicks off her video by addressing a fundamental question: \u201cHow many days is Diwali celebrated for?\u201d She confirms that the festival spans five days. As she navigates through various questions, she shares her personal preferences, choosing a bustling Diwali market over a candle-making workshop and opting for diyas instead of rangoli. She expresses her love for hosting parties rather than attending them, enjoys playing karaoke over cards, and favours the charm of fairy lights over the noise of fireworks. In a nod to sustainable gifting, she suggests plants as the perfect gift idea for the season.\r\nWhen asked about her favourite activities, Lovneet confidently states, \u201cCook a meal,\u201d stressing on her passion for preparing delicious and healthy dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA post shared by Lovneet Batra (@lovneetb)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLovneet Batra also mentions that dates are a sugar substitute for making homemade mithai. Then, she chose chia seeds over flax seeds and vegetable juices over smoothies. She shares that she never had matcha, so she opts for green tea. She also adds, \u201cIf I'll have to pick, then I will pick Jalebi. Small jalebis.\u201d Answering, \u201cFavourite sweet during the festival,\u201d she says, \u201cIf it's sweets, homemade kheer.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe also reveals that she would rather work out than to skip it due to the festive season. However, she mentions, \u201cI don't do calorie maths, I focus on quality ingredients.\u201d Finally, she gives a tip to reduce bloating this season, and shares, \u201cSip on more fluids,\u201d which is indeed reasonably necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about Lovneet Batra's version of spending the festive time?

        "text": "Rumors about the marriage of Bollywood stars Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan have been circulating, especially after neither Abhishek nor other Bachchan family members publicly wished Aishwarya on her 51st birthday on November 1. While fans from around the world showered Aishwarya with birthday love, her father-in-law, Amitabh Bachchan, also refrained from his usual practice of marking special occasions with heartfelt blog posts, further fueling speculation.\nAmid these ongoing rumors, an old interview with Aishwarya has resurfaced, where she opened up about her relationship with Abhishek and the crucial role of communication. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of adjustment, a lot of give and take. There will be agreements and disagreements. But it\u2019s important to keep the communication going. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always believed in,\u201d she told Filmfare.\nShe continued, \u201cAbhishek has been wonderful to respect that. Communication is extremely important in a relationship. Doesn\u2019t it all start with friendship? What\u2019s friendship all about? I\u2019m not one of those who say, \u2018Okay shut it for today and don\u2019t take it to tomorrow.\u2019 If it needs to go to tomorrow, then it\u2019ll go to tomorrow. And if you can shut the chapter today, great! But neither fit into a rule book. There\u2019s no finality in looking at each day. You have to be open-minded about how you share your time together. It also means respecting and being sensitive to your partner,\u201d she added.\nOn November 1, fans were quick to observe the silence from Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, and Shweta Bachchan, as none publicly acknowledged Aishwarya\u2019s birthday. The lack of any visible celebration led to online discussions and left some fans puzzled by the apparent change.\nOn Reddit, fans unearthed old tweets from Amitabh Bachchan that highlighted a very different tone in previous years. In 2010, Amitabh expressed gratitude to fans for their wishes for Aishwarya, sharing, \u201cT172 -First things first \u2026 thank you all for wishing Aishwarya on her birthday !! Have passed it on to her.. she thanks all \u2026 love.\u201d Another tweet mentioned a family dinner celebrating her birthday: \u201cT171 -\u2026.family dinner at Chinese in Taj where function was held \u2026 and brought in Aishwarya Birthday ..good feel about the day..\u201d\nThe Bachchan family\u2019s silence has only intensified speculation about possible marital issues between Aishwarya and Abhishek, who have been married for 17 years and are parents to Aaradhya Bachchan. The gossip started earlier this year when Aishwarya attended the Ambani wedding without Abhishek, making an entrance with their daughter, Aaradhya. Adding fuel to the fire, Abhishek recently liked a social media post about divorce, which caught fans\u2019 attention.\nAishwarya and Abhishek\u2019s relationship blossomed from friendship while working on films like Dhai Akshar Prem Ke (2000) and Kuch Naa Kaho (2003), but romance truly developed during the filming of Umrao Jaan in 2005-2006. The couple tied the knot on April 20, 2007, in a grand wedding ceremony. Following this, they welcomed their daughter Aaradhya in 2011.",

The Puneri Paltan won the game by a scoreline of 49-30, with Akash Shinde scoring 11 points, and defenders Abinesh Nadarajan, Gaurav Khatri and Aman all scoring a Hi-5 each. Meanwhile, for the Gujarat Giants, it was Guman Singh who stood out with 13 points.\nDefending champions Puneri Paltan were out of the blocks at a rapid pace, and picked up an early lead against the Gujarat Giants, who found it tough to get going in the initial minutes. Within the first five minutes, the Puneri Paltan also landed an all-out via Abinesh Nadarajan on the Gujarat Giants, which put the Season 10 champions in the box seat.\nMidway through the first half, the Puneri Paltan led the Gujarat Giants by 9 points, with Akash Shinde and Abinesh Nadarajan leading the way for their side. The Gujarat Giants had Guman Singh fighting a lone battle at this point, and what put them under more pressure was a second all-out. At the half-time break, the dominant Puneri Paltan led the contest by 30-9.\nThe second half started off with an all-out going, again, in the favour of the Puneri Paltan, who were well and truly in control of the contest. The early exchanges saw the Puneri Paltan continue to pick up points at will, while the Gujarat Giants had Guman Singh and Rakesh fighting on. Meanwhile, Puneri Paltan\u2019s Pankaj Mohite, Akash Shinde, Mohit Goyat, Abinesh Nadarajan and Gaurav Khatri were causing their opponents all sorts of problems. At the half-hour mark, the Puneri Paltan led by 25 points.\nIn the final phase of the contest, the Gujarat Giants had a few positive moments, both in defence and in attack, including being able to land an all-out on the Puneri Paltan. But it was never going to be enough, as the Puneri Paltan romped over the line to a comprehensive and comfortable win to kickstart their week.",

She is a fashion diva in every sense of the term who knows the absolute know-how of fashion. From walking the ramp for popular designers to making public appearances, Shanaya does so in the most fashionable way possible. The soon-to-be debutante rang in her birthday recently and the internet is absolutely obsessed with her sartorial choice for the evening. Shanaya chose to keep it chic yet casual and her outfit was reflective of the same. Shanaya was seen wearing the Vivara multi-coloured print dress from the shelves of the iconic brand Pucci. This \u00a31,045 maxi dress roughly converts to roughly Rs 113,898. The expensive dress fitted her like a glove, accentuated her statuesque figure and created a stunning silhouette. The dress featured not only archival prints but also a V-neckline. However, it was the backless feature of the dress and the thigh-high slit that amped up the drama of the outfit. She looked so stunning wearing the dress that her best friend, actress Suhana Khan could not help but write \"Hottttt\" in the comment section. Orry who is a social media favourite commented, \"I love the dress you wore while you kept me out of the festivities.\" Shanaya further accessorised the look with a dainty pendant, a pair of diamond studs, a sleek Cartier bracelet, a chunky golden watch and a couple of fingerrings mixed and matched to go with the vibe. For her footwear, she went ahead with a pair of white strappy flats that complemented the look in the best way possible and also looked like a comfortable choice to have made. In terms of makeup, she went ahead with a no-makeup makeup look, the pink blush on her face was in the right proportion and the nude pink lip shade matched the dress well. For her hair, she chose to keep her tresses open with beach curls.",

        "text": "King is worried about fostering a relationship with Prince Harry in case he gets involved in a Home Office legal dispute. It has been reported that the King is afraid of fostering a relationship with Prince Harry in case he is drawn into his son's legal battle against the Home Office, as quoted in a report by The Telegraph.According to a constitutional expert, the monarch is believed to be concerned that any effort to mend his relationship with the Duke of Sussex would put him in legal jeopardy. After leaving the UK, the government decided to downgrade Prince Harry's security, which has led to a protracted legal battle between him and the government. According to reports, constitutional experts worry that the Prince's propensity to recite private family conversations, most recently in his memoir Spare, and his propensity to allegedly misremember particular incidents could embarrass the King if they are revealed in court, as quoted in a report by The Telegraph.Also Read : Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War: Here\u2019s Part 3 Episode 6 release date, time, where to watch and upcoming episode scheduleAn infelicitous situation where the King's son is suing the King's ministers in the King's courts, as a senior constitutional expert and advisor to the Royal Family told royal biographer Robert Hardman. The King is being pulled in three different directions by that. The King's son has been known to publish accounts of private conversations, some of which have been inaccurate. Royal advisers have discussed the case of former butler Paul Burrell, who was charged with theft after police discovered hundreds of items belonging to Princess Diana at his home. The trial was abandoned after Queen Elizabeth II recalled that Burrell had told her he was looking after Diana's things for safekeeping. The collapse of the trial caused embarrassment to the Royal Family over claims of inappropriate involvement. Palace officials say the King is not opposed to rapprochement with the Sussexes, but the situation is complicated by the fact that several Palace staff who have dealt with Harry and Meghan are resentful of the way he has portrayed them.

The King could intervene in the matter and help broker an arrangement that would ensure their security needs are met when visiting Britain.FAQsWhy is King Charles hesitant to reconnect with Prince Harry?King Charles is concerned that repairing his relationship with Prince Harry may put him in legal jeopardy if any private family discussions are mentioned in Harry's ongoing legal case against the UK government over security concerns.Can King Charles help Prince Harry address his security concerns?Although sources close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe the King may intervene, royal advisors advise against it to avoid the appearance that the monarchy is influencing legal matters.",

        "text": "As Khushi Kapoor celebrates her birthday on November 5, 2024, the daughter of legendary actress Sridevi and producer Boney Kapoor reflects on her cherished memories of her mother. Khushi has often reminisced about her childhood, revealing how she would 'reenact Sridevi\u2019s iconic funny scenes whenever she was away'. \n\nSpeaking with NDTV about how her childhood was influenced by Bollywood, Khushi shared that her upbringing revolved around the film industry. She recalled, \"When my sister Janhvi and I were not on set, we would be at home enacting scenes and watching films.\" One particular memory stood out to her: \"I have this specific memory of putting on Om Shanti Om at home, and I would do the wave that Shah Rukh Khan and others would do, making my cousin tie my dupatta on her bracelet to repeat the whole thing.\"\n\nKhushi also mentioned her mother Sridevi's unique relationship with her own films. \"Mom would hate to watch her own movies at home and would get shy and awkward,\" she explained. This quirk led the sisters to enjoy her films in her absence, creating their own fun memories.\n\nReflecting on those playful moments, Khushi fondly recalled, \"We would end up watching them when she wasn't around and re-enact funny things she would do in them.

        "text": "Celebrating her 32nd birthday on November 5, 2024, Athiya Shetty isn\u2019t just known for her work in films. Her flair for fashion and style also makes her a favourite on social media. Her fans are familiar with her fun and candid posts, which she frequently shares, giving glimpses of her life.\nShe began her acting career in 2015, making her mark with Nikhil Advani\u2019s Hero, a remake of the iconic 1983 film by Subhash Ghai, who also co-produced the remake. Daughter of veteran actor Suniel Shetty, Athiya has found her spotlight in the glamour world. On January 23, 2023, she tied the knot with her longtime partner, Indian cricketer KL Rahul.\nTo celebrate the diva on her special day, let\u2019s revisit her journey in Bollywood and her beautiful relationship with KL Rahul.\nATHIYA SHETTY\u2019S FILMS\n\nAthiya entered Bollywood in Hero (2015), a romantic action film directed by Nikhil Advani. The film, a remake of Subhash Ghai\u2019s 1983 classic, had her playing Radha Mathur, a Mumbai-based aspiring dancer. Radha falls in love with Sooraj, played by Sooraj Pancholi\u2014a gangster who initially kidnaps her to blackmail her father, IG Shrikant Mathur. Produced by Salman Khan and co-written by Advani and Umesh Bist, the movie brought Athiya recognition for her portrayal of Radha.\n\nTwo years later, Athiya starred in Anees Bazmee\u2019s romantic comedy Mubarakan (2017) alongside Anil Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, and Ileana D\u2019Cruz. Set in Punjab and London, the movie was a box office success, grossing about Rs 93 crores, although it received mixed reviews. Athiya played Binkle Sandhu, a simple Punjabi girl romantically linked with Charan (Arjun Kapoor) but mistakenly engaged to his twin brother Karan. Her performance garnered a mixed review, reflecting the film\u2019s overall reception.\n\nIn 2018, Athiya made a special appearance in a popular song, Tere Naal Nachna, for the film Nawabzaade. A catchy composition by Badshah, it is directed by Jayesh Pradhan and produced by Remo D\u2019Souza. The song stars Raghav Juyal, Dharmesh Yelande and Punit Pathak, making it an instant hit with audiences.\n\nREAD MORE: Athiya Shetty-KL Rahul Launch Charity Auction with MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma And Others On Board\nMotichoor Chaknachoor\nIn 2019, Athiya took on the role of Anita Ani Awasthi in Motichoor Chaknachoor, a comedy-drama directed by Debamitra Biswal. Paired with Nawazuddin Siddiqui, she portrayed a young woman eager to settle abroad by marrying an NRI. Though the film itself received mixed reviews, Athiya\u2019s performance as the ambitious Ani stood out.\n\nATHIYA SHETTY AND KL RAHUL\u2019S LOVE STORY\nAthiya Shetty and KL Rahul\u2019s romance blossomed away from the spotlight, with their relationship staying under wraps for a long time. The two reportedly met in February 2019 through a mutual friend, and their connection grew quickly. They kept things private, but fans began to speculate when designer Vikram Phadnis playfully teased Athiya about her relationship on social media. Their first public hint of romance came in December 2019, with a cosy Instagram post during their New Year\u2019s celebration in Thailand, reports Filmfare.\nSince then, they have often expressed their affection online, especially on birthdays. In 2021, Rahul made their relationship official with a heartfelt Instagram post and a sweet photo of the two. Even with their visible closeness on social media, they kept their relationship details private, with Suniel Shetty respecting his daughter\u2019s boundaries and refraining from discussing their future plans.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by KL Rahul? (@klrahul)\n\nAthiya\u2019s bond with Rahul became more evident as she accompanied him on several of the Indian cricket team\u2019s tours abroad. Their relationship extended into their professional lives, with the couple doing endorsements together. Rahul became close to Athiya\u2019s family, especially when he attended the screening of her brother Ahan Shetty\u2019s film Tadap.\nREAD MORE: \u2018Baby Simba\u2019: Arjun Kapoor, Alia Bhatt And Karan Johar React To Deepika-Ranveer\u2019s Daughter Dua\u2019s Pic\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Athiya Shetty (@athiyashetty)\n\nOver the years, their relationship deepened, and they continued to attend events together, including a memorable outing in Munich with Akansha Ranjan Kapoor.

        "text": "In a surprising turn of events, music sensation Taylor Swift opted for a night of football instead of attending Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s pre-Election Day rally in Pennsylvania. Swift was seen arriving at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City on Monday night to cheer on the Chiefs as they faced off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nA Shift In Plans\n\nThere was considerable speculation that Swift would make an appearance alongside Harris at her rally, especially given her ties to the Philadelphia area. However, Swift\u2019s decision to be at the football game quickly became apparent when footage of her entering the stadium surfaced on social media. Clad in a black Chiefs jacket, Swift was seen making her way to her seat, effectively choosing the excitement of the NFL over the political event.\n\nMany of Swift\u2019s fellow A-list celebrities, who have rallied behind Harris during this election cycle, have made appearances at various campaign events. Stars such as Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, Usher, Eminem, and Beyonc\u00e9 have all publicly shown their support for the Vice President. Swift\u2019s absence from the rally highlights her unique position amidst a group of prominent figures actively campaigning for Harris.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 I Taylor has arrived in Kansas City to support Travis Kelce! #ChiefsKingdom\n\n\u2014 Taylor Swift News (@DailyTSwiftNews) November 4, 2024\n\nBalancing Personal And Political\n\nWhile Swift has publicly endorsed Harris, her choice to attend the Chiefs game speaks volumes about her personal priorities. With a clear schedule and the opportunity to support her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce, in his quest for an undefeated season, many believed it was a missed opportunity for Swift to show solidarity with Harris. Instead, she opted for a prime-time NFL matchup, signaling her commitment to her relationship over political appearances.\n\nIn September, following a presidential debate between Donald Trump and Harris, Swift made her political stance known through a social media post. She stated, \u201cI\u2019ve done my research, and I\u2019ve made my choice,\u201d encouraging her followers to participate in the electoral process. Swift emphasized the importance of registration and early voting, reflecting her commitment to civic engagement. In her endorsement, she expressed that Harris \u201cfights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\u201d\n\nPolitical Ripples In Chiefs Kingdom\n\nSwift\u2019s choice not to attend the rally has stirred conversations within the Chiefs Kingdom, particularly given the political leanings of some players\u2019 families. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes, sparked controversy earlier this year by showing her support for Trump, which she indicated by liking a post outlining the \u201c2024 GOP platform.\u201d Adding to the political mix, Mahomes\u2019 mother was spotted wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat at the game, illustrating the varied political affiliations within the sports community.\n\nMUST READ | Philadelphia DA Warns Against Election Interference: F*** Around And Find Out",

        "text": "Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan secretly revealed he visited Siddhivinayak Temple and Shri Babulnath Temple in Mumbai on Monday. The veteran actor took to his Tumblr blog to reveal that he spent Monday by offering his prayers to the dieties residing in the iconic temples. Coincidentally, Big B\u2019s visit to these spiritual destinations came a day before his son, actor Abhishek Bachchan is all set to drop the first trailer of his new film, I Want To Talk. \nTaking to his blog, Amitabh Bachchan wrote, \u201cA day filled with religious divinity, prayer and seeking the blessings of the Almighty.

        "text": "A US woman who killed her \"best friend\" in 2019 after allegedly being catfished by a man who offered her $9 million to commit the murder is speaking out about what led to this point. Denali Brehmer, now 23, shot and killed her so-called best friend Cynthia Hoffman, 19, after forming an online relationship with a man who convinced her he was rich and willing to pay her $9 million to murder a person of her choosing. She was convicted earlier this year and sentenced to 99 years in prison for the 2019 murder, the Alaska Department of Law announced. According to authorities, Denali Brehmer carried out the killing after Darin Schilmiller, a 21-year-old Indiana man living in his grandparents' basement, catfished her online and \"solicited the murder of Hoffman from Brehmer in Anchorage\". Brehmer enlisted other friends too into the plot and then in June 2019, they carried out the murder of the 19-year-old. Ms Hoffman's death was captured in photos and videos that were sent back to the man on Snapchat as proof. In 2023, Brehmer pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. Her friends - Kayden McIntosh and Caleb Leyland - were also charged in the murder. (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Now, in the latest episode of Court TV's 'Interview With a Killer', Brehmer opened up about the incident publically for the first time. \"I've already admitted guilt so now I'm ready to fully take responsibility for what I've done,\" she said in the interview which aired on Sunday, per People Magazine.Speaking to the hosts, Brehmer acknowledged that the murder was somewhat premeditated, but she also blamed it on panic. She also said that she agreed to commit the crime because she was mad at Ms Hoffman because they had gotten into a fight over a boy. Also Read | US Woman, 23, Goes Blind In One Eye After Swimming With Contact Lenses: \"Most Pain I've Ever Experienced\"Mr Brehmer said that Thunderbird Falls, where she, Leyland and McIntosh took Ms Hoffman hiking the day she was murdered, was merely \"a place of opportunity\" for them to carry out the killing. \"Initially, when we all came up with it, I agreed and said yeah because I was mad at her and she was mad at me and I was just over her s***,\" Brehmer said in the interview about the fight they had over a boy named Zack. \"I wanted to make amends, I did want to make amends but she needed payback for what she did with Zack,\" she said. When asked in the documentary if she deserved payback with her life, Brehmer said, \"no,\" adding \"That's on me.\"Brehmer was eventually arrested, and once she realized she had been catfished or tricked by Darin Schilmiller she told authorities that she had been solicited by him. She was given the maximum sentence for her role in the killing. Schilmiller, who posed as \"Tyler\" online, was also sentenced to 99 years in prison for his role in the murder. He admitted to federal agent that he chose Ms Hoffman as the victim after learning about the fight between the two friends.&nbsp",

        "text": "The commencement of verification patrolling by the Army in Eastern Ladakh, specifically in the contentious regions of Depsang and Demchok, marks a significant achievement in India\u2019s longstanding efforts to secure its borders with China. Following successful disengagement between Indian and Chinese forces in these areas, the patrol resumption reflects progress towards reducing hostilities in a region fraught with tension since early 2020. This accomplishment is notable not only for its implications on national security but also as a diplomatic milestone that could have far-reaching effects on India and the broader Indo-Pacific region. Depsang and Demchok have been focal points of friction between Indian and Chinese troops over the past few years. These regions, along with other parts of Eastern Ladakh, have been witness to frequent standoffs as each nation asserts its territorial claims. The disengagement agreement and the start of verification patrolling highlight India\u2019s determination to restore stability in the region while safeguarding its sovereignty.\nIndia\u2019s strategic approach, which combined diplomatic efforts and military preparedness, has been successful in de-escalating the situation at these friction points. Since the Galwan Valley clash in 2020, India has maintained a strong defensive posture, deploying adequate troops and establishing infrastructure to ensure readiness. Simultaneously, India has been consistent in its diplomatic efforts, holding several rounds of high-level talks with China to de-escalate tensions. The current disengagement agreement is a result of this sustained diplomacy and resolve, showcasing India\u2019s ability to balance diplomacy with deterrence.\nResuming patrolling rights in Depsang and Demchok is an assertion of India\u2019s sovereignty in these areas. Patrolling rights are crucial as they represent the control a nation exercises over its territory and allow ground commanders to verify adherence to agreements and monitor any movements. The mutual agreement on verification patrolling reflects India\u2019s insistence on transparency in the de-escalation process and holds China accountable for compliance with established norms. By achieving this outcome, India has effectively reaffirmed its position and bolstered its operational confidence in Eastern Ladakh. With the restoration of pre-2020 patrolling levels, India has successfully re-established the status quo, ensuring that any future developments or deployments will be conducted on mutually accepted grounds. This move reflects India\u2019s unwavering commitment to safeguarding its interests along the LAC.\nMoreover, this achievement sends a clear signal that India will not yield to unilateral territorial assertions. China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in recent years has prompted India to pursue stronger security alliances, such as the Quad-a strategic alliance with the United States, Japan, and Australia-while also deepening its partnerships with regional neighbours. Through these moves, India is strengthening its position as a stabilising force in the Indo-Pacific, with the capability to counter any encroachments on its territory.\nHowever, the underlying tensions between India and China, which stem from historical border disagreements and strategic competition, are unlikely to dissipate entirely. Moreover, the current disengagement does reflect a potential thaw in hostilities and creates room for the two nations to explore further dialogue on broader issues. India\u2019s recent diplomatic achievement also sets an example of peaceful conflict resolution. Amidst a global climate of territorial disputes, this achievement may contribute to a precedent of negotiation over aggression. The India-China border conflict has drawn international attention, particularly in the context of China\u2019s territorial claims in other regions, such as the South China Sea. India\u2019s insistence on fair and transparent disengagement reinforces its commitment to international law and stability, sending a strong message to China and the global community.\nThe resumption of patrolling and verification provides a morale boost not only to the armed forces but also to the general public. The Government\u2019s focus on bolstering infrastructure and enhancing connectivity in border areas has been a prudent step. Improved logistics in regions like Ladakh will enhance India\u2019s ability to monitor and respond to any developments along the border. However, India must remain vigilant and prepared for any unexpected developments.",

        "text": "Nora Fatehi garnered significant fame with her popular dance songs, such as Dilbar, Garmi and Kamariya. In the last few years, the actor-dancer has been vocal about various issues in Bollywood. In a recent conversation, she explained how difficult it gets to make people understand her different body type. Nora also shared that she would often ask her stylists not to dress her up like the other actresses, including Janhvi Kapoor, Sara Ali Khan and Ananya Panday.\nIn an interview at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, Nora revealed that she refused to wear the blouse the stylists had initially designed for her for the song \u201cDilbar\u201d from Satyameva Jayate. Despite not having a strong foothold in the industry back then, she was determined not to wear such a blouse and asked them to reconstruct it. However, now the tables have turned.\nNora shared that now that she has the power to talk about her choices, she would often ask her stylists not to dress her up like the young actresses. She said, \u201cToday, when I do have the power to talk. I do tell my stylists, \u2018This is too much.\u2019 The way they dress Ananya (Panday), Sara (Ali Khan), or Janhvi (Kapoor), they cannot dress me the same way. My body is not the same.\u201d \nShe continued, \u201cI have a lot of conflicts where I do have to push this on stylists and directors because they will make certain clothes and be like, \u2018Well, the others are wearing this.\u2019 I am like, \u2018I get that, but the others don\u2019t look like me, unfortunately, when I wear it.\u2019 So we have to think about that, and with my body type, because it\u2019s not really familiar in Bollywood. Not a lot of girls have my body type.\u201d\nDespite the fact that directors and stylists often struggle to understand her perspective, Nora frequently advocates for her clothing choices.

        "text": "Currently riding high on the success of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, Kartik Aaryan's dating life recently became the subject of media glare and public scrutiny when Vidya Balan teased him on The Great Indian Kapil Show. But recently during an interview with The Mashable India, the actor disclosed he is single and haven't had any time to date since Chandu Champion. He further elaborated how hectic his work schedule has been, because of which he barely had any time. \"I am single. I don't have to send my live location to anyone. I am not even present in any dating applications. Technically, since the time I have been preparing and shooting for Chandu Champion, I didn't get the time,\" Kartik said on being asked about his current relationship status. Further explaining how his last couple of years have been, the actor said, \"I was in such a strict regime, in which I had to calculate my gym, eating, and sleeping pattern, just like an athlete. All of that went on for two years. In fact, I was also learning swimming for the very first time. The routine became so hectic. Plus, shooting for Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 and finishing it in a specific period of time was also a challenge. So, I was completely busy with all that.\"Recently, when the Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 team came on Netflix's The Great Indian Kapil Show, Vidya Balan playfully revealed, \"During the shoot, he was always on his phone between takes. I used to stand next to him, hoping to catch a hint, but all I could hear him say was, 'Me Too, Me Too.' So I had no idea!\" and then teased him by asking \"What is her name?\" This led to speculations about who the girl might be. But Kartik has now cleared the air.Directed by Anees Bazmee, the horror comedy movie's cast also includes Triptii Dimri, Madhuri Dixit, Rajpal Yadav, Shweta Tiwari, and Vijay Raaz in important roles. Within just four days of release, the movie has minted Rs 123.5 crore at the box office.

        "text": "BLACKPINK\u2019s Rose aka Roseanna Park, has been garnering significant traction ever since she released the punchy and peppy single APT, featuring Bruno Mars. The song is the first single from her debut album, Rosie. In a recent interview, the songstress opened up about the much heavier themes of her upcoming album, scheduled to be released on December 6. She shared that it would revolve around toxic relationships, love gone wrong and missed red flags, among others.\nDuring her conversation with Paper Magazine, the BLACKPINK member, for the first time, talked about her love life and revealed that she has had her fair share of \u201ctoxic relationships\u201d, just like any other girl in her early 20s. Rose said, \u201cI think I\u2019m grateful enough to have gone through a few relationships, you know, like a normal girl in her 20s. I do want people to understand that I\u2019m not much different from your average girlfriend or 23-year-old girl.\u201d\nThe APT singer further mentioned that it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a toxic romantic relationship but any kind to understand her new music. \u201cI\u2019m probably very relatable if you listen to my songs and if anyone\u2019s been in that kind of a relationship. It doesn\u2019t even have to be about a boyfriend, just any type of toxic relationship,\u201d she added. \nRose also highlighted that she wanted to sing about the vulnerabilities that people generally have during their twenties, making it more relatable to her fans. The BLACKPINK singer said, \u201cThe 20s is not an easy time to live through. It\u2019s when you\u2019re very vulnerable and confused, excited and angry about life. That\u2019s what I wanted to sing about.\u201d Through her upcoming album, the 27-year-old singer aims at \u201cmanipulators and emotional traitors\u201d and is all about the \u201cterrible 20s.\u201d\nIn the same conversation, Rose revealed that through her upcoming album, she wants people to understand her real self and stop misunderstanding her all the time. \u201cAt the end of the day, I want people to understand me and stop misunderstanding me as a person as well. I\u2019m ready to be a bit more vulnerable and open and honest in order for people to not misunderstand, and take me for what I am,\u201d she said.\nSpeaking of her love life, since the time Rose has entered showbiz, she has been entangled in several dating rumours. First, she was associated with South Korean actor Kang Dong Won after they were spotted together at a social gathering. Soon, Ros\u00e9 agency denied the rumours. After this, the 27-year-old was said to be dating ASTRO\u2019s Cha Eun Woo. The speculations were solely based on their similar Instagram posts.",

The young girl shared that the foundation helped her after her father passed away. Hearing her speak, Suriya broke down. \n\u201cWhen I started the Akaram Foundation, the Telugu people came forward to help us as much as the Tamil people came forward to help us.

        "text": "Ryan Reynolds has announced an exciting reunion with his Deadpool and Wolverine co-star Hugh Jackman, along with director Shawn Levy, for a new movie.\n\nHowever, fans should note that this project is not a part of the Marvel universe. In a recent interview with Variety on the Awards Circuit podcast, Reynolds shared a few details about the upcoming film, including his dedication to writing the script.\n\nReynolds confirmed that he will spend the year working on the script for this new project. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m spending the year writing. I\u2019m writing a movie for myself, Hugh, and Shawn to do that is not Marvel.\u201d Reynolds did not disclose specific plot details of this new film.\n\nThis announcement follows the successful collaboration between Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and Shawn Levy on Deadpool & Wolverine, which has garnered significant attention and acclaim.\n\n Director Shawn Levy has a long-standing relationship with both actors. He worked with Jackman on the 2011 sci-fi film Real Steel, which has since gained a loyal fan base.\n\nIn addition, Levy collaborated with Reynolds on Free Guy in 2021 and The Adam Project in 2022. This collaboration led to Levy directing Deadpool & Wolverine, a project that broke box office records, earning a remarkable $1.3 billion worldwide.\n\nReynolds has expressed his appreciation for Levy, stating that he would not have pursued a third Deadpool film unless Levy was at the helm.\n\nWhile fans are eager to see what this new film will entail, it appears they will have to wait. Reynolds mentioned that he would be focused on writing throughout 2025, which suggests that production may not begin until 2026.\n\n As Reynolds works on this new original film, there are questions about the future of his character, Deadpool, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Reynolds has been heavily involved in the creative direction of the Deadpool films. If he dedicates time to this new project, it may limit his availability to contribute to future Deadpool storylines.\n\nWhile Disney and Marvel are keen on having Deadpool return in upcoming installments, they have a packed schedule of other projects. This could mean a longer wait for audiences hoping to see Reynolds and Jackman on screen as their beloved characters again.\n\nALSO READ: \u2018People Can Get Really Tired\u2019: Barry Keoghan Responds To 'Deadbeat Dad' Claims And Talks About Avoiding Weird Roles",

He has issued an apology for repeating the same slur hurled at him and his brother, Travis Kelce. \n\nJason was at the Ohio State-Penn State match at Beaver Stadium in State College Pennsylvania and during this match, a man was hurling anti-gay slurs regarding Travis and his pop-star girlfriend Taylor Swift which provoked Jason. The heckler had called Travis a \"f**got\" for dating the pop sensation and shoved him to the ground, as can be seen in a widely circulated video on social media.\n\nThe heckler's offensive remarks made a furious Jason retaliate by slamming the heckler\u2019s phone and using the same insult directed at his brother. This event garnered a lot of attention on online platforms, prompting Jason to respond to it and ensure that he would clarify the situation in one of ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Countdown segments.\n\nThe New Heights podcast host said, \"Everybody has seen what happened. I\u2019m not happy with anything that took place. I\u2019m not proud of it. In a heated moment, I chose to greet hate with hate, and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a productive thing, I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think it leads to discourse and it\u2019s [not] the right way to go about things.\"\n\n In the rush of events, Jason was able to say that he did not react well and that he did not meet the standards set by himself and those that he would like to emulate. He reaffirmed the importance of the golden rule, which is to do unto others as you would have them do to you, and said he would do better in the future.\n\nSince Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift started their romantic affair in September 2022, the two have been in the public eye as they have been attending numerous events together including football matches. \n\nJason Kelce concluded his reflection by saying, \"I think the bottom line is I try to live my life by the golden rule, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always been taught. I try to treat people with common decency and respect, and I\u2019m gonna keep doing that moving forward even though I fell short this week.\"\nALSO READ: Did Taylor Swift Predict Travis Kelce\u2019s First Touchdown Of The Season?

The gala gathered in one place a horde of stars and raised a staggering amount of 6.4 million USD for good causes, which is a new record. The brattiest detail of the festivities included Charli XCX's music that headlined the gala.\n\nWintour presented a special tribute to the avant-garde director Luhrmann, who is her longtime friend and associate. In her speech, she recalled various incidents where Luhrmann's creative inputs have aided her in the past. One of the anecdotes she shared involved Rihanna dancing on a table at the Met Gala and it was Luhrmann who made it happen, as per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nShe said, \"The year we put on a show of Chinese art and fashion, he announced before the gala that the evening could not go on unless we tracked down a giant gong with which to announce dinner. While we were locating and trying to figure out how to deliver this enormous instrument, Baz had somehow persuaded Rihanna to surprise everybody by dancing down the center of the dinner table.\"\n\n\"Incidentally, we are no longer allowed to give dinners in that gallery, but no one has stopped talking about that night,\" Wintour added.\n\n Luhrmann who is behind successful films such as Romeo + Juliet, The Great Gatsby, Moulin Rouge, and Elvis, did not shy away from the limelight dressed in a smart Gucci suit as he encouraged those artists to lift up younger generations. He emphasized how artists should try create art where the future generations can be inspired.\n\nHe stressed the need for the people in the room to be active and help young voices and energies who are getting into the arts, promoting both collaboration and imagination. \u201cIt\u2019s our job now to turn around and to make space and to lift up the new voices and the new energies and the new generations, and let that new energy smash through this ossified world we\u2019re in.\"\n\nBaz Luhrmann clarified that he was not talking about retirement, rather he meant that those icons his generation had looked up to helped them by creating space for them, and that\u2019s the duty that falls on the shoulders of artists already present in the room.\nALSO READ: Rihanna Confirms 2025 Met Gala Appearance Alongside A$AP Rocky; Admits She's 'Concerned' About What To Wear",

And Taylor takes on that love with her personal touch; she makes every fan interaction a sort of magic encounter. One of her most cherished traditions is the one that occurs at \"22,\" where Taylor falls to her knees to present her lucky fan with her famous black hat.

        "text": "The turmoil in the Malayalam film industry ever since the Hema Committee report became public in August took a new twist on Tuesday as the Producers' Association ousted actress-cum-producer Sandra Thomas, who had been complaining about its functioning, from the body. An active personality in the Malayalam film industry, Thomas and the Association had been at loggerheads since the Hema Committee report was published and she had filed a complaint against the Association, alleging that it was acting as a feeder organisation of the powerful Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA). The Association dismissed her complaint as a fake one and they decided to take action against her. Already with the relations strained between her and her Association, she, along with another woman producer, made a written demand that there should be a change of the office bearers of the Association and this was treated as an act of indiscipline by the male-dominated grouping. She was also upset with the Association over its silence after the Hema Committee report was published and the police launched action, based on the various complaints that came from various actresses. She was further upset when the association called a meeting to discuss the issues raised by her and it ended up as an eyewash and she felt she was humiliated. Another reason why she was seen as a troublemaker was when she expressed her view that in the Malayalam film industry, there exists a power group which decides everything. Known for her roles in popular films like \"Amen\" and *Zachariayude Garbhinikal\", Thomas was also the producer of \"Zachariayude Garbhinikal\" and \"Philips and the Monkey Pen\". In the past, she was in the limelight when her business partner Vijay Babu, who co-founded film production company Friday Film House, split with her. She then started her own production company named Sandra Thomas Productions. (With inputs from IANS)",

        "text": "No one can forget how invested people were in the 2022 dramatic defamation trial of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. The trial went viral online for multiple reasons, one of them being statements that she made at the beginning of trial that she still had love her ex.\n\nWhen Heard appeared in an interview with NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie, she was asked about the statement she made for her ex during the legal session. The actress was asked if the statement she made still held any truth.\n\nTo which she expressed, \u201cYes. Absolutely. Absolutely. I love him. I loved him with all my heart, and I tried the best I could to make a deeply broken relationship work. And I couldn't. I have no bad feelings or ill will towards him at all. I know that might be hard to understand, or it might be really easy to understand if you've ever loved anyone.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, she stood firm to the allegations she made against Depp. During her conversation with the journalist, the Aquaman star said that till the day she dies, she will continue to stand by each word of her testimony.\n\nAfter the trial was done, with time many netizens seemingly forgot about it as the discussion on the same topic became less. Since then, Heard has not been much out there, and many people question where she is these days.\n\n To answer the question, the actress has reportedly been staying in Spain. Due to her fluency in the language, she surely is adjusting well. In a previous interview, she expressed her love for Spain. She was asked if she would go on to stay in the region, and she said, \u201cYes, I hope so. Yes, yes, I love living here.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to her personal life, the actress reportedly birthed a daughter, Oonagh Paige Heard, in 2021 via the route of surrogacy.\n\nAs far as her professional front goes, she was seen in an independent movie titled In the Fire, which was released in 2023. In the project, she portrays a psychologist in the 1800s working on a child\u2019s case who is rumored to be possessed. The actress also appeared at the Taormina Film Festival to promote the venture.

        "text": "Fatima Sana Shaikh is a versatile actress who has carved a niche for herself through powerful acting. She became a well-known name after Dangal. However, she played a pivotal role in Thugs Of Hindostan. Recently, the actress opened up about her experience working with Amitabh Bachchan. Fatima praised the actor and revealed that he did not get tired.\nIn a recent chat with Filmfare, Fatima Sana Shaikh shared how Amitabh Bachchan spent an entire day submerged in water and said, \u201cWe were doing a scene in Thugs where Amitabh Bachchan sir was in the water for one full day. He had worn a heavy armour and was giving a monologue. That man did not get tired! He would himself ask (the director), \u2018Sir should we have one more take? Did you get what you wanted?\u201d Thugs of Hindostan starred Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif, alongside Bachchan and Fatima. The film was a big flop at the box office. It was made on a whopping budget of Rs 300 crore and managed to earn only Rs 150 crore at the box office.\nIn a recent interview, Fatima also revealed that she was diagnosed with epilepsy during Dangal. She mentioned how she was afraid of having a seizure in public and how she has learnt to cope with the disease over time.\nIn a conversation with Filmfare, Fatima Sana Shaikh revealed how she struggled to accept her diagnosis. She mentioned that she was aware of the stigma and said that she was afraid that people might label her as an attention-seeker. The actor said, \u201cI was diagnosed with epilepsy during the Dangal shoot. At first, I was in denial and wasn\u2019t willing to accept that I had a neurological disorder, so I didn\u2019t take any medication. I was scared I might have an episode in front of people. Epilepsy carries a lot of stigma. People think you\u2019re either on drugs, seeking attention, or possessed and should be avoided.\u201d\nOn the work front, Shaikh was last seen in Sam Bahadur. She will be next seen in Metro\u2026In Dino.",

        "text": "Days after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath coined his new slogan, \u201cBatenge Toh Katenge\u201d (divided we shall fall) ostensibly aimed at the unity of Hindus, following near-debacle for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to reaffirm his party\u2019s policy with his newly-coined phrase \u2014 \u201cEk Hain Toh Safe Hain\u201d (if we are united, we are safe). The Prime Minister, during his speech on the occasion of the birthday of India\u2019s first home minister and freedom fighter Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as usual laid stress on oneness in the country and said India is moving towards One Nation, One Civil Code. Globally, most countries have switched to a common civil code as an expression of equality and non-discrimination. In India, the Constitution\u2019s Directive Principles of State Policy, though not justiciable, calls for the promulgation of a uniform civil code for the whole country. As a policy, the uniform civil code may be welcomed if it does not discriminate against one group in favour of the other and if it does not impose a practice of the followers of one religion on those following other religions. Furthermore, marriage laws in India are based on local traditions \u2014 an aspect that gained recognition through the Hindu Marriage Act. As traditions are an inherent part of one\u2019s culture, they are protected under Articles 29 and 30 (cultural and educational rights) of the Constitution, which allows any citizen to challenge the validity of uniform civil code if it is discriminatory.The government must, therefore, resist the temptation to hasten the introduction of Uniform Civil Code and initiate a comprehensive public consultation before preparing its draft to be presented in Parliament. In fact, a lesson or two could be learnt from the consultation conducted before the Hindu Code was legislated in 1955. The debate on the need for Hindu code was first initiated in 1921 by Mahamahopadhyaya Ganganath Jha, a member of the Viceroy\u2019s Legislative Council. The draft was debated between March 1943 and March 1944. Subsequently, the four-member Hindu Law Committee toured the entire country for one year for consultation. Finally, the Hindu Code Bill was introduced to the Constituent Assembly on April 9, 1948, and was debated extensively during 1948-1951 before being enacted four years later in 1955.",

        "title": "No Clean Shave, Love Then",
        "text": "As no shave November (aka Movember) approaches, in the bustling streets of Indore, a bold new trend is shaking up the dating scene: the \u201cNo Clean Shave, No Love\u201d movement. This cheeky slogan has taken social media by storm, prompting women to declare their preference for clean-shaven partners in a city known for its rich culture and vibrant community. What started as a light-hearted call-out has quickly evolved into a full-fledged debate about personal grooming and its influence on modern relationships. Cut To Love The movement gained traction when several young women in Indore took to social media to share their thoughts on men\u2019s grooming habits. Armed with hashtags and selfies, they proclaimed that if a guy wants to catch their eye, he better keep his face clean and smooth. \u201cI just feel more attracted to a guy who takes care of himself,\u201d says Dhanashree Subhedhar, a SEO specialist leading the charge. \u201cA clean shave shows effort, and who doesn\u2019t love a little extra polish?\u201d But it\u2019s not just about the aesthetic appeal; it\u2019s a reflection of broader societal norms and expectations surrounding masculinity. A recent survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) found that 78% of young adults aged 18-35 believe good grooming is crucial in a partner. Talk about a grooming revolution! Clean-shaven men are becoming the darlings of the dating scene, while their bearded counterparts may need to reconsider their strategy \u2014 or risk finding themselves single. Beards, Bonds, Breakups It turns out that personal grooming is not merely a matter of vanity; it\u2019s a love language too. The movement highlights how grooming preferences can signal self-care, attention to detail, and even a certain level of sophistication. Who knew that a little razor could wield such romantic power? Grooming is a reflection of lifestyle choices and values, and as societal expectations evolve, so do the standards of attraction. In a world where appearances often speak louder than words, a clean shave has become the new heartthrob. Gone are the days when ruggedness was synonymous with masculinity; the modern man is all about the sleek, sophisticated look. A well-groomed man might just get the green light in the dating game. Grooming Gains Ground The \u201cNo Clean Shave, No Love\u201d movement has prompted many men to rethink their grooming habits. As the trend spreads, some men are embracing the challenge of clean-shaven appearances, while others are staunchly defending their beards. For many women, it\u2019s not just about their physical appearance; it\u2019s a reflection of personal values. \u201cIf a guy can\u2019t take the time to groom himself, how will he take care of other important things?\u201d expresses Evette John, a marketing executive. However, the movement has sparked conversations about the pressure to conform to certain looks. Not every man feels comfortable sporting a clean-shaven face, and the debate raises questions about individuality versus societal expectations. In the quest for love, it seems some men may feel they have to compromise their personal style. According to a survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Management Indore, 45% of women in urban areas express a preference for clean-shaven partners over those with facial hair. The same survey also indicated that 40% of men are willing to adapt their grooming habits to meet the preferences of their partners. Additionally, fashion experts can shed light on how grooming trends have evolved over the years. Grooming styles are reflective of societal changes. What\u2019s trendy now may not have been the case a decade ago,\u201d says Brenden Mathew, a UX UI designer. \u201cMen are becom-ing increasingly aware of their appearance, which is a positive shift.\u201d Shave, Share, Swoon As the \u201cNo Clean Shave, No Love\u201d movement continues to gain momentum in Indore, it serves as a reminder of the impact that personal grooming can have on relationships. While preferences may vary, the underlying message is clear: self-care matters, and so does the effort put into maintaining one\u2019s appearance. Whether you\u2019re clean-shaven or sporting a beard, what ultimately matters is authenticity. Grooming trends will come and go, but confidence and self-acceptance will always remain attractive qualities. So, gentlemen, if you\u2019re feeling the pressure to pick up a razor, remember: love isn\u2019t just about looks; it\u2019s about the connection you build. And who knows? You might just find that the right partner appreciates you for exactly who you are\u2014beard or no beard!",

It's not a one-sided right that the franchise has, the player has to consider various factors and agree,\" said Mysore.\"Somewhere along the line, if that agreement doesn't happen because of factors like money or someone wants to test their value, then the decision is influenced,\" Mysore said.Mysore stated that although he enjoys a personal rapport with Shreyas, the batter wanted to test his value in the auction, a decision that he was happy to support. He emphasised the importance of players prioritising their commercial value.\"In this case, it so happened that he felt it was best, and we're always supportive of the players when it comes to going to the auction and testing their value,\" Mysore added.With teams such as Punjab Kings (PBKS), Delhi Capitals (DC) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the hunt for captains, Iyer could be highly sought-after in the IPL 2025 mega auction.",

The host asked the actress if she had ever forgotten herself, to which Rupali said: \u201cOf course, but six-and-a-half years when you are home as a housewife\u2026 After having a kid your waistline suddenly becomes 40 from 24-25. You stop looking at yourself in the mirror.\u201d\n\nShe said that \u201cMonisha Sarabhai\u201d has \u201cgained so much weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAunties will just say it but those things really hurt a woman who is anyway battling with a lot of things. There are a lot of postpartum things happening. I have always worked,\u201d she added.\n\nRupali revealed that she relates to her iconic 90s character Monisha Sarabhai from the sitcom \u201cSarabhai Vs Sarabhai.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would come home and one slipper would be here and the other other there. I was Monisha Sarabhai. My mother raised me with a lot of love. But I was still very hardworking,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThen you get married with so many responsibilities not that the husband did not share the responsibilities. He was there with me\u2026 And not once did my husband tell me that I am ugly or I was fat. I don\u2019t think he even realised that I became so big.\u201d\n\nWomen feel less of themselves, she shared.\n\n\u201cTo accept yourself, you look for plus size clothes. Somewhere there your self image takes a beating. You feel less of yourself somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe talk show host asked if she ever cried because of all this?\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even have time for that. I didn\u2019t even have time for that because today I feel like I am working very hard, I am doing my work very diligently. I shoot in the morning and at night. But a housewife works 10 times more than me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was not doing anything, I was working a lot. I mean, on one hand, you manage the house. On the other hand, even though your house helps, they are very good. But still, somewhere, you have to manage.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo somehow, by talking, you have to do everything. Whether you have to go to the grocery store, or if something happens to your child, you become paranoid. You say, my child, what happened to my child?\u201d\n\nRupali said that she became completely paranoid.\n\n\u201cAnd when a child is at a late age, he becomes even more paranoid. So doing all those things, then you realise that you are so paranoid all the time. I had become completely paranoid. Like everything had to be perfect and I was not managing to do anything perfectly. So yeah, this happens,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Mumbai: Bollywood actress Suhana Khan, who made her debut with the streaming movie \u2018The Archies\u2019, has shared rare pictures of her childhood with her father, the Bollywood icon Shah Rukh Khan and her brother, Aaryan Khan.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the actress took to the Stories section of her Instagram, and shared pictures in sepia tone on the occasion of her father\u2019s birthday.\r\n\r\nShe wrote on the picture, \u201cHappy birthday, love you the most\u201d.\r\n\r\nKing Khan is celebrating his 59th birthday on Saturday. The actor, who entered the film industry after a brief stint in television, capitalised on the opening of India\u2019s economy, and made a seamless shift from grey characters to the king of romance.\r\n\r\nSRK is inarguably the face of Indian cinema across the world with several honorary doctorate degrees, a Padma Shri, and the French Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\nThe actor was last seen in \u2018Jawan\u2019 and single-handedly pulled the Hindi film industry out of the commercial lull induced due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nEarlier, Suhana had revealed the secret to her perfect svelte figure, which includes a combination of pull ups and deadlifts. She took to her Instagram, and shared a video of herself working out in the gym.\r\n\r\nIn the clip, the actress, who made her debut with Zoya Akhtar\u2019s \u201cThe Archies\u201d, is seen doing several weighted workouts including pull ups, hip thrusts, push ups and deadlifts under the supervision of a personal trainer.\r\n\r\nThe actress made her debut with \u2018The Archies\u2019 which was dubbed a critical disaster. The film was also panned for being the debut vehicle of Bollywood kids, and was caught in the nepotism controversy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Suhana will be next seen in the upcoming movie \u2018King\u2019 which also stars SRK in the titular role.",

        "title": "Rewind: Telugu diaspora as soft power",
        "text": "By Dr Akhil Kumar, Anudeep Gujjeti\r\n\r\nIndian Americans represent a substantial voting bloc and hold the potential to influence the election outcome in the United States, particularly at local levels. Both Presidential candidates\u2014Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee former President Donald Trump \u2014 are making significant efforts to engage with this segment. With a population of more than 5 million, Indian-Americans constitute approximately 1.5% of the US population from foreign origin. As of 2022, the US Census Bureau reports that around 46% of Indian Americans are eligible to vote\u2014a notable figure compared with other ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nHowever, an often-overlooked nuance in discussions about the Indian diaspora is its diversity. While the diaspora is frequently regarded as a unified entity with shared national interests, it comprises residents from various linguistic, cultural and political backgrounds, representing different States across India. These diverse political perspectives, shaped by their regional origins, often influence their engagement in politics in the country they reside in. One such influential community is the Telugu-speaking population, which plays a significant role within this heterogeneous diaspora.\r\n\r\nIncreasing Influence\r\n\r\nThe Telugu diaspora holds a significant presence in States such as Virginia, Texas, California, Georgia and Illinois. In recent times, the Telugu-speaking population in the US has quadrupled, rising from 3.2 lakh in 2016 to 12.3 lakh this year. Telugu is now the 11th most spoken language out of 350 languages in the US and the third most spoken Indian language thereafter Hindi and Gujarati. According to a Statistical Atlas of the USA report based on US Census Bureau data, the Telugu-speaking population includes fourth-generation immigrants to the students who arrive in the US every year (60,000-70,000) to pursue higher studies.\r\n\r\nTelugu diaspora holds a particularly significant presence in States such as Virginia, Texas, California, Georgia and Illinois. The Telugu-speaking population in the US has quadrupled \u2014 from 3.2 lakh in 2016 to 12.3 lakh this year\r\n\r\nAmong all the States in the US, California hosts the largest Telugu-speaking population followed by Texas (1.5 lakh), and New Jersey (1.1 lakh). Interestingly, Santa Clara County in the city of California, permitted voters registration for mail-in voting in six Indian languages, including Telugu, which appeared on the ballot boxes in the US 2020 Presidential elections. In fact, in the recently held student union elections at the University of South Florida, G Suryakant Prasad, who hails from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, was elected as president.\r\n\r\nIn his 1975 work Andhras in the United States of America published in Telugu Vani: Voice of the Telugu People, P Venugopala Rao categorised Telugus residing in the US into four distinct groups: students pursuing higher education, individuals who obtained postgraduate degrees in the US and settled as permanent residents, professionals who entered the US for employment, and dependents, who constitute a significant portion of the Telugu-speaking population.\r\n\r\nCSHN Murthy in Mapping Media, Cultural Ties, and Political Economy with Homeland noted the substantial impact the Telugu film and television industry has had on overseas audiences, particularly in the US, where Telugu films generate significant revenue. Radio Surabhi, a 24-hour Telugu radio station broadcasting on HD frequency 104.9, has gained widespread popularity within the diaspora, amassing over 50,000 followers and becoming a new cultural sensation for the community in America. The channel was launched in 2018 and transitioned into a 24/7 operation in 2022. It is the brainchild of Rajeswari Udayagiri, an IT professional. The slogan, \u201cAe bidda idi mana America lo Telugodi adda, Radio Surabhi America lo Telugu nestham\u201d (This is your Telugu gathering spot in America, Radio Surabhi, your Telugu friend in America), echoes throughout the streets of Dallas, which has a significant Telugu-speaking population.\r\n\r\nIn March 2021, Joel Reifman, former US Consul General, Hyderabad, said one in four Telugu families had an American connection. The significant number of visa applications originating from Hyderabad, along with the growing interest among Telugu families in securing matrimonial alliances with individuals settled in the US \u2014often referred to as \u2018America sambandham\u2019,is as clear evidence of the high rate of Telugu migration to the US.\r\n\r\nPreserving Identity\r\n\r\nIn recent years, numerous Telugu-speaking organisations have intensified their efforts to preserve and strengthen the cultural identity and unity of the community. These initiatives include promoting teaching and learning of the Telugu language to ensure its continued use among younger generations. Additionally, these organisations are working towards the construction of temples, providing a space for spiritual and cultural gatherings.\r\n\r\nTelugu is now the 11th most spoken language out of 350 languages in the US and the third most spoken Indian language thereafter Hindi and Gujarati\r\n\r\nThey also actively organise and celebrate traditional Telugu festivals such as Bonalu, Bathukamma and Sankranti, fostering a deeper connection to their heritage and promoting cultural continuity within the diaspora. The growing influence of Telugus can be gauged from the fact that in 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared April 2 as Telugu Language and Heritage Day in the State. In recent times, Telangana\u2019s floral festival Bathukamma has received official recognition as \u2018Festival of Life\u2019 in various cities of the US.\r\n\r\nSobering Reality\r\n\r\nHowever, beneath the narrative of success and opportunity that often characterises the Indian American diaspora in the US lies a more sobering reality, marked by the persistent threat of gun violence and the increasing number of shootings. These dangers weigh heavily on the minds of Indian parents and prospective students. Yet, the allure of a promising and prosperous future eclipses concerns for personal safety.\r\n\r\nAmong all the States in the US, California hosts the largest Telugu-speaking population followed by Texas (1.5 lakh), and New Jersey (1.1 lakh)\r\n\r\nIn the domain of international relations, the post-Cold War years had a huge impact on the political and economic milieu of several nations, marked by the increasing involvement of non-state civic actors on a global scale which can be attributed to several factors. First, the global expansion of democratic governance created more opportunities for civic engagement. Second, the rise of interconnectedness, driven by advancements in communication technologies, revolutionised the way people and organisations across borders interacted. Third, globalisation facilitated the growth of transnational and multinational civic activities, allowing non-state actors to operate beyond national boundaries. Finally, the wider dissemination of education and the resulting increase in public awareness empowered individuals and groups to participate more actively in civic and political spheres.\r\n\r\nTraditional diplomacy has undergone significant changes as interactions between states are no longer confined to official government channels. Instead, they now occur through an expansive and growing network of civil society organisations. Despite this shift, the state remains the primary facilitator and executor of foreign policy, maintaining its central role in the formal diplomatic process.\r\n\r\nWhile diaspora communities may play a minor role for smaller countries, for nations like India and China, with large populations dispersed across the globe, these communities serve as a crucial source of soft power and they become the cultural ambassadors of their respective countries. They act as conduits for transmitting cultural, economic and political values from their homeland to the countries they reside in, while simultaneously engaging in the political processes of both nations. Additionally, these groups are often afforded special recognition in host countries due to their shared sense of cultural distinctiveness, which allows them to be viewed as a cohesive entity.\r\n\r\nPoliticians\u2019 Preferred\r\n\r\nIn recent times, the Telugu-speaking population in the US has gained significant political attention, both in the US and in India. This community, now recognised for its economic influence and political clout, has become a key demographic for politicians seeking support. In the midst of the Indian election season this summer, several political leaders travelled abroad, making deliberate efforts to connect with the diaspora. These interactions reflect the diaspora\u2019s growing role in shaping political narratives and decisions, both in India and beyond.\r\n\r\nHaving established a strong presence in Silicon Valley, the Telugu community in the US is now beginning to make significant inroads into US politics and policymaking\r\n\r\nHaving established a strong presence in Silicon Valley, the Telugu community in the US is now beginning to make significant inroads into US politics and policy making. This shift reflects a broader ambition within the community to not only contribute to the economy but also influence political discourse and governance in the country they currently reside.\r\n\r\nAruna Miller, born in Hyderabad and a member of the Democratic Party, made history by becoming the first Indian American to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Maryland. Her family, hailing from Ventrapragada in Pedaparupudimandal of Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, immigrated to the US when she was just eight years old. Similarly, Dilip Tunki, a resident of Johns Creek, Georgia, and a native of Hyderabad, is serving as a city council member. His proactive involvement in community initiatives led to the organisation of Diwali celebrations in Johns Creek for the first time. Paramesh Bob Erramilli, a Hyderabad-based pilot, was also a council member from Fulton County in Johns Creek City.\r\n\r\nChivukula Upendra, an electrical engineer from Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, served as a Democratic legislator from 2002 to 2014, and played a crucial role in shaping policy. Narender Reddy, a prominent figure within the Republican Party in Georgia, hails from Nalgonda in Telangana. Although he ran as a Republican candidate and was not successful in his campaign, he has emerged as an influential voice among Republicans in Georgia, actively participating in discussions and initiatives related to regional transportation and other community matters. Bangar R Reddy Aloori from Jajireddygudem in Suryapet district of Telangana also ran as a Democratic candidate although he was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAs Usha Chilukuri, wife of JD Vance, who is the Vice Presidential running mate of Donald Trump, enters the political arena, it underscores the increasing influence of the Telugu-speaking community in US politics. This emergence reflects a broader trend of heightened political engagement among individuals of Indian origin, particularly those from the Telugu diaspora.\r\n\r\nThe growing representation of Telugu speakers in political positions not only enriches the diversity of American political discourse but also brings unique perspectives and experiences to the forefront. As more individuals from this community seek public office, they are likely to advocate for issues pertinent to both their local constituencies and communities of origin. This dual engagement can lead to stronger advocacy for policies that address the needs of the diaspora, such as immigration reform, educational initiatives and cultural recognition. At a time when migration and its influence on the US are leading the political debate surrounding the Presidential election, it becomes interesting to see how the Telugu diaspora votes, either collectively or otherwise.\r\n\r\nWaves of Hope\r\n\r\nWhen legendary producer D MadhusudhanRao made America Abbayi in the late 1980s, it reflected the early wave of Telugu migration to the US, especially among doctors. The film\u2019s central character, a doctor, symbolised the aspirations of that era \u2014 where the American dream was largely tied to the medical profession and a stable, prestigious career abroad.\r\n\r\nWhile many Telugus have traditionally migrated to the US for higher education or to secure white-collar employment, an increasing number are now aspiring to enter the political arena\r\n\r\nFast forward to the millennial generation in the early 2000s, and director Shekhar Kammula\u2019s Dollar Dreams captured a different wave of hope and ambition among youngsters in India who saw an opportunity in various fields, especially IT. Kammula\u2019s film reflected the changing aspirations of young Telugu minds\u2014 not just seeking stable professions like medicine and IT but driven by a desire to study, succeed and establish themselves in the US.\r\n\r\nThrough these two films, we witness an evolution of the Telugu community\u2019s relationship with the American dream. Both films serve as cultural markers of the times, showcasing how the Telugu diaspora\u2019s dreams have transformed over the decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Dr Akhil Kumar is a PhD from Department of Political Science, University of Hyderabad.

He recently admitted that he sometimes Googles about his girlfriend to find out if she is doing fine, reported People.\"The last thing I googled was actually Zendaya,\" said the 'Spider-Man' actor, adding, \"I'm not on social media, and I delete it when I'm not using it.\"\"So, sometimes, like, it's more of a bit of an anxiety thing, but I'll check to see if everything's good and to make sure we're all cool. So I just give her a little Google and look through the news, and I'm like, 'She's good,\" he said.The way he cares for her was clearly visible at the New York City launch party of his brand on October 24.In a viral clip, the actor could be seen rescuing the 'Challengers' star from fans who surrounded her, asking them to \"give us a little bit of space.\"The couple, who met while working on 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming and began dating in 2021, have kept their relationship a secret.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"I can't not be a person and live my life and love the person I love,\" Zendaya said in an interview, adding, \"You can't hide.

I am navigating it more than ever now.\"\"It's about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist,\" she added.However, the duo were never reluctant to express their feelings. Holland said at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards, \"Zendaya and I will, every now and then, watch Spider-Man 1 and reminisce about being 19 and making those movies again.\"\"I love those movies, and I love savoring those moments, so I try not to watch them as often as I would maybe like to because it's so special,\" he added. \"It's such a luxury, such a gift to be able to sit down and sort of relive your youth,\" reported People.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "After the lights came on and the crowd started to disperse at the Etihad Arena in Yas Island of Abu Dhabi, two things stood out: All were moving their shoulders to the beat of Chayya Chayya that wrapped up a three-hour musical journey guided by A.R. Rahman himself, and the amused comments, on how the show went better than expected, in Tamil and Malayalam. \n\nAccompanied with a full-fledged orchestra, Firdous \u2013 an ensemble of women from around the world including war torn countries in West Asia \u2013 and a team of talented singers including Shweta Mohan, Jonitha Gandhi, Haricharan, and more, the concert on Saturday (November 2) night was both a celebration for the Indian diaspora in the Emirates of peace and a trip down the memory lane. \r\n\nStarting with his Oscar-winning Jai Ho, the show had everything one could expect from Mr. Rahman and more. A soulful rendition of Kun Faya Kun, romance and heartbreak in Munbe va and Kadhal Rojave and the spirit and celebration of youth in Mustafa Mustafa and Barso re. \n\nWith fan favourite Jonitha joining Mr. Rahman to set the bar right at the beginning with Mukkala Mukkabala, Shwetha Mohan won the crowd with Kadhal Rojave, originally sung by her mother Sujatha, and followed it up with spot-on performances one after the other culminating in early Malayalam version of rap battle Padakali from Yodha. \n\nWhile the show did not carry any specific proclaimed theme, a dialectic of individual cultural identity and cultural integration was visible when Mr. Rahman took a moment during the show to tell the crowd that the \u201cbiggest identity\u201d should be \u201cservice to humanity, peace, and love\u201d. Then he went on to sing Yeh jo Desh hai tera, a song about the need for people to go back to their roots and ended with its Tamil version, calling out to the \u2018Tamizhar\u2019. He also acknowledged migration, with a nod to critically acclaimed The Goat Life. \n\nMr. Rahman\u2019s quest to address themes from humanity, as a group and as individual beings, through his songs is not new to his fans. The audience was surprised when he announced in the middle of the show, calling a lady from amidst them backstage and telling her to get ready to perform. Celine Dee Matahari, a French-speaking woman born to Indonesian parents in Dubai, sang Chinna Chinna Asai in heavily accented Tamil, to a roaring reception from the predominantly south Indian crowd. \n\nThe crowd was in for another surprise when the group started singing Hum Dum Suniyo Re and the big screen showed Vivek Oberoi, still the \u2018cool guy\u2019 whose bike sync with the tune with headphones over his ears in Sathiya made waves. \r\n\nAfter an orchestral tribute to \u201cSuperman of Tamil Nadu\u201d Rajinikanth, a rap mashup and countless fan favourites covering the whole spectrum of musical genres, the all-familiar drum beats of Chayya Chayya that defined an era for Bollywood brought nearly 18,000 people to their feet with their flashlights blinking, bringing an amazing Abu Dhabi night to an end, reinforcing the hold Mr. Rahman has created on the ears of the diverse diaspora.",

Rahman himself, and a happy sense of nostalgia that pervaded the arena.\n\nAccompanied by full-fledged orchestra Firdaus - an ensemble of women from around the world including war-torn countries in West Asia - and a team of talented singers including Shweta Mohan, Jonita Gandhi, Haricharan, and more, the concert on Saturday (November 2) night was both a celebration of peace and a trip down the memory lane for the Indian diaspora in the Emirates.\n\nStarting with his Oscar-winning Jai Ho, the show had everything one could expect from the Mozart of Madras, and more. A soulful rendition of Kun Faya Kun, romance and heartbreak in Munbe Vaa and Kadhal Rojave, and the spirit and celebration of youth in Mustafa Mustafa and Barso Re.\n\nFan favourite Ms. Gandhi joined Mr. Rahman to raise the bar right at the beginning with Mukkala Mukkabala. Ms. Mohan won the crowd with Kadhal Rojave, originally sung by her mother Sujatha, and followed it up with a string of hits, culminating in the early Malayalam version of rap battle Padakali from Yodha.\n\nWhile the show did not have any specific proclaimed theme, a subtle undercurrent of individual cultural identity and cultural integration was visible when Mr. Rahman took a moment during the show to tell the crowd that the \u201cbiggest identity\u201d was \u201cservice to humanity, peace, and love\u201d. Then he went on to sing Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera from Swades, a song for those longing to return to their roots, and also acknowledged migration, with a nod to the critically acclaimed The Goat Life.\n\nMr. Rahman\u2019s quest to address themes from humanity, as a group and as individuals, through his songs is not new to his fans. The audience was surprised when he called a lady from amidst them on to the stage and asked her to get ready to perform. Celine Dee Matahari, a French-speaking woman born to Indonesian parents in Dubai, sang Chinna Chinna Asai in heavily accented Tamil, to a roaring reception from the predominantly south Indian crowd.\n\nThe crowd was in for another surprise when the group started singing Hum Dum Suniyo Re and the big screen showed Vivek Oberoi, still the cool guy whose bike ride in Sathiya - with his headphones on - had made waves.\n\nAfter an orchestral tribute to \u201cSuperman of Tamil Nadu\u201d Rajinikanth, a rap-mashup and countless fan favourites covering the whole spectrum of musical genres, the all-familiar drum beats of Chaiyya Chaiyya that defined an era for Bollywood brought nearly 18,000 people to their feet with their flashlights blinking, bringing an amazing Abu Dhabi night to an end.",

The actress has now shared her thoughts on what makes a happy and successful partnership, which she agrees is not \u201ceasy peasy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dancing diva tied-the-knot to Shriram Nene, a cardiovascular surgeon from Los Angeles, California in October 1999, in a traditional ceremony held at the residence of the actress\u2019 elder brother in Southern California. The couple welcomed their first son Arin in 2003 and their second boy Ryan was born in 2005.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a lot of things. You have to give and you have to take. It's like, it's a give and take. And you have to realise that, you know, these are two human beings under one roof. So, there will be positives and there will be negatives and you just understand that,\u201d Madhuri told IANS.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd understand the fact that you will always be working towards a goal that's, you know, equal to both of you, right? You both have dreams and you have equal goals. And you're always working towards that,\u201d she added.\r\n\r\nThe actress, whose latest release is \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d with Kartik Aaryan, Vidya Balan and Triptii Dimri, said that one has to work towards their marriage everyday.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's not easy peasy. And, you know, it's not like, it's not like that. But you have to work at it every day and it's a partnership. There should be respect for each other. There should be love for each other. There should be space for each other also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think all these things together make a marriage work,\u201d she added.\r\n\r\nThe 57-year-old actress has been in the industry for almost four decades. She made her debut in 1984 with \u201cAbodh\u201d and was then seen in over 70 films. In her journey in cinema, Madhuri has been lauded for her acting and dancing skills, which earned her several honours including a Padma Shri in 2008 by the Government of India.\r\n\r\nHas self doubt ever crept into Madhuri?\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not really, because I've always gone with gut feeling and when I heard the \u2018Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u2019 script, I had a feeling that I had to be a part of it because that's just what I felt. Also, I felt that it gave me something different to do, you know, on screen. People have not seen me in this avatar. And for me, it's always been about what I want to do, what excites me, what I feel is going to add a new dimension to who I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I've always selected a script like that. And I think that's always been my motto in life. You know, do what you love to do. There's nothing to prove. It's like, just enjoy what you're doing.\u201d",

She was so special in that film \u2014 so unique and so present. I loved it. So, the moment the script was ready, it was a no-brainer to approach her. I wanted someone young, someone social media savvy, internet savvy, and Instagram savvy, who has a strong presence, you know? Someone who comes across as youthful and a youth icon. She also, in a way, gets trolled a little bit, and maybe that played a part in it. But mainly, I just love her as an actress,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Indian captain Rohit Sharma on Thursday backed the retention of national team players in the Mumbai Indians squad for IPL 2025 while franchise skipper Hardik Pandya summed it up as \"five fingers but one fist\". Mumbai Indians chose to retain five Indian players as the IPL franchises submitted their list of retentions to end weeks of speculations around who were going to stay with their teams and who would be entering the auction pool. MI's retentions were 1. Jasprit Bumrah, 2. Hardik Pandya, 3. Suryakumar Yadav, 4. Rohit Sharma, 5. Tilak Varma.\r\n\r\nwindow._rrCode = window._rrCode || [];_rrCode.push(function(){ (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\"); });\"Since I have retired from the format, this is the perfect (retention) spot for me. The players who are representing the national team at the highest level should get the preference. That's what I believe in. It's a very tough one when you come into a fresh auction and you start retaining players,\" former MI skipper Rohit said after being retained by the five-time winners.After a disastrous last season when they finished at the bottom of the 10-team league, Rohit said MI will look to put their best foot forward in the next edition.\"With Mumbai, we have always tried maintaining a core group of players. Moving forward, I just feel that we can have a good auction and create a group of players who can be match-winners for us.\"We will put the right foot forward and bring the legacy back where it belongs.\" There have also been plenty of chatter around Rohit's future in the side after he was replaced by Hardik as captain before the start of last year's tournament.\"I have played so much cricket for Mumbai Indians. I am happy to be here. We haven't had the best of the season in the last two or three years. But we are quite determined to change that. We will be looking forward to each other's help. And hopefully, we can turn things around,\" Rohit said.\"Mumbai Indians has a rich history of winning trophies, winning games out of unbelievable situations. Since I have retired from the (international) format, I think this is the perfect spot for me.\" Hardik will be eager to start afresh after last season's disappointment in a franchise with whom he has achieved so much success as a player.\"Everything that I've achieved in my life has been part of Mumbai Indians. We remember, as a group, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020. All our fans know what happened in those years. We are going to come back in 2025 even stronger than that,\" he said.\"You lose and win on the ground. It is just preparation. I like to work hard. I like to prepare well,\" Hardik was quoted as saying by the franchise.Mumbai Indians are left with Rs 45 crore after retaining Jasprit Bumrah (Rs 18 crore), Suryakumar Yadav (Rs 16.35 crore), Hardik (Rs 16.35 crore), Rohit (Rs 16.30 crore) and Tilak Varma (Rs 8 crore).Hardik added, \"Five people who we all have cherished a lot of good memories together. We are as one. We are five fingers but one fist. That's how I look at it.\"We are going to come in all guns blazing, with brotherhood, friendship and at the same point of time we are going to back each other no matter what happens.\"PBKS retentionIn the Punjab Kings franchise, Shashank Singh got the top retention at Rs 5.5 crore while Prabhsimran Singh was retained at Rs 4 crore.Speaking about the move, PBKS head coach Ricky Ponting said, \"Prabhsimran is someone we've invested in with great expectations. Shashank's skill set is highly sought after, and following his standout performances, he was impossible to overlook.\"We aim to bring back some of our other players at the auction.\"RCB TrioVirat Kohli (Rs 21 crore), Rajat Patidar (Rs 11 crore) and Yash Dayal (Rs 5 crore) are the three players retained by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.'We are thrilled to retain Yash Dayal, an extraordinary talent whose career is on an upward trajectory.\"His unique ability as a left-arm bowler, capable of swinging the ball in both directions, adds a valuable dimension to our bowling attack -- one that is increasingly rare in the auction landscape,\" said Andy Flower, RCB's head coach.Samson speaksRajasthan Royals have retained Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer and Sandeep Sharma.\"\"The last few seasons have truly been remarkable for our franchise. We have been able to deliver some special moments for our fans and were able to create an environment in the dressing room where some of our young talent has been groomed to be the next generation of superstars for Indian cricket,\" said skipper Samson in a RR press release.Samson, who is set to embark on his 11th season with the Jaipur-based franchise, has been retained at a value of RS 18 crore.During the past four seasons under his captaincy, the team has made the play-offs twice, including a runner-up finish in IPL 2022.\"I am incredibly fortunate to be able to continue this incredible journey for both myself and the franchise under the esteemed leadership of Rahul Dravid and ably supported by Kumar Sangakkara.\"It gives me immense pride and I accept this responsibility with the utmost humility to keep leading this franchise and team into what we all want to make into the best phase in the franchise's history,\" added Samson.",

        "title": "\u2018Mithya \u2013 The Darker Chapter\u2019 review: A forced,  underwhelming sequel",
        "text": "In the first season of the ZEE5 series Mithya, Hindi professor Juhi Adhikari (Huma Qureshi) was locked in a dangerous battle with student Rhea Rajguru (Avantika Dassani) after she failed her the young woman for plagiarism and branded her a cheat. The entitled daughter of a tea estate owner and college trustee, Rhea became obsessed with seeking vengeance, sometimes with violent results.\n\nIt emerged in season one that Juhi and Rhea were half-sisters. Rhea\u2019s vendetta has now become as much about getting back at Juhi as it is about gaining the acceptance of her father, the author Anand Tyagi (Rajit Kapur).\n\nSeason one, which came out in 2022, was an adaptation of the British mini-series Cheat (2019). In the absence of a second season of Cheat, the writers of Mithya (Purva Naresh, Nishank Varma with a screenplay by Nisarg Mehta) have created a new set of twisted mind games which aren\u2019t always logical or convincing.\n\nBy now, Juhi has gained confidence and overcome her previous ambivalence. Juhi is now a celebrated author, but an accusation of plagiarism by the failed writer Amit Chaudhary (Naveen Kasturia) destroys not just her reputation but her father\u2019s equilibrium too. \n\nAs things intensify, Anand is pushed into an abyss. Indraneil Sengupta, Avantika Akerkar, Rushad Rana and Krishna Bisht return in supporting roles.\n\nRhea continues to be able to get random people to do her bidding. Things simply fall into her lap, like access to IVF records, entry into a home from where she can pick up things, meeting Amit and seamlessly taking over her father\u2019s estate. This is in spite of once having been incarcerated. \n\nRhea is ruthless and heartless and will use anyone to achieve her goal, which is getting her estranged father\u2019s attention and felling Juhi. As the power play between the women spirals out of control, a body count also starts to build. Even though a new inspector struts around offering piercing looks and asking the right questions, she and the local police seem completely incompetent when it comes to solving any case.\n\nDirector Kapil Sharma captures the hill region\u2019s mood and landscape. But even the overuse of overdramatic background music cannot drown out the show\u2019s shaky suspense and uninteresting script.\n\nOver six episodes, Rhea\u2019s relentless schemes, lies and manipulation and Juhi\u2019s reactions and her own need for revenge get crazier and crazier, peaking with a ridiculous scheme in episode four. Dassani\u2019s Rhea, who was intriguing before, is simply villainous and repetitious now. \n\nQureshi appears to be equally flummoxed by her character\u2019s actions and behaviour, almost going through the beats just to get to the climax. A hanging thread at the end of this season suggests that there may be more drama brewing in Darjeeling.",

Interestingly, Big B has delivered numerous films, many of which have been massive successes. His film \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar\" proved to be a blockbuster during the Diwali season.\r\n\r\nThe film featured stars like Rekha, Vinod Khanna, and Rakhee and was directed by Prakash Mehra. Released in 1978, \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar\" was the highest-grossing film of that year. It was the third highest-grossing Indian film after \"Sholay\" and \"Bobby.\" \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar\" was reportably made on a budget of 1.3 crores and the film earned Rs 9 crores at the box office, collecting a worldwide total of 22 crores.\r\n\r\nThe film won several Filmfare Awards and held its record for seven years until Amitabh himself broke it. In 1985, the film \"Mard\" was released, which became the highest-grossing film during Diwali after \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar.\" \"Mard\u201d was produced on a modest budget of just Rs 1 crore and went on to earn an impressive Rs 8 crores at the box office. Seventeen years later, Shah Rukh Khan shattered this record with his iconic film \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,\" which became the highest-grossing film released during Diwali, surpassing \"Mard.\"\r\n\r\nThis Diwali, Rohit Shetty's much-anticipated cop drama \"Singham Again\" is set to go head-to-head with T-Series' horror-comedy \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3\" at the box office on November 1. \"Singham Again\" features an impressive cast, including Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Arjun Kapoor, Tiger Shroff, and Jackie Shroff.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3,\" which is co-written and directed by Anees Bazmee, showcases a talented lineup with Kartik Aaryan, Vidya Balan, Triptii Dimri, Madhuri Dixit, Vijay Raaz, Rajpal Yadav, and Sanjay Mishra.",

        "title": "Weekend Binge: Celebrate The Festival Of Lights With These Films",
        "text": "It's that time of the year again. People across the nation are all set to celebrate the festival of Diwali. Our homes will be illuminated with diyas, the colours of rangoli will add to its beauty and the freshness of flowers will elevate the atmosphere. To get you into the festive spirit of Diwali, we've taken a nostalgic look at some of our favourite Diwali scenes from Bollywood movies. These classic scenes transport us to exquisitely decorated sets and mouthwatering feasts, all while perfectly encapsulating the essence of the festival of lights. 1. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (14 December 2001) - Netflix: Film enthusiasts will always remember the famous Diwali scene from Karan Johar's blockbuster Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Set between Rahul (played by Shah Rukh Khan) and his adoptive mother Nandini (played by Jaya Bachchan), the scene is a direct reference to Lord Ram's return to his kingdom of Ayodhya following a 14-year exile. It shows Nandini Raichand sensing her son's arrival on the occasion of Diwali.2. Mohabbatein (27 October 2000) - Prime Video: The song Pairon Mein Bandhan Hai in the movie Mohabbatein is centred on the festival of Diwali. The music video of the track featured the quintessential Bollywood visuals, lights and dancing as the actors celebrated Diwali with great joy and spirit. 3. Hum Aapke Hai Koun (5 August 1994) - Netflix: This film offers a nostalgic trip back to the simpler 1980s and the realm of family dramas. The catchy tunes capture the happiness of the family during the Diwali celebrations, when they discover that Renuka Shahane's character is pregnant. 4. Golmaal 3 (5 November 2010) - JioCinema: Golmaal 3 features a memorable and humorous scene involving the ensemble cast of Kareena Kapoor, Ajay Devgn, Shreyas Talpade, Arshad Warsi, Kumal Kemmu and Johnny Lever. On the occasion of Diwali, the characters set up a stall to sell crackers. Things take a wild turn when they unintentionally set off and burst all of the crackers in a string of raucous accidents. 5. Padmaavat (25 January 2018) - Prime Video: A beautiful scene in Padmavat depicts how people celebrated Diwali in ancient forts. With imaginative decorations and the traditional setting, the movie presents a dreamy image of those times. 6. Vaastav (7 October 1999) - Prime Video: Raghu in Vaastav is remembered as one of Sanjay Dutt's most memorable roles. Diwali serves as the backdrop for a moving scene between Raghu and his mother, played by Reema Lagu. The actor delivers his famous line, \"Ye dekh pacchass tola,\" in this scene.7. Taare Zameen Par (21 December 2007) - YouTube: Taare Zameen Par is another film that depicts the sombre aspect of Diwali. In the festival scene, Darsheel Safary's character Ishaan Awasthi muses over the horror of being forced to attend a boarding school. Ishaan's rising anxiety overshadows the joy that others experience on Diwali. 8. Zanjeer (11 May 1973) - Prime Video: The festival of lights plays a significant role in this iconic movie. Zanjeer begins with a Diwali scene in which a young Vijay Khanna (Amitabh Bachchan) watches an unnamed man kill his parents. In the final scene of the movie, Bachchan's cop hero discovers that Teja (Ajit Khan) is the murderer of his parents, which also takes place on Diwali. After that, he battles the villain and defeats him.9. Swades (17 December 2004) - Netflix: Swades's song Pal Pal Hai Bhaari reminds us of Ramayana as it shows Ravan's vadh (killing) by Lord Ram. This particular scene takes place on the occasion of Diwali. When the village experiences a power outage just after the Ravan dahan, the villagers light up diyas and firecrackers. 10. Sadma (8 July 1983) - YouTube: The soulful number Ae Zindagi Gale Laga Le from Sadma (1983) is filmed on Sridevi and Kamal Hassan. The song depicts the couple celebrating Diwali by lighting firecrackers and sparklers.&nbsp",

        "text": "Roadies, a show that elevated the standards of reality shows in the country is coming back with it's 20th season. The latest season titled 'Double Cross Battleground' is all set to stream with the preliminary auditions in each city being done. Talking with Deccan Chronicle during his recent visit to Hyderabad, RannVijay Singha, the host who is coming back after a gap of almost four years, shared his excitement.Excerpts: Q. You missed out last season, do you have any complaints regarding the season?Actually, after 2020, four years, I missed out few seasons, not just one and. you know, when you're in a relationship or your relatives goes to Canada, US or the UK, you remember a lot of those small small things that you love about them, that aren't those wonderful.So I think the last four years, MTV and I have actually missed each other so much that now that they've come back, you know, In a season that's 20, which is the Milestone season. It's fantastic. It's supposed to change each other. But while those four years were happening, uh, I was doing different things.I was trying to figure it out a way of, you know, uh, connecting the show in a different way, uh, but there was no other way, it was just so happened that we bring that situation, but always knowing that we will come back and no more better season than this.Q How do you find Sonu Sood hosting the show? I love Sonu Sood. Yeah, I have a lot of respect for him, not just because of what he did during Covid, before that also we worked together, for some events. and then during Covid that is a nature that he already had that just came out.For him to be hosting Roadies was awesome because that's the kind of guy that they look up to. I'm gonna say to that. The last season Karm ya Kaand where, you know, it's Good vs evil and he's the right choice.So I think that was the perfect choice. Q What is your favorite Biryani spot in Hyderabad? A lot of times when you come to Hyderabad, there are some spots that people will say, this is the spot for good biryani and you go to those Spots and I've done that because I've been working there for 20 years.So, I've done it in the first few years of MTV, I would come and go to those places. But now what's happened is I have a lot of friends here. Like I would call Basheer, and I'll tell him, then you'd get an from authentic dish, right? So now because it's been so long, I will go to a these people and then get the right food. And i think Andhra food is not just about Biryani. That's what I felt. Because I'll come here so often even the local food, the spices, the chicken dishes they're pretty amazing. Yeah. Even those Starters with like all the other, you know, ingredients is pretty cool. Yeah. Q So what is special about this season? How will it be different from this? It is Roadies double cross it's in the theme only, which means you can't trust anybody if you want to win, you want to trust yourself because survival of the fittest and I think everything is fair in love and war like they say.It could be the end of it as you know it, but if this was a season that somebody wants to win, it would take everything. The OGs were coming, Neha and Rhea are never been part of the show together, we've added some elements which will keep you guessing, so because all these this season becomes special.Q How do you maintain your energy throughout? I think probably having experiences and exposure kind of excites me. But I think different things are driving me now. I wanted to work, I have kids, and I have high energy generally so I don't have to maintain it's just that things excite me.Like now this time this whole show me coming back, that's the other thing. The first question that you answered if it was something that kept doing, maybe it would be as exciting. But today is exciting because I'm coming back. The reaction is crazy, they have missed me, you know, the feeling that people watch Roadies and continuously every day commented everywhere, where is Rannvijay? come back, come back. These things excite me and i'd love, um, the fact that we have the opportunity in the resources to work in the field where your work is fun, like a lot of Adventures.I'm very grateful for the kind of, you know, love we get it. So I mean, energy is always going to be like that.",

        "title": "Assam CM says 'infiltrators' behind Muslim population spike in J'khand",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday claimed that Muslim population is growing in the state of Jharkhand and the local tribal population is on the decline. Himanta, who is also BJP's Jharkhand election co-in-charge, accused the Hemant Soren led state government of letting \"intruders\" enter the state. \"I ignite fire against infiltrators. Lord Hanuman had also set fire in Lanka. We have to set fire against infiltrators and make Jharkhand a golden land,\" he said. The Assam chief minister who was in the state to drum up support for the saffron party ahead of the elections, claimed that Aadhar cards were being provided to infiltrators through madrassas in Jharkhand and that in Santhal Pargana, the tribal population is decreasing and the Muslim population is increasing. \"In Santhal Pargana, the tribal population is decreasing and the Muslim population is increasing. Not every Muslim is an infiltrator but how is the population of Muslims increasing every 5 years? Is a family giving birth to 10-12 children? If families are not giving birth to so many children, then definitely people are coming from outside,\" he said according to news agency ANI.Terming it \"simple mathematics\", he exuded confidence that the BJP will emerge victorious in the elections and the priority, he said, was to \"throw out infiltrators from Santhal Paragana\". The BJP's poll-in-charge also pledged the BJP will implement NRC in Santhal Pargana division, if the BJP is elected to power.Earlier on Sunday, the chief minister sought cooperation from states bordering Bangladesh to crack down on infiltration. Further, on that regard, he claimed Assam and Tripura governments of working closely with border force but singled out the West Bengal government led by CM Mamata Banerjee of not lending a hand to identify the infiltrators. This he said, would contribute to a \"well-orchestrated effort\" by all states to curb infiltration from the border.The BSF, meanwhile, is ramping up its efforts to control the infiltration from borders, which since the political turmoil erupted in Bangladesh has witnessed a spike. The BSF authorities nabbed 12 Bangladeshis on Saturday who were illegally attempting to cross the border through Tripura. In another development, BSF troops arrested nine Bangladeshi nationals near Agartala railway station. \"In the last two months, almost every day we are capturing foreigners in our state. My feeling is that due to the porous boundary, in spite of best efforts of the BSF, some people are coming into India illegally,\" Himanta said.Earlier, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, who is a four time Lok Sabha MP from Godda constituency in Jharkhand alleged that that neither the Congress nor the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha are concerned about the tribals due to vote bank politics.Echoing the Assam CM's remark, he claimed that Bangladeshi infiltrators are behind the 11 per cent rise in the Muslim population in Santhal Pargana and added that the BJP will not take it lightly until Bangladeshi infiltrators are sent back. \"In 1951, the population of Muslims was 9 per cent, today it is 24 per cent. Throughout the country, Muslims have increased by 4 per cent and in our Santhal Pargana, it has increased by 15 per cent, these 11 per cent are Bangladeshi infiltrators and the government of Jharkhand is accepting this. Due to vote-bank politics, neither the Congress nor the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha are concerned about the tribals. Until Bangladeshi infiltrators are sent back, the Bharatiya Janata Party will not sit peacefully, this is not the issue of the election, this is the national issue,\" Nishikant Dubey told news agency ANI. Elections are being held on 81 seats of Jharkhand assembly in two phases on November 13 and November 20.A total of 2.60 crore voters are eligible to cast votes in Jharkhand and there are 1.31 crore male and 1.29 crore female voters. The state has 11.84 lakh first-time voters and there are 66.84 lakh young voters.In the previous assembly election, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha won 30 seats, BJP won 25 and Congress won 16 seats",

Rama Rao on Monday called HYDRAA a \u201cblackmailing organisation\u201d let loose on the people by the Congress government, and reiterated that his party would stand by those affected by the agency\u2019s actions.Speaking to reporters after visiting the family of Buchchamma, a 52-year-old woman in Nalla Cheruvu area of Kukatpally, who allegedly died by suicide over fears that her house would be demolished by HYDRAA. Rama Rao assured that the BRS will assist the bereaved family. \u201cPeople are watching every move of the government and the Chief Minister. Buchchamma\u2019s death is not a suicide but a murder by the state government. Our party will stand with the family to whom we have also provided some financial assistance. It is time people revolt against this government,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Rao also met Vedasri, a child whose house was also among those demolished after which she had complained that she was not allowed to collect her school books and water bottle among other things. Rao gifted her a new school bag, notebooks and a water bottle along with similar gifts to some other children in the area. He said an atmosphere of fear has been created among the poor in the city that their homes will be demolished. \u201cSuch is the fear that people are taking their own lives. Is there anything more tragic than such a thing?\u201d Rao asked. Severely criticising the Congress government for its attitude on demolitions, he said \u201cfor Revanth Reddy, law appears to be applicable only to the poor but not to the rich like his brother, who too has his house in the full tank level of a water body but only received notices. The houses of the poor are demolished without even as much as a warning.\u201dBuchchamma\u2019s death is murder by the state, says BRS leader",

This year, the event commemorated the 100th birth anniversary of Telugu cinema legend and actor Nagarjuna's father, Akkineni Nageswara Rao. A video from the event showed Amitabh Bachchan honouring Chiranjeevi with a trophy and a shawl. To take Big B's blessings, a very emotional Chiranjeevi bent before him and touched his feet. After accepting the award, Chiranjeevi posed for a photo with Nagarjuna Akkineni and Amitabh Bachchan. Hosted by Nagarjuna, the ANR National Award event was attended by several notable figures from the Telugu film industry.

KA, the Telugu thriller releasing on October 31 in Telugu and a week later in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada, has demanded all his attention. \u201cWe have attempted something new. I was very taken in by an important point that directors Sujith and Sandeep intended to convey through their story, written in a thriller format,\u201d he says, speaking for this interview in between promotional activities in Hyderabad. Kiran exudes confidence but admits to a tinge of nervousness as the release day draws closer.\n\nIn KA, set in the 1970s in a fictional village named Krishnagiri, Kiran plays Vasudev, a postman, but there is more to his seemingly-innocent character. He says, \u201cSo far I have never portrayed a part with shades of grey. This has been a new learning.\u201d \n\nTrekking into the forests\n\nKA was filmed in the vicinity of forest areas; the crew scouted for locations that would be apt for a fictional village surrounded by hills, where light fades by 3pm. \u201cAround 60% of the film takes place in darkness. We had heard of a village in Telangana where it gets dark around 4.30pm. For this film we wanted an earlier time,\u201d he says, adding that the dialect in KA is not specific to any region in Telangana or Andhra Pradesh.\n\nKiran brightens up while discussing the filming process in the forest zones. The crew would walk for nearly a kilometre, carrying cameras, lights and other equipment, to reach the shooting spots in the jungles near Thirthahalli and Agumbe in Karnataka. \u201cThis region is home to several snakes, so we had medical kits handy. Once we got used to the location, we had a good time; it was beautiful to be one with Nature.\u201d\n\nSome portions were filmed in Muchintal and Vikarabad in Telangana; eight sets were constructed at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad, pertaining to the village areas, and one set with a few interior portions was constructed at Sarathi Studios, Ameerpet.\n\nKiran hails from a village in Rayachoti in Andhra Pradesh and recalls how he had no exposure to urban lifestyle until he completed Class X. \u201cThat childhood experience helped me get in sync with this film easily. It was like going back in time.\u201d \n\nThe USP of KA, Kiran explains, is its unpredictability. \u201cI listen to a number of narrations and read scripts, so when Sujith and Sandeep began narrating this story, I thought I had figured it out in the first few minutes. The story took me by surprise at each turn and I was shocked after listening to the climax. I hope the audiences find it equally interesting. The period setting will give people something new and immersive.\u201d \n\nIn the past, Kiran has also been a co-writer for his films such as SR Kalyanamandapam and Nenu Meeku Baaga Kavalsinavaadini. In the case of KA, he was content being only an actor. He cites the production design (by Sudheer) and sound (mixing by Aravind Menon) as assets to the film.\n\nKA also features extensive sequences with animals. Kiran mentions how a street dog from Kurnool was trained for six months and became a favourite with the unit members. The same is the case with the bulls in the climax. \u201cWe ensured that all precautions were taken for animal safety.\u201d \n\nTime for reflection\n\nThrough the conversation, Kiran repeatedly mentions his debut film Raja Vaaru Rani Gaaruand SR Kalyanamandapam as being received well by the audience and how he hopes for a repeat of the same with KA, which was pitched to him in January 2022. In 2022 and 2023, he had a bunch of releases of which only Vinaro Bhagyamu Vishnu Katha stood out; the other films came in for criticism and did not fare well at the box office.\n\nLooking back, Kiran says there were times when he could sense that a film was not shaping up well, but he had to fulfil his commitment. \u201cI also think maybe I should have discussed it better with the respective directors. While working on KA, I have reflected on my choices and the need to be more careful.\u201d\n\nNext, he has a film with Saregama, which is foraying into Telugu film production, and two other films are in pre-production stages.",

        "text": "Academy Award-winning actor Robert Downey Jr. is strongly opposed to the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to recreate his likeness, particularly in the context of reviving his iconic character Tony Stark aka Iron Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Oppenheimer actor during a conversation on On With Kara Swisher, where he joined Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Ayad Akhtar and Tony-winning director Bartlett Sher explored the implications of AI in modern storytelling, reported Deadline.Asked about his feelings on deepfakes and AI technology, Downey said, \"There's two tracks. How do I feel about everything that's going on? I feel about it minimally because I have an actual emotional life that's occurring that doesn't have a lot of room for that.\"Despite his concerns, Downey expressed confidence in the current leadership at Marvel, stating, \"To go back to the MCU, I'm not worried about them hijacking my character's soul because there's like three or four guys and gals who make all the decisions there anyway and they would never do that to me, with or without me,\" Deadline reported.Swisher suggested that future executives may have different intentions, to which Downey responded humorously, \"Well, you're right. I would like to here state that I intend to sue all future executives just on spec.\" In a light-hearted manner he added, \"But my law firm will still be very active,\" drawing laughs from the audience as Swisher compared him to Elvis Presley and his estate.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In addition to his concerns about Artificial Intelligence, Downey discussed his investments in AI companies, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations. He stated, \"It always comes down again to not the technology or the opportunity to line my pockets as much as, 'Who are the people involved with this? Do I think they have a moral psychology? For what reason are they deploying this?'\"Currently, Downey is appearing on McNeal stage play, where he portrays a Nobel Prize-winning novelist who uses AI to write a new work. While the Lincoln Center Theater production has received mixed reviews, critics have praised Downey's performance, as per Deadline. Downey is also set to reprise his role in the MCU as Dr. Doom in the upcoming films Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "GOP leader and former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy said the Puerto Rico joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden event was bad because it wasn't funny but he absolved Donald Trump from the controversy and asked why Kamala Harris was not held responsible for a similar joke made by comedian George Lopez where he called all Mexicans thieves. \"I think we need to all get off our high horses and acknowledge that a bad joke was told. It was bad because it wasn't very funny. The audience didn't find it funny,\" Vivek said. \"If the George Lopez joke had been told at the Donald Trump rally you and I both know we'd be talking about that,\" he said. \"But because it was at a Kamala Harris rally we're not saying a word about it. And I think that that's just hypocritical.\"Hinchcliffe in an attempt to be funny referred to Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage\" and mocked Latino birthrates. The Puerto Rico joke became the latest issue with only a week remaining before the election as a Trump adviser distanced the former president from the joke which was denounced by the Kamala Harris campaign as well. Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance said he heard the joke but he saw no reason to take the joke seriously. \"I've heard about the joke, I haven't actually seen the joke that you mentioned, but I think that it's telling that Kamala Harris' closing message is essentially that all of Donald Trump's voters are Nazis, and you should get really pissed off about a comedian telling a joke,\" Vance said. \"Maybe it's a stupid, racist joke as you said, maybe it's not. I haven't seen it. I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the joke,\" he added. \"But I think that we have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America. I'm just \u2014 I'm so over it.\"What was the Puerto Rico joke?\"There\u2019s a lot going on. I don\u2019t know if you know this but there\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now.

        "title": "Opinion: Ananya Panday To Shefali Shah, How OTT Turned Careers Around",
        "text": "B-Town actor Ananya Panday began her career in 2019 with a bang in Karan Johar's Student of the Year 2, but her silver screen success has been somewhat uneven for the most part. However, with two successful OTT releases in 2024, the 25-year-old seems to have redeemed herself and found the perfect niche on the small screen. In September, director Colin D'Cunha's Call Me Bae was released on Amazon Prime, and in October, director Vikramaditya Motwane's CTRL was released on Netflix India. While the former is a series, the latter is a film, and both saw Ananya Panday excel in the roles of Bella and Nella (yes, what are the chances?) respectively. Both Call Me Bae and CTRL clearly targeted Gen Z and millennial audiences, and Ananya was the ideal actor to step into the stilettos of a charming young woman caught in various situations. She resonated with viewers, and many on social media applauded her for her improved acting skills.\n\nShefali Shah's Second Innings\n\nAnanya Panday is not the first actor to receive more appreciation, success, and recognition for their work on OTT platforms rather than the big screen. Pankaj Tripathi, Jaideep Ahlawat, Sobhita Dhulipala, Radhika Apte, Jitendra Kumar, Vijay Varma, Rasika Duggal, and Shefali Shah are examples of other B-Town actors who are now in demand for web series due to their varied performances across numerous digital platforms. Take, for instance, Shefali Shah, who made her film debut with Rangeela in 1995. Although she was considered a good actor and has worked in some noteworthy films, such as Monsoon Wedding, Satya, and Dil Dhadakne Do, her popularity as a mainstream actor skyrocketed after Delhi Crime. She went on to feature in Ajeeb Dastans, Jalsa, Darlings, and Human, all of which are for streaming services. At 51, the gifted actor has embarked on a second innings that is arguably more successful in many ways than her first when it comes to showcasing her talent.\n\nOn the other hand, there are actors like Jitendra Kumar and Rasika Duggal who have largely made streaming platforms their home. Jitendra Kumar, an IIT graduate, became a household name thanks to his role as Bhaiya in Kota Factory, which was initially released on YouTube in 2019. The talented actor made his online debut in 2014 with TVF's Permanent Roommates, considered India's first web series. Since then, he has appeared in numerous OTT shows and is riding the wave of success from his latest web series, Panchayat, streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nMeanwhile, Rasika Duggal tasted critical acclaim, but mainstream audience recognition only came with her role in the 2018 web series Mirzapur Season 1. Since then, she has appeared in Made in Heaven, Out of Love, Delhi Crime, A Suitable Boy, OK Computer, Adhura, Spike, and Shekar Home, in addition to two films released directly on OTT platforms. This raises the pertinent question of why some actors find success on streaming services rather than the silver screen.\n\nOTT And Experimentation\n\nOne of the main reasons is that OTT platforms produce a wide range of content catering to niche audiences. Actors who may not fit into mainstream cinema's formulaic roles often find success by portraying complex, unconventional characters. These platforms encourage experimentation, allowing actors to showcase their versatility. In traditional film and television industries, actors are often typecast into certain roles. Web series frequently tackle socially relevant and complex themes that might not be explored in mainstream cinema. Thus, digital platforms tend to take more risks, giving actors the chance to break free from previous stereotypes and try new, bold roles that redefine their careers. Furthermore, in a web series, actors can explore longer and more detailed character arcs, allowing them to delve deeper into their roles. This helps actors create memorable performances, as seen in the cases of Pankaj Tripathi and Ananya Panday.\n\nThe Audience Economics\n\nAnother important aspect is that streaming services are available globally, giving actors the opportunity to reach a wider, more diverse audience. An actor's popularity is no longer limited to a regional or national audience\u2014people from different countries and cultures can watch them in content that is accessible from anywhere in the world. OTT platforms are known for pushing the envelope in terms of content quality, including better storytelling, cinematography, and production value. Therefore, actors involved in critically acclaimed or talked-about series or films benefit from the platform's reputation and the attention that such content garners.\n\nToday, many established artists, including stars like Hrithik Roshan and Ajay Devgn, are avidly exploring the OTT space to take on unconventional, challenging, and layered roles. Many web series, especially on international platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ Hotstar, also offer cross-border collaborations, providing added opportunities for them. But for emerging talent and those who haven't yet made a significant name on the silver screen, OTT platforms present the perfect opportunity to showcase their talent, make a mark, and become household names.\n\n(The author is a senior entertainment journalist and film critic)\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author",

I feel not everyone would think like that. I feel I am lucky enough that my thinking pattern is very practical. I am a very practical guy. I have spent a lot of time with Hardik (Pandya) and you also know that he is a very practical guy. What's needed, is needed. You don't have to cry about everything... So I have also started thinking like that,\" Kishan told Times of India.\u201cAt a very young age, I was picked by Mumbai Indians and I have been friends with Hardik for a long time now. So I know how he thinks and I know he also wants me to be a great player so he keeps sharing ideas with me. I am in a very practical zone right now. Even if you get out, it's not like I start thinking 'ye kya ho gaya (what just happened), how will I now perform in the next game\u201d he added.Ishan played two matches in the ODI World Cup 2023 before losing his spot to Shubman Gill. The youngster opened up about how maintaining a neutral point helped him in keeping balance in his career.\"You need to find that neutral point where even when you score a hundred, you have to be very calm. Even if you get out early, you have to stay grounded. You have to find that right balance. I am very lucky to have guys like Hardik around me who have spoken to me about it. There are moments in cricket where you feel really down. And it's not just for me, it's for every cricketer.\"But if you find that neutral point, you will get over it. Skills are always there, it's just your mental thing. How you are dealing with things at that point of time.

        "text": "The ANR National Awards in Hyderabad were recently held and it was an event that emphasized the interdependence and the common heritage of Indian films. It was the collaboration of two great legends, Bollywood\u2019s Amitabh Bachchan and Tollywood\u2019s Chiranjeevi, who were both on stage to mark the award and their great relationships, which was animated by the memories of the late Akkineni Nageswara Rao(A. N. R. ). Celebrations were for the actor who has been the epitome of grace and hard work. His presence indeed proved to be the cherry on top of an already memorable event. It was more than simply formal. Considering the actors\u2019 growing relationship with Telugu cinema, he called himself an \u201chonorary member\u201d of the industry, alongside such greats as Chiranjeevi and Nag Ashwin, who featured him in their works. This is the first time I have heard of a Czech who is understanding of double entendres in the Telugu film industry! The response was expected; claps were heard throughout the hall as Bachchan made such a statement. Amitabh Bachchan recently appeared in Kalki 2898 AD along with Prabhas and Deepika Padukone, and he thanked the film for its admiration, shattering a record by earning over Rs. 1000 crores worldwide. When talking about his camaraderie with Nag Ashwin (Kalki\u2019s) director he also made a quip about wishing to stay on the director\u2019s contact list for more projects perhaps marking the start of a fresh party between Bollywood and Telugu cinema industry. Nagarjuna Akkineni, the host of the evening, expressed warm sentiments, recalling how he feels about Bachchan. After watching Kalki 2898 AD, Nagarjuna had called Amit Bachchan, and said, \u201cAmit Ji, my original mass hero is back!\u201d To hear such a voice would surely not only be a comment on Mr. Bachchan\u2019s performance but also the golden era of Indian cinema which he continues to represent in many ways. Chiranjeevi receiving the award from Mr. Bachchan was very special for him, in fact he went so far to accuse that receiving from someone like Mr. Bachchan is a victory for him in the context of Telugu as well as in his story with the Indian film industry. This event turned even more special when Mr. Bachchan hugged Chiranjeevi\u2019s mother Anjana Devi and that respect and love spirit made the evening special for both families and the fans. This year\u2019s ANR National Awards were not only a showcase of cinema but also a celebration of the relationships that go beyond the geographical borders and forge a link between the icons and the light of narration across the Indian film industry.",

        "text": "A recent World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO) report said the number of GenAI patent families has surged dramatically, increasing from 733 in 2014 to more than 14,000 in 2023. Research output has also exploded, with scientific papers growing from 116 in 2014 to over 34,000 in 2023.\n\nA breakthrough in Gen AI came with a paper from google \u201cAttention Is All You Need\u201d which introduced a transformer neural network and showed how it was able to translate between English and French or English and German with more accuracy and in less time to train compared with other neural networks.\r\n\nThe introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 led to an approximate 800 per cent increase in GenAI-related patents. Since 2017, researchers have developed various transformer-based models, including GPT family, Bert, etc. \n\nThese models have significantly improved, performance and applications in comprehending documents, answering questions, and generating new text, images, audio, video etc. The widening of horizons is also reflective in the fact that in 2023 alone, over 25 per cent of all GenAI Patent and 45 per cent of all GenAI scientific papers were published.\r\n\nPatent filing\n\nPer the WIPO report, China leads Patent filing in Gen AI segment with over 38,000 GenAI patent families being published from 2014\u20132023. Top Chinese Companies with AI Patents are, Tencent focusing on AI integration into its platforms like WeChat, Ping an Insurance Group using GenAI for underwriting and risk assessment, Baidu which recently released ERNIE 4.0, an AI chatbot. Other non-Chinese companies, which are major players, are IBM, Samsung, Google, and Microsoft. Japan, and India are also significant contributors though their numbers are still low.\r\n\nMachine learning has led to AI systems learning from vast amounts of data to create new content, however, there are also concerns relating to use of GenAI models and tools, like copyright infringement, deepfakes, which are fake images or videos created without the consent of one or more persons in the image or video. Throughout the world there are discussions on Gen AI related regulations, which are being developed to reap the benefits of GenAI while mitigating any risks that may be involved. Similar to the global landscape of Generative AI, a surge in number of GenAI patent families can be seen in India too. The number of GenAI patent families filed in India from 2015 to 2020 has multiplied approximately 15 times.\r\n\nThe list of \u2018Top Patent Holders\u2019 in India does not mimic the list of \u2019Top Patent Holders\u2019 globally. Google tops the list in India followed by Qualcomm, Samsung, Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Wipro etc. The common top players worldwide and in India are Google, Samsung, Microsoft.\r\n\nIndian strides\n\nFurthermore, India is not only showing an upward trend in relation GenAI space but also in overall filing of patents through government initiatives such as \u2018Startup India\u2019 and \u2018Make in India\u2019. According to Global Innovation Index 2024: India has risen significantly in the Global Innovation Index (GII) rankings, rising from 81st in 2015 to 40th in 2024. The GII 2024 evaluates the innovation ecosystem performance of 133 economies and tracks the latest global innovation trends.\r\n\nThe government is also endorsing and supporting inclusion of GenAI in diverse sectors. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC- a private non-profit company established by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) of Government of India) recently launched Saarthi, a reference application designed to assist businesses in creating customised multilingual buyer apps. This indicates that Indian Government is acknowledging the importance of GenAI and its role in transforming different sectors.\r\n\nSharma is Partner (head \u2013 intellectual property); Suri is Director \u2013 patents) and Pandey is Principal Associate, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas",

        "text": "For more than four decades Americans have been on the look out for that October Surprise, nothing to do with department stores putting out discount coupons but of something out of the ordinary happening that threatens to change the direction of a political season.\n\nIn 1980, the Reagan campaign was getting bent out of shape in the event of President Jimmy Carter springing a last-minute surprise and getting out the 52 American hostages before polling day; and in 1992 the indictment of Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger in what came to be known as the Iran-Contra Arms scandal that threatened to derail a second term for George Herbert Walker Bush.\n\nAnd between 1992 and now, historians and media commentators have talked of other things that have been passed off as October Surprises. In 2000, news of George W Bush\u2019s run-in with the law for driving under the influence of alcohol; Donald Trump\u2019s descriptions of how he deals with women or Hillary Clinton\u2019s problems with e-mails in 2016; Covid and Trump or Hunter Biden in 2020; and in 2024 to Iran for being involved in election meddling or a more serious charge of attempting assassination of former President Trump as a way of settling scores for General Qasem Soleimani who was taken out in January 2020 in Iraq.\n\nThe Gaza effect\n\nIran is now back in the news, thanks to Benjamin Netanyahu who has successfully thrust himself into the American elections process \u2014 accidentally or by design. The attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists brought forth a brutal response from the Jewish state in the Gaza; and making matters worse was Tel Aviv\u2019s decision to go after yet another proxy of Iran in the Middle East, the Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nFor the last several months Netanyahu has been cocking a snook at the Biden administration, refusing to play game over Gaza.\n\nThe goings on in the Gaza has had its impact in the American Presidential elections, not just related to Washington\u2019s relations with Tel Aviv and reviving the debate over whether Republicans or Democrats are better for Israel, but to the extent to which Democrats were going to retain the electoral hold over the Arab-American vote, especially in a critical battleground state like Michigan.\n\nThe louder the campus protests got, Democrats started getting an earful on two fronts: from pro-Palestinian supporters that the Biden administration was not leaning on Netanyahu enough and continuing to supply weapons that were being unloaded in the Gaza; and from conservative Jewish voters that Biden and Harris were not doing enough to stem the tide of anti-Semitics.\n\nIn the final stretch, no matter how much the Biden administration says that it has nothing to do with Netanyahu\u2019s strikes in and around Teheran, \u201conly\u201d on military targets and not energy sites is going to make little difference.\n\nThe Arab-American community has made it clear that it is neither endorsing Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump in 2024. It is estimated that there are about 400,000 Arab-Americans in Michigan, many of them outside Detroit which is supposed to have a large cluster of Palestinians, Lebanese and Jews.\n\nIn 2020 President Joe Biden took this state but not so this time around for Harris. Says Osama Siblani of The Arab American News out of Dearborn, Michigan: \u201cPeople are really right now in a dilemma. They really don\u2019t know where to go. It\u2019s like somebody hit them with a two by four, right on their head. So now they\u2019re in total disarray. They may vote for Donald Trump, just to punish Biden and Harris, just to say, \u2018Look what you\u2019ve done.\u2019\u201d The other scenario would be voting for Trump by way of punishing Harris for her association with Biden; or for the Green Party candidate which would actually be advantageous to the former President.\n\nThe writer is a senior journalist who has reported from Washington DC on North America and United Nations",

        "title": "\u2018KA\u2019 movie review: Kiran Abbavaram\u2019s \u2018karmic\u2019 thriller packs a handful of surprises",
        "text": "Comebacks are always interesting, especially when an actor is willing to look back and understand what went wrong in the first place. After a series of misfires, a resurgent Kiran Abbavaram is back with a festive release, mysteriously titled KA, that invests in a solid story over the heroics of the male protagonist. The period thriller offers a rich blend of action and emotions with a karmic twist. \n\nSet in Krishnagiri, a fictional hilly village enveloped by darkness as early as 3 pm, the film unfolds through a series of flashbacks across multiple decades. Abhinaya Vasudev (Kiran Abbavaram) is the orphaned, happy-go-lucky postman who treats the village populace as his extended family. When several women in the village go missing and Vasu\u2019s loved one is nearly abducted, he is determined to find answers.\n\nDebut directors Sujith and Sandeep camouflage the core premise with an innovative script. However, more than the screenplay, what leaves you impressed is their sharp eye for detail. Vasudev\u2019s profession comes with a solid backstory of a traumatic childhood. He grows up discreetly reading others\u2019 letters to overcome loneliness and gain a better understanding of family ties.\n\nKrishnagiri with its mysteries, little pleasures and rich tapestry of characters, is introduced to the viewer with child-like enthusiasm through Vasudev\u2019s eyes. Helping the rural folk with reading and writing letters, the protagonist has a good excuse to sustain his childhood habits, which land him in trouble soon. The romance with a village belle Satyabhama is basic but effective. \n\nThe storytelling is intriguing, given the film is deceptively structured like a kidnap drama, through which the pasts of multiple lead characters are explored. The first hour is a mishmash of every possible genre \u2014 crime, romance, humour, suspense \u2014 utilised to establish the many layers in the small-town ambience and the philosophy of the protagonist while teasing the viewers with the story trajectory.\n\nThroughout the film, a device keeps transporting the characters to a particular timeline, helping them introspect about their decisions and comprehend the repercussions. While a delicious revelation leading to the intermission turns the film on its head, setting a firm foundation for a gripping contest, it loses its fizz later. The overdose of the \u2018world building\u2019 and detailing affects the pacing and sucks the joy out of the film. \n\nTime and again, the directors try to reiterate that Vasudev is an orphan. It does not help that he switches conveniently from a postman to a detective to a jilted lover to a rebellious hero. Thankfully, he is still made to work hard to decode the mystery behind the missing women in the village, away from the world of CCTV footage, forensic teams and mobiles.\n\nKA heavily relies on the performances, technical finesse and the music to scrape past the dull stretches. Just when you are likely to give up on the film, a fantastic culmination shifts the momentum in its favour. A magnificently lit-up action sequence, where an entire village is in shambles and Vasudev chases the culprit on a bullock cart, provides the right mix of intensity, emotion and heroism.\n\nYet, the film\u2019s best part is not the action but how it smartly changes gears with the discourse on destiny and karma with a reference to Shankaracharya\u2019s Bhaja Govindam. Much like the interval, the directors generate a whistle-worthy cinematic high through an aptly timed twist. The dialogues summarising the cycle of life, birth and death make up for the film\u2019s rough edges.\n\nAs Vasudev, Kiran\u2019s innocence is a throwback to his Raja Vaaru Rani Gaaru days, free from larger-than-life indulgences. Nayan Sarika\u2019s role (as Satyabhama) deserved more prominence, but she is proving to be quite a talent in the making, having proven her worth in Aay and Bench Life (web series) as well.\n\nVeteran Achyuth Kumar\u2019s potential is not tested much in the part of a typical casteist Ranga Rao. It is hard to understand what Redin Kingsley \u2014 whose timing largely depends on his uncanny Tamil slang \u2014 is doing in a rustic Telugu film. Tanvi Ram bags a crucial role and proves her finesse. Saranya Pradeep, Annapurna, Bindu Chandramouli and Ajay excel in extended cameos. \n\nThe director duo Sujith-Sandeep deserve a larger chunk of the credit for giving a new spin to a period thriller and extracting commendable performances from a fairly young cast and crew. Cinematographers Viswas Daniel and Sateesh Reddy Masam infuse life into the rural ambience with their imaginative lighting and camera angles in a retro setup. The spirited and racy music score by Sam C S makes the most of an eventful script.\n\nKA is not without its shortcomings, though they pale in comparison with the ambition in the writing and technical finesse. It is a thriller with a difference.\n\nKA is currently running in theatres",

        "text": "Meghan Markle insists on being addressed as \u201cMa'am,\u201d Invictus Games CEO Scott Moore has revealed. The newly appointed head of the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 disclosed that he was briefed on this unique approach before his first encounter with the Duchess of Sussex during their visit to Canada earlier this year.\u201cI did make sure to ask how I should be addressing them when they get here,\u201d Mr Moore shared, according to The Mirror. The advice he received was: a simple \u201cMa'am\u201d for Meghan and \u201cSir\u201d for Prince Harry. This guideline differs from the formal address typically reserved for royals, where they are addressed first as \u201cYour Royal Highness\u201d followed by \u201cMa'am\u201d or \u201cSir.\u201d However, after stepping back from royal duties in 2020, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex no longer hold \u201cHRH\u201d titles, making this protocol unnecessary.The choice to maintain formal titles is different from Prince Harry's previous stance on informality. In 2020, he attended a tourism conference in Edinburgh, where he told the host and the audience to simply call him \u201cHarry.\u201dThe Invictus Games is an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women, both active and veteran. The Games were founded by Prince Harry in 2014, inspired by the Warrior Games in the United States.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");During the ex-royal couple's February trip to Vancouver, the Sussexes took time to connect with the Invictus community on Valentine's Day, joining participants for winter sports training. This event, named the \u201cOne Year to Go\u201d celebration, spanned three days and allowed members of the international Invictus community to participate in various winter sports in preparation for next year's games. The Vancouver event, which will take place from February 8 to February 16, 2025, will build on the success of the 2023 games held in Germany.At last year's games, Meghan Markle hinted at the possibility of bringing along their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.",

        "text": "In the bustling realm of Indian spirituality, a young boy named Abhinav Arora, known as bal sant baba, has stirred quite a commotion. His lively dance at a religious gathering drew the attention of Hindu spiritual leader Swami Rambhadracharya, who was far from pleased. The incident quickly became a hot topic on social media, with opinions divided over the boys actions.During a press interaction, Swami Rambhadracharya shared his views on children preaching like saints. He expressed his dissatisfaction, saying, Ye durbhagya hai (This is unfortunate). He further criticized Abhinav by calling him foolish.The Swami remarked, Itna murkh ladka hai wo. Wo kehta hai ki Krishna uske sath padhta hai... bhagwan kya uske sath padenge? Maine to Vrindavan mai bhi usko danta tha. (He is a foolish boy. He claims that Lord Krishna studies with him... Will God study with him? I had scolded him in Vrindavan too.)Social Media Reactions and CriticismThe situation escalated when Swami Rambhadracharya asked Abhinav to leave the stage, saying, Aap pehle neeche jao. This moment was captured on video and quickly went viral. Social media users were divided; some criticised Abhinavs energetic behaviour while others targeted his father, Tarun Raj Arora, accusing him of exploiting his sons fame.Abhinavs spiritual journey reportedly began at age three, driven by devotion to deities like Shri Ram and Shri Krishna. With nearly one million Instagram followers, he has established himself as one of Indias youngest spiritual speakers. He often shares stages with political figures and Bollywood stars.Legal Action and Public PerceptionAmidst the backlash, Abhinav has sought legal assistance from senior lawyer Dr. Kislay Pandey. Dr. Pandey claims that the young boy faces serious threats and requires legal protection. He suggests that there is an orchestrated effort to damage Abhinavs reputation through malicious videos circulating online.The lawyer has called for an investigation into the viral video featuring Swami Rambhadracharya. He speculates that it might have been edited for dramatic effect. If Swami Rambhadracharya only asked him to step down, wheres the reprimand? he questioned, implying that the story might have been exaggerated.The Intersection of Spirituality and CelebrityA pressing question arises: Why isnt this young saint attending school? Dr. Pandey assures that Abhinav is indeed focused on his education while managing his spiritual engagements. As this controversy unfolds, it prompts reflection on whether a child can be both a spiritual leader and a social media star.With opinions sharply divided and memes flooding social platforms, the saga of bal sant baba continues to captivate public attention. Whether seen as an authentic spiritual prodigy or a child caught in media frenzy, Abhinav Arora undeniably remains in the spotlight-both on stage and beyond.",

Unable to contact his parents since Saturday morning, he visited his home to check on them.

Moreover, the bodies were found to be around two days\u2019 old. \n\nThe circumstances behind the death is yet to be ascertained. While neighbours suggest the possibility of financial hardships following the couple\u2019s daughter\u2019s marriage, the police have not confirmed the theory. \n\nThe couple used to run a YouTube channel called \u2018Sellu family\u2019 that has around 18,500 subscribers. \n\n(Suicide prevention helpline: DISHA \u2013 1056, 0471-2552056)",

        "text": "One thing we have to appreciate about the British is that they are very concerned about their pets. And they really do go out of their way to show their love and affection. Thus, one of the biggest flower-shows in London \u2014the famous Chelsea Flower Show \u2014 will have its own \u201cdog garden\u201d next year. So \u2014 while most of us are worried that our dogs may misbehave in public flower beds as they scrummage around and poo and pee \u2014 here the country\u2019s most sophisticated flower show is actually creating what a dog heaven on earth may look like. Monty Don who presents a show called \u201cGardener\u2019s World\u201d is designing this special garden for dogs where they can just enjoy unrestricted access amongst special plants and long grass. Don who is extremely fond of his own dogs is using the Chelsea Flower Show to express his affection towards canines. Though as of now it appears that only guide dogs will be able to use the dog park next year, and normal pets may not be able to go there \u2014 at least it gives hope that special \u201cdog parks\u201d are being thought about. However, I am not sure if all dogs will get along with each other inside these enclosures\u2026 or will they go barking mad and tear it up in sheer excitement? What has definitely got wrecked meanwhile is King Charles\u2019 visit to Australia. Linda Thorpe a Senator in the Australian Parliament, accused the King (and thereby the British Empire) of genocide towards the aborigines, while he was visiting their Parliament as their King. The British media showed her screaming \u201cGive us our land back. Give us what you stole from us. Our bones, our skulls, our babies \u2026\u201d It was a surprising attack as the King had been doing his best to acknowledge the wisdom of the aborigines, and participating in their rituals. However, it is obvious that the King is going to face these outraged individuals and crowds ever more, as a generation that had never been part of the Empire grows up around the world. However, Royalty is still one of the biggest brands of Great Britain \u2014 and they attract crowds in droves. I have to say I could see the stiff upper lip in full display as even after this terrible incident \u2014 the King and Queen were cheered by Australian fans. I did mention that the British love their pets and animals \u2014 even those that live entirely in the imagination like Paddington Bear. This little favourite toy began life in Peru (or so the legend goes) and therefore he is one the UK\u2019s most beloved refugees. This is shocking of course \u2014 but what is even more shocking is that the British Home Office has just issued him a passport! It is a major departure from present policy to give a passport to a refugee (he should have been flown to Rwanda, maybe) \u2014 but then to be fair, Paddington Bear has been living on people\u2019s book shelves and sleeping in children\u2019s beds for almost 75 years. It\u2019s about time he had an identity and a country he could call his own! But to be honest \u2014 it is horses which are really a very special part of British life \u2014and so unsurprisingly a show everyone is breathless about is Rivals. It is based on a book by the popular author Jilly Cooper. Set in the 80s \u2014 when the UK was a very snooty, Tory country \u2014 the show is exciting many. Not only does it provide nostalgia \u2014 but it also gives us a world where men were men and women were women eager to jump into bed with these gorgeous men. And all of them rode horses. What could be better? The reviews of the show make one wonder if UK is happiest watching soft pornography \u2014 or is it a nation obsessed with sex? Or is it the horses\u2026? And, finally, the good news is that the Vincent Van Gogh exhibition, \u201cPoets and Lovers\u201d, is still on at The National Gallery. I was very worried that I would not be able to see the \u201cSunflowers\u201d before more climate change protestors threw more soup on it. However, this enormously well curated exhibition \u2014 with masterpieces drawn from many different sources \u2014 was hugely interesting. Most of the works were painted by the artist when he was struggling with his mental illness in France. It is fascinating to note that he would often paint the same scene many times, especially what he saw from the asylum window \u2014 but would change the colours or the perspective and instantly the mood would change. The show clearly depicts his pain and suffering \u2014 but his transcending creativity, above all. The exhibition is so successful that the visitors wait patiently in the sun and rain and the queue winds round from Trafalgar Square right up to Leicester Square. But I have to add that the queues at the British Museum were equally long. Thankfully, London remains a culturally rich city where the crowds at the museums and art exhibitions exceed those at the theatre and the pubs!",

BJP\u2019s Sita Soren is BJP\u2019s candidate from the Jamtara constituency in the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly elections. She is up against Congress\u2019 Irfan Ansari, who is the INDIA bloc candidate for the seat.Ansari stirred a controversy after he called Sita Soren a \u201crejected\u201d and a \u201cborrowed\u201d player. Recalling her late husband Durga Soren\u2019s role in the movement for Jharkhand state, she asked can such remarks be made against her, just because her husband is no more. Speaking to the media on Sunday, Sita Soren said, \u201cI will not forgive him. The way he made a comment against me, does he not know who I am, whose wife I am and which house I belong to? My father-in-law and husband started an agitation for Jharkhand. All of our community and the women are hurt.\u201dShe also asked the INDIA bloc to take responsibility for Ansari\u2019s statement, as he is a minister in the Jharkhand government. \u201cOur community has decided that he will not be allowed to enter Adivasi villages. Irfan Ansari is a minister in the INDIA Alliance government. It is also the responsibility of those who made him the minister. There should be some discipline. Just because my husband is no more,\u201d said Soren while breaking into a sob.The BJP leader was later consoled by some women after her breakdown.Earlier on Saturday, Sita Soren said that the BJP has complained to the Election Commission about Ansari\u2019s remarks and he will not be forgiven. \u201cI am unable to understand where he gets the courage to make such statements. Who is giving him the courage to make such remarks, because no one has ever made such statements against me in Jharkhand? The party has informed the Election Commission about his statement. We will not forgive him. The entire tribal population is angry,\u201d Sita Soren told ANI.Following this, Jharkhand Additional Chief Electoral Officer, Neha Arora on Saturday said that an FIR was registered against Ansari for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Sita Soren.Union Minister Annapurna Devi said the statement made by Irfan Ansari \u201cexposes\u201d the \u201cmentality\u201d of the Congress party.Assam Chief Minister and BJP\u2019s co-incharge of the Jharkhand polls, Himanta Biswa Sarma lashed out at Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren for not taking action against Irfan Ansari over his derogatory comments on his sister-in-law Sita Soren.\u201cOur party condemns the words used by Irfan Ansari against Sita Soren. But I want to condemn Hemant Soren more for not taking action against someone who made such objectionable statements against his sister-in-law,\u201d Sarma told reporters on Saturday.\u201cAdivasi dignity is nothing for CM Soren\u2026The daughter-in-law of Shibbu Soren is insulted and Hemant Soren says nothing\u2026Adivasi people will teach them a lesson in the elections,\u201d he added. The BJP will contest the upcoming Jharkhand assembly elections in alliance with the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU), Janata Dal (United), and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). While BJP will contest 68 seats, AJSU will contest 10 seats, and JD(U) and LJP will contest two and one seat respectively.The elections for the 81 assembly seats of Jharkhand will be held in two phases on November 13 and November 20.

The trial begins today, October 28, 2024, in the criminal court, with Depardieu's lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, asserting that the defense will present evidence and witnesses to refute the accusations as \"false.\" This case represents a significant moment in the French cinema industry's #MeToo movement, which has prompted greater scrutiny of influential figures in the field. The accusations stem from events during the filming of Les Volets Verts (\"The Green Shutters\") in 2021, where one plaintiff, a set dresser, reported that Depardieu engaged in sexual harassment, sexual assault, and made sexist remarks. She claims Depardieu physically assaulted her, including groping and making sexually explicit comments. The second plaintiff, an assistant director, has also made allegations of sexual violence against the actor. In an interview with AFP, actor Anouk Grinberg, who also worked on Les Volets Verts, described Depardieu\u2019s behavior as persistently salacious, attributing it to a permissive industry culture. Depardieu, who has denied all accusations, wrote an open letter last year claiming he has \"never abused a woman.\" The case unfolds as France reckons with longstanding allegations against various prominent figures in its cinema industry, drawing parallels to cases such as Harvey Weinstein's in the U.S.",

        "text": "The nostalgia that Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham fuels for 90s kids is unmatched. Shah Rukh Khan's entry sequence in the movie is something that is talked about even today. But recently director-producer Nikkhil Advani revealed on the podcast Cyrus Says that SRK was disappointed with the iconic helicopter scene that introduced his character Rahul Raichand in the movie. \"When we told him that his entry in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is with the helicopter. He thought he is going to jump off the helicopter, while he just had to step down. The scene was more about Jaya Bachchan that she gets to know about the arrival of her son as soon as he touches the ground,\" recalled Nikkhil Advani, a long time friend of SRK. He also shared that this sequence quite disappointed SRK, who was hoping for some intense action the scene. That's not all, SRK even added his touch of action during the basketball scene in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. \"When you see Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, he gets a credit called thrills. In the beginning of the film, he gets credit for thrills. It is because he treated the basketball sequence in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai like an action scene. He choreographed it\", Nikkhil said.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");This is not the first time that fans are finding out about SRK's love for action movies. In the Netflix documentary The Romantics, Aditya Chopra spoke at length about SRK's affinity towards action movies and how he always wanted to be an action hero instead of a romantic one. Shedding more light on this, Nikkhil disclosed how SRK \"hates\" love stories. \"Shah Rukh and I used to have these conversations so many times that 'Karan and Adi (producer Aditya Chopra) only do love stories, let us do something different.' Shah Rukh hates love stories. Considering that he is known as King Khan and King of Romance, this and that, but he hates love stories,\" Nikkhil shared. On the work front, SRK will be next seen in Sujoy Ghosh's King, where he will share the screen space with his daughter Suhana Khan. &nbsp",

        "text": "Madhuri Dixit, who is the epitome of beauty, elegance and talent in Indian cinema, has been captivating the audience with her mesmerizing moves, signature style and graceful expressions ever since she entered the industry. And has rightly earned the name of the dancing queen of Bollywood. Whether it\u2019s the foot-tapping beats or the graceful expressions, Madhuri has mesmerised the audience in various genres.In an interview with ANI, Madhuri revealed what dance means to her and how it has influenced her career over the years.She said, \u201cMy life was always influenced by dance because I started learning when I was 3 years old. Kathak has always been a part of me. I have learned it for, like, 9, 10 years. I have given performances on stage for 2 hours. I had a national talent scholarship for dancing. So for me, dance is in my blood.\u201dShe added, \u201cI\u2019ve grown up on music because of my mom. She was a classical singer and used to attend, programs by Bhimsen Joshi and Kishori Amonkar. We used to fall asleep 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. We were little kids. We used to listen to the music. So it\u2019s always been a part of my life. And then I was so lucky that I joined a profession which had everything that I grew up with, whether it\u2019s music or dance or acting. And, so I think I\u2019m very lucky to be where I am and I always thank God every day. I have a lot of gratitude for what I was given.\u201dMadhuri is a trained Kathak dancer and her dance numbers have set high standards and continue to be popular even today. Her ability to blend Indian classical dance elements with contemporary styles has made her dance performances even more captivating.And the recent one that is the talk of the town right now, is the stunning face-off between Madhuri and Vidya Balan in the much-awaited horror-comedy \u2018Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u2019Ami Je Tomar 3.0 is sung by Shreya Ghoshal, with lyrics penned by Sameer. The new version of the song is reprised by Amaal Mallik. Acclaimed choreographer Chinni Prakash has expertly crafted a mesmerizing blend of these classical dance forms.Talking about her experience doing dance face-off in the movie, Madhuri said, \u201cI have done so many dance offs. Like, even a dance Dola Re Dola or others but for me, it\u2019s always been a collaboration with the other artist. Ami Je Tomar is such an iconic song already. As I said earlier it\u2019s an OG, iconic song and it was made iconic by Vidya Balan.\u201dShe revealed how she always wanted to do such a song.\u201cI have always loved this song. Always wanted to be a part of it somehow. I used to think, maybe I should perform this song in one of my show performances or something like that. And when I got the opportunity, it was, like, so wonderful that I was dancing with Vidya who is the OG Manjulika, Madhuri added.Sharing how this song is not only a face-off between actors but also a face-off between the two dance forms of India.\u201cIt is wonderful that we have introduced the two dance forms Bharatanatyam and Kathak. So it\u2019s like a face-off between the two dance forms of India which are the classical dance forms which are so popular everywhere in the world. And I think that was also a great moment for me,\u201d the actor continued.Directed by Anees Bazmee and produced by Bhushan Kumar, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, combining horror and comedy.The film stars Kartik Aaryan, Madhuri Dixit, Vidya Balan, and Triptii Dimri, making it a highly anticipated Diwali release.Set to hit theatres on November 1, \u2018Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u2019 faces a significant box office challenge from Rohit Shetty\u2019s \u2018Singham Again\u2019.With both films generating considerable buzz, the clash promises to be a thrilling showdown in theatres. The film is produced by Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, and Murad Khetani.",

        "text": "The investment landscape is rapidly evolving as Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) become integral to private equity (PE) strategies. ESG considerations are no longer just a check-the-box, risk-mitigation exercise; they are now recognised as key drivers of value creation. A Deloitte US report projects that by 2027, around $1.6 billion in new fundraising will incorporate ESG commitments, highlighting this shift in mindset.\n\nIntegrating ESG principles into the core of PE is a complex endeavour. However, developing a holistic ESG strategy and guiding policies helps PE firms make the right investment decisions. Developing a clear long-term value narrative and embedding it throughout the portfolio is crucial.\n\nPE firms are more likely to build a sustainable portfolio and prioritise sustainability in the pre-investment phase through robust ESG due diligence, peer benchmarking, materiality and risk assessments.\n\nPeriodic assessments to confirm alignment with international frameworks and relevant regulations can help them navigate compliance reviews and regulatory audits.\n\nThe United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) plays a crucial role in this transition, helping investors integrate ESG principles in the investment process to create sustainable markets and improve returns. In 2021, about 75 per cent of PE investors used materiality assessments, and most PE signatories use ESG factors in pre-investment processes to identify risks. Nearly 96 per cent of corporate and PE investors expect that over the next three years there will be a greater focus on ESG issues in business agreements as the dynamics of business transactions evolve.\n\nNew York University researched and analysed over a thousand studies on ESG, and 58 per cent highlighted a positive relationship between ESG and financial performance. Furthermore, PE\u2019s business model can enhance the implementation of the sustainability agenda, provide new opportunities and alter the legacy of businesses as they have some degree of ownership and governance control. Early adoption of ESG has indicated early mover advantages, leading to improved valuations and higher returns.\n\nInvestment trends\n\nPE firms are increasingly investing in renewable energy, decarbonisation and circular economy. These investments are driven by climate change mitigation efforts and the need to reduce emissions from energy-intensive operations.\n\nTop PE firms with the highest assets under management (AUM) are focusing on the energy transition, such as renewable energy, transition fuels and electric grid infrastructure. By 2030, about $4.5 trillion per year will be required for the energy transition, with private capital expected to finance 40 per cent.\n\nAccording to S&P Global Market Intelligence Data, PE and venture capital transactions in the global renewable energy sector reached $14.58 billion in the last five years. There has been a 25-fold increase in funds raised for renewable energy compared with fossil fuel fundraising.\n\nAs the global economy shifts towards sustainability, PE investors can enhance business outcomes for stakeholders. PE firms must develop a clear long-term value narrative and embed it across their portfolio to achieve this. This means proactively creating shared value with society and not just responding to regulations. Effective ESG integration requires a top-down approach, embedding sustainability across the investment life cycle. By articulating the commercial value of ESG and focusing on measurable outcomes, PE firms can boost investment performance, seize new opportunities and lead the transition to a sustainable economy.\n\nBerry is President, Strategy, Risk and Transactions, Deloitte South Asia, and Tyagi is Partner, Climate Change and Sustainability, Deloitte India",

        "text": "The Netflix film Do Patti revolves around a pair of twins so identical that you cannot tell them apart even though one is behaving demurely and the other is flouncing about wildly. Saumya and Shailee (Kriti Sanon in a double role) have a childhood animus that has carried over to their adulthood.\n\nWhen Saumya falls for the wealthy Dhruv (Shaheer Sheikh), Shailee works her charm on Dhruv out of sheer spite. When Dhruv begins beating up Saumya, Shailee cares about her battered sister as much as Do Patti does about developing a barebones premise.\n\nKanika Dhillon\u2019s latest treatise about misunderstood women is too smug to bother saying anything lasting about domestic violence. Dhillon\u2019s story and screenplay, directed with a matching lack of interest by Shashanka Chaturvedi, has a pair of big-name actors and an important cause, but neither rigour nor potency.\n\nThe Hindi movie\u2019s title itself is a giveaway, suggesting a game being played between key characters and police inspector Vidya Jyoti (Kajol). The upright Vidya is stonewalled in her attempts to get Saumya to file a complaint against Dhruv \u2013 until matters come to a head.\n\nThe 127-minute movie is mostly flat and uninvolving, sparking to life only in its unstinting depiction of the violence endured by Saumya. Despite two Kriti Sanons and Kajol, as well as Shaheer Sheikh\u2019s worthy antagonist, Do Patti lurches from scene to scene before clumsily arriving at a predictable destination.\n\nThe cast includes Brijendra Kala doing his usual cute number, Tanvi Azmi as the twins\u2019 concerned nanny, and Sohaila Kapur as a judge who furiously makes notes after the case reaches the courtroom.\n\nAlthough Kriti Sanon can\u2019t get Saumya to be very different from Shailee, she is compelling in her anguish as well as her inner strength. Kajol is fine too as the gung-ho Vidya, who is sadly not as sharp as she billed to be. Kajol is always up for more than the movie can offer her.\n\nThe binary of how good and bad women are supposed to behave doesn\u2019t do this self-declared feminist film any favours. Do Patti\u2019s most promising idea is that the twins are actually one woman who represents the conflicted states of submissiveness and courage. Beyond this, Do Patti is sketchy, dealing its enthusiastic heroines and itself a bum hand.",

We aren't blood relatives, but in our culture, it is unacceptable for a woman to be married into a family of a lower stature, if another woman has already been married into a family of a higher stature. And because my sister-in-law had been married into my family, I couldn't be married into their family, which was considered of lower stature,\" Mridula said on the Conversations with Atul YouTube channel. Mridula revealed that she was almost married to someone else but decided to tell her father about her relationship with Pankaj Tripathi. She said, \"There was a tehelka, a bawaal (a ruckus). Bhabhi wasn't happy, mom wasn't happy. She was concerned about how he'd take care of me. But slowly, they came around to accepting us.\" While most of their family members have now made peace with their marriage, there are still some reservations from Pankaj Tripathi's mother's side. \"My mother-in-law hasn't accepted me to this day, for the reasons I mentioned earlier. She is still upset about this intermingling. But what can we do about it now?\" Mridula said.Pankaj Tripathi and Mridula got married in 2004. They are now proud parents to their daughter Aashi Tripathi.",

        "text": "Nicole Kidman, for her part, has been candid in detailing how very emotionally draining it was to shoot some of the sex scenes in her new film, Babygirl. The new drama directed by Halina Reijn, portrays a powerful CEO whose affair with her very young intern, Harris Dickinson, puts both her marriage and her career in precarious balance. Aged 58, she co-stars here with Antonio Banderas, who plays her husband. Such intense scenes have made it necessary for Kidman to shift filming sessions several times as she called them very difficult yet very revealing. Having back-to-back orgasms while shooting, Kidman had to stop filming sex scenes for Babygirl movie. \n\nToo much or orgasm! The reason why Nicole Kidman asked to stop filming sex scenes for Babygirl\n\nIn an interview, Kidman candidly said that the love scenes with Banderas and Dickinson were too much to handle. The performances were so intense that she had to stop the sex scenes on many occasions for Babygirl. She cited deep trust moments while shooting those scenes but moments of frustration too, where at one point she was like, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were times when we were shooting where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to orgasm any more. Don\u2019t come near me. I hate doing this. I don\u2019t care if I am never touched again in my life! I\u2019m over it.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was so present all the time for me that it was almost like a burnout,\u201d\n\nKidman admitted that filming the sex scenes for Babygirl required the actor to be in a place of vulnerability that extended beyond her previous professional experiences. She admitted that it felt like burnout, hence the reason she had to occasionally step back from it. It was a role that allowed her to explore some aspects of human behaviour and emotion, initially beginning to attract her to the project. A seasoned actress, she maintained that she\u2019s always on a quest for roles that challenge boundaries and offer profound character exploration.\n\nKidman purposely chose the adult film!\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been on a quest as an actor. I\u2019m always going, where have I not been? And what can I explore as a human being? And this was an area I\u2019d never been.\u201d\n\nAt the premiere of Babygirl at the Venice Film Festival, the critics spoke very well of Kidman\u2019s performance, saying that she gave an essential depth to this character. Scenes of the film having sexuality involve just that kind of emotion and never in a sensational manner. Director Halina Reijn has said of Kidman and Dickinson\u2019s characters, that they confronted problems of power, gender, and age, allowing her to explore primal instinct and hierarchy in a way that felt both rebellious and free.\n\nAlso, see: Ram Gopal Verma wants to make a biopic on Lawrence Bishnoi, says he is even handsome than many film stars",

        "title": "Architecture Job, US Girlfriend: Biographer Shares Insights On Ratan Tata",
        "text": "Ratan Tata died earlier this month but his life and his contributions to Indian industry will continue to inspire generations. One snapshot of his life has been captured by his official biographer, Thomas Mathew, whose book, 'Ratan Tata: A Life', was released recently.\n\nMr Mathew spoke to NDTV on Friday about Mr Tata's various successes, the biggest problems he faced and also gave insights into the corporate titan's personal life - including a little-known fact about a serious girlfriend in Los Angeles - and his love for dogs. \n\nMr Mathew, who is a former IAS officer and has also worked with stalwarts like former president Pranab Mukherjee, said he met Mr Tata for the first time in 1994-1995.\n\n\"He had taken over as the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991. As you know, Ratan Tata was probably one of the most good-looking industrialists... more than six feet tall, with hazel eyes, melding the colours of brown, green and gold. I still remember, on a Monday in 1995, he walked into my office - I was a private secretary to the industries minister at the time... When he walked in, it was something like a Greek god walking into the room, but what struck me was his humility. We kept in touch from then on,\" he said. \n\nEarly Years\n\nMr Mathew said the biography, which is published by HarperCollins, is an effort to \"unravel the complexities of a simple man\". The former IAS officer Mr Tata did not \"have a great childhood\" but the strongest force in his early life was his grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata.\n\n\"When he was young, his parents separated and that caused him a lot of agony. Not only was he shamed in school but, in those conservative settings, he was socially ostracised. But, a determined man and with the protection of his grandmother, he could withstand the challenge and he withstood it well,\" he said. \n\nMr Tata studied in a school called Riverdale in New York and Mr Mathew said the industrialist was unaware until he told him that it was the same institution in which John F Kennedy had done his early education. After he finished his schooling, he initially studied mechanical engineering, before shifting to architecture at Cornell. \n\n\"He had a car, a black Mercedes, and he also took to flying. There are many stories revolving around the car and his daredevil flying skills... He used to go up into the sky, switch off the engine and scare his co-passengers. He left a lot of legends in Cornell and, in 1962, after he finished his Bachelor of Architecture course, he happened to write to one of the external examinees, who was a partner at a company called Jones & Emmons in Los Angeles,\" he said. \n\nArchitecture Job\n\nThe examiner asked him to visit Los Angeles, Mr Mathew said, and Emmons was so impressed with his thesis that he asked Mr Tata to work for him.\n\n\"Here was a young man being offered a job by one of the top architects of the US and he worked. It was also here that he fell in love and that was his first serious girlfriend that he wanted to marry, called Caroline Jones. But it was short-lived. In 1962, he wanted to come back because his mother was not keeping well. He came back and Caroline was supposed to join him. In 1962, India was a distant place for Americans and the war with China (the same year) scared every American, so she did not have the guts to come to India,\" Mr Mathew said. \n\n\"So, over a period of time, it fizzled out and she subsequently got married to somebody who was incidentally like Ratan in many ways,\" he added.\n\nFocus On Trust\n\nTo a question on Mr Tata's biggest corporate achievement, the biographer said a string of contributions made the industrialist who he was. \n\n\"In 1991, when he took over the Tata Group, it coincided with the economic liberalisation of India. This meant that industries protected by the licence raj were suddenly open to the turbulent winds of foreign corporate invasion. So this made his task very difficult,\" he said.\n\nMr Mathew said stalwarts and veterans were heading large companies of the group like Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Power, who had a mind of their own, and Mr Tata came up with a strategic plan that would define the Tata Group for the next three decades. This plan unveiled a set of 11 corporate initiatives, including the JRD Qualitative Value Award, which led to a reinvention of Tata companies and the group. \n\n\"One of the most important initiatives he took was the formalisation of the Tata Code of Conduct, much before companies from many Western countries did it. And that was because of his passion for trust. He said anything bearing the name 'Tata' should immediately invoke in people a picture of quality and trust,\" he said.\n\n'Loneliest Times'\n\nThe former IAS officer said the protests in West Bengal, which led to the Tata Nano factory being relocated from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat in 2008, and the legal battle with Cyrus Mistry were challenging but the situation which tested Mr Tata's \"patience, strength, courage and vision\" was the strike at Tata Motors after he took over as the company's chairman.\n\n\"It was the biggest strike the Tata Group ever faced. When he took over as the chairman of Tata Motors in 1988, he was the chairman of one company, not the Tata Group. And the trade unionism, which was very violent, tested his patience and capacity. He says those were some of the loneliest times of his life. That is what tested every nerve of his,\" he said. \n\nLove For Dogs\n\nMr Mathew said Ratan Tata got a Fox Terrier when he was 12 years old and while he was fond of him, his grandmother never liked the dog. \n\n\"And he always laughed when he said that when he left for the US to do his schooling, his grandmother got so fond of the dog and the dog got so fond of her that it would guard her as she slept. So, from then, he developed a liking for dogs and the rest is history,\" he said.",

The incident sparked nationwide outrage, with several voices stressing the need to raise boys better instead of restricting girls.\n\n\"It starts at home, it starts for boys at a very tender age of 4-5 years when they start understanding the difference between a boy and a girl... how a girl should be respected... it is for mothers to understand and tell their little boys. This conversation is important to have with your child, however uncomfortable, they must be told, they must be shown the way,\" said Ms Kapoor Khan, mother to Taimur (7) and Jeh (3). She is married to actor Saif Ali Khan.\n\nThe actor said children understand actions more than words. \"If they also see their mother doing (work) things... Taimur understands now, I have told him that I am speaking at a very important event, so he is excited, he's like 'What are you gonna talk about?' When I go home, he might ask me. So we will talk about different things that I said... These conversations are important,\" she said.\n\nEarlier, while responding to a question about her son Jeh, Ms Kapoor Khan said she would want him to grow up into someone who would always stand by the truth. \"He (Jeh) has a brother, but that does not mean he does not have a (duty) to protect other girls, he will be somebody's father, husband someday so I hope he values what his mother has done for him because he sees his mother and father go to work. So he understands that it is important for women to be safe to go to work, to feel happy. These are things that he is watching every day. I want him to grow up knowing and normalising that women are equal to men and they can also be frontrunners,\" she said.",

Anna Durai gave his voice, Karunanidhi gave his voice and I told the same. They've added what I didn't say and lied. Now cases have been filed not just in Tamil Nadu but in many places across India. They asked me to apologise in the court. I said what I said is said. I am Karunanidhi's grandson and will not apologise for anything\", he said.\n\nThis is the first time Udhayanidhi Stalin has commented on this after becoming the Deputy Chief Minister.\n\nIn March he had said 'Sanatan Dharma' ought to be \"annihilated like mosquitos causing malaria and dengue.\n\nAlthough courts had made strong observations on the issue, his legal team argues that in Tamil Nadu and southern states, 'Sanatan Dharma' has always been seen through the prism of untouchability and discrimination on the basis of castes and that his comments ought to be seen in that context. They claim that had no intention to hurt any Hindu sentiment.\n\nLargely focussing on women empowerment and the ruling DMK's contribution to the cause over the years including legislation for property rights for women and monthly assistance of thousand rupees, he took on Governor RN Ravi as well on the recent issue of skipping a line from the Tamil Nadu anthem which had the word Dravida at a function he presided over.\n\nChief Minister MK Stalin elevated Udhayanidhi Stalin as Deputy Chief Minister superseding several senior ministers triggering opposition criticism of family politics and dynasty.

        "text": "A new genus and snake species discovered in the Himalayas has been named after the Academy Award-winning Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio - the \"Titanic\" star who is also a passionate environmentalist, officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe newly described snake species, \u2018Anguiculus dicaprioi' is distributed from central Nepal to Chamba district in Himachal Pradesh, whereas \u2018Anguiculus rappii' is distributed in Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThese snakes are mostly active from late May to August and are not found at other times of the year, nothing is known about the biology of the two species, and \u2018Anguiculus rappii' is rare and has not been recorded in the last couple of decades.\n\nThe snake was first found by Virender Bhardwaj in the backyard of his home in the western Himalayas during the Covid-19 Pandemic lockdown.\n\nHe posted its pictures on social media, leading to a sensation - and a three-year-long investigation coupled with laborious research - to identify the snake which resembled \u2018Liopeltis rappi', a species known to be distributed in the eastern Himalayas.\n\nHowever, the population from Himachal Pradesh differed from the true \u2018Liopeltis rappi' found in Sikkim in many aspects like the scales on the head and general colour patterns -- which was confirmed by examining specimens from natural history museums across Europe, the US and even India.\n\nBesides, the DNA sequences generated for this snake did not match any genus and the team included DNA and morphological data for other related species from all over Asia.\n\nThe complication of the molecular and morphological data suggested that the snake from HP is related to \u2018Liopeltis rappi' but differed in many aspects, to be called a new species, and both these belong to a new genus that is endemic to the Himalayas region.\n\nA research paper was authored by Zeeshan A. Mirza of Max Planck Institute for Biology at Tubingen (Germany); Virender K. Bhardwaj and H. T. Lalremsanga of Mizoram University (India); Saunak Pal of the Newcastle University (UK); Gernot Vogel of the Society for Southeast Asian Herpetology(Germany); Patrick D. Cambell of the Natural History Museum (UK) and Harshil Patel of the Thackeray Wildlife Foundation (Mumbai, India).\n\nThe research paper was submitted early this year and published recently by Scientific Reports, an international peer-reviewed journal.\n\nDiCaprio has been actively involved in creating awareness about global climate change, increased biodiversity losses and the impact of pollution on human health plus related issues.\n\n\"The specific epithet 'dicaprioi' is a patronym honouring Leonardo DiCaprio, an American actor, film producer, and environmentalist who has been actively involved in creating awareness about global climate change, increased biodiversity loss, and human health issues through pollution,\" the report explained.\n\n\"The work not only resolved the status of the Himalayan species but also resolved a taxonomic confusion regarding the genera Liopeltis and Gongylosoma that lasted 180 years.

The power outage, which began around 7 p.m. and lasted until 12.30 a.m., forced devotees to navigate the hill using torches on their mobile phones. The situation was worsened by heavy rains and an unprecedented rush of pilgrims, adding to their difficulties.\n\nThe Travancore Devaswom Board confirmed the incident, attributing the outage to severe lightning in the area. \u201cThe outage lasted just under 45 minutes and was fixed promptly,\u201d said P.S. Prashanth, president, TDB. According to him, arrangements are being made to ensure that such issues do not occur in future. \n\nIncidentally, the power outage occurred during a time when the trekking path was experiencing a heavy influx of pilgrims.

The discussions are at a preliminary stage and there is no proposal before the Board of the company or its insurance subsidiaries in this regard, said Bajaj Finserv.\u201cAllianz has indicated to Bajaj that given its strategic priorities, it is actively considering an exit from the life and general insurance joint ventures. It has indicated that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market but will not speculate on alternatives,\u201d said Bajaj Finserv.Bajaj Finserv holds a 74 per cent stake each in two JVs Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. while Allianz owns the remaining.Allianz plans to exit because Bajaj Group isn\u2019t allowing the German insurer to raise its stakes at a discounted price. It also isn\u2019t given a say in strategic decisions, according to a Bloomberg report.As per a 2001 joint venture agreement, the German company had a call option to increase its stake in the life insurance joint venture to 74 per cent from 26 per cent at a predetermined price if allowed under laws and subject to regulatory approvals. If the option is exercised by July 30, 2016, the pre-determined price will be Rs 5.42 per share, plus interest at 16 per cent per annum from July 31, 2001, to the date of payment. After 2016, Allianz would have to pay the market price.Allianz is instead now looking to buy stakes in newly established insurance firms to retain a presence in the fast-growing South Asian country, said the news report.Allianz, in case it exits the joint venture, has committed full support to Bajaj in ensuring a smooth transition to the Bajaj brand keeping in mind the interest of policyholders, business partners, employees and other stakeholders of the insurance companies, the statement further said.The Bajaj Allianz general insurer is the third-largest in the country by gross written premiums, while the Bajaj Allianz life insurer is one of the fastest-growing with assets under management of Rs one lakh crore as of March 31, 2024.",

He was also the first to give a \u201clife-long pension\u201d to his wife.\n\nVaidyar, an Ayurvedic medical practitioner by profession, was more famous for his social criticism and friendship with eminent writers of his time. Nilgiris, the private lodge he ran near the railway station, was a haven for many writers, Mr. Leelakrishnan recalled.\n\nHe pointed out that Malayalis were often found to preach something and practise something else. Mere criticism would not help address this attitude, and Vaidyar knew it very well. That was why he resorted to his quirky acts, Mr. Leelakrishnan said. Thus, Vaidyar became part of the great tradition of satirists in Malayalam such as Kunchan Nambiar, E.V. Krishna Pillai, Sanjayan, and VKN, he added. \n\nCalicut Press Club president E.P. Mohammed and senior journalists A. Sajeevan and Kamal Varadoor, among others, were present.",

In the latest episode of the show's 16th season, the actor engaged in foodie conversations with contestant Harsha Upadhyay and revealed his favourite dish, which is a popular street snack in Mumbai. After a food-related question, contestant Harsha Upadhyay, an arts, crafts, and music teacher from Gujarat, asks Amitabh Bachchan if he enjoys churma, reported IANS. Big B chuckles and reveals that while he may not know all the dishes, he does have a favourite snack - Vada Pav.\n\nAlso Read:Not Just Deepika Padukone, Prabhas Has Also Treated These Stars To Yummy Food\n\nTalking about his love for Vada Pav, the KBC host says, \"Usse badhkar koi cheez nahi hai, chhota sa hai par lekin itna badiya hai... har jagah milta hai - sirf desh mein hi nahi, par videsh mein bhi.

        "text": "Mitchell Starc has started to peak just before the Border Gavaskar Trophy against India as shown by his scorching spell at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) during Sheffield Shield. While featuring for the New South Wales, Starc was a force to be reckoned with across both innings. Ahead of the highly-anticipated BGT series, where skills and patience will be tested, Starc is getting primed at the right time. He took 1/35 and 6/81 in 36.5 overs across the match. On both occasions, Starc removed Marcus Harris, one of the players in contention to open for Australia in the BGT.He took seven wickets in the match by putting his experience and skillset to optimum use. But even after his valiant display, New South Wales tasted a 141-run defeat against Victoria. NSW coach Greg Shipperd believes India could find themselves in a tough spot if the conditions are similar to the one they played in. \u201cHis pace, his rhythm, all of those things that go to engineering the sort of pace he was dealing with. He changed the game once he decided to go short and really change the dynamic of the match. And the second innings again, we thought perhaps he\u2019d done enough, but he kept coming. And so that\u2019s a good sign for Australia and troubles ahead, perhaps, on the right wicket for India,\u201d Greg said as quoted from ESPNcricinfo. On the fourth day of the match, Victoria stood victorious before lunch. Right-arm pacer Sam Elliot picked the final four scalps to end NSW\u2019s agony. He broke the stubborn partnership 63-run between Josh Philippe and Starc. Philippe scored 88. Starc was next to follow after top-edging the ball while attempting a pull. Nathan Lyon departed similarly after miscuing his pull shot, which was taken at the square leg. Elliot cleaned up Jackson Bird moments later to seal the game in Victoria\u2019s favour. (ANI)",

The \u2018Guilty\u2019 star shared, \u201cI had an absolute blast working with Vasan Sir again. Whenever he calls me, it's a no-brainer for me to say yes, and it was the same with Jigra. I remember he called me one fine day and told me that I had a one-day shoot, and I immediately signed up for it. He\u2019s always been a guiding force in my career. The fact that this short scene is getting so much love from the audience, and that people are tagging me everywhere, feels amazing.\u201d In \u2018Jigra\u2019, Akansha portrayed a quirky air hostess who brings a much-needed dose of levity to the story.

Lee's remarks came after India's eight-wicket defeat to New Zealand in the Bengaluru Test earlier this week. India, aiming to qualify for their third successive final in the World Test Championship, will be travelling to Australia next month to defend the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"This day and age, India is a powerhouse that don't want to bow down. They know how to win, and they know they can beat Australia; they know they can beat the Kiwis. They know they can beat anyone on any given day,\" Lee told 'Fox Cricket'.Commenting on India's outing in the Bengaluru Test against the Kiwis, Lee felt that they might have got influenced by 'Bazball', leading to playing some loose shots.\"India just didn't go into their shell. Maybe it's Bazball brushing off on other cricketers around the world,\" he noted.\"I know that India won't be proud of the way they played. They played some pretty loose shots.\" India's decision to bat first in overcast conditions raised eyebrows, as the team was bowled out for 46 in the first innings of the opening Test, its lowest Test score at home.Lee said the side needs to \"weigh up the risk factor\" and added the Indians should have judged the conditions better.\"But, you've got to weigh up the risk factor as well. There are times when you've got to go, 'Okay, well, maybe the big shots aren't working today'.\"Maybe, just rein it in a little bit. I don't think they sort of summed up the conditions as quickly as what they should have done,\" Lee said.India play two more Tests against New Zealand -- Pune (October 24-28) and Mumbai (November 1-5) -- before leaving for Australia.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Taylor Swift began a relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce during her Eras Tour. The relationship was confirmed when Swift attended Chiefs games with Kelce's mom and Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany Mahomes. The National Football League quickly recognized the value of Swift's presence at games, making the Kansas City Chiefs and Swift almost synonymous, despite longtime football fans' disdain. However there also have been some controversies.

The Daily Mail reported that several fans found the video 'ridiculous', questioning whether it was a blunder or joke.The romance was part of a predetermined planA leaked document claiming a \"Comprehensive Media Plan\" for the 'Love Story' couple has gone viral, causing concern among Swift's followers.

To accompany a carousel of photos, he penned a long, heartfelt caption filled with candid musings and wishes for his spouse. He mentioned how his wife has \"ghar ka khanna\" taste buds, which makes it difficult for them to find spots for eating out that she would like. In the post, Boman Irani hinted at their shared love for chai too. He explained that, while travelling out of the country, his wife's pet peeve is being rather disappointed with specific tea offerings. She often tends to feel that drinks that are labelled chai abroad don't actually deserve to be called that. He finds himself in agreement with her on this point.\n\nAlso Read:\"I Truly Believe In This\" - Boman Irani's Latest Reel Is All About Bonding Over Food\n\nBoman Irani's note also includes several other glimpses into their life together. He has lovingly described her habits and complimented her personality. Here's the complete caption: \"It is impossible to find a restaurant to please your \"Ghar Ka Khana\" tastebuds. Impossible. You always repeat instructions a minimum of 84 times. Like, \"Check the passport, or let's leave 4 hours early for the airport, or let's go to the gate, 2 hours before the gate opens. When you see a dog... you snap your finger and instruct me to take a photograph like I'm on your payroll. When I'm abroad, you wake me up in the middle of the night to ask if I've taken my medication. Then wonder why I'm sounding sleepy. When in town you give me my medication yourself, and 5 minutes later you ask if you've given me my medication. You hate to speak in public but somehow love to speak (a lot) in private. When abroad, your pet peeve phrase is, \"How dare they call this CHAI??\" (This, I agree, actually.). I wouldn't mind being on your staff; that's where one gets treated the best.I love to grumble about you like this. Because saying nice things is somehow boring. But today I am going to say just one nice thing. Why not... I have yet to find a person who has a single bad thing to say about you. Said it. Only because it's your birthday. Happy birthday, Zen!\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nBefore this, Boman Irani had posted about his experience dining at Chef Vikas Khanna's New York restaurant. He posted a reel that captured Chef Khanna's hospitality and the lip-smacking dishes served during the meal. Boman said that it was an \"unforgettable celebration\".

        "text": "Former MLC quits BJP to join Congress, likely to contest Channapatna by-polls\n\nBengaluru: In a big shocker for the opposition BJP and JD(S) alliance, former Minister C.P. Yogeshwar tendered his resignation to the primary membership of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to join the Congress party, here this morning. Yogeshwar sent his resignation to BJP State President B.Y. Vijayendra through a WhatsApp message. It may be remembered that Yogeshwar, who was nominated to the Legislative Council by BJP, had resigned as MLC on Monday.\n\nThe former BJP MLC joined the Congress party in presence of KPCC President and Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, Ministers N. Cheluvarayaswamy, B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan and R. Ramalinga Reddy, former MP D.K. Suresh among others including party MLAs from Mandya and Ramanagara districts at KPCC Office on Queen\u2019s Road.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Yogeshwar said he had joined the Congress party unconditionally. However, sources said that Congress is likely to field Yogeshwar in Channapatna bypoll.\n\nMeanwhile, D.K. Shivakumar said that All India Congress Committee (AICC) would announce the candidate for Channapatna by-election this evening following which the nomination papers will be filed tomorrow.\n\nYogeshwar, who aspired to contest the upcoming Channapatna by-poll on a BJP ticket, was denied the ticket by party high command which forced the former Minister to join the Congress party. Yogeshwar\u2019s move comes amid JD(S) State President and Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy informing the party workers about BJP National President J.P. Nadda and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi calling to him to enquire the possibility of Yogeshwar contesting the Channapatna by-polls on a JD(S) ticket.\n\nIt may be recalled, H.D. Kumaraswamy had defeated C.P. Yogeshwar by a margin of 15,195 votes in the Assembly polls held last year.\n\nAccording to sources, Yogeshwar had given BJP High Command a deadline till Oct. 22 evening to decide on the ticket. With party unable to take a decision, the former Minister decided on rejoining the Congress party. Yogeshwar\u2019s return will not only be a boost to the Congress Party in Channapatna but will also strengthen the party in Bengaluru Rural and old Mysuru region.\n\nThe prominent Vokkaliga leader, also a five-time MLA from Channapatna, had played a crucial role for the victory of BJP candidate Dr. C.N. Manjunath, brother-in-law of H.D. Kumaraswamy, from Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha Constituency in 2024 elections against the then sitting Congress MP D.K. Suresh, younger brother of D.K. Shivakumar, by a margin of 2,69, 647 votes.\n\nSources also said that Yogeshwar was also in touch with Samajwadi Party leaders to secure a \u2018B\u2019 Form to contest the upcoming by-poll from Channapatna. However, in the last minute he decided to rejoin the Congress Party as he saw better chances of winning and bright political prospects in the future. \n\nThe by-poll to Channapatna Assembly Constituency has been necessitated following the resignation of H.D. Kumaraswamy as MLA after him getting elected to Lok Sabha from Mandya during the general elections held early this year.\n\nThe last date for filing of nomination papers is Oct. 25 while the polling will take place on Nov.13 and the results will be announced on Nov. 23.\n\nC.P. Yogeshwar\u2019s electoral career in Channapatna Assembly Constituency\n\n1999: He won as an independent candidate by a margin of 18,828 against Congress party\u2019s Sadath Ali Khan.\n\n2004: Contested on a Congress ticket and defeated M.C. Ashwath of JD(S) by a margin of 16,169 votes.\n\n2008: Contested again from Congress and defeated M.C. Ashwath of JD(S) by a margin of 4,930 votes.\n\n2009 (By-election): Joined BJP and lost to H.D. Kumaraswamy (JD-S) by a margin of 20,254 votes.\n\n2011 (By-election): Contested on BJP ticket and won against S.I. Nagaraju of JD(S) by a margin of 17,803 votes.\n\n2013: Contested on a Samajwadi Party ticket and won against Anitha Kumaraswamy (JD-S) by a margin of 6,464 votes.\n\n2018: Contested from BJP and lost to H.D. Kumaraswamy by a margin of 21,530 votes.\n\n2022: Nominated as MLC by the BJP State Government under artiste quota as he was also a Kannada actor.\n\n2023: Contested from BJP and lost to H.D.

        "text": "Like every year, fashion designer Manish Malhotra hosted a Diwali party on Tuesday night. The star-studded event was attended by who's who of Bollywood, including Shraddha Kapoor. The actress looked stunning in a silver tissue saree, which she paired with a heart-shaped purse. Later in the night, the actress tried to make a quiet exit from the party but was enveloped by a crowd of paparazzi. In a shrewd attempt to divert the shutterbugs' attention, the actress pointed in the other direction and mentioned Shah Rukh Khan's name, believing that the paps would hurry to get a picture of the star, allowing her to make a quick exit. In between all this, Shraddha approached the wrong car and attempted to change the subject by bringing up Salman Khan's name. Unfazed, the paparazzi maintained their focus on her by pointing out that Salman wasn't there. Shraddha was accompanied by Raveena Tandon's daughter Rasha Thadani.

The film also featured Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Banerjee and Aparshakti Khurana in key roles. Directed by Amar Kaushik, Stree 2 is the sequel to the 2018 horror comedy Stree. After the immense success of the first two parts, the makers are now all set to work on the third instalment of the franchise. At a recent media event, Shraddha confirmed that Stree 3 is in the works. The actress revealed that director Amar Kaushik already has a story ready for the next movie. She said, \"When Amar sir told me he had a story for Stree 3, I got very excited because I know it's going to be something amazing. I can't wait to hear what it's about.\u201d Talking about the success of the first two movies, Shraddha Kapoor said, \"The kind of love and accolades the first part received were immense. It all started there. Hats off to the director, writer and producer for cracking a sequel. It's important not to make a sequel just for the sake of it - you need substance to bring people to theatres and earn genuine appreciation. They stayed true to how a sequel should be made and cracked the story of Stree 2. It had all the entertainment factors, brilliant actors and really entertaining dialogues. I believe it was a fabulous team effort. It was pure cinematic joy.\"Apart from the Stree franchise, Shraddha Kapoor is also expected to be featured in a dance number in Pushpa 2: The Rule.

        "text": "Indian Olympic Association president PT Usha feels the axing of medal-yielding sports such as wrestling, hockey and badminton from the 2026 Glasgow Commonwealth Games programme is \"disappointing\" for the country but the approach to reduce cost would ensure that the event continues to find hosts in future. The 23rd edition of the Games is scheduled to take place from July 23 to August 2, marking the Scottish capital's return as host after 12 years. Most of the National Sports Federations have been critical of Glasgow's decision to exclude hockey, badminton, wrestling, cricket, shooting, TT, and squash from the roster and have even questioned the relevance of the Games after this move.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");But Usha said the reasons can't be completely ignored.\"The reduction in the sports programme for the 2026 Commonwealth Games is disappointing, but I am sure that you will understand that 2026 games serve as a bridge to the future of the CWG,\" Usha read out a written statement to PTI Videos on Wednesday.Glasgow stepped in to save the Games after original host Victoria (Australia) backed out citing ballooning cost. It has less than two years to complete preparations and the organisers said they have tried to ensure that financial and operational risks are reduced by their conservative approach.While India would lose out on a lot of medals, Usha backed the idea of reduced cost and lower environmental impact due to a pruned schedule of 10 events to be conducted at four venues within an eight-mile radius.\"The approach aims to reduce costs, lower environmental impact, and increase social benefits, such progressive and sustainable model is very exciting as it will enable more countries to host the Games in future,\" she explained.\"Given the limited time-frame and financial constraints, focus of CGF has been to deliver a high-quality Games in a financially responsible way, with emphasis on minimising risks and prioritising athletes and sports,\" said one of India's greatest athlete.Usha said CWG grew from being a 10-sport event up until 1998 and can go back to expanding itself in future once a stable model of hosting the event is figured going forward.\"Historically, CWG featured around 10 sports and since 1998, programme has expanded to include 15 to 20 sports, and flexibility in future will be crucial for hosts,\" she added.\"I have had discussion with CGF president and he has assured me that exclusion of certain sports from the 2026 programme doesn't set a precedent for future games, and all CWG sports remain important to CGF, with opportunity to return in future editions,\" she said.The sports programme will include Athletics and Para Athletics (Track & Field), Swimming and Para Swimming, Artistic Gymnastics, Track Cycling and Para Track Cycling, Netball, Weightlifting and Para Powerlifting, Boxing, Judo, Bowls and Para Bowls, and 3x3 Basketball and 3x3 Wheelchair Basketball.",

        "text": "Royal author and former editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair Tina Brown has shredded Meghan Markle to pieces in a no-holds-barred attack in which she analyzed Prince Harry and Meghan's character and their exit from the Royal family and what followed after that. According to Brown, Harry is good at being Prince Harry and is the most talented member of the royal family but he became the sacrificial lamb in Meghan Markle's scheme of things and Meghan is always wrong.Brown said Meghan is a perfectionist but about getting it all wrong. She had the worst judgement in the world and she's flawless at getting it wrong. The attack comes at a time when Meghan and Harry are manoeuvering a lot of things -- their divorce speculations, their new house in Portugal, their individual career path etc. Just before that, a report in the US media called Meghan a dictator in high heels -- citing Meghan's former staff. While all this combined delivered a blow to Meghan's PR, Tina Brown said Meghan has a lot of people, she asks them their opinion and then doesn't follow it. \"She does what she wants to do. And all of her ideas are total crap, unfortunately.\"The royal author, who was Princess Diana's biographer and the author of the Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor -- The Truth and the Turmoil, decribed Prince Harry as the naive persone who does not know the ways of the world -- a person who has probably not ever booked a table in a restaurant. \"The army was great for him, and he was extremely good and competent in there. That really helped turn him into a real person.\"Since his marriage to Meghan, Harry has been the lamb to the slaughter. When Harry met Meghan, he was terribly impressed by her, the savvy Hollywood wheeler-dealer. \"He was terribly impressed by Meghan. He thought that she knew all, she persuaded him that she was the savvy Hollywood wheeler-dealer who could come in and make them stars and all the rest of it. And he just sort of blindly followed her like a child, really.\"But Harry has a road to come back as he would always be Prince Harry, Brown said. Being Harsh to Meghan, she said she's kind of run out of road. Both of them are, however, addicted to drama, Brown said .",

She had the worst judgement and though she has people whom she asks for advice, she does not listen to those and does what she thinks right and that is inevitably always wrong.

        "title": "Return Of Luxe Craftsmanship",
        "text": "In recent years, the fashion industry has seen a notable resurgence of craftsmanship in the luxury sector. This return to artisanal traditions highlights a growing appreciation for the artistry, dedication, and heritage embedded in fashion\u2019s finest creations. Fast fashion, while accessible and affordable, often comes with significant ethical and environmental costs. Consumers are becoming conscious of these downsides. They are seeking clothes with aesthetic appeal, ethical integrity and longevity. Enter the renewed focus on craftsmanship in the fashion industry. Meaningful Fashion\u201cTimeless artistry is precious. It is indeed a fragile and intricate process \u2014 the weaving of Banarasi fabric, which demands patience and dedication. With our artisans, we focus on authenticity and the skill that goes into creating the craft. There's a push for a significant level of speed, yet the collections show how we devote time and thought to each piece,\u201d says Khushi Shah, owner of Shanti Banaras.For luxury fashion houses, the return to craftsmanship is more than a reactionary move. It is a reclamation of the heritage. Craftsman-ship, after all, is what has long set luxury fashion apart from the fast fashion world. These brands have always been synonymous with meticulous attention to detail, quality fabrics, and timeless designs. Consumers are seeking more from their wardrobes \u2014 durability, and authenticity. Luxury houses are refocusing on ancient craftsmanship and their roots.Archana Jaju, owner, Archana Jaju says that they use old techniques like hand embroidery, Kalam-kari, and Zardozi in creating their designs. \u201cAll these methods not only become a means of storytelling in each product but also symbolize the rich cultural heritage of India. Details and patterns and how they come together are not merely aesthetic choices but reflections of olden traditions, and so each garment is a bridge between the past and the present,\" says Archana.Handcrafted vs Mass ProductionOne of the driving forces behind this shift is the desire for uniqueness. In a market saturated with identical, machine-made garments, handcrafted pieces represent something special. Every stitch, fold, and detail tells a story of human hands and techniques passed down through generations, and of the cultural traditions that inspire fashion's finest creations. \u201cBanarasi handloom weaving is the core of our designs. Through generations of weavers from Varanasi, each piece that we make is a testament to this rich legacy. Storytelling within our collections comes through in the intricacies of motifs and patterns, each of which holds cultural significance and makes our contemporary pieces part of a tradition spanning centuries,\u201d says Khushi.This return to artisanal craftsmanship can be seen in the revival of techniques such as hand embroidery, tailoring, and textile creation. Intricate beading, once reserved for haute couture, is making its way back into collections, offering consumers the chance to wear something genuinely unique. Brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci, among others, are increasingly leaning on their ateliers and skilled artisans to create one-of-a-kind pieces that stand in stark contrast to the ubiquity of fast fashion.Sustainability & CraftsmanshipAnother key factor driving this renewed focus on craftsmanship is the growing emphasis on sustainability in fashion. Fast fashion industry\u2019s negative environmental impact has been under scrutiny. In contrast, the artisanal approach encourages slower, more mindful production, often using higher quality, sustainably sourced materials that result in garments with longer life spans.\u201cThis craft allows the wearer to wear creations that might be passed down for generations. Handwoven fabrics and natural fibres breathe life into clothes meant to last decades. These pieces aren\u2019t just a fashion item; they\u2019re a part of family heirlooms sewn together with the quality-of-care mass-produced goods cannot. All of this leads to slow fashion, waste reduction, and intimacy with what one wears,\u201d adds Khushi. By embracing craftsmanship, fashion houses are creating garments meant to be treasured and worn for years, not just for a single season. This shift represents a broader trend towards slow fashion \u2014 a movement that prioritizes quality, sustainability, and the ethical treatment of workers.Behind the ScenesAt the heart of this shift are the artisans whose skills are now being championed and celebrated. Historically, these craftsmen and craftswomen have often remained in the shadows, with little recognition for their contributions to the industry. As the demand for handcrafted pieces grows, so too does the visibility of the artisans behind them.\u201cCraftsmanship will always be at the heart of luxury fashion. Though technology may bring efficiency, the soul in luxury is human touch and attention to detail. The customers will be targeting handcrafted pieces that they will see as authentic and connected; thus, there will be a stay...",

        "title": "Bollywood actresses expand brand with big-ticket Telugu films",
        "text": "After a break, it looks like Bollywood actresses are having a good time in Tollywood by being part of some big-ticket movies to expand their brand equity. Top league actress Deepika Padukone showcased her acting prowess in \u2018Kalki 2898 AD,\u2019 and held on her own, despite the presence of legends like Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan. She is going to hog more limelight in 'Kalki sequel' as well since the sci-fi thriller revolves around her and a divine child. Her colleague Kiara Advani is romancing Ram Charan in \u2018Game Changer,\u2019 while Mrunal Thakur proved her acting mettle in films like \u2018Sita Ramam\u2019 and \u2018Hi Nanna\u2019. However,Janhvi Kapoor turned out to be find of the season and created a lot of buzz with her maiden Telugu film \u2018Devara\u2019 opposite Jr NTR and also signed up another film with Ram Charan in a big film being directed by Buchi Babu Sana. \u201cWe felt that Janhvi Kapoor would be apt for this female lead role in our film with a big star Ram Charan. Even director Buchi Babu felt the same since he has etched a significant role. In fact, Ram Charan and Janvhi pairing would be a refreshing jodi on big screen,\u2019 says ace producer Ravi Shankar Yellamanchilli.Similarly, Raveena Tandon is in talks to do a pivotal role in Telugu film 'Jatadhara', while Norah Fatehi has done a key role in her Telugu film \u2018Matka\u2019 with Varun Tej and would be showcasing a new avatar. \u201cIt is true that some Bollywood actresses are headlining Telugu films these days, and they come as a breath of fresh air,\u201d says producer Vishnu Vardhan Induri, who brought in Kangana Ranaut for \u2018Thalaavi\u2019 and Vidya Balan for \u2018NTR Kathanayakudu\u201d.\u201cIt all depends on the massive scale and reach of their pet projects. If they are looking for a pan-India appeal, a top-rung Hindi actress would be a big value addition. For instance, if I am watching a Malayalam film, I would watch it with more interest, if I find a familiar Telugu actor in it. Hence, to make North viewers own our movies, Telugu filmmakers are signing up Hindi actresses. Their popularity is bound to give a fillip to our big-ticket movies,\u201d he adds. However, young director Hanu Raghuvapudi introduced B-town diva Mrunal Thakur in his Telugu blockbuster \u2018Sita Ramam\u2019 since he was looking for a girl who fits into the role of a princess. \u201cI was looking for a gorgeous looking girl who is also a good performer, so I found Mrunal Thakur ideal for the role. She matched strides with ace performer Dulquer Salmaan and proved my choice right with a sterling performance. I am quite happy that she is doing more Telugu films now,\u201d says director Hanu Raghavapudi who introduced non-Telugu girls like Lavanya Tripathi and Mehreen Pirzada in his movies like \u2018Andala Rakshasi\u2019 and \u2018Krishnagadi Veera Prema Gaadha\u2019 respectively. On strict demands put up by few Bollywood divas like traveling with their 7 to 8 member team like chef, trainer along with stylist and designer, producer A M Ratham, explains, \u201c'We have to be transparent while making agreements with them. If both actor-producers follow the terms, there will be no issues. More Bollywood actresses will come to town in the days to come, since Telugu films have turned multilingual.\"",

Dennis Quaid, who starred in a recent movie as Republican icon Ronald Reagan, spoke at a Trump rally in California.\"I'm here to tell you that it's time to pick a side,\" Quaid said to applause.Other Trump supporters from the entertainment world include musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, and wrestler Hulk Hogan, who spoke at this summer's Republican National Convention.HELPING OR HURTING?Will Garner, Quaid or any other movie star make a difference?Celebrity appearances do amplify messages about voting, said Christian Grose, a political science professor and academic director at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute.If a non-famous person knocks on a door, it affects only that voter. When a celebrity does, it generates media coverage and social media posts that reach beyond that home, Grose said.Whether that translates into higher turnout depends on the celebrity and the circumstances.Megastars such as Oprah Winfrey can make a meaningful impact. Winfrey's 2007 endorsement of Barack Obama was credited with driving 1 million votes during the Democratic primary.And pop megastar Taylor Swift stimulated thousands of new voter registrations with a nonpartisan call for people to register in 2023, according to the nonprofit group Vote.org.This September, Swift went a step further and endorsed Harris via an Instagram post, which has now received more than 11 million likes.While the Harris campaign welcomed Swift's support, it may not turn out to be a blessing, according to Mark Harvey, author of \"Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy,\" published in 2018.Harvey and other researchers surveyed 1,000 people in August, before Swift's endorsement. Half were shown a photo of Swift with a generic message urging people to vote and half were shown the same image urging votes for Democrats.In the study, the singer was most influential with undecided voters who were Swift fans. Swifties who saw the general message reported a high likelihood of heading to the polls. The intent to vote declined, however, among the Swift fans who saw the singer calling for ballots for Democrats.\"I think there are a lot people who don't want to mix their entertainment with their politics,\" said Harvey, an associate professor at the University of Saint Mary in Kansas.And outside of the elite sphere of the biggest celebrities, studies suggest celebrity endorsements have \"no effect to marginal effect\" on turnout, Grose said.Still, it is possible that the presidential race, and some races for the U.S. Congress could be decided by hundreds or thousands of votes.\"I wouldn't put it up there as the most critical part of the campaign,\" Grose said, \"but you certainly can mobilize people with enthusiasm and excitement and a little bit of Hollywood pizzazz showing up in places you wouldn't expect.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Australia batter Steve Smith said that Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne \"hated\" him at the top order and wanted him to return back to his original batting position - No. 4 - but he is happy to bat wherever the team wants him to. Australia head coach Andrew McDonald confirmed last week that he and captain Pat Cummins have decided to shift Smith back to No. 4 batting spot in Test cricket following a brief stint at the opening role.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Smith stated that he was asked by McDonald to tell his preferred batting position to which he replied 'four' but he never requested the management to put him back in the middle order.\"I got asked where I'd prefer to bat, and I said four. I didn't ask (to move) though. I also said I'm happy batting wherever. I'm not really too fussed. I got asked where my preference would be, and I said four. I saw a few things last week saying that I've requested to bat at four. That wasn't the case. I said I'm happy to bat wherever you'd like me to bat but, yeah, four would be my ideal position,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted Smith as saying.He added that his teammates Labuschagne and Khawaja in particular were not happy to see him bat in the top order and with all-rounder Cameron Green being ruled out of the India Test series, it became evident to shift him back to No. 4.\"Obviously there's a spot there now with Greeny (Cameron Green) out. And I think just conversations we had after New Zealand with particularly Marnus and Uzi, they hated me up top, to be honest. They wanted me behind them. They just like the...they call it security behind them, in a way. They were pretty strong on me not batting there. So that was a big part of it. And then obviously, I've got a decent record at four,\" he added.On his brief opening stint, Smith feels that he would have excelled if given more opportunities. \"It was good fun having a crack at something new, batting up top. I still feel like I could do a job there for sure. It was a pretty small sample size. But I've done pretty well at four for a number of years now. I feel like it's probably where I can have my best input for this team at the moment.\"After replacing retired David Warner as Khawaja's opening partner, Smith scored 171 runs at an average of 28.50 in four Tests. His numbers were not that bad as no opener averaged more than 32 after four Tests.\"Honestly, I'm not that fussed. I said it when I took that job, I'm not really fussed where I bat. The conversations I had with the other guys, they didn't like it at all. They wanted some security, I suppose, behind them, where I've done really well for a number of years, and I can understand that as well. So it is what it is and I'm not going to be opening this summer. That's it,\" Smith said.The 35-year-old feels Nic Maddison is one of the potential candidates, along with Cameron Bancroft and others, to fill the void created after Warner's departure. \"There's a few really good candidates, guys, that have done really well the last few years. (Cameron) Bancroft and the usual suspects that have been talked about. Maddo I think is also another really good candidate. He's had a good couple of years. If you're looking for someone similar to a Davey replacement, he gets after the ball and can score really quickly,\" Smith said.\"So he's someone who probably hasn't been spoken about a great deal from all you guys in the last little bit, but I think he's someone that could definitely play test cricket and have a similar impact to what Davey sort of had at the top, the way he plays. So plenty of options. We'll wait and see,\" he added.--IANSab/bc(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The idea that a society\u2019s well-being is influenced by its economic institutions dates back to Adam Smith. This year, the Economics Nobel was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (AJR) for their research demonstrating the link between economic and societal institutions and the level of prosperity. By institutions, the laureates refer to the broad set of rules and norms that govern the economic behaviour of businesses and society or a nation.\n\nAn example of the impact of institutional differences can be seen in the high income disparity between Nogales, Arizona, US, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, despite sharing the same geography, climate, and culture across the US-Mexico border. A similar contrast exists between South Korea and North Korea. These obvious intra-community inequality is explained by AJR in terms of differences in their political and economic institutional framework.\n\nAn example of a successful social institution is the Marwari community. Despite operating within the same geographical area with common economic and political institutions as other Indian communities, the Marwaris have achieved remarkable economic prosperity.\n\nTrust-based credit\n\nA key factor for this lies in their informal institutional framework, which enabled them to leverage trade credit effectively. Trust is the cornerstone of trade credit. Intra-community extension of trade credit relied on extended family ties and relationship, acquaintances, and referrals by respected and distinguished business and community figures.\n\nThis trust-based credit network helped them in establishing and expanding their businesses when banking was absent or inaccessible. Such familial business relationships not only provide credit but extend advice and strategic partnerships. It minimises credit risks and maximise opportunities.\n\nHistorically, trust in B2B credit relationships was reinforced by a strong social and business stigma against default and bankruptcy. Within tightly-knit communities, the fear of reputational damages and social boycotts \u2014 such as avoiding marriage alliances with bankrupt families \u2014 created strong pressure to honour financial commitments. These factors acted as powerful deterrents to defaults.\n\nWith changing social values and weakened societal bonds, and events like demonetisation and the Covid-19 pandemic, the trade credit ecosystem has been disrupted, eroding the willingness to honour financial commitments. Intense competition and the loosening of close-knit social ties have diminished the effectiveness of fear of reputational damages leading to widespread delays and defaults. These undermine payment culture - once key to business prosperity.\n\nBusinesses thrive on reputation, which is deeply tied to credit discipline. To operationalise this, real-time tracking of payment defaults and delays, along with the digital dissemination of this information to stakeholders, can foster a trade credit ecosystem.\n\nThe writer is former DGM, SIDBI",

        "text": "Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE. The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year. Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain. By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.\"I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today,\" Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.\"There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level,\" the Portuguese boss added.On Monday, Hilal took the lead on 26 minutes, when former Newcastle United and Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic played in Lodi down the left, and the ex-Atletico Madrid full-back drilled a low shot past Khalid Essa in the Al Ain goal.However, Hernan Crespo's side drew level six minutes before half-time, Morocco international Soufiane Rahimi sliding home a cross. Rahimi was the star of Al Ain's Asian Champions League success last season, finishing top scorer and named player of the tournament.In first-half stoppage-time, Hilal seemed to take the contest away from their UAE rivals. First, Joao Cancelo, a summer signing from Manchester City, crossed for Milinkovic-Savic to head home unmarked from six years. Moments later, reigning Asian Player of the Year Al Dawsari raced cleared of the Al Ain defence, skipped around the onrushing Essa and curled home superbly on the angle.Al Ain reduced the deficit just after the hour, through substitute Mateo Sanabria, only for Al Dawsari to flick home his second of the night from a Milinkovic-Savic centre. Minutes later, Rahimi notched his double as a see-saw clash took another swing. Al Dawsari then restored Hilal's two-goal advantage with a sublime strike from range.Not long into 12 minutes of the allotted injury-time, and with Hilal reduced to 10 men after defender Ali Al Bulaihi was sent off for an intentional handball, Rahimi won and converted a penalty to secure his hat-trick and give Al Ain hope, but the Saudi champions hung on to claim the win.Neymar had little time to truly impact the game, although he did flash wide an effort in the dying moments of normal time. Hilal sit top of the Western region group, with three victories from three while Al Ain have picked up a solitary point.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Lidia Thorpe, an Independent Australian senator, has accused King Charles of committing genocide of Indigenous people and shouted, \"You're not my king.\" The 51-year-old interrupted King Charles's parliamentary reception on Monday, saying, \"You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people.\" A video of Ms Thorpe's remarks before she was whisked away by security personnel went viral on social media.Who is Lidia Thorpe?Born in 1973 in Carlton, in the state of Victoria, Lidia Thorpe belongs to the Gunnai, Gunditjmara, and Djab Wurrung peoples and has been a prominent figure in politics and advocacy for Aboriginal causes.She has a Diploma in Community Development from Swinburne University of Technology and a graduate certificate in public sector management. Ms Thorpe is known for her strong opposition to monarchy and advocacy for Indigenous rights.Lidia Thorpe's political careerLidia Thorpe was first elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly from the Northcote seat in a 2017 by-election. She received over 45 percent primary votes. In December 2018, she lost her seat to Labour candidate Kat Theophanous.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In 2020, Victorian Greens members preselected Lidia Thorpe for the federal Senate seat, which fell vacant after the resignation of Richard Di Natale. Her election to the Senate also made her the first Aboriginal woman to represent Victoria in the Senate. She is also the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian from the Greens.After her re-election in May 2022, the Greens party room elected Lidia Thorpe as the party's deputy leader in the Senate. She quit the Greens in February 2023 after the party threw its weight behind the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum, a reform Ms Thorpe and some of her supporters did not approve of, The Guardian reported.Why did Lidia Thorpe confront King Charles?After her outburst at King Charles, Lidia Thorpe was escorted out of the venue. While the parliamentary reception continued, she later told the BBC that her goal was to send \"a clear message\" to Charles, stressing that \"to be sovereign you have to be of the land. He is not of this land.\"What are Lidia Thorpe's views on the British monarchy?Lidia Thorpe has long been critical of the British monarchy, calling King Charles \"not the legitimate sovereign of these lands\" and accusing the institution of committing genocide against Indigenous Australians.\"How can he stand up there and say he's the King of our country - he's stolen so much wealth from our people and from our land and he needs to give that back. And he needs to entertain a conversation for a peace treaty in this country,\" she told the BBC.She advocates for a treaty between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to address historical wrongs. Ms Thorpe believes that moving towards a republic through a treaty process can help resolve \"unfinished business.\"She has been involved in Indigenous activism for many years, even before entering politics. She has campaigned for justice system reform, environmental issues, and Indigenous land rights. Lidia Thorpe's activism is deeply rooted in her upbringing. \"I had no choice in being influenced by black activists and the black struggle of my people...I was born into it and I don't know anything else,\" she said in 2022.Lidia Thorpe has a history of high-profile protests. In 2020, during her swearing-in ceremony as a senator, she raised a black power salute while wearing a traditional possum-skin cloak and holding an Aboriginal message stick. The stick bore 441 marks to symbolise Aboriginal deaths in custody following a royal commission in 1991. In 2022, after being re-elected, she referred to the late Queen Elizabeth II as \"the colonising Her Majesty\" during her oath, for which she was required to repeat the correct wording.",

Cheer from Miami's Stadium and the Chiefs' Unbeaten StreakOn that day, Travis was playing for the Kansas City Chiefs in Santa Clara, California, against the San Francisco 49ers while the pop star performed the third and final show of her Miami run on 20 October. The Chiefs beat the 49ers, retaining their record-breaking win streak.A Sweet Tradition of Altered LyricsAlthough Taylor never mentioned the name Travis while performing, she gave a gesture that undoubtedly acknowledged his success. Whenever Travis came out to watch her performances earlier, she changed the lyrics of the song \"Karma\" to include a funny twist: \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me.\" The change in lyrics becomes a sweet tradition whenever he comes out to support her at a concert.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest\u2014 JustJared (@JustJared) Show of Support Despite His AbsenceInterestingly, while Travis was off on Sunday, Taylor still performed those modified lyrics, which will showcase her relationship with him and excitement over the win for the team. This subtle tribute was not only about her love for Travis but also the bond they share for each other amidst a distance as far apart as between the sun and the moon. Such a moment was undoubtedly missed by no one in the concert who attended her. It showed her love for him and her passion for her craft.The Mystique of the RelationshipIt's quite apparent that with the Chiefs' streak this season, Taylor is cheering for them in her own way all mixed into her career and personal life for the sake of engagement with her public.

        "text": "Actor Jennifer Garner had a warning for a crowd of \"Moms for Harris\" gathered at a tearoom in Tucson, Arizona: Be prepared to see more Hollywood stars visiting your state to talk about the November 5 election.\"Jessica Alba, Kerry Washington - my colleagues and friends - will be here tomorrow. We're all just going to barnstorm you and drive you nuts,\" Garner said with a smile.\"I'm sure everything is a nightmare. You don't even want to turn on the TV,\" Garner said to laughter. \"That being said, it really is that important.\"The \"Alias\" star was acknowledging the text messages, TV ads, canvassing and other efforts in one of the seven battleground states that will decide whether Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump becomes the next US president.Celebrity endorsers such as Garner are part of the down-to-the-wire blitz to mobilize voters ahead of Election Day on November 5. A week after her Arizona stop, Garner stumped for Vice President Harris in Pennsylvania and had plans to visit Nevada.When stars want to campaign, political strategists urge them to visit places where they have a personal connection and to talk about issues they have worked on. They also are pairing them with political heavyweights.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In Garner's case, she joined former policy adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice, and the actor talked about how her parents met in Arizona. A board member for Save the Children, Garner touted Harris' support for child tax credits and higher pay for child-care workers.Julia Roberts, meanwhile, visited her home state of Georgia and was introduced by former state Representative Stacey Abrams.Actor Jane Fonda, an advocate for action on climate change, knocked on doors in Michigan to tout Harris and other \"climate champions.\" The Oscar winner and longtime political activist said she had never campaigned door-to-door for a president before.\"I'm doing everything I can,\" Fonda told one potential voter. \"We have to get them elected.\"While Hollywood has a reputation for being liberal, some stars are working to turn out the vote for former President Trump. Dennis Quaid, who starred in a recent movie as Republican icon Ronald Reagan, spoke at a Trump rally in California.\"I'm here to tell you that it's time to pick a side,\" Quaid said to applause.Other Trump supporters from the entertainment world include musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, and wrestler Hulk Hogan, who spoke at this summer's Republican National Convention.HELPING OR HURTING?Will Garner, Quaid or any other movie star make a difference?Celebrity appearances do amplify messages about voting, said Christian Grose, a political science professor and academic director at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute.If a non-famous person knocks on a door, it affects only that voter. When a celebrity does, it generates media coverage and social media posts that reach beyond that home, Grose said.Whether that translates into higher turnout depends on the celebrity and the circumstances.Megastars such as Oprah Winfrey can make a meaningful impact. Winfrey's 2007 endorsement of Barack Obama was credited with driving 1 million votes during the Democratic primary.And pop megastar Taylor Swift stimulated thousands of new voter registrations with a nonpartisan call for people to register in 2023, according to the nonprofit group Vote.org.This September, Swift went a step further and endorsed Harris via an Instagram post, which has now received more than 11 million likes.While the Harris campaign welcomed Swift's support, it may not turn out to be a blessing, according to Mark Harvey, author of \"Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy,\" published in 2018.Harvey and other researchers surveyed 1,000 people in August, before Swift's endorsement. Half were shown a photo of Swift with a generic message urging people to vote and half were shown the same image urging votes for Democrats.In the study, the singer was most influential with undecided voters who were Swift fans. Swifties who saw the general message reported a high likelihood of heading to the polls. The intent to vote declined, however, among the Swift fans who saw the singer calling for ballots for Democrats.\"I think there are a lot people who don't want to mix their entertainment with their politics,\" said Harvey, an associate professor at the University of Saint Mary in Kansas.And outside of the elite sphere of the biggest celebrities, studies suggest celebrity endorsements have \"no effect to marginal effect\" on turnout, Grose said.Still, it is possible that the presidential race, and some races for the U.S. Congress could be decided by hundreds or thousands of votes.\"I wouldn't put it up there as the most critical part of the campaign,\" Grose said, \"but you certainly can mobilize people with enthusiasm and excitement and a little bit of Hollywood pizzazz showing up in places you wouldn't expect.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Australia batter Steve Smith said that Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne \"hated\" him at the top order and wanted him to return back to his original batting position - No. 4 - but he is happy to bat wherever the team wants him to. Australia head coach Andrew McDonald confirmed last week that he and captain Pat Cummins have decided to shift Smith back to No. 4 batting spot in Test cricket following a brief stint at the opening role.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Smith stated that he was asked by McDonald to tell his preferred batting position to which he replied 'four' but he never requested the management to put him back in the middle order.\"I got asked where I'd prefer to bat, and I said four. I didn't ask (to move) though. I also said I'm happy batting wherever. I'm not really too fussed. I got asked where my preference would be, and I said four. I saw a few things last week saying that I've requested to bat at four. That wasn't the case. I said I'm happy to bat wherever you'd like me to bat but, yeah, four would be my ideal position,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted Smith as saying.He added that his teammates Labuschagne and Khawaja in particular were not happy to see him bat in the top order and with all-rounder Cameron Green being ruled out of the India Test series, it became evident to shift him back to No. 4.\"Obviously there's a spot there now with Greeny (Cameron Green) out. And I think just conversations we had after New Zealand with particularly Marnus and Uzi, they hated me up top, to be honest. They wanted me behind them. They just like the...they call it security behind them, in a way. They were pretty strong on me not batting there. So that was a big part of it. And then obviously, I've got a decent record at four,\" he added.On his brief opening stint, Smith feels that he would have excelled if given more opportunities. \"It was good fun having a crack at something new, batting up top. I still feel like I could do a job there for sure. It was a pretty small sample size. But I've done pretty well at four for a number of years now. I feel like it's probably where I can have my best input for this team at the moment.\"After replacing retired David Warner as Khawaja's opening partner, Smith scored 171 runs at an average of 28.50 in four Tests. His numbers were not that bad as no opener averaged more than 32 after four Tests.\"Honestly, I'm not that fussed. I said it when I took that job, I'm not really fussed where I bat. The conversations I had with the other guys, they didn't like it at all. They wanted some security, I suppose, behind them, where I've done really well for a number of years, and I can understand that as well. So it is what it is and I'm not going to be opening this summer. That's it,\" Smith said.The 35-year-old feels Nic Maddison is one of the potential candidates, along with Cameron Bancroft and others, to fill the void created after Warner's departure. \"There's a few really good candidates, guys, that have done really well the last few years. (Cameron) Bancroft and the usual suspects that have been talked about. Maddo I think is also another really good candidate. He's had a good couple of years. If you're looking for someone similar to a Davey replacement, he gets after the ball and can score really quickly,\" Smith said.\"So he's someone who probably hasn't been spoken about a great deal from all you guys in the last little bit, but I think he's someone that could definitely play test cricket and have a similar impact to what Davey sort of had at the top, the way he plays. So plenty of options. We'll wait and see,\" he added.--IANSab/bc(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The idea that a society\u2019s well-being is influenced by its economic institutions dates back to Adam Smith. This year, the Economics Nobel was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (AJR) for their research demonstrating the link between economic and societal institutions and the level of prosperity. By institutions, the laureates refer to the broad set of rules and norms that govern the economic behaviour of businesses and society or a nation.\n\nAn example of the impact of institutional differences can be seen in the high income disparity between Nogales, Arizona, US, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, despite sharing the same geography, climate, and culture across the US-Mexico border. A similar contrast exists between South Korea and North Korea. These obvious intra-community inequality is explained by AJR in terms of differences in their political and economic institutional framework.\n\nAn example of a successful social institution is the Marwari community. Despite operating within the same geographical area with common economic and political institutions as other Indian communities, the Marwaris have achieved remarkable economic prosperity.\n\nTrust-based credit\n\nA key factor for this lies in their informal institutional framework, which enabled them to leverage trade credit effectively. Trust is the cornerstone of trade credit. Intra-community extension of trade credit relied on extended family ties and relationship, acquaintances, and referrals by respected and distinguished business and community figures.\n\nThis trust-based credit network helped them in establishing and expanding their businesses when banking was absent or inaccessible. Such familial business relationships not only provide credit but extend advice and strategic partnerships. It minimises credit risks and maximise opportunities.\n\nHistorically, trust in B2B credit relationships was reinforced by a strong social and business stigma against default and bankruptcy. Within tightly-knit communities, the fear of reputational damages and social boycotts \u2014 such as avoiding marriage alliances with bankrupt families \u2014 created strong pressure to honour financial commitments. These factors acted as powerful deterrents to defaults.\n\nWith changing social values and weakened societal bonds, and events like demonetisation and the Covid-19 pandemic, the trade credit ecosystem has been disrupted, eroding the willingness to honour financial commitments. Intense competition and the loosening of close-knit social ties have diminished the effectiveness of fear of reputational damages leading to widespread delays and defaults. These undermine payment culture - once key to business prosperity.\n\nBusinesses thrive on reputation, which is deeply tied to credit discipline. To operationalise this, real-time tracking of payment defaults and delays, along with the digital dissemination of this information to stakeholders, can foster a trade credit ecosystem.\n\nThe writer is former DGM, SIDBI",

        "text": "Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE. The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year. Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain. By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.\"I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today,\" Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.\"There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level,\" the Portuguese boss added.On Monday, Hilal took the lead on 26 minutes, when former Newcastle United and Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic played in Lodi down the left, and the ex-Atletico Madrid full-back drilled a low shot past Khalid Essa in the Al Ain goal.However, Hernan Crespo's side drew level six minutes before half-time, Morocco international Soufiane Rahimi sliding home a cross. Rahimi was the star of Al Ain's Asian Champions League success last season, finishing top scorer and named player of the tournament.In first-half stoppage-time, Hilal seemed to take the contest away from their UAE rivals. First, Joao Cancelo, a summer signing from Manchester City, crossed for Milinkovic-Savic to head home unmarked from six years. Moments later, reigning Asian Player of the Year Al Dawsari raced cleared of the Al Ain defence, skipped around the onrushing Essa and curled home superbly on the angle.Al Ain reduced the deficit just after the hour, through substitute Mateo Sanabria, only for Al Dawsari to flick home his second of the night from a Milinkovic-Savic centre. Minutes later, Rahimi notched his double as a see-saw clash took another swing. Al Dawsari then restored Hilal's two-goal advantage with a sublime strike from range.Not long into 12 minutes of the allotted injury-time, and with Hilal reduced to 10 men after defender Ali Al Bulaihi was sent off for an intentional handball, Rahimi won and converted a penalty to secure his hat-trick and give Al Ain hope, but the Saudi champions hung on to claim the win.Neymar had little time to truly impact the game, although he did flash wide an effort in the dying moments of normal time.

        "title": "Who Is Lidia Thorpe, Australian Senator Who Heckled King Charles",
        "text": "Lidia Thorpe, an Independent Australian senator, has accused King Charles of committing genocide of Indigenous people and shouted, \"You're not my king.\" The 51-year-old interrupted King Charles's parliamentary reception on Monday, saying, \"You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people.\" A video of Ms Thorpe's remarks before she was whisked away by security personnel went viral on social media.Who is Lidia Thorpe?Born in 1973 in Carlton, in the state of Victoria, Lidia Thorpe belongs to the Gunnai, Gunditjmara, and Djab Wurrung peoples and has been a prominent figure in politics and advocacy for Aboriginal causes.She has a Diploma in Community Development from Swinburne University of Technology and a graduate certificate in public sector management. Ms Thorpe is known for her strong opposition to monarchy and advocacy for Indigenous rights.Lidia Thorpe's political careerLidia Thorpe was first elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly from the Northcote seat in a 2017 by-election. She received over 45 percent primary votes. In December 2018, she lost her seat to Labour candidate Kat Theophanous.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In 2020, Victorian Greens members preselected Lidia Thorpe for the federal Senate seat, which fell vacant after the resignation of Richard Di Natale. Her election to the Senate also made her the first Aboriginal woman to represent Victoria in the Senate. She is also the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian from the Greens.After her re-election in May 2022, the Greens party room elected Lidia Thorpe as the party's deputy leader in the Senate. She quit the Greens in February 2023 after the party threw its weight behind the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum, a reform Ms Thorpe and some of her supporters did not approve of, The Guardian reported.Why did Lidia Thorpe confront King Charles?After her outburst at King Charles, Lidia Thorpe was escorted out of the venue. While the parliamentary reception continued, she later told the BBC that her goal was to send \"a clear message\" to Charles, stressing that \"to be sovereign you have to be of the land. He is not of this land.\"What are Lidia Thorpe's views on the British monarchy?Lidia Thorpe has long been critical of the British monarchy, calling King Charles \"not the legitimate sovereign of these lands\" and accusing the institution of committing genocide against Indigenous Australians.\"How can he stand up there and say he's the King of our country - he's stolen so much wealth from our people and from our land and he needs to give that back. And he needs to entertain a conversation for a peace treaty in this country,\" she told the BBC.She advocates for a treaty between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to address historical wrongs. Ms Thorpe believes that moving towards a republic through a treaty process can help resolve \"unfinished business.\"She has been involved in Indigenous activism for many years, even before entering politics. She has campaigned for justice system reform, environmental issues, and Indigenous land rights. Lidia Thorpe's activism is deeply rooted in her upbringing. \"I had no choice in being influenced by black activists and the black struggle of my people...I was born into it and I don't know anything else,\" she said in 2022.Lidia Thorpe has a history of high-profile protests. In 2020, during her swearing-in ceremony as a senator, she raised a black power salute while wearing a traditional possum-skin cloak and holding an Aboriginal message stick. The stick bore 441 marks to symbolise Aboriginal deaths in custody following a royal commission in 1991. In 2022, after being re-elected, she referred to the late Queen Elizabeth II as \"the colonising Her Majesty\" during her oath, for which she was required to repeat the correct wording.",

Aisa laga ke yeh kya hua? (The wound was deep, but I couldn\u2019t believe it had happened. I was thinking, \u2018What just happened?\u2019).\"According to the Indian Express, Govinda recounted the shocking incident, which took place early in the morning, around 4:45-5:00 a.m., while he was preparing to leave for a show in Kolkata.

While he acknowledges the love and support from many, he also recognizes the presence of competition and jealousy.

In a recent interview, Ananya revealed that she gets her \u201cnazar\u201d taken out every week to ward off negativity. \u201cI take out my nazar every week. The help at my house does the mirchi thing. You know the Mirchi thing? So, if it smells a lot, it means you have nazar. If the mirchi burns a lot, you have nazar. I don't know the science behind it,\u201d Ananya said in a video shared on Netflix India's YouTube channel. The actress also mentioned that her mother, Bhavana Panday, often puts \u201ckaala teeka\u201d behind her ear to shield her from the evil eye. She said, \u201cMy mom put two black dots behind my ear before I came here. Everyone thinks I don't shower or have something dirty behind my ear, but my mom keeps putting it again and again.\u201d(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Last month, Netflix dropped the trailer for CTRL. The story follows Ananya Panday's character Nella and her seemingly perfect life. She stumbles onto Control Your Life, an AI-based program. Her life changes after logging into the app. Nella's relationship with her boyfriend Joe (Vihaan Samat) comes to an end after he cheats on her but everyone blames her. In resentment, Nella says to CTRL, \u201cI just want to erase my ex.\u201d While Nella wants to take away her suffering, the app has different ideas. Soon after, Joe's presence in the real world starts fading along with his social media blueprint. After a phone conversation, Nella learns that Joe has gone missing. \"But isn't that what you wanted?\" an AI-generated character asks Nella in the last few seconds of the trailer.Sharing her thoughts on playing Nella, Ananya Panday said in a statement, \u201cMy character Nella is like any of us. She's caught up in a world dominated by technology and social media. CTRL explores how we navigate the fine line between our online presence and who we are in real life. Working with Vikram sir and Nikhil sir has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait for you to watch it on Netflix and uncover the connection between Nella and Allen,\u201d reported News18.

        "text": "The media is buzzing with tales of a whopping Rs 50 crore heist from a retired IAS officer\u2019s high residence in the tranquil hills of Uttarakhand. What\u2019s drawing attention is not just the theft, but also the great question\u2014how did such a hefty sum of money get there in the first place? The babu, once a powerful figure in a nearby state government and still considered very close to the Chief Minister there, has now become the focus of suspicion on social media, where rumours are spreading quickly. What makes this case even more intriguing is the fact that no formal FIR has been lodged, despite the scale of the theft. Some media outlets have meanwhile received notices, we\u2019re hearing. Neither the authorities nor anyone associated with the officer appears prepared to speak out, adding to the mystery. A Lucknow-based daily broke the story, alleging ties to a powerful ex-bureaucrat but not naming any names. As expected, the story has since gone viral, with social media users spreading the word and speculating about the officer\u2019s identity. Many people question why the authorities are so tight-lipped. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the officer\u2019s wife was emotionally affected by the occurrence, adding another layer of personal drama to an already sensational case. What\u2019s really going on here? Some argue that this is yet another example of how certain public officials stash illicit wealth in cash to avoid detection by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Cash is harder to trace, making it a convenient way to fly under the radar of anti-corruption bodies. If the stolen money is found, experts warn that any attempt by the officer to reclaim it could trigger a new legal firestorm under the Prevention of Corruption Act. For now, the silence around the case only seems to intensify public curiosity. The lack of an official statement, whispers about who the officer might be, and the staggering amount of money involved have everyone waiting for more details to surface. The case may even impact the prevailing tensions between the Centre and the state chief minister. Watch this space for updates. Delhi DMs get more powers, ruffle feathers The Delhi government\u2019s recent move to form \u2018working groups\u2019 of District Magistrates (DMs) to assess and improve the functioning of various departments has raised eyebrows, especially among senior babus. These groups are tasked with reviewing departmental operations and submitting actionable recommendations by October 5. They\u2019ve also been empowered to hold meetings with concerned officials\u2014which is the tricky part. Many in the administration are questioning the practicality of junior DMs overseeing and advising more experienced senior officials. Some see this as an unusual situation, with younger IAS officers from recent batches being asked to recommend improvements to departments headed by officials with decades of experience. This bold move comes at a time of transition for Delhi, with newly appointed Chief Minister Atishi stepping into the shoes of Arvind Kejriwal. Known for her focus on education reforms, Atishi now faces the challenge of managing the city\u2019s broader governance issues. This initiative is likely part of her broader strategy to improve inter-departmental synergy and bring fresh perspectives to long-standing administrative processes. A senior official explained that this initiative aligns with Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena\u2019s vision of making DMs more active and dynamic. Take that with a pinch of salt! The order coincides with a renewed push for cohesion between Atishi, AAP ministers, and senior babus, aiming for better coordination across key departments like transport, health, and education. Whether this approach will foster the intended inter-departmental synergy or cause further friction remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly a shake-up in Delhi\u2019s administrative corridors. Why merging DIPAM and DPE makes sense The government is once again considering the merger of two important departments: the Department of Investment & Public Asset Management (DIPAM) and the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). Both play crucial roles in managing Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and if all goes according to plan, they could soon be working together under the Ministry of Finance. The idea behind the merger is to create more synergy and liquidity for the NDA government\u2019s ambitious investment projects, particularly as it prepares for major reforms aimed at boosting growth and employment. This proposal isn\u2019t entirely new. It was first floated during the NaMo 2.0 era but didn\u2019t materialize for various reasons. The project was revived again in the list of \u201c100 days programme\u201d conceived by the Modi sarkar before the May 2024 Lok Sabha polls. So why merge these two departments? DIPAM deals with investment and disinvestment in CPSUs, while DPE focuses on the management and performance of these enterprises. When a CPSU is up for closure or divestment, DIPAM initiates the process, and DPE handles the final closure. A merger could streamline this process and make things more efficient. It seems the government is banking on this move to bring much-needed agility to its public sector investment strategy ahead of 2024. By Dilip Cherian",

One of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, Winslet feels women should be able to \"stand with pride\" and look back on the things that they have achieved in life without coming across as arrogant, reports femalefirst.co.uk. She said: \"The pride I feel is enormous in the things that I have been able to do. And to be able to say that I'm proud of myself matters, because I think that that's something else I hope to put out there \u2014 that women should be able to stand with pride and acknowledge that and not feel like they are bigging themselves up. \"It's a self-acceptance and an awareness of doing something that is challenging and that feels impactful and takes effort like you wouldn't believe.\" Last month, the actress spoke about the different standards set for male and female actors.

        "text": "Los Angeles: Hollywood star Anne Hathaway is set to return to the coming-of-age comedy franchise film Princess Diaries with its third instalment. The development on Princess Diaries 3 is moving at a brisk pace with Adele Lim signing on to direct, reports Variety. \"As a diehard fan of the original Princess Diaries, I'm beyond excited to be a part of bringing the third iteration of this beloved franchise to life,\" Lim said in a statement. \"We look forward to celebrating its core tenants of female power, joy and mentorship with audiences worldwide.\" As per Variety, the film is produced by Debra Martin Chase, who originated the film franchise starring Hathaway as Mia Thermopolis, the down-to-earth teen-turned-queen of the fictional kingdom of Genovia, and Julie Andrews as her regal grandmother. Hathaway will also produce under her Somewhere Pictures banner. Naia Cucukov, Lim's producing partner at 100 Tigers, will executive produce the film alongside Melissa Stack. Princess Diaries 3 has been in development since 2022 and, last year, Hathaway shared an update about the long-awaited movie's progress in an interview with V Magazine. \"We're in a good place,\" Hathaway teased. \"There's nothing to announce yet. But we're in a good place,\" she had said. Flora Greeson is writing the script. Plot details haven't been confirmed, but the threequel is expected to continue the story in 2001's The Princess Diaries and the 2004 sequel Royal Engagement rather than rebooting the series. Lim is best known for penning the mega-hit movie Crazy Rich Asians, which grossed $174 million domestically for Warner Bros.",

The trailer of the film was released a few days ago, and by the looks of it, \u2018Jigra\u2019 seems to be inspired from the Russell Crowe-starrer \u2018The Next Three Days\u2019 which itself was inspired from the French film \u2018Pour elle\u2019 by Fred Cavaye. While in \u2018The Next Three Days\u2019 Russell Crowe takes extreme measures to break his wife out of prison after she is wrongfully convicted for the murder of her boss, in \u2018Jigra\u2019 the lead characters are of a brother and a sister. Produced under the banner of Dharma Productions and presented by Viacom18 Studios and Eternal Sunshine Productions, \u2018Jigra is set to debut in theatres on October 11.",

        "text": "Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL), a Central Public Sector Enterprise, has officially been classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) by the State Bank of India (SBI), the telecom firm confirmed in an exchange filing. The bank added that MTNL now owed a total of Rs 325.53 crore as of September 30. This declaration follows a similar downgrade by Punjab National Bank (PNB) on September 9 and other public sector banks.In a letter addressing MTNL, SBI wrote, \u201cYou have been enjoying credit facilities in the nature of a Term Loan from the bank, with the Term Loan Account Number 367266589**. The instalment and interest payments for this account became overdue as of June 30, 2024, due to non-payment. As 90 days have passed, the account is categorised as an NPA (sub-standard) effective September 28, 2024.\u201dAs of September 30, 2024, the total outstanding debt of MTNL to SBI stands at Rs 325.52 crore, with rs 281.62 crore classified as \u2018overdue\u2019. SBI has called for immediate payment of this overdue sum to regularise the account and cautioned that failure to comply would lead to the imposition of a penal interest rate on the outstanding balance.Following SBI\u2019s classification of MTNL as an NPA, other banks such as Union Bank of India and Bank of India have already categorised the company\u2019s debt in the same manner. It is anticipated that additional lenders, including Punjab & Sind Bank and UCO Bank, may soon follow suit.MTNL\u2019s mounting debtMTNL\u2019s financial situation has been deteriorating, with total debt reported at Rs 31,944.51 crore as of August 30, 2024. At the beginning of August, MTNL informed the stock exchanges that it had defaulted on bank loan payments worth Rs 422.05 crore. This includes payment of Rs 155.76 crore on debt raised from Union Bank of India, Rs 40.33 crore from Bank of India, Rs 40.01 crore from Punjab & Sind Bank, Rs 41.54 crore from Punjab National Bank, and Rs 4.04 crore from UCO Bank.ALSO READ: Union Bank freezes accounts of telecom firm MTNL over non-payment of duesSBI seeks details on MTNL\u2019s land monetisation planAdditionally, SBI is seeking details on MTNL\u2019s land monetisation plan, which had previously been submitted with detailed year-wise cash flows. The bank asked for the current status of this plan, especially concerning the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to develop a 13.88-acre land parcel on Pankha Road, New Delhi, for residential and commercial purposes. SBI specifically inquired whether the proceeds from this project would be used to repay outstanding loans.MTNL has identified 158 properties in prime locations across Mumbai and Delhi for outright sale, with an additional 137 vacant properties available for rent \u2013 103 in Mumbai and 34 in Delhi.SBI has cautioned that if MTNL fails to meet its payment obligations within the timeframe, the bank will have no choice but to initiate legal proceedings to recover the full loan amount along with interest, and may proceed with \u2018enforcement of securities\u2019 without further reference to MTNL..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Heritage Circles or Hoardings ?",
        "text": "This year\u2019s Dasara illumination is mediocre but the Circles are worse. Mysuru has turned into \u2018flexuru\u2019, thanks to the Government\u2019s decision to hand over key Circles to private players. What used to be iconic landmarks are now little more than giant hoardings. Interestingly, according to sources, most of these companies were not interested to take over the Circles as they did not have enough time to create aesthetic designs but agreed to sponsor so as to not \u2018upset\u2019 the administration. But here\u2019s the burning question: If the Government is intent on selling off our public spaces to the highest bidder, then why did they bother increasing the Dasara budget? And they did this while creatively sidestepping public tenders by invoking the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act. For those not in the know, the KTPP Act allows the Government to bypass open bidding when it claims it \u2018ran out of time.\u2019 How convenient. So, we\u2019re left wondering \u2014 was the whole Dasara preparation process conveniently delayed just to activate this loophole and handpick the \u2018right\u2019 contractors? Here\u2019s where it gets truly puzzling: The Dasara budget ballooned from Rs. 29 crore last year to Rs. 40 crore this year. That\u2019s a whopping Rs. 11 crore more, and yet, somehow, they still felt the need to hand over our beautiful Circles to private companies. Now, instead of historic monuments, we\u2019re greeted by enormous sponsor logos and political banners. The District Administration appears to have forgotten that Mysuru is not just any city; it is a heritage city, where even a traffic Circle has historical significance, whether in its name, its design, or its location, which is meant to reflect the unique character of the city. But now, under a barrage of gaudy lights, sponsor logos and political banners, these once-distinguished Circles are telling a different story \u2014 a story of administrative neglect, lack of imagination, and unbridled greed. It is truly disheartening that the first impression tourists arriving from Bengaluru by road receive is no longer one of beauty or history, but of consumer products and political personalities. This unregulated give-away of public spaces without the establishment of any proper guidelines has led to what can only be described as a visual assault. Seeking sponsorship to improve public spaces isn\u2019t inherently a bad idea. Done right, it can be a win-win situation \u2014 enhancing the city\u2019s beauty while also attracting investment. But the way it\u2019s been executed here is anything but right. To begin with, the administration did not give sponsors enough time to plan and design their campaign. Next, if public spaces like Circles or medians are to be leased to sponsors, there must be clear and enforceable ground rules, which we don\u2019t have. Other countries have stringent design approval committees for such purposes, often comprising experts from renowned advertising agencies or design institutions. Why can\u2019t Mysuru do the same? We could have a \u2018Dasara Public Space Design\u2019 Approval Committee which MUST comprise people from reputed design firms and schools such as the National Institute of Design or Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. Such a Committee would ensure that sponsors adhere to basic aesthetic principles, like limiting the sponsor\u2019s logo to no more than 20 percent of the space and ensuring that the advertisement blends harmoniously with the theme of Dasara and surrounding architecture. Additionally, it could enforce rules that protect the physical structure of these heritage sites, ensuring that nothing is permanently damaged. What we have now, however, is a chaotic free-for-all, where anyone with a banner can turn our historical Circles into personal billboards. For years now, the city\u2019s once-pristine Circles have been turned into medieval town squares, plastered with garish posters announcing everything from elections to festivals to, morbidly, even deaths. But MCC does nothing to stop this vandalism. Way back in 2006, the MCC proposed to declare K.R. Circle, Five-Lights Circle, Ramaswamy Circle etc., as \u2018hoarding-free\u2019 zones and ban commercial hoardings within 100 metres of heritage sites. What happened? Nothing. In 2009, MCC started an \u2018illegal hoarding drive\u2019, what happened? Nothing. In 2011, MCC Commissioner K.S. Raikar made a grand announcement: \u201cWe held discussions with the City Police Commissioner and cases will be filed against those violating the MCC directive on flex boards.\u201d What happened? Nothing. Earlier this year, in 2024 the MCC Commissioner said that they have issued notices and asked the Zonal Commissioners to clear out the flex\u2026 what happened? Nothing. Today, flex posters not only remain all around heritage Circles and buildings, but they have also now become part of the structure and with that part of Dasara too! What a sad reflection of incompetence, of a District Administration, of a Royal Heritage City, one that hosts a world-famous festival! Unless the MCC really flexes its muscles against flex, our city will become \u2018Flex City\u2019 and unless they make rules for sponsors of Circles during Dasara, then Historic Circles will end up as \u2018Billboards.\u2019 At this rate of callousness, myopic vision and greed, Mysore Palace may be the next big Dasara hoarding with sponsors\u2019 logo adorning the Palace domes. We are doomed. e-mail: [email protected]",

        "text": "RFK Jr's wife actor Cheryl Hines is reportedly embarrassed by the barrage of cheating scandals against her husband including the episode of reporter Olivia Nuzzi. PEOPLE reported that things are rocky between Cheryl Hines and Kennedy Jr and they have barely spoken. 'She's embarrassed because he got caught,\" a source told PEOPLE. Hines has been in Europe since shortly after the news broke.Olivia Nuzzi was placed on leave after she acknowledged that her relationship with Kennedy Jr (she didn't name him) turned personal. Kennedy camp vehemently rejected it and asserted that he only met Nuzzi once during the interview last year. But the two camps did not let things be. Kennedy camp claimed Olivia Nuzzi bombarded him with her nudes while Nuzzi camp claimed Kennedy Jr grabbed her arm during the interview in a very creepy way. Nuzzi accused her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza of playing a role in leaking the allegations and Lizza denied those. In a court filing, Nuzzi said Lizza explicitly threatened to make public personal information about her to destroy her life, career and reputation. Amid this controversy, three more women claimed that they have been romantically involved with Kennedy Jr over the past year. According to reports, these three women came in contact with Kennedy Jr through Children's Health Defense -- the advocacy group founded by Kennedy. \u201cThere are a number of women in the \u2018health freedom\u2019 movement who thought of themselves as Bobby\u2019s only one, and I\u2019m quite sure they are angry and shocked to find out they weren\u2019t,\u201d a source told Mediaite. \u201cAfter talking to some of these women, I think what he does is just love bombs them. He makes them feel important, even tells them he loves them, and so they all feel special and wanted.\u201dKennedy's spokesperson did not comment on the fresh allegations. As Kennedy is facing storms one after another, Hines has been in Europe attending several shows during Milan Fashion Week. But there are rumors that Hines is seething in anger and contemplating divorce from Kennedy Jr who is the most prominent aide of Donald Trump -- this election season.",

        "title": "The frustrated pursuit of happiness",
        "text": "Pain and disappointment writ large in his face, Sunil, 40, sat down to narrate his story at a lodge on Anna Salai in Chennai. Hailing from Malappuram, he began driving an autorickshaw at his hometown after completing Class X. Since he was struggling to make ends meet, and inspired by tales of people from his district going abroad, he began dreaming of a better life in a foreign country. He was directed to an agent at Palavakkam in Chennai. In the very first meeting, the agent claimed that he had successfully sent many abroad for jobs, and Sunil was quickly convinced. He paid \u20b940,000 to him in processing fees for a job in Israel. However, thereafter, there was no progress at all for months. Sunil met the agent frequently to push his case. Every time, the agent collected more money, and altogether Sunil ended up paying \u20b97 lakh, which he mopped up by mortgaging his house, pledging his wife\u2019s jewellery, and borrowing from relatives. The agent claimed he had tied up with a tour operator in Israel for sending 46 men and women en masse as tourists. Tickets for onward and return journeys and hotel rooms were booked in their names. The plan was that they would travel like tourists and on reaching a famous church in Jerusalem, would disappear amid the crowd. Later, they would stay in the houses of relatives or friends who had already settled down as migrant workers and seek jobs. A plan fraught with danger and rejection, but Sunil went ahead because he was desperate to \u201cgo abroad\u201d. However, the visa was rejected. Neither could he leave Chennai nor was his money repaid. The agent advised him to stay back and wait for another opportunity, promising this time a job in Canada. He demanded a further \u20b98 lakh, and Sunil coughed it up too, borrowing from every one he knew. Forged ID cards On May 1, the agent sent Sunil forged ID cards and documents identifying him as a senior scientist in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) attending a conference of scientists in Canada. This time the visa came through, but as Sunil tried to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the authorities came to know that there was no such conference happening and stopped him. \u201cMy dreams are gone. I had to come back and begged the agent to return the money. Instead of returning the money, he threatened me. I am staying at a cheap lodge for five months now, and I\u2019ve been starving. If I go back home, all the people who lent me money will be at my door. So I am hiding in Chennai. My aged father is down with a terminal illness and my wife is unable to bear this life any more.\u201d Later, investigation revealed that his agent was running an office as a registered bus travel operator. His modus operandi was the same: sending people abroad with forged documents and ID cards as scientists from prestigious research institutions. But Sunil is far from alone in his predicament. The police say there has been a huge increase in the number of overseas job-seekers being cheated by unscrupulous recruitment agents. Once Gulf countries were the most sought-after, but the pattern of migration by unskilled and semi-skilled aspirants indicates that eastern European nations, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, Lithuania and Armenia, are popular. South Korea, Israel, and Canada have also come into the picture. Recently, it came to light that job-seekers from several districts, especially from South India, were recruited through illegal manpower agencies and sent to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar on tourist visas. Victims are then held captive in Cambodia or Laos for work in harsh and restrictive conditions. They are forced to commit online cyber frauds, which is known as \u201ccyber slavery\u201d. These agents do not have a licence from the Ministry of External Affairs, which is mandatory to be involved in any recruitment for work abroad. Typically, they target job-seekers through advertisements posted on social media platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. In 2023, G. Mohan, an engineer from Erode, saw an advertisement on Facebook. Out of curiosity, he clicked the link and entered all details sought. Immediately, he received a call from an agent offering a job in Canada and even permanent residentship. They first collected \u20b950,000 for processing papers, and subsequently, he had to pay \u20b94.5 lakh. Later, they called him, informing there was some delay in getting a visa owing to the India-Canada diplomatic row. \u201cThey asked me to go to any European country and work for some time there. It would be easier to migrate to Canada then. They told me that they would arrange a visa from the Slovakian embassy. Days went by, but there was no progress towards travelling to any country or obtaining a visa. They said they would get a visa for another country and demanded more money. The money I paid has still not been returned,\u201d he recounted. The police later discovered that Akil, 25, of Ernakulam, and S. Veeraragavan, 29, of Tindivanam, also had similar experiences. Irrespective of whom they approached, the police found that some traits were similar. Tutoring the applicants These unregistered agents run their illegal operation from outlets such as browsing centres, tea shops, or petty shops, while some of them have swanky offices, creating the impression of a travel agency. They also tutored applicants on how to approach visa officers in embassies, besides supplying forged documents to them. They even tutored them on how to seek asylum in a foreign country, if they managed to get there. Many of those who were cheated did not file complaints because they were hoping to get their money back. Then how could the police zero in on this racket? Only if the forgery was detected at the processing stage. In September, last year, Mohammed Irfan Khan of Andhra Pradesh appeared with documents before the visa processing staff in the U.S. Consulate in Chennai and claimed that he was a medical professional and wanted a visa to attend a medical expo. All his documents were found to be fake. In November, Rusheekesh Reddy and Dhivakar Reddy of Andhra Pradesh were caught when they produced fake documents for visa processing for Kallem Sai Ram Reddy. Following this trail, the police found out that all fake certificates were generated at a centre at Villivakkam in Chennai, run by Mohammed Riyas and Mageshwaran since 2019. Thirumurthy, 30, of Thanjavur, was one of the victims rescued by Indian authorities recently. He recounted, \u201cWe paid \u20b94.5 lakh to the middleman who arranged this job for a salary of $2,000 a month. Eight of us were taken to Sihanoukville, Cambodia, by road from Bangkok. Our passports were collected by them. Only after landing at the workplace did we realise that it was a scam. We were detained in wire-fenced buildings. When we refused to do their bidding, they would beat us up and even give electric shocks.\u201d He adds, \u201cOur phone and WhatsApp conversations were scrutinised by them constantly. At last, we managed to send a mail to family members. With the help of a native lawyer, we sought the assistance of the Indian High Commission, and were rescued.\u201d R. Viswanathan, vice-president of the Tamil Association in Cambodia, said that based on a series of complaints from the affected persons, the Indian authorities, with the help of local officials, rescued the workers, and were trying to put an end to the illegal recruitment and confinement camps. Recently, the CB-CID registered nine cases and arrested 10 illegal recruitment agents. Similarly, the Greater Chennai Police, along with the Emigration Department, raided 10 locations, registered nine cases, and arrested five persons who operated without licence. The Emigration Department has also identified certain districts as hotspots where people try to go abroad through illegal means. These include Tiruchi, Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Sivaganga, Madurai, Tiruvannamalai, Perambalur, and Thiruvarur. \u2018File complaints\u2019 Greater Chennai Police Commissioner A. Arun has advised people to be wary of fake advertisements of foreign employment. Anyone who has been cheated by unauthorised companies should file a complaint, he has said. Surender, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Job Racket Wing, says no individual or agency can recruit Indian citizens for overseas employment without a valid licence. \u201cHowever, job aspirants get connected to the agents under the radar. We are working on 60 cases of job rackets.\u201d The Emigration Department advises those seeking jobs overseas to engage only with licensed agents. Licensed agents are required to maintain a bank guarantee with the government, and their operations are monitored and regulated by the offices of Protector of Emigrants (PoE). These agents undergo stringent inspections and document verification before they are licensed. A valid job offer comes along with an employment contract duly signed by the foreign employer, recruitment agent, and the worker. The contract must mention the terms and conditions of the job and the salary and other emoluments. Valid offers must allow the worker to emigrate on the strength of employment or work visa or other similar visas, not on a tourist visa. As per the Emigration Act, 1983, no recruiting agent shall collect from the prospective emigrant service charges of more than \u20b930,000 plus GST (18%) for services, excluding airfare and other charges. A receipt has to be issued. M. Rajkumar, Protector of Emigrants, Chennai, says, \u201cWe have 200-odd licensed agents registered with us. People can see the list of licensed agents on www.emigrate.gov.in and check whether their agents are licensed or not. We have also opened a column called job opportunities as of now for ECR (Emigration Clearance Required) countries. Wherever the licensed agents conduct the interviews, it will be posted here.\u201d He adds that aspirants would be safe when they go through licensed agents. \u201cWhen ECR passport-holders go to ECR countries, we verify everything for them and give them emigration clearance.\u201d Job-seekers can dial the PoE helpline 9042149222 for more information.",

        "text": "As Prince Harry is on a solo trip and rumors of Harry-Meghan divorce are rife, it has now come to be reported that Harry did not spend the night of his 40th birthday with Meghan though he was in the US at that time. While many reports call it the \"latest blow to their marriage\", their friends claim that it was actually a gift from Meghan and the couple are not separating -- they are professionally choosing different paths. Meghan was last seen before Harry's birthday. The Duchess of Sussex reportedly booked the trip for Harry so that he could spend the night of his 40th birthday doing a hike on the Montecito peak -- which is part of the Cold Spring Trail in California. It is near Harry-Meghan's mansion.Soon after Harry's birthday, he started his solo tour which has now been extended by a few days and Harry has scheduled some secret meetings. Reports claimed Harry and Meghan have been staying apart and Harry was found moping around by himself at a local cafe. It was when reports of his longing to be back to the Royal Family emerged. It was reported that Harry was feeling homesick as Meghan was busy with her Hollywood and entrepreneurial projects. Sources close to the couple who emphasize that they are not splitting claimed that the phase of Harry moping is over and now he has immersed himself in work according to his liking. Meghan was supposed to accompany him on his tour to New York but she was unwell. From New York, Harry flew to the UK and it was obvious that Meghan would not accompany him there. From UK, Harry went to Africa for a charity event but now Harry has extended his solo trip. Harry was initially scheduled to be back in California this weekend, UK Express reported. But he has chosen to prolong his solo trip. The Duke will likely head to Johannesburg and Cape Town for \"private time\" with family and friends. Another secret visit is also planned but it has been kept out of his official diary, the report said.",

        "title": "Hamas confirms Yahya Sinwar\u2019s death",
        "text": "Jerusalem: Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar , was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza, and the militant group reiterated its stance that hostages taken from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. \u201cThose prisoners will not return to you before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza,\u201d said Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar's Qatar-based deputy and headed up the grou's delegation during several rounds of cease-fire negotiations mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. In a statement, Hamas heralded Sinwar as a hero who \u201cascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.\u201d The statement appeared to refer to a video the Israeli military circulated of Sinwar\u2019s apparent last moments in which a man sits on a chair in severely damaged building, badly wounded and covered in dust. In the video, the man raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli drone. Sinwar\u2019s killing, in what appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, could shift the dynamics of the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas war began. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran , which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be him, half-buried in rubble and with a gaping wound in his head. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that \u201cour war is not yet ended.\u201d But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar\u2019s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar\u2019s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. \u201cWe are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,\u201d Ronen Neutra, father of the Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra, said in a video statement. \u201cSinwar, who was described as a major obstacle to a deal, is no longer alive.\" Netanyahu was planning to convene a special meeting Friday to discuss hostage negotiations, an Israeli official with knowledge of the negotiations said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the their former enemy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. \u201cWhen U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield \u2014 in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy \u2014 the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.\u201d More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza erupted in October last year, issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. Hezbollah's statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel\u2019s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it would activate an additional reserve brigade to the north of its country to support troops battling in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to \u201cplans prepared in advance\u201d to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced...",

        "title": "Sakshi Malik\u2019s memoir \u2018Witness\u2019: The wrestler sees an unsparing image of herself in her own mirror",
        "text": "\u201cIt is indisputable,\u201d reads a line in the autobiography of an Indian cricket icon co-written by a journalist, \u201cthat my parents were very supportive.\u201d\n\nThere is a reason (auto)biographies of Indian sportspersons are almost uniformly inane \u2013 a reason explained by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and memoirist JR Moehringer in a May 2023 piece in The New Yorker.\n\nMoehringer, whose own coming-of-age story The Tender Bar ranks as a classic of the memoirist\u2019s art, and who has co-written the bestselling autobiographies of tennis legend Andre Agassi, Nike founder Phil Knight, and England\u2019s estranged Prince Harry, recounts a conversation he had with the latter during a pre-writing session that did not end well.\n\nA story, carved from a life\n\nAfter a long discussion with Harry, Moehringer refused the offer to co-write the book. Why? \u201cBecause, I told him, everything you just said is about you. You want the world to know that you did a good job, that you were smart. But, strange as it may seem, a memoir isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s not even the story of your life. It\u2019s a story carved from your life, a particular series of events chosen because they have the greatest resonance for the widest range of people\u2026\u201d\n\nThe art of memoir, encapsulated in six words: A story, carved from a life.\n\nThat is the problem with autobiographies of Indian sportspersons \u2013 they tend, more often than not, to be a highlights reel of their careers as they lived it \u2013 or, often, as they want you to think they lived it. What you get is a one-dimensional portrait \u2013 scorecards and career graphs rendered in prose and wallpapered with a litany of clich\u00e9s; what you don\u2019t get is insight into the living, breathing human being behind those accomplishments; the stories carved from their lives.\n\nThere are exceptions. A Shot At History by Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, co-authored by Rohit Brijnath, is one; the more recent I Have The Streets by India\u2019s ace off-spinner R Ashwin, written with Sidharth Monga, is another. To that sparse canon add Witness, the autobiography of champion wrestler Sakshi Malik co-written with veteran sports journalist Jonathan Selvaraj.\n\nWhen the book hits the shelves, the large-type headlines and the buzz in the social media echo chamber will be about Malik\u2019s first up-close experience of sexual harassment and her ongoing battle to bring BJP politician and former Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to book for the serial sexual abuses he is accused of. And that will be a pity, because there is so much more to Malik\u2019s story as both a champion wrestler and an insurgent fighting injustice.\n\nThe battle against Brij Bhushan and his backers in politics \u2013 and, by extension, against the strong arm of the police force \u2013 bookends the story of Malik as an insecure girl from a small village in Haryana; her early, occasionally risible forays into various sports; her discovery of wrestling as the career she always wanted and never knew it till her wandering footsteps led her to the mat.\n\nThe book is hung on the tick-tock timeline of her life and times, both in the ring and out of it, and it is a story of stark contrasts. There is the self-assured sportsperson juxtaposed with the awkward, unsure woman in the throes of a first, and lasting, love. She is the ace wrestler, proud of the painfully acquired strength of thighs and biceps, but also the woman who hates how those same biceps look when she is forced to wear high fashion. She is the gawky village girl who leans heavily on parental support and encouragement in a rigidly patriarchal environment that frowns on women \u201cdisplaying\u201d themselves in skimpy sports costumes but equally, the mature woman battling the realisation that the love of even the most supportive of parents can be subsumed by the lure of the money their accomplished daughter brings in\u2026\n\nSakshi Malik, the person\n\nMalik\u2019s story is layered; it lends what we know of her life a larger frame and a deeper context. Through the pages of Witness, a Sakshi Malik emerges who is no longer just a champion wrestler, or a leader in an ongoing battle against a political strongman and accused sexual abuser \u2013 she is a human being in the true sense of the word, with all the fears and uncertainties, the faults and the foibles that being human entails.\n\nAnd it is all down to a clear-eyed awareness of her own self, abetted by honesty as unsparing of herself as it is of everyone in her orbit. Thus, if she is open about her parents\u2019 unconditional love turning into unbridled greed as the money begins to pour in, or about the politicking of farmer leader Naresh Tikait who insinuated himself into the wrestlers\u2019 protests for his own ends, or about her disenchantment with what she sees as the self-interest of her comrades-in-arms Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, she is equally forthright about her own early forays into petty theft and, more startlingly, about her deepest insecurities.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Moehringer said in an interview where he discussed the art of the memoir, \u201cin order to tell the truth, you simply cannot avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings. It goes down easier if you are equally unsparing of yourself.\u201d\n\nParts of Witness will hurt. Parents, siblings, former opponents, and present comrades will all find reflections of themselves that they would far rather have hidden from the world \u2013 but there is no part of the book that cuts as deep, and is as unsparing, as the image Malik sees in her own mirror.\n\nIn an early chapter, she talks of the paralysing dread that envelops her before every bout, and about how she has \u201cnever enjoyed the actual act of confrontation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany wrestlers have a little bit of nervousness before their bout starts, which helps them get focused for the contest,\u201d Malik writes. \u201cI have come across contestants who tell me they are excited before a bout. They enjoy that feeling of getting into a fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that. I\u2019ve always been afraid, sometimes almost sick with worry.\u201d\n\nWho knew? As one accustomed to reading, and listening to, sportspersons natter on about \u201cembracing the challenge\u201d, \u201csoaking up the pressure\u201d and suchlike inanities, it came as a refreshing change to read an elite sportsperson \u2013 a practitioner of one of the most physically confrontational of all sports \u2013 talk with such openness about the crippling grip of fear that she had to confront, even before she confronted her opponent on the mat, right through her career.\n\nIf being honest \u2013 with oneself first, and then with the reader \u2013 is hard for sportspersons, it is equally difficult for them to talk in an accessible fashion about the nuances of their sport. And there is a reason for this: in her formative years, the sportsperson practices the mechanics of her sport for countless hours until it becomes part of muscle memory. In the heat of competition, she instinctively does what all that practice has prepared her for. Asking her to relieve a bout, to explain the mechanics of a takedown, is akin to asking a pilot how she flies a plane, or a writer how she organises her material and engages her reader.\n\nHere, again, Malik scores \u2013 a favourite section, one that I went back to after a first read-through of the entire book, is chapter ten where Malik delves into the arcana of \u201cweight cutting\u201d, a phrase that entered the public consciousness thanks to the fiasco of Vinesh Phogat failing, by 100 grams \u2013 one third the weight of an adult human heart \u2013 to qualify for the final of the 50kg wrestling competition in the Paris Olympics.\n\nElsewhere, there are illuminating details about the mechanics of various forms of takedowns, insights into how a wrestler reads and counters an opponent\u2019s strategy \u2013 a wealth of detail, told in accessible form, that made me go back to YouTube videos of her various bouts, including the Rio Olympics bronze medal match in the 58-kg category that made her India\u2019s first woman Olympic medallist in wrestling, with a new awareness and appreciation of the sport.\n\nWe consume sport in boxes \u2013 the playing field, the wrestling ring, the boundaries of our television screens. And yet the real story, unseen by us, lies outside these boundaries, in what ace sportswriter Gary Smith calls \u201cthe psyche of the sporting spirit.\u201d\n\nWriting an energising memoir\n\nThe likes of Andre Agassi, Phil Knight and Prince Harry needed a Moehringer to go outside those boxes, to delve into and unearth the stories hidden behind those medals, the fame, the public persona. Malik finds the ideal amanuensis in Jonathan Selvaraj, a veteran sportswriter who has spent decades covering those sports, including wrestling, that play out in the nearly impenetrable shadow cast by cricket.\n\nOn the evidence of this book, Selvaraj has mastered sprezzatura, the ability to conceal art. Selvaraj brings to the book the art and the craft of a skilled storyteller \u2013 a mastery of narrative arc and of pacing, the ability to focus on what is important, the minute attention to the telling detail. Rather than chisel and sand and buff and polish the story to death, Selvaraj helps Malik embrace the volatility, the insecurities, integral to the human condition.\n\nWhere Selvaraj really excels though is in his ability to step back and let Malik\u2019s natural voice, with which we have become familiar through the many press conferences and interviews she has given in the course of her battle against Brij Bhushan, shine through. It is Selvaraj who writes, but it is Malik we hear.\n\nMalik\u2019s lived experiences and refreshing honesty combine seamlessly with Selvaraj\u2019s self-effacing pen to produce a sports biography that is energising, and compellingly readable.\n\nWitness, Sakshi Malik with Jonathan Selvaraj, Juggernaut.",

The two cases, though separate, have brought attention to growing criminal activities in the region, prompting swift action from local law enforcement.\n\nThe first case involves a 52-year-old mushroom trader from Tanda Rajpur, Palampur. He lodged a complaint against four individuals\u2014two women and two men\u2014accusing them of extortion and blackmail. According to the victim, the incident began when he received a call from a woman in Ram Chowk, Palampur, asking to purchase mushrooms. Upon arriving at her house, he found two women inside. They gave him water, locked the door, and then engaged in obscene acts. Shortly after, two men entered the room, assaulted him, and forcibly filmed an obscene video.\n\nThe victim claimed the group demanded \u20b91.5 lakh, threatening to release the video if he didn\u2019t pay. Terrified, he approached the Palampur police station, where a formal case was registered. Station in-charge Bhupendra Singh Thakur confirmed that an investigation is underway, with the accused currently being tracked by the police.\n\nMeanwhile, in Manali, local police exposed a gang involved in prostitution-related fraud after receiving a complaint from Pradeep Bagati, a resident of Jharkhand. Bagati reported that he was tricked by a woman at the Manali bus stand, who promised him a room at a cheap rate. When he followed her to Aleu, she demanded \u20b92000 for engaging in sexual activity. As soon as he undressed, she took photographs and summoned her accomplices. A second woman and two men then entered, robbing him of \u20b95000 in cash, taking his ATM card, and withdrawing \u20b910,000.\n\nThe gang threatened Bagati, demanding an additional \u20b950,000 to ensure his release. Bagati managed to escape and alerted the Manali police. Acting swiftly, the police arrested the suspects and recovered 12 mobile phones, ATM cards, and cash. The arrested individuals were identified as Vishal from Shimla, Deepak from Chandigarh, and two women from Kullu and Manimajra.\n\nManali police station in-charge Manish Sharma stated that this gang had been operating for over two years, targeting unsuspecting individuals. The gang\u2019s network is now under further investigation, with more arrests likely.\n\nThese two cases underline the growing concern over extortion and organized fraud in Himachal Pradesh, as police intensify efforts to combat such criminal activities.",

        "text": "Vedang Raina and Alia Bhatt's Jigra was released in theatres on October 11. Recently, the actor spoke about the emotionally charged whiplashing scene. The actor who was appreciated for his performance, said, \"The lashing scene was tricky, but Vasan Bala sir gave me some really great advice right before the scene, which made my approach clearer. It was still very hard to put my mind through that. I'm happy that there was appreciation for that scene.\"He also spoke about how transformative the entire Jigra experience has been for him. He said, \"Jigra changed my life way before it was even released. I'm just grateful I was part of this project and got to work alongside some really great minds. I feel blessed to be in this position so early in my career and at such a young age.\"Jigra faced competition from Vicky Aur Vidya Ki Woh Wala Video, starring Rajkummar Rao and Triptii Dimri, which opened with Rs 5 crore and had about 3,500 shows, giving it a slight edge over Alia's film. Notably, Jigra is Alia's only release for 2024. Directed by Vasan Bala, the movie narrates the story of a sister who will go to extreme lengths to protect her brother.On the work front, Vedang Raina made his acting debut with Zoya Akhtar's The Archies.

        "text": "Air pollution is back to haunt the national capital with the onset of winter and early morning and late-night fog. \nOn Saturday, Delhi\u2019s Anand Vihar reported PM 2.5 of 326 and PM 10 levels of 654, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to activate Stage 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan from October 15. GRAP includes measures to control dust, waste management, and ensure vehicular restrictions, with mist-spraying drones to monitor and tackle pollution hotspots.\nThe Delhi government on Monday also imposed a blanket ban on the sale and use of firecrackers till January 1, 2025, in view of the likely deterioration of air quality in the city during the winter.\nTo further understand the effects of the deteriorating air quality, LocalCircles conducted a survey which revealed that 36 per cent Delhi-NCR families have one or more members with sore throat, cough and breathing difficulty/asthma due to rising levels of pollution, while 27 per cent have someone with a runny nose/congestion.\nThe survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. A total of 61 per cent respondents were men while 39 per cent were women.\nThe survey also sought to know the steps Delhiites were taking or planning to take to combat the issue of air pollution. While only 18 per cent citizens of Delhi-NCR said they will use air purifiers to reduce the impact of pollution, a large majority said they would just live with it by increasing the intake of immunity foods and drinks. A total of 22 per cent respondents are planning to travel for some part of the next one month. It is also likely that many have planned travels for Diwali which also allows them to get away from peak pollution days in Delhi-NCR when AQI has touched 1000 in the past.\nYear after year for the last decade, AQI levels in the region have been touching 500-1000 between October 15 and December 1, causing devastating long-term impact on the health of residents and no concrete solutions have been implemented to address this at a structural, policy and enforcement level.\nEmissions from transportation account for approximately 19.2 per cent of Delhi\u2019s air pollution, according to the Centre\u2019s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management in Delhi.\nAnother major contributor to the worsening air quality is stubble burning in neighbouring states. Satellite data on Wednesday reported 99 fire incidents in Punjab, 14 in Haryana, 59 in Uttar Pradesh, and one in Delhi.\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered \u201cgood\u201d, 51 and 100 \u201csatisfactory\u201d, 101 and 200 \u201cmoderate\u201d, 201 and 300 \u201cpoor\u201d, 301 and 400 \u201cvery poor\u201d, and 401 and 500 \u201csevere\u201d.",

Eight were found alive on Wednesday after being reported missing after an avalanche on Sunday, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nAn avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, such as a hill or mountain. Avalanches can be triggered spontaneously, by factors such as increased precipitation or snowpack weakening, or by external means such as humans, other animals, and earthquakes.\n\nPrimarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches have the capability to capture and move ice, rocks, and trees.\n\nAvalanches occur in two general forms, or combinations of slab avalanches made of tightly packed snow, triggered by a collapse of an underlying weak snow layer, and loose snow avalanches made of looser snow.\n\nAfter being set off, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they capture more snow. If an avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air, forming a powder snow avalanche.\n\nThough they appear to share similarities, avalanches are distinct from slush flows, mudslides, rock slides, and serac collapses. They are also different from large-scale movements of ice.\n\nAvalanches can happen in any mountain range that has an enduring snowpack. They are most frequent in winter or spring but may occur at any time of the year. In mountainous areas, avalanches are among the most serious natural hazards to life and property, so great efforts are made in avalanche control.",

        "text": "When Prince Harry and Meghan shifted to California leaving their royal duties, they were not very welcome there. Four years down the line, their Montecito neighbors are not very happy about the royals settling at their place. A similar situation is brewing for Harry and Meghan as they are purchasing a house in Comporta, Portugal. The residents are expressing frustration that the coastline is now becoming exclusive to wealthy property owners. UK Express reported that restricting access to public beaches was illegal in Portugal until recently but new regulations now allow local councils and government agencies to designate certain beaches as \"private\". \"Worst thing to happen to the Portuguese coast, typical greed situation. Taking land and property from locals who have been enjoying it for years,\" one wrote. \"I am very upset by this massive piece of Portuguese land destroyed for the rich, removed from the average local that had been creating memories in this place for generations and generations,\" another said. \"I have been going to this place for years, camped there several times and, because of this company, this is no longer possible,\" another said. Reports said Harry and Meghan chose Portugal to be close to Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank who own a home at the Costa Terra Gold and Ocean Club in Melides. Harry and Meghan will not be shifting out of the US and their Portuguese resort will be more like a holiday home for them. Reports said the resort is on a picturesque and unexplored beach in the Algarve and has become a popular holiday destination. Once completed, the resort is set to have 300 homes, with prices starting at a whopping \u00a33.6million.The news has put speculations over Harry-Meghan divorce to sleep following their individual engagements. When Harry was on his solo trip to UK and then South Africa, Meghan made solo appearances back home triggering speculations that they are already living separately though their friends said they are only separating their professional paths and their relationship is rock-solid.",

The British monarch arrived in Sydney late on Friday evening for their 9-day Australia tour.Later, Charles will address the New South Wales state parliament and visit the Admiralty House for a series of private meetings with top officials.Royal watchers will have another opportunity to see the king on Monday when he arrives in Canberra with Queen Camilla for the busiest portion of his streamlined schedule.In the past, visiting British royals would undertake extended tours, drawing large crowds of excited, flag-waving supporters. However, due to the king's fragile health, much of the usual pomp and grandeur has been scaled back this time.Aside from a community barbecue in Sydney and an event at the city's iconic opera house, large public gatherings will be limited.On Sunday, a small group of protesters gathered near a church, calling for Australia to \"decolonise.\"While Australians are slightly in favour of maintaining the monarchy, the enthusiasm is far from what it was in 2011 when thousands turned out to see Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, wave to the crowds.",

        "text": "After a disaster like \u2018Jigra\u2019 featuring Alia Bhatt, some Telugu distributors are wary about distributing another Bollywood actress film in the two Telugu states. \u201cWomen centric movies are not fetching even bare minimums openings and it would be difficult for Kangana to release her film \u2018Emergency\u2019 without much fuss,\u201d says a distributor. \u201cProbably, she has to tour Hyderabad and promote her political thriller by hosting big events, only then it could create some buzz in trade circles,\" he adds. Earlier, Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut's much-anticipated film \u2018Emergency\u2019 has cleared a significant hurdle as it recently received certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The film, which portrays the controversial political period of the 1975 Emergency in India, has been under scrutiny for its depiction of historical events and figures, particularly former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who is portrayed by Ranaut. Of course, Bollywood teams are reportedly in discussions with Telugu distributors but no agreements have been finalized for the film to hit theaters. \u201cKangana's recent films \"Chandramukhi 2\" and \"Dhakkad,\" had underperformed in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In all likelihood \"Emergency\" would be released on a commission basis. In which, the film would release in theatres. Then all the collections are garnered and given back to makers, after deducting theatre rentals and 8 to 10% commission,\u201d he informs. He believes the film would attract more viewers in Telangana, particularly in the Nizam region, compared to Andhra Pradesh, where Hindi films generally receive less patronage.",

Earlier, comedy kings like Brahmanandam, M S Narayana, and Vennela Kishore managed to draw more applause than heroes in some of their movies. Now, it is the turn of young comedian Satya to make his presence felt in his latest release 'Mathu Vadalara 2'. \"No doubt, Satya stole the show with his comic one-liners and unique mannerisms and has become the flavor of the season,\" adds the source. He claims that Satya would be roped in by other producers since few distributors are insisting for his comedy and few ongoing films could have his comedy track to cash in on his popularity. \"He will be doing comedy in another big star movie and discussions are underway, \" he adds. He also claims that probably by now, few producers would have reached him to cast him as a \u2018hero\u2019 in the films since the laugh-riot has set cash registers ringing in two Telugu states. \u201cHe may soon turn a protagonist and is surely grabbing plum comic roles too,\u201d he concludes.",

        "text": "Riddhima Kapoor recently made her on-screen debut on the Netflix show Fabulous Lives Vs Bollywood Wives after staying away from the camera for years. While promoting the show, she appeared in an interview with YouTuber Siddharth Kanan, where she opened up about a deeply personal chapter in her life after Rishi Kapoor's death. She revealed how each member in the family dealt with it in their own way and never showed their emotions to each other. Reminiscing about that dark phase in their lives Riddhima said, \"When my dad passed away we never showed emotions to each other. We used to go to separate rooms and cry like take it all out and then come and then just be normal or act normal, but it has got us really close.\" Ridhhima further added that even though her family does not express their grief, but \"deep down\" they always carry the pain in their hearts. Earlier in another interview, Riddhima had also shared that ever since Rishi Kapoor's death, Ranbir, she and their mother also look after each other more than before. Rishi Kapoor was diagnosed with leukaemia and spent a lot of time in New York for his treatment. He came back to India in 2019. The veteran actor died on April 30, 2020.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Coming back to Riddhima's work front, both Ranbir and Neetu Kapoor showed her their support on her first on-screen stint. Ranbir also hyped his sister up and forewarned the other members of the cast to not take her lightly. \"Riddhima, beyond the politeness and you know, the softness, she's a fighter. So the OG wives and the new wives, they're definitely in for a shock. Because I would tell them don't take Riddhima lightly,\" he said.He also showered love and praises on her, and showed her his unwavering. \"I don't tell her this often, but Riddhima, I love you deeply. You are somebody I look up to. Even when you were not doing a show like this, I was always rooting for you. And I'm gonna root more for you,\" he concluded.&nbsp",

The streets buzzed with excitement as women prepared for this special day dedicated to the well-being and long life of their husbands. Various organisations and local communities came together to organise programmes and gatherings for the cultural celebrations. Women dressed in vibrant, traditional attire were the centre of attraction of the festival. Their hands were adorned with intricate mehndi designs, symbolising love and devotion.\n\nFrom dawn, the women observed a day-long fast, refraining from food and water. This fast is a key ritual of Karva Chauth and is kept until the moon appears in the night sky. The day began with Sargi, a pre-dawn meal given by mothers-in-law to their daughters-in-law, symbolising the bond between them. As the day progressed, groups of women gathered in homes or community centres, sharing stories and songs related to the significance of the festival. They passed the Karva (a clay pot) around in a circle, singing traditional songs of marital bliss.\n\nKarwa Chauth Moon Rise Timings In MP: Moon Will Be First Seen In Bhopal Followed By Indore; Check...\n\nIn the evening, as twilight fell, the anticipation grew. Women sat in beautifully decorated spaces, their thalis prepared with diya, rice and sweets, waiting for the moon to rise. Once the moon appeared, they gathered on rooftops or terraces, gazing at it through a sieve, symbolising the filtering of negativity. They then offered water to the moon, seeking its blessings before breaking their fast by sipping water and eating a sweet from their husband's hands. Throughout the city, the sounds of laughter, music and blessings filled the air, as families gathered to celebrate the bond of love and the strength of relationships, making the night of Karva Chauth a truly magical and heart-warming experience.\n\nOne unique programme took place in the Pashupatinath Porwal Social Group. They celebrated the Karva Chauth festival at The Meera Garden, Rajiv Gandhi Square, Indore. Over 250 people participated in the event and passed a message to observe No Car Day once a week. The males of the group were seen holding placards and they also took a pledge to keep the environment safe.\n\nMaharashtra: NCP-Ajit Pawar Faction Appoints Ashish Damle As Chairman Of New Brahmin Economic Development Body\n\nMumbai: Doctor Dupes Colleague Of \u20b934.97 Lakh In Medical Camp Scam\n\nMumbai: Peon Arrested For Sexually Assaulting Minor At School Premises\n\nMaharashtra: ACB Files 26 Disproportionate Assets Cases Involving \u20b929 Crore\n\nFollow us on",

Snakes have flexible jaws, which are not rigidly attached like in many other animals. This flexibility allows them to stretch their jaws wide open to accommodate prey much larger than their head. In the case of an egg, the snake carefully manoeuvres it into its mouth and gradually swallows it whole. Once inside, special muscles in the snake's bodywork to break the egg's shell, after which the contents are digested, and the shell is later regurgitated. This incredible ability showcases the snake's evolutionary adaptations for survival.''\n\nAnother said, ''That's a remarkable sight!

The cast, Bhavana Pandey, Maheep Kapoor, Neelam Kothari Soni, Seema Kiran Sajdeh, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, Shalini Passi, and Kalyani Saha Chawla recently came on The Great Indian Kapil Show to promote their show, and shared funny anecdotes with Kapil. Bhavana Pandey shared a particularly hilarious incident that happened during a Karwa Chauth function at Anil Kapoor's house, which left everyone in splits. Recalling the event, she said, \"We go to Sunita Kapoor's house, Anil Kapoor's wife. So all of us go there and break the fast together. We have to go to the terrace to see the moon. So all of us go together. So we got the channi (strainer) and placed the diyas there. I told Chunky to hold his position because we were waiting to eat.\" Bhavana then complained how Chunky Pandey's old habits landed her in an awkward situation. \"Chunky has this old habit. I prepared everything and the moment I turned around he was gone. I don't know whether he got a call or something else happened, and the channi landed straight on the face of Boney Kapoor! I instantly turned around and yelled, 'Chunky, where are you?' He came back and took his position. Then I did the ritual properly,\" she concluded. This made everyone burst into laughter, leading Kapil to a witty comeback. He joked that Boney Kapoor must have been wondering why Sridevi (his late wife) looked so different that day.

        "text": "Seema Sajdeh confirmed her new relationship on the third season of Fabulous Lives Vs Bollywood Wives with ex-fiance Vikram Ahuja. While the internet is buzzing with congratulatory messages, her son Nirvaan Khan had a mature response to it. On the last episode of the show, Seema spoke to Nirvaan about moving on in life after her much-talked about divorce from actor Sohail Khan and also the new man in her life, who she is currently dating. She also asked him if he held any grudges against her. \"Everyone is talking about me moving out because I have moved on in my life. Do you have a grudge on me for moving on in my life?\" she asked. In the last episode of the show, Seema moved back to Bandra after Nirvaan insisted her to. \"No, absolutely not. Mumma, at some point, you will move on. At some point, you will need a companion or a partner or something or the other and that's acceptable,\" Nirvaan reassured her. Seema also asked him next if he approved of Vikram. Nirvaan asked, \"Is he older than you?\" to which Seema replied, \"Yeah, a year older to me.\" This got Nirvaan's nod of approval for his mom's relationship. \"Yeah, then that's fine. I am okay with him. If you are happy, we are happy for you. How long will you be in that stressful environment? It's stressful for me, you, and Yohan. Be happier.\"Seema got candid about Vikram on the show and shared how she feels about him. \"He knows me like no one else. If anybody knows us in town, they all know the story of Seema and Vikram,\" she said. Adding some trivia about her relationship, Seema added, \"Vikram is the one that I was engaged to before I met Sohail, and here we are. Life comes full circle.\" &nbsp",
