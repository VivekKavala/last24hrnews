        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 21 (IANS) Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar says the Mahayuti-led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) remains unified with a clear and mutually-agreed seat sharing formula, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Congress, Shiv Sena(UBT) and NCP(SP) is facing internal squabbles over constituency allocation.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with IANS, Shelar claims that the Mahayuti government will come back to power after the elections. Here are some excerpts:\n\nIANS: Although the BJP has announced the first list, talks for seat sharing among the Mahayuti are not yet concluded. Is it due to differences? The MVA is also struggling to arrive at an understanding. What is your take?\n\nShelar: There is remarkable unity and discipline within the Mahayuti alliance. We have finalised our seat-sharing proportions and accordingly our list of candidates has also been declared. There is also clarity that the elections will be contested under the leadership of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. However, within the MVA, there is no consensus, no balanced seat-sharing arrangement and all their allied partners are embroiled in internal debates. Either before arriving at a consensus over seat sharing or immediately after the results, the MVA is sure to be in tatters after November 23. The MVA\u2019s expiry date is arriving soon.\n\nIANS: How confident are you about the Mahayuti forming the government once again in Maharashtra?\n\nShelar: Absolutely confident. Every election is different in terms of the prevailing issues, subjects, developments and the overall ecosystem. We, as the Mahayuti, are confident of winning the elections as we have only focussed on working for the development of the state. We have decided to go out to the people of Maharashtra with the list of development works and initiatives undertaken.\n\nIANS: Do you fear fake narratives will impact the results like during the Lok Sabha elections?\n\nShelar: Fake narratives were spread during the Lok Sabha elections which had impacted us. Today, once again, conspiracies to spread lies and fake narratives are being made. It is our job to stop the fake narrative and to speak in the interest of the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray alleged that 1,000-odd acres of land has been transferred in the name of Adani. I challenged him to give evidence to prove his statement. If Aaditya Thackeray has the courage, he should come forward for an open discussion and counter our questions. He is behaving like a spokesperson of urban Naxals and deliberately trying to spread lies, disturbance and unrest and create an image that there is anarchy in the state.\n\nIANS: You have been targeting the MVA over \u2018Vote Jihad\u2019. What is your comment?\n\nShelar: The MVA leaders are resorting to doing politics of appeasement. We have always believed in \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019. Our Hindutva also revolves around development of all elements of society. We believe in taking everybody together in our march of progress. Why should Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya get worried about it? The Mahayuti government is working towards ensuring homes for the poor in Dharavi. But they are making attempts to incite Dharavikars and spread fear in the minds of the poor Marathi, Muslim, Dalits making them believe that they will never get their rightful homes in Dharavi.\n\nIANS: What is the Mahayuti\u2019s agenda for the forthcoming Assembly elections?\n\nShelar: Our agenda is development. The Mahayuti government believes in delivering on its promises. The government launched the Coastal Road, the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg, the Mumbai-Delhi corridor, bullet train and much more. Through schemes like the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, the government started transferring money in the bank accounts of women, made ST travel free, deposited money in the bank accounts of senior citizens, and gave waivers to farmers over electricity bills. Today, the common citizen is concerned about the development of his city, state and the nation and we believe in favour of development.\n\n(Sanjay Jog can be reached at sanjay.j@ians.in)",

The clash led to the tragic death of Ram Gopal Mishra, a 22-year-old who succumbed to gunshot injuries.Following the incident, the area descended into chaos, with mobs engaging in widespread vandalism and arson, targeting homes, shops, showrooms, hospitals, and vehicles.Local authorities have responded by registering multiple FIRs against both unidentified rioters and some named individuals. As of now, the police have detained 55 suspects and increased security measures in the town, which has a mixed population.This marks the third major communal incident in Bahraich, following previous outbreaks in 2009 and 2014.In October 2009, violence erupted in the same area after rumors circulated about objectionable materials being thrown at a religious site, leading to arson and destruction. A similar incident occurred in January 2014, triggered by disputes over loud DJ music, which also affected the Nanpara area.",

        "text": "The Cyber Crime Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police has busted a six-member gang reportedly involved in running an online share trading scam and duping a person of \u20b914 crore. \n\nAdditional Director General of Police, Cyber Crime, Sandeep Mittal, said the online trading scam involved \u201cfraudulent individuals misleading victims into investing in fake share trading opportunities, promising high returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cCybercriminals, forming a group via WhatsApp, have created share investment apps, misleading people into believing they can earn up to 500 times their investment by trading shares online. They have circulated false information suggesting that many people are making significant profits through these apps, thereby cheating the public under the guise of online share trading,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\nThe police said the complainant in this case was contacted via WhatsApp by a member of the gang in April, introducing himself as someone who represented an institution called Black Rock Asset Management Business School. He falsely claimed that investing in Black Rock would yield a 500% profit within two months, while also stating that the company was SEBI-approved. \n\nThe man convinced the complainant to invest with a stipulation that he must pay a 20% service charge on the profits generated from the investment. The complainant was then persuaded to download a mobile app through a link and subsequently invested \u20b914 crore into various bank accounts, the police said. \n\nWhen the complainant realised that the invested money was not being returned, he filed a complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. Based on this, an FIR was registered at Cyber Crime Wing Headquarters, Chennai \u2013 SCCIC (State Cyber Crime Investigation Centre), and the police retrieved the money from 13 bank accounts. \n\nAfter analysing the call records and money trail, the special team of police arrested V. Subramanian, 39, from Chengalpattu, who is the first-layer beneficiary ICICI Bank account holder of the fraudulent transaction of \u20b921.5 lakh. \n\nBased on his confession, the other suspects were arrested. They are: M. Madan, 43, from Neelankarai, who owns a chit company in T. Nagar; R. Saravanapriyan, 34, from Thiruvallur, who is an associate producer in the film industry; Sathish Singh, 46, from Avadi, who is an associate of Saravanapriyan; Shafahed, 38, from Pulianthope, who owns a shop that converts currency; and D. Manikandan, 30, from Madurai, who previously worked at a cine producer\u2019s office in Chennai.\n\nAdditionally, two cryptocurrency wallet accounts were frozen. Action is being taken to arrest a gang based in north India that allegedly masterminded these cybercrimes and recover the defrauded money, said Mr. Mittal.",

Similar to earlier reports, the House findings do not pinpoint any specific individuals responsible for the failures.The preliminary findings are based on thousands of pages of documents, nearly twenty transcribed interviews with state and local officials, and a range of briefings\u2014both classified and unclassified\u2014from senior officials at the Secret Service and FBI.Meanwhile, the task force has initiated an investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump from last month, involving an individual with a rifle who was found camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.",

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chiefs Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will be present on the occasion, they said.Ahead of her nomination filing, Priyanka Gandhi met party chief Kharge here on Monday and took his blessings. On Wednesady, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will also lead a roadshow from Kalpetta New Bus Stand at 11 AM. The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.Priyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary byeelection. \"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.Congress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said. With the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.Soon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, the Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate from the seat in Kerala. With the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.Days after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.If elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.The EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies. The bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.Since her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.However, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.She emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year. After her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi had said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\"\"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both the constituencies.Priyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.",

This arrangement could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started back in May 2020 and moving towards peace.\n\n BREAKING: India, China agree on patrolling along LAC, leading to disengagement ahead of BRICS meet in Russia \n\n New Delhi: In a major development, India and China have agreed on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas of the Himalayas, informed Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday. This development has come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia to attend the crucial BRICS summit. The patrolling arrangement between both countries can lead to disengagement and could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started in May 2020.\n\nWhile addressing the media during a special MEA briefing, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that diplomatic and military officials from both countries were in talks with each other. \u201cOver the last few weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums and as a result of these discussions, an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border area, leading to disengagement and resolution,\u201d he stated. \nResponding to a media question on possible meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS in Russia, Misri stated that there are chances of a bilateral meeting between both the leaders. \n\u201cAs far as the question on the bilateral meetings is concerned, this is a multilateral event, though there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking over the overall program of the prime minister. There are a lot of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update on the bilaterals as they evolve,\u201d Misri stated. \nPM Modi, will attend the BRICS summit in Kazan this week. Starting from Tuesday, his short, two-day journey comes as a response to the invitation extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a recent statement on Friday, Denis Alipov, who represents Russia as its ambassador to India, teased the possibility of welcoming new entrants into the BRICS assembly. Such an addition could hugely amplify the group\u2019s capacity as an influential frontier, upholding the interests of the Global South. \nAt an online \u2018BRICS 2.0 meet: New Members, New Horizons\u2019, this comment was made looking forward to the soon-to-be-held BRICS convention in Kazan, next week. At the moment, the holding of BRICS\u2019 chair position is in Russia\u2019s hands. This significant alliance brings together the advanced developing economies of the world. Initially, the four original countries were Brazil, Russia, India, and China, hence the name BRIC. South Africa hopped on board in 2010, sparking the change to the currently known name, BRICS. \n(Note: This is a developing story and further details will be added.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "New Delhi:Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will file her nomination for the Wayanad Lok Sabha bypoll on Wednesday, party sources said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chiefs Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will be present on the occasion, they said. Ahead of her nomination filing, Priyanka Gandhi met party chief Kharge here on Monday and took his blessings. On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will also lead a roadshow from Kalpetta New Bus Stand at 11 AM. The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said. Priyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary byeelection. \"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said. Congress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said. With the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics. Soon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, the Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate from the seat in Kerala. With the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it. Days after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut. If elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together. The EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies. The bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23. Since her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli. However, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh. She emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year. After her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi had said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both the constituencies. Priyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.",

        "text": "The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Friday rejected the bail and anticipatory bail applications filed by suspended Janata Dal (S) leader Prajwal Revanna, who is accused of rape and sexual assault. The HC also dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking legal action against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged comments against former Hassan MP Prajwal during a Lok Sabha campaign speech in Karnataka earlier this year.\nThe All India Dalit Action Committee had filed the PIL, requesting the court to direct Gandhi to issue an unconditional apology to women for his statements, and disrespecting the Constitution. The petition claimed that Gandhi made the remarks on May 2 during election rallies in Shivamogga and Raichur, just prior to the polls on May 7, 2024.\nThe bench stated that the court must uphold a standard when determining whether a matter qualifies as a public interest issue, noting that not every grievance can be raised in court via a PIL. They acknowledged that Gandhi\u2019s remarks, while potentially controversial, do not meet the criteria for a PIL.\nIn dismissing the case, the court reiterated the importance of careful consideration regarding what constitutes a public interest issue, affirming its discretion in handling such petitions.\nAdditionally, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on the petitioner while dismissing the case.\nThe counsel representing the All India Dalit Action Committee argued that Gandhi\u2019s statements outraged the modesty of women and constituted fabricated accusations against Revanna. They contended that such speeches were damaging in a small town like Hassan, creating mistrust among households.\nThey sought the court to impose a token fine on Gandhi for the supposed misuse of his public position, breach of public trust, and violations of various legal provisions, including the Model Code of Conduct for the 2024 Parliamentary elections and the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\nDuring the hearing, the bench, consisting of Chief Justice N V Anjaria and Justice K V Aravind, indicated that the case did not qualify as a public interest litigation. The court stated, \u201cWe have not said anything on the merits; we are not saying anything on the merits of the speech. We have only said this cannot be the subject matter under public interest litigation,\u201d according to Live Law.",

        "text": "A budget of Rs 10 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Baoli Sahib temple in the Punjab province to address the long-standing demands of the Hindu community in Pakistan. This marks the first phase of reconstruction, 64 years after the temple was rendered dysfunctional.The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a federal body responsible for overseeing minority worship sites in Pakistan, has commenced work on restoring the Baoli Sahib temple, located in Zafarwal town in Narowal, a city along the western bank of the Ravi River. The temple has been out of service since 1960, according to Dawn News.Currently, there is no functional Hindu temple in the entire Narowal district, forcing the local Hindu population to either conduct religious ceremonies at home or travel to temples in Sialkot and Lahore. Ratan Lal Arya, the former president of the Pak Dharamsthan Committee, explained that the temple became non-functional after the ETPB took control of it. The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time. The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million. The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population resides in Sindh province, where they share cultural and linguistic ties with their Muslim neighbors.",

The forecast indicates that Trump has a 52% chance of winning the presidency, while Harris stands at 42%.Since late August, the model had consistently favored Harris, with her chances hovering around 54-56%, while Trump held about 44-46%. However, in early October, the gap began to close, and the candidates are now nearly even.This shift in the forecast aligns with Trump's improved polling averages in key battleground states like Wisconsin and Michigan, which had previously leaned toward Harris. Trump already had a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.Of the seven critical swing states in 2024, Pennsylvania is the only one where Harris still leads, according to The Hill report.The US presidential election will take place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, with early voting already underway in states like Georgia, California, North Carolina, Virginia, and Alabama. The elected candidate will begin their four-year term in the White House starting from the inauguration on January 20, 2025.",
        "summary": "Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate, leads Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast with a 52% chance to win the presidency. This shift reflects Trump's stronger polling in key battleground states, now narrowing Harris's earlier lead.",

        "text": "In a dramatic development, India and China have reached an agreement on \u201cpatrolling arrangements \u201d and a resolution of the military standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) , the government announced on Monday (October 21, 2024). The patrolling arrangement agreement extends beyond the areas along the LAC where there has already been a disengagement of military personnel over the past few years, and include the so far unresolved areas of Demchok and Depsang, sources told The Hindu, indicating that the India-China standoff since April 2020 is now expected to be resolved.\n\nWhile the MEA did not give further details of the agreement, and whether there would be a reversion to the status quo pre-2020, and whether the \u201cbuffer zones\u201d more recently created would continue to exist for patrolling purposes\u201d, Mr. Misri said that the two sides had \u201creached an agreement on the issues that were being discussed\u201d\n\nThe announcement, by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, came amidst a media briefing on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit on Tuesday which he will attend along with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cOver the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums, and as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the line of actual control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists adding that the two sides would now take the \u201cnext steps\u201d on this.\n\nThe timing of the India-China agreement announcement, just a day before the BRICS Summit indicates that a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi on the side-lines, that has been speculated about is now expected to take place. Although the two leaders met as many as 18 times prior to the Galwan clashes in June 2020 , where 20 Indian soldiers were killed, they have spoken only twice since then, on the side-lines of the G-20 summit in Indonesia in 2022, and the BRICS summit in South Africa in 2023.\n\n Mr. Misri did not confirm a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi , he said that government is discussing the scheduling of a number of bilateral meetings in Kazan, the venue of the BRICS summit.\n\n\u201c[BRICS] is a multilateral event, though, of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall program of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings, and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve, as soon as feasible,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists when asked, not denying that a meeting with the Chinese leader was among those.\n\nMr. Misri, who was previously India\u2019s Ambassador to China, and was no doubt, a key part of the recent negotiations, did not give further details of the agreement between both sides. He referred to recent meetings that had led to the breakthrough, which include two meetings between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Chinese FM Wang Yi in June-July, two meetings of the WMCC mechanism of diplomatic and military officials in July-August, followed by a meeting between NSA Ajit Doval and Mr. Wang, who is also the Special Representative on border talks in September. These were followed by intense negotiations of military commanders and MEA officials in the last few weeks. With Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi\u2019s travels to Russia for the BRICS confirmed, a deadline appeared to have emerged for the negotiations to conclude with a result.",

He said the diplomatic and military negotiators from both sides had been in close touch in recent weeks. Government sources called it a \u201cbig development\u201d.\nALSO READ | India, China Reach Agreement On Disengagement, Border Patrolling Ahead Of BRICS Meet\nThe statement came just a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit for the BRICS Summit to Kazan, Russia, where he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nThere were seven points of conflict on the LAC since the Galwan clash in 2020, five of which had seen disengagement, but the troops from both sides remained in an eyeball-to-eyeball conflict in Depsang Plains and Demchock. The issue also became a major political flashpoint in India with the Congress attacking the Modi government for alleged presence of Chinese troops on Indian soil.\n\n#IndiaChina Stand-off | India-China reach patrolling agreement on LAC\nIt has to translate on ground, Depsang and Demchok are really important: Lt.

EAM highlighted the need to redouble efforts to achieve complete disengagement from the remaining areas in Eastern Ladakh,\u201d the Indian side had said, after the meeting.\nThe two ministers met again on July 25 in Vientiane, Lao PDR on the sidelines of the ASEAN-related Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting to lay the groundwork. \u201cBoth the ministers agreed on the need to work with purpose and urgency to achieve complete disengagement at the earliest,\u201d an Indian statement had said about the meeting.\n\nThe meeting also resolved to hold an \u201cearly meeting\u201d of the Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) to take the discussions forward.

The case relates to Kejriwal's remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification.A bench comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy and SVN Bhatti stated that the court was not inclined to interfere with the matter, especially since a similar plea by co-accused AAP leader Sanjay Singh was dismissed on April 8, 2024.Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s counsel argued that the defamation case lacked merit, claiming that the complaint was filed by the Gujarat University registrar, who was not directly mentioned in Kejriwal\u2019s remarks. However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta countered that Kejriwal was in the \u201chabit of making defamatory and reckless statements and then saying sorry\u201dThe court clarified that although Kejriwal's legal team made references to relevant legal provisions, the dismissal of Sanjay Singh's plea earlier influenced the decision to reject Kejriwal\u2019s petition as well.\"We must have a consistent approach,\" the bench noted, further stating that they were not commenting on the merits of the case, only choosing not to entertain the plea.ABOUT THE CASEA defamation case was filed by Gujarat University registrar Piyush Patel against Kejriwal and Singh after the AAP leaders made \"defamatory\" and \"sarcastic\" statements at press conferences and on social media targeting the university over PM Modi's degrees.The AAP leaders had allegedly made the comments after the Gujarat High Court had set aside an order of the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) that called for providing information about Modi's educational degrees to them under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.After the High Court\u2019s order in the RTI case, Gujarat University filed a defamation case against the two AAP leaders.Arvind Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh had approached the Gujarat High court, seeking quashing of the defamation proceedings in a trial court. The Gujarat High Court had declined the plea, following which the two AAP leaders approached the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Gujarat High Court\u2019s decision and dismissed Kejriwal\u2019s request for relief from the defamation proceedings.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 21, 2024Must Watch",

        "title": "Remarks on PM's degree: Kejriwal faces defamation trial in Gujarat as SC upholds summons",
        "text": "New Delhi: Former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal is facing criminal proceedings in a defamation case over his alleged remarks over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification after the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed his plea to quash summons. A Gujarat Metropolitan court had summoned Kejriwal and AAP's Sanjay Singh in the defamation case over their alleged \"sarcastic\" and \"derogatory\" statements related to PM Modi's educational degrees. Gujarat University Registrar Piyush Patel had filed the defamation case against the politicians over their alleged comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the chief information commissioner (CIC) for providing information about Modi's degrees under the Right to Information Act. A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S V N Bhatti noted that a separate bench of the apex court had junked the plea filed by AAP leader Sanjay Singh on April 8 in the same case, who is a co-accused in the case. \"We must have a consistent approach. Having regard to that view, we would not like to entertain the present plea. The same is dismissed,\" said the bench. The top court, however, said all contentions were left open to be decided in the trial and it was expressing no opinion on the merits of the case. Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, submitted Patel was not an aggrieved party in the matter. \"If at all the statement was defamatory, it is for Modi to file a criminal defamation case and not for the Gujarat University registrar,\" he said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the University, said a separate bench of the apex court had already dismissed Singh's petition on April 8. Mehta said the degree had been uploaded on the university website and referred to the dismissal of the CIC order by the Gujarat High Court. Arguing that no case of defamation was made out, Singhvi stated that Kejriwal merely asked why the university was not publishing Modi's degree. The bench, however, rejected Kejriwal's plea. The high court had on February 16 dismissed the pleas by Singh and Kejriwal seeking quashing of the summons issued against them in the defamation case. Both had challenged in the high court the summons issued by a trial court in the case filed by the Gujarat University and the subsequent order of the sessions court dismissing their revision pleas against the summons. According to the complainant, the two politicians made \"defamatory\" statements at press conferences and on microblogging platform X, targeting the university over Modi's degrees. Their comments against the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the institution, which has established its name among the public, he alleged. \"Their statements were sarcastic and intentionally made to hurt the prestige of the university,\" he added. On March 31, 2023, the high court quashed the 2016 order of the CIC asking Gujarat University to provide information on Modi's degrees to Kejriwal, and observed the AAP chief's RTI plea appeared to be \"politically vexatious and motivated\" instead of being based on \"sound public interest considerations\".",

We have concluded that there are two areas we can explore - 1) Amendment to Aircraft Security Rules... one of the ideas we wish to implement through these rule changes is that once we apprehend the perpetrator behind these threats, we aim to place them on the no-fly list... 2) Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Civil Aviation Act... Naidu explained.Bomb threats cripples Indian aviationOn Sunday alone, more than 20 flights from IndiGo, Akasa Air, and Vistara were disrupted by bomb threats.This led to a meeting between BCAS officials and airline CEOs, as the threats continue to cause alarm and necessitate extensive security checks.Additionally, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and BCAS Director General Zulfiquar Hasan met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan on Monday to discuss the recent surge in hoax calls.During the half-hour meeting at the Home Ministry, both director generals briefed the home secretary on the recent wave of hoax bomb threats, which have caused widespread panic and prompted exhaustive security measures by Indian aviation authorities, intelligence agencies, and other departments.",

The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary by-election.\n\n\"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.\n\nCongress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said.\n\nWith the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.\n\nSoon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate for the seat in Kerala.\n\nWith the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.\n\nDays after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.\n\nIf elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.\n\nThe EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies.\n\nThe bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.\n\nSince her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.\n\nHowever, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nShe emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year.\n\nAfter her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both constituencies.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Tata Consumer Products, one of the leading FMCG majors in India, witnessed its share prices tumble nearly 10% in yesterday's trading after reporting lackluster financial results for the second quarter of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe company's revenues from operations grew by a modest 13% to Rs. 4,214.5 crores compared to the same period last year. However, operating margins declined by 30 basis points to 14.9% due to rising input costs. Net profits increased by 6% to Rs. 359 crores year-on-year, but fell short of street expectations.\n\nWeak demand, especially in the urban markets, impacted the volume growth for Tata Consumer during the quarter. The tea business, which contributes over half of total revenues, registered muted sales. Rising inflation has also constrained discretionary spending by consumers.\n\nCommenting on the results, analysts at Elara Securities highlighted the competitive pressures in the FMCG sector and slowing demand trends in urban regions as near-term headwinds. Although they remain optimistic about the company's diverse portfolio and broader growth prospects, earnings estimates for the next two fiscal years have been cut to factor in the pressure on revenues and margins.\n\nWhile Tata Consumer looks well-positioned in the long run with its brands and distribution expansion plans, investors seem concerned about the soft demand environment squeezing profits in the immediate quarters. The company will need to efficiently manage costs and urgently revive volume growth in key categories to allay such concerns.

With that we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia.\n\n\"There are areas which for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020,\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nThe External Affairs Minister said the LAC breakthrough is a good development that happened due to \"patient and persevering diplomacy\".\n\nREAD | India To Resume Patrolling In Ladakh After Big Breakthrough With China\n\n\"... At various points of time people almost gave up. We have always maintained on the one hand we obviously had to do counter deployment, and we have been negotiating since September 2020. It has been a very patient process, though more complicated than how it should have been,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV.\n\n\"The important thing is if we have reached an understanding, I think what it does is it creates a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border, which were there before 2020. That was a major concern. If there is no peace and tranquillity, how can other areas of bilateral ties improve?\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nWhile he agreed people may speculate on the LAC development, the External Affairs Minister said he would use \"caution\" in responding on whether this positive development would spread to trade ties.\n\n\"It (LAC breakthrough) has just happened. I would not go so fast at the moment,\" Mr Jaishankar said, referring to trade.\n\nThe last meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs was held on August 29 in Beijing. The two sides then had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the LAC to narrow down differences and find early resolution of outstanding issues.\n\nIt was agreed that restoration of peace and tranquillity, and respect for the LAC are the essential basis for restoration of normalcy in bilateral relations.\n\nEarlier this month, Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had said the two sides have resolved the \"low-hanging fruits\" and now need to address difficult situations, adding there was \"positive signalling\" from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries.\n\nIndian and Chinese military commanders too had been meeting regularly seeking complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh as an essential basis for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.\n\nSome areas still remained to be de-escalated after Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from Gogra-Hot Springs in Ladakh in September 2022. The Chinese forces in this area had returned to pre-2020 positions. Even then, Chinese soldiers were still believed to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north in the Depsang plains.\n\nFierce clashes between soldiers of both sides took place in eastern Ladakh's Galwan in June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action. Over 40 Chinese soldiers were killed or injured.",

Shivakumar said on Monday that about 80 per cent of the workers are demanding the candidacy of former MP and his younger brother D.K. Suresh from the Channapatna Assembly seat for bypolls. \n\nHe claimed that he clarified to the workers that they must support whoever the high command decides to field.\n\n\u201cWe are still recovering from the shock of the Lok Sabha election loss where Suresh lost against C.N. Manjunath by more than two lakh votes. Manjunath had contested Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket. Suresh worked hard but we still lost by a huge margin. Had we lost by a smaller margin, we could have improved our performance. We lost the Lok Sabha badly,\u201d said the Deputy Chief Minister. \n\nHe added that if we start to think that JD-S is weak, then \u201cwe will be the biggest fools\u201d. \n\n\u201cWe have discussed and gathered opinions of the ministers. Instead of a meeting of the election committee, we have discussed with the election in-charges. The decision on the party\u2019s candidates has been made. We will submit the proposal to Delhi, and they will make the final decision.\u201d \n\nCommenting on allegations by Union Minister Kumaraswamy that Congress leaders were in contact with BJP MLC and ticket aspirant for Channapatna, C.P. Yogeshwar, he said, \u201cI have not met or spoken to Yogeshwar. There has been no meeting or discussion between us.\u201d\n\nHe added that Yogeshwar is a sitting member of the Legislative Council and since the MLA position from Channapatna became vacant, Congress has been working to organise the workers. \n\nOn the alleged rift between BJP and JD-S, the Deputy Chief Minister said that he is not aware of any conflicts between them and the media has not reported anything about it.\n\n\u201cChannapatna is naturally a JD-S stronghold. Kumaraswamy was the sitting member. But media reports suggest he is surrendering the segment to the BJP. If he gives up this area, it will lead to the party losing its existence,\u201d the Deputy Chief Minister claimed. \n\nHe added that Suresh has worked hard and the Congress is confident of winning the Channapatna Assembly seat. \n\nOn heavy rains in Bengaluru, the Deputy Chief Minister said that many people have built houses in low-lying areas, and when heavy rain occurs, water inundates those houses. \n\n\u201cWe need to find long-term solutions for the areas where water stagnates and problems arise.

        "text": "Ahead of Indian cricket team's all-important Tour of Australia, that starts next month, the recent loss to New Zealand at home has raised a few doubts about whether the current side needs some changes or not. One star who is most likely to be not picked for the Tour of Australia is Cheteshwar Pujara. The veteran batter, known for his dogged resistance in the face of strong challenge, has a proven record in Australia. The 36-year old has been overlooked from international matches, and the last match he played for India was in June, 2023.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Pujara has now surpassed the great Brian Lara's tally of 65 first-clas tons with a century for Saurashtra against Chhattisgarh in a Ranjji Trophy match. Pujara has 66 tons now. He also went past the 21000-mark in first-class run tally. Regarding his absence, Australia star Pat Cummins said: \"It comes down to who wants to outlast each other, which I quite like that aspect of Test cricket. It's going to be a shame that he is not there, but I'm sure they'll pick someone else who's in a similar kind of style.\"\"It was always great playing (against) Pujara. He was one of those guys who never really felt like he was getting away from you. But then he would (just) bat, bat, bat and bat. I really enjoyed the contest against him. Some days he won, other days I won. It's going to have a bit of a different feel without him. Pujara is a great player.\" He also said that the India vs Australia rivalry is now at par with Ashes. I do think it is. Particularly, after the Indian team won the last couple of series at (our) home. We've had more success against England over the past decade. I think it's right up there,\" he said.\"You know when you play against India, you've got a few Indian fans that are watching. It's a slightly different rivalry to England-Australia rivalry. But again, now having a five-Test match series, it does mirror the Ashes series very closely,\" he said.",

The cabinet, dubbed the \u201cRed and White Cabinet\u201d after Indonesia's national colors, dwarfs the 34-member team under predecessor Joko Widodo.\n\nSubianto, who was sworn in as Indonesia's eighth president last week, stated the cabinet's large size was necessary to create a \u201cstrong government\u201d that could unite the diverse nation and represent its many political voices. Analysts noted it allows him to reward the seven-party coalition that backed his election victory in February. Several ministers from Widodo's cabinet were also retained.\n\nA key reason for the cabinet's enormity appears to be Subianto's stated goal of accelerating Indonesia's economic growth to 8% annually through ambitious spending plans. These include salary hikes for civil servants, free school meals for 83 million children, and defense budget increases. To implement such broad programs, a huge team of ministers will be required.\n\nSome familiar faces staying on include respected Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the first person to hold the post under three separate presidencies. Other returnees are the ministers of trade, energy, state firms and interior. Indrawati's stewardship of the economy through various crises has made her a key stabilizing presence.\n\nInterestingly, Subianto had been a political rival of Widodo for years but did not contest his 2019 reelection defeat, even serving as his defense chief later. This paved the way for the unlikely alliance that saw Widodo tacitly endorse Subianto's recent candidacy. With his new giant cabinet, Indonesia's new leader is clearly ambitious in scale \u2013 whether this gamble to leverage broad coalition support pays off remains to be seen.",

        "text": "Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday said his government would clear pending bills worth Rs 763 crore of the police department and also promised to hire 6,100 constables.The Chief Minister gave the assurance while speaking on the occasion of Police Commemoration Day at the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium in Vijayawada.The previous government (YSRCP) has left bills of the police department worth over Rs 763 crore unpaid. Will take decisions in phases to cooperate with the police department and will clear all those bills, said Naidu during his speech as part of the Police Commemoration Day.Noting that investing in the police department is akin to investing in the state, the CM said he always gave importance to and cooperated with it.According to Naidu, the state government has already cleared pending bills worth Rs 100 crore of the department within 125 days of coming to power.Emphasising on the need for providing latest technologies to the police department, Naidu said policemen cannot fight criminals with old fashioned technological tools.Only when we have an upper hand over criminals in terms of surveillance and technology, can we control them, said Naidu, promising to improve and bring advanced technology.He accused the previous YSRCP government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of using the police department as a tool for political harassment.Slamming Reddy, the TDP supremo said the former could not release Rs 700 crore to the police department but allegedly splurged Rs 700 crore on survey stones, which bore the former CM's images.Assuring importance to police welfare, the CM promised to commit at least Rs 20 crore every year and also build a facility at Amaravati to observe the next Police Commemoration Day from there.I pay my tributes to police who died on duty. I assure you that I will always stand by the police who do justice and respect officials, Naidu added.",

In Delhi, we have only CNG and electric buses, whereas 100% of the interstate buses coming from UP and Haryana are diesel-powered. Why can't the governments of Haryana and UP introduce electric buses? It's because they want to play dirty politics with the people of Delhi. While Delhi has no brick kilns, there are 3,800 brick kilns in the NCR region, contributing significantly to pollution levels in the capital,\" the Chief Minister added.\n\nOn the water pollution in Yamuna, she said, \"BJP leaders have been visiting Kalindi Kunj for photoshoots, but the real cause of the toxic foam in the Yamuna is industrial waste being dumped into the river by factories in Haryana. The UP government also contributes to the problem by releasing polluted water into the Yamuna.\"\n\nOver the past several winters, Delhiites have gasped for breath as stubble burning in neighbouring states, among other causes, has pushed up air pollution in the capital. With election in the city due in February, air pollution has now emerged as a key talking point.\n\nIn power for 10 years, AAP is pushing hard for a third term. AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, now out on bail after he was arrested in a corruption case linked to Delhi's now-scrapped liquor policy, stepped down as Chief Minister last month and said he would return to the top office only after the \"people's court\" elects him again. Senior party leader Atishi took over the job after Mr Kejriwal's exit.",

        "text": "Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court on Monday rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) petition demanding that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi apologise for allegedly tarnishing the dignity of Indian women.The PIL stemmed from a claim that Gandhi had falsely accused former Janata Dal (Secular) MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of rape and sexual abuse, of \u201craping 400 women and filming the act,\u201d describing it as \u201cmass rape\u201d and not a sex scandal.A bench comprising Chief Justice NV Anjaria and Justice K Aravind dismissed the petition, stating that it was a waste of judicial time.The Court also imposed a Rs 25,000 fine on the petitioner, the All India Dalit Action Committee, for filing the plea.The petitioner's counsel argued that Gandhi's remarks, made during a public speech, were highly irresponsible and offensive, particularly to the women of Hassan. He pleaded the Court to issue a notice to Gandhi, compelling him to respond to the allegations.\u201cGandhi is a serial offender,\u201d the counsel contended, referencing past statements made by Gandhi, including comments regarding individuals with the surname Modi.'The petitioner also cited Gandhi's alleged citizenship issues, which are pending before the Delhi High Court, as further evidence of his misconduct.However, the Karnataka HC found no merit in the petition and dismissed it along with a fine.The petitioner's counsel sought waiver of the fine and argued that he should not be penalized for taking rightful action.The PIL highlighted that Gandhi's allegations, made without evidence, misled the public and disrespected the modesty of Indian women, particularly in light of the provisions under the new Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita.The plea argued that Gandhi's statement amounted to hate speech and promoted gender-based hatred. It also sought a directive from the court requiring Gandhi to issue a public apology and called for the National Commission for Women to take appropriate action against him.Despite the petitioner's appeal, the Court concluded that the matter did not warrant further consideration.",

However, some of the party leaders in the district unit of the AGP revolted against the decision while the district president also resigned from his post.\n\nThese developments caused the AGP leadership to delay the announcement of the name of Choudhury as the party candidate. However, according to sources, Phani Bhusan Choudhury was insistent on his wife getting a ticket for the Assembly bypolls and the top leaders decided to field Diptimoy Choudhury in Bongaigaon.\n\nMeanwhile, the Barpeta Lok Sabha MP said that the people of Bongaigaon wanted his wife to contest the elections. \u201cThis is the only reason why she was chosen as a party candidate here,\u201d he said.\n\nChoudhury will take on the Congress party\u2019s nominee Brajenjit Sinha in the Bongaigaon Assembly seat.\n\nBy-elections in five assembly constituencies\u2014Dholai, Samaguri, Behali, Bongaigaon, and Sidli became imminent following the elections of five legislators in the lower house of the parliament in this year\u2019s Lok Sabha polls.\n\nApart from Sinha, the Congress has given party tickets to Dhrubajyoti Purakayastha in Dholai, Sanjib Warle in the Sidli seat, and Tanzil Hussain in the Samaguri Assembly constituency.\n\nThe Dholai Assembly constituency is reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) community and the Sidli seat is reserved for the Scheduled Tribe (ST).",

        "text": "\"Have 16 children\" - Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin's eyebrow-raising 'solution' Monday to the possibility the southern state will be allotted fewer Lok Sabha seats - and therefore be less important to any political party looking to form the union government - after the delimitation in 2026, i.e., redrawing of parliamentary constituencies, before the 2029 election, based on revised population levels.\n\nThe DMK leader - presiding over the state-funded Hindu marriage ceremony of 31 couples - said the tradition in his state was for family elders to bless married couples with \"16 kinds of wealth\"; the benediction, translated from Tamil, reads \"Acquire 16 kinds of wealth and lead a prosperous life)\".\n\n\"That blessing does not mean you should have 16 children... but now a situation has arisen where people think they may have to, literally, raise 16 children and not a small and prosperous family.\"\n\nAs an aside (and in a comment seen as another jab at the BJP that is in power at the centre), Mr Stalin called on Tamil couples to give their children \"beautiful Tamil names\".\n\nREAD | \"Imposing Hindi Everywhere\": MK Stalin vs Governor In Anthem Row\n\nThe Chief Minister's comment about Tamil names for Tamil children comes amid yet another state-centre flare-up on the language row; last week Mr Stalin lobbed tough questions at Governor RN Ravi, the centre's rep in the state, for trying to \"impose Hindi everywhere\".\n\nThe Delimitation Row\n\nOver the past several months Tamil Nadu, and the other southern states, have expressed concern over a delimitation exercise that will see the number of seats jump from 543 now to 753.\n\nThe biggest increase will be in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state; the number of Lok Sabha seats will jump from 80 to 126 - a 57.5 per cent spike. Among the southern states, only Karnataka could see a measurable increase - from 28 seats to 36 - in representation in the Lower House.\n\nTamil Nadu's Lok Sabha share will likely only inch up - from 39 to 41, a five per cent increase, and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana may be given only three extra seats each.\n\nNDTV Explains | What India Will Look Like After 2026 Delimitation\n\nAnd Kerala - the state that has best controlled population growth, a critical factor as the country and world battles climate change, unemployment, and resource scarcity - could lose one of its 20 seats.\n\nThe opposition has been fiercely critical about the marked disparity between possible revised Lok Sabha representation for the northern states - a majority of which voted for the BJP in the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections - and for those in the south.\n\nAnd Mr Stalin's government has been among the most vocal in this regard.\n\nTamil Nadu's Anti-Delimitation Move\n\nIn February Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK adopted a resolution against the proposed delimitation, arguing that states that have best controlled population levels ought not to be penalised.\n\nREAD | In Tamil Nadu Assembly, A Challenge To Delimitation Exercise\n\nConversely, the DMK said, states that had failed to do so should not be rewarded.\n\nChandrababu Naidu's Remark\n\nMr Stalin's comment - in jest, yes, but with a definite edge - came shortly after his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, Chandrababu Naidu, also 'advised' people to have more children.\n\nMr Naidu's comment, however, was in the context of an aging state population.\n\nHe warned that a disproportionate number of elderly people could affect the state's finances and offered Japan as an example. \"In many villages, only elderly people remain... as the young have migrated to cities or overseas,\" he said, adding his government would pass laws in this regard.\n\nCentre Says...\n\nThe Narendra Modi government will be considerate of the fact southern states have, on average, controlled population better than the north, sources told NDTV in September last year. Fears southern states will be penalised by their Lok Sabha seats being affected, will be allayed, sources said.\n\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

There were no clues available from the spot and analysis is going on,\u201d they said.\nThe sources added: \u201cThe place is insignificant in terms of being picked as a target for a bomb blast. This is a busy area in terms of car parking and residential locality but the logistics ensured that no damage occurred. What is most surprising is that no bomb blast material is available and neither was any device found. In this case, it becomes a crude bomb.\u201d\nCrude bomb is used in Bengal and other parts of India, sources said, adding that they had never been used in the national capital.\n\u201cThe CCTV footage examination is crucial. There is no clue in CCTVs so far as no one is seen going closer to the spot where the blast took place.\u201d\nOn Monday, Delhi Police said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to the blast. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform.\nThe purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents. The claim was made by Justice League India using a clip of the blast with a \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d watermark at the bottom, and circulated on social media platforms.\nThe blast, which destroyed a portion of the school wall, window panes of nearby shops, and damaged a few cars parked nearby, was captured in a CCTV camera. Police suspect that the bomb might have been placed late at night as local residents said it went off between 7.35 am and 7.40 am.\nThe sound of the blast was heard several hundred metres away. Videos from the spot showed thick plumes rising from the site. Residents called the explosion \u201cintense\u201d and reported a foul smell in the area.\nPolice have filed a case under sections of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on charges of \u201cmischief through explosion\u201d and under the Explosives Act.",

He vacated the Budgam seat and retained the Ganderbal constituency, the pro-tem speaker announced in the House on Monday.

Tensions escalated after attackers killed two Opposition figures\u2014a lawyer and a party official\u2014who were shot while traveling in a car, prompting condemnation from the EU and human rights groups.The new Opposition Podemos party and its presidential candidate, Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, have rejected provisional results that indicate a probable win for the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for half a century. They called for a nationwide strike in response to the results.Mozambique Elections: Police fire tear gas at Mondlane, journalists \u2013 Watch | O Pa\u00eds #Mozambique #Mo\u00e7ambique #Mocambique #MozambiqueElections #News https://t.co/BeZrRxo0NA\u2014 Club of Mozambique (@clubOmozambique) October 21, 2024 \">Also Read: The Mozambican civil society election observer group More Integrity reported that the shooting occurred in the Bairro da Coop neighborhood of Maputo, resulting in the deaths of Podemos lawyer Elvino Dias and party representative Paulo Guambe. Several dozen people, including journalists, scattered as heavily armed police patrolled the area, according to videos posted on social media. Adriano Nuvunga, director of Mozambique\u2019s Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD), described the killings as \u201ca cold-blooded murder,\u201d noting that around 10 to 15 bullets were fired. The EU condemned the violence, demanding an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation. \u201cIn a democracy, there is no place for politically motivated killings,\u201d the EU's diplomatic service stated, adding that its election observers are still assessing the electoral process. As of now, Frelimo leads in all 11 provinces, with Daniel Chapo expected to win the 9 October election, despite external observers raising concerns about the poll's integrity due to reports of vote-buying and intimidation. Full results are due on 24 October, but fears mount that Monday\u2019s protests could turn violent, given the history of police brutality against political dissent.

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed that secularism has long been regarded as an integral part of the Constitution's basic structure. The top court made the statement orally while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the removal of the terms 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Preamble to the Constitution.\"You don't want India to be secular?\" Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked, while hearing the plea alongside Justice Sanjay Kumar. The Supreme Court bench said that the term 'socialism' should not necessarily be interpreted in the western context and the term can also mean that there has to be an equal opportunity for all. \"There are a number of judgments of this court which hold that Secularism was always part of the basic structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and word fraternity used in the Constitution as well as the rights under Part III, there is a clear indication that secular has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,\" Live Law quoted Justice Khanna as saying. Khanna also pointed out that, unlike the French model of secularism, India adopted a new model of secularism.The plea, filed by senior BJP leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy and one Balram Singh, challenged the 42nd amendment to the Indian Constitution that was made by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi-led government during the Emergency.Responding to the top court judge, Advocate Jain said, \"We are not saying that India is not secular, we are challenging the amendment\". Jain further argued that Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar had opined that the inclusion of the word 'socialism' would curtail personal liberty.In response, Justice Khanna said, \"Socialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of country should be distributed equally. Let's not take the Western meaning\".It was also argued by the petitioner that the Preamble of the Constitution, as it stood on November 26, 1949, was a definitive declaration, contending that any subsequent amendment adding words such as 'socialist\" and 'secular' was arbitrary, according to Live Law.To this, Justice Khanna highlighted that the words introduced by the 1976 amendment were clearly indicated by brackets, making it evident that they were additions. Khanna also pointed out that terms such as 'unity' and 'integrity' of the nation were also incorporated through this amendment.The bench then agreed to examine the issue in detail and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Oct 21, 2024ALSO READ | Supreme Court dismisses Arvind Kejriwal's plea in case over remark on PM's degreeALSO READ | Supreme Court junks plea to replace 'Hindutva' with 'Indian constitutionalism",

Over the past five years, imports fr0m FTA partners increased by 37.9 per cent to USD 187.92 billion, significantly outpacing export growth, which rose by 14.48 per cent to USD 122.72 billion.\n\nThis trade imbalance has been particularly pronounced with ASEAN countries, the UAE, Japan, and nations within the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).\n\nThe revised strategy draws on lessons fr0m past agreements, such as the challenges encountered with gold, silver, platinum, and date imports under the India-UAE FTA.\n\nBy adopting a more meticulous approach to concessions, India aims to mitigate potential risks and unforeseen consequences in future trade deals.\n\nA key focus of the new policy is to address the issue of third-country products, especially those originating fr0m China, entering India through FTA partner countries at preferential rates.\n\nThis practice, observed notably with Indonesian and Vietnamese imports under the India-ASEAN FTA, has prompted calls for more robust rules of origin to close existing loopholes.\n\nAdditionally, India is taking a firmer stance against non-tariff barriers proposed by developed nations, particularly those related to sustainability, labour standards, and environmental regulations.\n\nThe country is also advocating for a more balanced approach in negotiations with smaller nations to ensure proportionate gains.\n\nTo refine its FTA strategy and develop standard operating procedures for trade negotiations, the Commerce Department organised a strategic planning session in May.\n\nThis event brought together officials and trade experts, including former negotiators, to brainstorm and shape India's future approach to international trade agreements.",

The 2009-batch officer, currently serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department, raised pertinent questions that garnered widespread attention.\nWho Is Shailbala Martin?\nShailbala Martin, originally from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, was born on April 9, 1965. According to the state government website, she began her career in the State Civil Service (SCS) before being promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) on June 12, 2017. With a BA and an MA in Arts from Holkar Science College in Indore, Martin joined the State Civil Service in 2009.\nThroughout her career, Martin has held various positions, including roles in the Health Department in 2014, Municipal Commissioner of Burhanpur in 2019, and Collector of Niwari district the same year. Since January 25, 2022, she has been serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department.\nThe Loudspeaker Controversy\nThe recent controversy can be traced back to guidelines issued by the state government last year to mitigate noise pollution, which specifically aimed to regulate loudspeakers in religious venues. A journalist on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) questioned the disparity in enforcement, focusing on the use of loudspeakers in mosques and the prevalence of DJs playing music outside these spaces.\nIn response, Martin highlighted the noise pollution caused by loudspeakers in temples, questioning why such disturbances, which can be heard several streets away and continue late into the night, are often overlooked. Her tweet sparked a mix of reactions, with some users supporting her stance while others criticised her for raising the issue.",

As a result, the Khinsvar assembly seat fell vacant.\n\nThere was speculation about a Congress-RLP alliance for the bypoll to the Khinvsar seat but Mr. Dotasra said the Congress' State unit was not looking for a tie-up.\n\nHe said the Congress' Rajasthan in-charge Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa would take the panels for all seven seats to Delhi and candidates would be declared after a discussion with the high command.\n\nDungarpur's Chorasi assembly seat fell vacant after Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) MLA Rajkumar Roat won the Lok Sabha election from the Banswara-Dungarpur district.\n\nThe Congress did not announce any alliance with the BAP in the general election but asked its candidate to withdraw their nominations from the Banswara-Dungarpur constituency. The move was aimed at supporting the BAP.\n\n\"There are no talks of alliance with any party in the assembly bypolls in Rajasthan. We have prepared panels for all seven seats in the meeting today,\" Mr. Dotasra said.\n\nHe also exuded confidence that the party would win all seven assembly seats.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Assembly Tikaram Jully, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, former assembly Speaker CP Joshi and other party leaders attended the meeting chaired by Randhawa.\n\nVoting on seven assembly seats -- Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Deoli-Uniara, Khinvsar, Chorasi, Salumbar and Ramgarh -- will be held on November 13 and the results will be declared on November 23.\n\nBypolls on two seats are being held due to the death of the MLAs -- Congress's Zubair Khan from Ramgarh and BJP's Amritlal Meena from Salumbar.\n\nIn the other five constituencies, the MLAs were elected as MPs, necessitating the bypolls.\n\nCongress MLAs Brijendra Ola (Jhunjhunu), Harish Chandra Meena (Deoli-Uniara) and Murari Lal Meena (Dasau) were elected as MPs in the Lok Sabha election. The other two are Beniwal and Roat.\n\nFour of the seven seats where bypolls will be held were with the Congress, while the BJP, BAP and the RLP held one each.\n\nThe BJP has declared candidates for all seats except Chorasi.\n\nThe BAP has already declared its candidate for the Chorasi seat.\n\nCurrently, the 200-seat state assembly has 114 MLAs of the BJP, 65 of the Congress, three of the BAP, two of the BSP, one of the Rashtriya Lok Dal and eight Independents.",

It's mind-boggling - you are one nation but you are speaking different languages and even the written languages are different. The first thing he (PM Modi) did was unify the tax system. This is an incredible accomplishment. This is something that probably would have taken a century.\"The investor said India's diversity results in incredible creativity and the future belongs to those who are creative.\"I definitely think India is going to become a leader or the leader in semiconductor production in the future. One reason I say that is the demand - you have got a market here that is one of the biggest in the world. Secondly, it is a relatively open economy, so you are going to be able to take technology from Taiwan, China, the United States, wherever. Thirdly, you have got an incredible software industry already, you are the largest exporter of software in the world,\" Mr Mobius said, adding that many large semiconductor companies already have software bases in India.The investor said semiconductor fabrication will happen in India because the country has the labour force. \"I remember I was meeting an Indian friend of mine a few years ago and I said India will become a big semiconductor manufacturer. He said Indians are not as patient and not so good with small things like the Chinese are and I asked him if he had seen the places where they are polishing these tiny diamonds in India. They will do a very good job here, no questions about it. But it will require a huge amount of capital,\" he added.In terms of return on capital, it's \"India, China and the US\", Mr Mobius said, adding that India still presents plenty of opportunities despite stock prices climbing. As the conversation moved to lighter topics, the investor said he likes the 'Baahubali' movies and also had a picture taken with a statue of the villain from the movies in Hyderabad. &nbsp",

What came instead was the pronouncement of his death \u2013 Shashi Abrol had been killed in a terror attack in Kashmir's Ganderbal district.\n\nNews of his death came late on Sunday night, long after the moon had risen, the sight millions of Hindu women look out for to break their daylong fast on the day. Fate could not have dealt Ruchi Abrol a crueller blow.\nShashi Abrol, an architectural designer, was among the seven people killed when terrorists attacked a tunnel construction site on the Srinagar-Leh national highway on Sunday.\nThe attack took place when the team had returned from work to their camp late in the evening. The morning after, his wife held on to their three-year-old daughter, angry, anguished and bewildered at the same time. The couple also has a son studying engineering.\n\u201cI spoke to him in the evening. He didn't mention any threats. I was going to the temple as part of my Karwa Chauth fast, and we had a brief conversation. I tried calling him after I returned but he didn't pick up. After that, his phone was switched off,\u201d a sobbing Ruchi told PTI.\n\u201cI waited for his call but had no idea about the attack,\u201d she added at her home in Jammu's Talab Tillo area, her mother-in-law by her side.\nNo one told them what had happened until late at night. And then too, it came through the media, the family said.\nRuchi was refusing to break her fast, said her sister-in-law Divya.\n\u201cHer life is shattered. The festival of Karwa Chauth has turned into a day of catastrophe for us. Our dear Shashi Ji was killed in a cowardly act by terrorists,\u201d she said.\nAnxiety mounted as the hours passed by.\nRuchi had completed her rituals and was waiting for a video call from her husband, everyone unaware of the magnitude of the tragedy that had befallen them.\n\u201cWe tried to comfort Ruchi as we grew worried when his phone switched off late at night. We only learned about his death through the media, which shocked us all,\u201d Divya said.\nShashi was the family's sole breadwinner.\n\u201cWhat have they gained from this? How will she feed her children now? We curse them,\u201d she said.\nShashi, who had been working for the construction company APCO in Sonamarg for the past six years, had last come home two months ago during his son's college admission.\n\u201cHis aim was to see his son as a bright engineer,\u201d Divya said.\nAs news of Shashi's death spread, hundreds of neighbours, relatives and others visited the family home to offer their condolences.\nThe family criticised the government for failing to inform them promptly and urged the authorities to ensure the swift return of Shashi's body for the last rites.\n\u201cThis is proof of how much peace and normalcy has been restored. Seven people were massacred. We lost our brother,\u201d Shashi's sister Urvashi said after the incident that came just four days after Omar Abdullah was sworn in as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe family called on the government to provide financial assistance.\nJ L Abrol, Shashi's father, said they had never anticipated any danger in Kashmir. \u201cWe demand a job for my daughter in law to feed the family,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is no breadwinner left in the family. How will his wife, who is a homemaker, feed the children? She should be given a government job. It is the government's duty to take care of them,\u201d a cousin Navin Suri said.\nAccording to Additional Deputy Commissioner, Jammu, Shishir Gupta, the loss cannot be compensated but the process to bring back Shashi's body is being fast tracked.",

If you look at our history with Russia after Independence, Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively. Among the major countries, there are not many about who we can say this. Today Russia's situation is different, I think Russia's relationship with the West has broken down, so you have a Russia which is turning much more towards Asia. Should Russia not have multiple options in Asia? Should we not take what is good for us in national interests?\"\"And clearly, Russia as a major natural resources power has a complementarity with India at this stage of development where we are big resource consumers. It isn't just Russian oil, it could be fertilisers, metals, coal. There is a whole economic logic to it. There is also a basic strategic logic, if you look at the Eurasian landmass, there are three big countries. You always keep a balance, a relationship,\" the minister said.New Delhi's ties with Moscow have been a key geopolitical talking point over the past few years, especially after the Ukraine War began. With the West siding with Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia, India's decision to buy Russian oil had come under scrutiny.India has consistently refused to take sides in the conflict and said it is on the side of peace. This was also reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Earlier, articulating the Indian position over the decision to procure Russian oil, Dr Jaishankar had said New Delhi has a right to prioritise the interests of its people.\"I understand that there is a conflict situation (in Ukraine). I also understand that Europe has a point of view and Europe will make the choices it will make that is Europe's right. But for Europe to make choices which prioritises its energy needs and then ask India to do something else..,\" he had said.",

        "text": "Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday met party chief Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi to discuss campaign strategies as she prepares to file nomination for the by-elections in Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Waynad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23.\n\nAfter the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Waynad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also remain present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. \n\nAfter being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Waynad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. Along with this, the election commission announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. \n\nIf Priyanka Gandhi wins from Waynad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi had retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. \n\nGandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation Councillor. \n\nRahul Gandhi had said both Raebareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Raebareli before making a run for active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party. \n\nMeanwhile, Congress appointed Saral Patel as the media coordinator for Wayanad ahead of the by-election with immediate effect.
