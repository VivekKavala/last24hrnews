South Eastern Railway officials quickly dispatched accident relief and medical teams to the scene, and buses were arranged to transport affected passengers to Kolkata. Railway authorities are currently investigating the cause of the derailment.\\n\\nDetails of the Incident\\n\\nThe derailment occurred while the train was transitioning from the middle line to the down line near Nalpur station, located about 40 km from Kolkata. Om Prakash Charan, Chief Public Relations Officer of South Eastern Railway, confirmed that at 5:31 AM, the Secunderabad-Shalimar train derailed, involving one parcel van and two passenger coaches. “No major injury or casualty has been reported,” Charan stated, emphasizing the rapid response by railway officials.

Passengers expressed relief at their safety; one traveler noted, “It was a frightening moment, but I’m grateful for how quickly help arrived.”\\n\\nRecent Developments and Official Statements\\n\\nFollowing this incident, railway authorities have activated helplines for passengers affected by the derailment. This event comes on the heels of other derailments in Tamil Nadu and Assam within recent weeks, which also resulted in no injuries but raised concerns about railway safety standards. In a statement regarding overall railway safety improvements, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw noted a significant reduction in annual railway accidents from 171 a decade ago to just 40 currently. Officials are now focused on determining the cause of this latest derailment while ensuring that normal train services are restored as quickly as possible. Advocacy groups have called for enhanced safety measures and more rigorous inspections to prevent future incidents.\\n\\nContext of Railway Safety in India\\n\\nThis derailment highlights ongoing challenges within India’s railway system. Historical data indicates a troubling pattern of accidents over the years, prompting calls for improved safety protocols. In light of recent incidents, experts are urging Indian Railways to invest in modern technology and infrastructure upgrades to enhance passenger safety. As public scrutiny increases, it is crucial for authorities to address these concerns transparently.\\n\\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective\\n\\nThe recent derailment of the Secunderabad-Shalimar Express underscores the critical need for ongoing improvements in railway safety across India. While it is fortunate that no injuries occurred this time, we must advocate for continuous enhancements in infrastructure and safety measures to prevent future incidents.

The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned militant group, has claimed responsibility for this attack.

In the aftermath, Quetta’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mohammad Baloch confirmed that around 100 people were present at the station, and the Jaffar Express train was about to depart for Peshawar.

In his statement, CM Bugti denounced the inhumanity of these attacks and committed to intensifying operations to eliminate terrorism in Balochistan. Citing recent successes in tracing and apprehending perpetrators, he assured that those behind the Quetta Railway Station bombing would be brought to justice.\\n\\nSurge in Terrorism-Related Incidents Across Pakistan\\n\\nThe recent surge in violence follows a particularly deadly year for Pakistan, with over 1,500 fatalities and nearly as many injuries from terrorism and counter-terror operations. In September alone, incidents included a bombing that injured police personnel in Quetta and an armed assault on laborers in Panjgur.

Condemning the violence, Trudeau stated, “Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely.” He thanked Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to the incident.The ongoing dispute underscores Canada’s and India’s contrasting approaches to diaspora and separatist issues, with both countries calling for a measured approach as tensions rise.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/trudeau-admits-many-khalistan-supporters-in-canada', 'image': 'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-jplgscjif5m1p5puo02apefbv0-20231221080151.Medi.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 04:40:09', 'author': 'DC Correspondent', 'authors': ['DC Correspondent'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.281}, {'id': 263684446, 'title': \"Khalistan supporters don't represent Sikh community in Canada nor do Modi supporters represent Hindus: PM Trudeau\", 'text': \"Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has said that pro-Khalistan separatists do not represent the Sikh community in Canada, remarking for the first time, while addressing the Indian diaspora at a Diwali event in Ottawa's Parliament Hill last week, media reports have emerged.

Earlier, a Hindu temple in Windsor suffered defacement with anti-India graffiti. Earlier incidents in Mississauga and Brampton saw temples similarly targeted, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada. Last year in December, gunshots were fired at the residence of the son of Satish Kumar, the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey.Severing India-Canada TiesMeanwhile, Indian diplomats in Canada have been in the cross hairs of Khalistanis for long, especially after the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year in Vancouver for which Trudeau has blamed Indian agents without providing any proof so far. Sanjay Verma, India’s outgoing high commissioner to Canada, previously accused Trudeau of “destroying India-Canada political relations.” On October 13, Canada named Verma a person of interest in its investigation into Nijjar’s killing.Canada escalated its claims by implicating India’s Home Minister Amit Shah, citing a leaked Washington Post report. Canada’s National Security and Intelligence Adviser Nathalie Drouin and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison told Parliament’s national security committee that Shah allegedly led a campaign against Khalistani separatists in Canada.

These raids occurred just as the state assembly elections approach. Pandey expressed concerns over the timing and intent of these actions, suggesting they might be politically motivated due to the lack of attendance at BJP rallies compared to those of Hemant Soren and Kalpana Soren.Earlier on Saturday, the Income Tax department conducted a raid at Sunil Srivastavas residence. Srivastava is known to be a close associate and personal secretary to Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren. This development has sparked further debate about the role of central agencies during election periods.Election Timing Raises ConcernsPandey highlighted that with only a few days left before the elections, such actions could disrupt preparations. He noted that Srivastava plays a significant role in organising for the assembly elections. The timing of these raids has led to questions about their purpose and impact on election activities.In a related statement, JMM candidate Mahua Maji criticised the BJP, asserting that the people have decided against supporting what she termed jumlebaaz. She recalled attempts by agencies to arrest CM Soren during previous Lok Sabha elections, which did not deter their success. Maji emphasised that despite high-profile visits from leaders like Prime Minister Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the results favoured JMM.Upcoming Assembly ElectionsThe political climate in Jharkhand is tense as assembly elections draw near. The JMM, led by CM Soren and allied with Congress, RJD, and left parties, faces stiff competition from the BJP-led NDA alliance. The elections are set for November 13 and 20 across two phases, with counting slated for November 23.These developments come amid heightened political activity in Jharkhand.

Trump has vowed to carry out the largest mass deportation in US history, stoking fears of increased illegal and irregular migration to Canada.As per the news agency AFP, the day after Trump won the election, online searches in the US over moving to Canada surged with terms like \"immigrate to Canada\" and \"how to move to Canada.\" These search results showed growing anxiety about the incoming administration\\'s immigration policies, though the legal status of those making these inquiries remains unclear.Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sergeant Charles Poirier confirmed that officials are monitoring the US border closely. \"We know that Trump\\'s stance on immigration might drive up illegal and irregular migration to Canada,\" he said, expressing concern that it could lead to a surge in border crossings. RCMP has been ramping up its presence along the 5,525-mile-long border, which is the world’s longest unmilitarized border. In addition to deploying more officers, the Canadian authorities have set up cameras, sensors, and drones to monitor the situation. Real-time information is being exchanged between Canada and the US, but Poirier warned that if thousands of migrants attempt to cross all at once, the situation could become unmanageable.In response, Canada\\'s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland assured the public that the government has a plan in place to handle any potential challenges. \"We have a plan,\" Freeland told during a news conference but declined to provide specifics, reported the news agency AFP. She reassured Canadians that their borders remain \"safe and secure,\" despite concerns about a possible rise in migrant arrivals. As Canada prepares, it is also cutting its own immigration targets, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s government aiming to slow population growth to focus on bolstering infrastructure and social services. Quebec Premier Francois Legault voiced concerns over the strain on the province’s ability to accommodate large numbers of migrants, fearing it could overwhelm housing and resources. Canada’s response comes at a time when the US has made it harder for migrants to make successful asylum claims, particularly for those coming from the United States. The wait time for refugee claims in Canada now extends to up to 44 months, and any migrants attempting to enter through unofficial border points risk being turned back or facing severe dangers. As winter approaches, authorities are particularly concerned about the dangers migrants face when attempting to cross illegally through forests, lakes, and rivers, which can result in frostbite, hypothermia, and even death.', 'summary': \"Canadian authorities are increasing security measures at the US border, anticipating a potential surge in migrants due to President-elect Donald Trump's strict immigration policies.  The RCMP is deploying more resources and collaborating with US officials to monitor the situation, while the Canadian government assures preparedness for potential challenges.\", 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-on-high-alert-braces-for-potential-migrant-surge-from-us-after-trumps-return-to-power/articleshow/115116321.cms', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115116561/115116561.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 12:54:22', 'author': 'Toi World Desk', 'authors': ['Toi World Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': -0.044}]}, {'news': [{'id': 263736302, 'title': 'Minor NEET aspirant held hostage, raped for months in Kanpur by coaching teachers', 'text': \"Kanpur: A minor student from Fatehpur who moved here to prepare for her medical entrance exam NEET at a prominent coaching institute was allegedly held hostage for over six months and raped by two of its teachers, police said on Saturday.

The chief minister observed that innovative ideas will remove poverty and generate income which can fund welfare activities.Earlier, Ram Mohan Naidu said a new chapter is being opened in Andhra Pradesh, adding that seaplane operations will not only change the future of the state but also India.Though seaplane operations were tried earlier, the aviation minister noted that they did not take off due to Covid and other reasons and highlighted that CM Naidu suggested the potential of seaplanes.

Thackeray further questioned the BJP for not providing employment to the youth of the state.“I think it would be better for the Prime Minister to answer why the BJP looted Maharashtra instead of entangling us in the pages of history. Why did the BJP not employ the youth here and take it to Gujarat? They should answer this,” he said. Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate from Worli, who was campaigning in the lead-up to the state elections, also accused the BJP of not prioritising the welfare of Maharashtra’s people, suggesting that while the BJP may focus on history, the state is looking at the future. In a direct challenge to the BJP, Thackeray asserted that the BJP thinks bad for Maharashtra and that the state would decline the BJP and would accept Maha Vikas Aghadi.“Maybe they are busy with the pages of history but Maharashtra is looking at the future. BJP thinks bad about Maharashtra. Maharashtra will decline the BJP; it will only accept MVA,” he said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde slammed the previous Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, stating that it would be remembered as an “anti-development government, reiterating that the voters of Pune would stand with the Mahayuti during the upcoming Maharashtra assembly polls.Addressing a public rally in Pune on Friday, Shinde accused the MVA of stalling major development projects and prioritising power over public welfare and criticised the MVA for forming an “unnatural alliance” driven by the “greed of power.”“I have come here after six public rallies throughout the day. Pune is an IT and manufacturing hub. It is the cultural city of the state. I know voters of Pune will stand behind Mahayuti. If you compare the work done by MVA and Mahayuti, they just stalled all projects like Jalyukt Shivar Yojana, Samruddhi Mahamarg, metro projects and others. MVA will be known as an anti-development government… They made an unnatural alliance for the greed of power,” he said.The Maharashtra assembly elections are scheduled for November 20, with votes for all 288 constituencies to be counted on November 23.The opposition MVA coalition, comprising Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and the Nationalist Congress Party (SCP), seeks to reclaim power in the state, challenging the Mahayuti alliance, which includes Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Ajit Pawar-led NCP.In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena secured 56, and Congress 44.

Addressing a crowd in Akola on Saturday, Modi said, “Wherever a Congress government is formed, that state becomes the ATM (Automated Teller Machine) of the party’s ‘shahi parivar’ (royal family). We won’t let Maharashtra become the ATM of the Congress.” The Prime Minister’s remarks were a direct criticism of the party’s alleged financial exploitation of states.\\n\\nModi didn’t hold back from criticizing the Congress’s record on Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s legacy, one of India’s most revered leaders and the architect of the Indian Constitution. He challenged the Congress party to prove its commitment to Ambedkar’s contributions, particularly his vision for a united India.\\n\\n“I challenge the shahi parivar of the Congress to prove if they ever visited Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s panchteerth,” Modi said, referring to five key locations associated with Ambedkar’s life. These include Ambedkar’s birthplace in Mhow, his residence in London, Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur where he embraced Buddhism, Mahaparinirvan Sthal in Delhi, and Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai. Modi’s comments were a pointed rebuke of the Congress, implying that the party had failed to honor the legacy of Ambedkar as it claimed.\\n\\nUnparalleled energy at the rally in Akola! Maharashtra stands firmly with the NDA.https://t.co/DjfwmpORDQ\\n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 9, 2024\\n\\nEk Hai To Safe Hai?\\n\\nIn a bid to unite voters ahead of the elections, Modi drew a parallel with the people of Haryana, who he claimed foiled the Congress’s attempts to divide society along caste lines. He invoked the slogan “Ek hai to safe hai,” which translates to “we are safe if we are united,” as a rallying cry for solidarity against the Congress’s alleged divisive tactics. Modi further accused the Congress of deliberately weakening the country by fostering caste-based divisions, claiming, “The Congress knows that it will be strengthened only if the country is weakened.”\\n\\nModi also took aim at the Maharashtra-based opposition alliance, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), describing it as synonymous with “corruption and scams worth thousands of crores of rupees.” He emphasized the corruption within the state government and criticized the MVA for its handling of Maharashtra’s resources. The Prime Minister continued his attack on the opposition, painting them as a party driven by self-interest rather than public service.\\n\\nTurning to his government’s achievements, PM Modi stated, “In my first two terms as Prime Minister, I have given four crore pucca houses to the poor,” he stated. The emphasis on the government’s welfare programs was part of his broader appeal to voters in Maharashtra, urging them to support the BJP-led Mahayuti (grand alliance) in the upcoming assembly elections.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister also took the opportunity to reflect on a significant date in Indian history. Referring to November 9, Modi recalled the 2019 Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, saying, “This date of November 9 will also be remembered because after the decision of the Supreme Court, people of every religion showed great sensitivity.” His reference to this key moment in India’s political history served as a subtle reminder of the BJP’s role in shaping the country’s cultural and religious landscape.\\n\\nMUST READ | Uddhav Thackeray Takes A Jibe At Mahayuti ‘Unity,’ Claims Cracks As Ajit Pawar Criticises Yogi’s ‘Katenge’ Slogan', 'summary': \"PM Modi in Akola slams Congress for exploiting states as 'ATMs' and calls for unity with his 'Ek Hai To Safe Hai' slogan, urging voters to support the BJP-led alliance.\\n\\n\\nThe post Maharashtra Election: PM Modi Accuses Congress Of Using States As ATMs appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/assembly-elections-2024/maharashtra/maharashtra-election-pm-modi-accuses-congress-of-using-states-as-atms/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PM-Modi.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 10:05:46', 'author': 'Satyam Singh', 'authors': ['Satyam Singh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.237}, {'id': 263734400, 'title': \"Maharashtra Election: PM Modi Accuses Congress Of 'Dividing' OBCs, Reiterates 'Ek Hain To Safe Hain' Slogan\", 'text': 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi teared into Congress on Saturday, accusing the party of trying to divide the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) for political gain.Speaking at a rally in Nanded, Maharashtra, the Prime Minister asserted that Congress cannot accept having an OBC Prime Minister for the last decade who has aimed to uplift all communities.Congress cannot tolerate the fact that there is an OBC Prime Minister who is taking everyone along with him, PM Modi stated.He alleged that Congress is attempting to fragment the OBC community by splitting it into smaller caste groups, aiming to weaken its collective influence.Congress is playing the game of eliminating the identity of OBC and dividing them into different castes.

India chooses its right to reply in response to the comments made by Pakistan that has yet again made an attempt to divert this august body from its agenda, Member of the Rajya Sabha and National Spokesperson of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Sudhanshu Trivedi said. His remarks came during a debate on peacekeeping operations at the Special Political and Decolonization (Fourth Committee) of the UN General Assembly here Friday. Trivedi asserted that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will remain an integral part of India. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have recently exercised their democratic and electoral rights and elected a new government. Pakistan must desist from such rhetoric and falsehood because it will not alter the facts, Trivedi said. He added that out of respect for the august members of the UN forum, India will refrain from responding to any further attempts by Pakistan to abuse the UN procedures. Trivedi delivered India's strong response after the Pakistani delegate spoke about the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), mandated to supervise the ceasefire along the Line of Control. India maintains that UNMOGIP has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control. Later in a post on X, Trivedi said that during discussions in the United Nations on peacekeeping operations, the representative from Pakistan, while speaking on the subject of UN peacekeeping, tried to digress the subject and unnecessarily mentioned that Pakistan's involvement with UN peacekeepers started when UN has put up peacekeepers in 1948 in territory Jammu and Kashmir. Trivedi added that taking a sharp exception of this remark, he exercised the Right of Reply and firmly stated on the floor that the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will remain an integral part of India. It has also recently gone through a proper democratic election. So the august forum of United Nations cannot be used in mentioning these types of non-substantive and misleading terms, Trivedi said. He added that this could have been possible because of firm foreign policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government for a strong and assertive India on the international stage. Trivedi is part of a delegation of 12 Members of Parliament from India who are visiting the UN for diverse engagements at the world body. Earlier, delivering a statement on the comprehensive review of peacekeeping operations, Trivedi said that recent conflicts are more challenging, spreading through myriad spectrums with volatile and complex settings now additionally involving terrorism and armed groups who are capitalising on the situation to serve their own objectives. India stands at the forefront in the effort to contribute to the peacekeeping efforts as the largest cumulative troop contributor to the UN peacekeeping operations. He added that India's cumulative experience is that in most cases today, conflict resolution lies in the sociopolitical domain. Highlighting the importance of realistic mandates , he said we must insist on practical and achievable mandates. Mission failures can be attributed to the non-robust mandates. This normally is the result when we keep the troops or police contributing countries out of the initial mandate formulation processes which we should avoid. He further said that in recent years, peacekeepers have experienced a great level of asymmetric threats ranging from land mines to IEDs. We cannot remain indifferent in this prospect. Trivedi also underscored that India upholds the safety and security of peacekeepers as one of the most important aspects of peacekeeping in a complex conflict scenario involving both state and non-state actors. It is necessary that the perpetrators of crime against peacekeepers need to be brought to justice and accountability for these crimes sought, he said. He further said that redundant peacekeeping missions existing for political purposes are a drain on depleting resources. Exit strategies for peacekeeping missions need to be built in from their very inception, he said. India is among the largest troop-contributing countries to UN peacekeeping missions. Trivedi also recalled the resolution passed by the General Assembly on establishing a memorial wall for fallen peacekeepers at a prominent location in UN Headquarters. There are many challenges in front of us, many decisions to be taken to ensure that the memorial wall is established in a manner befitting to its sanctity and its purpose, he said. UN peacekeeping is not just an operation, but it is a mission with utmost dedication. UN peacekeepers are making sacrifices not for just nationality, but for the whole humanity, he said.\", 'summary': 'At the UN, India criticised Pakistan for bringing up Jammu and Kashmir during a debate on peacekeeping.

Arya argued this framing is misleading and divisive.In a statement shared on the social media platform X, Arya wrote: On behalf of Hindu-Canadians and the vast majority of Sikh-Canadians, I again strongly condemn the attack by Khalistani extremists on Hindu devotees at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton. Politicians are deliberately avoiding recognizing and mentioning Khalistanis as responsible for this attack or are shifting the blame to other entities. They are misleading Canadians by framing this as an issue between Hindus and Sikhs. This is not true.

Hindus and Sikhs have been united throughout history, are united today, and will continue to be united in the future. We, as Hindus and Sikhs, will not and should not allow vested interests to divide us for their political gain, added the post.The Canadian MP said that politicians are portraying Hindus and Sikhs as opposing sides regarding the attack on the temple by Khalistani extremists. This picture is simply not true. The two sides are actually Hindu-Canadians and the vast majority of Sikh-Canadians on one side, and Khalistanis on the other, he said.Arya's post also highlighted the influence Khalistani supporters wield over certain Canadian Gurudwaras, quoting Sikh community leader and former British Columbia Premier Ujjal Dosanjh.According to Arya, Dosanjh noted that a silent majority of Sikhs do not want to have anything to do with Khalistan and that they just don't speak out because they're afraid of violence and violent repercussions. Dosanjh also mentioned that many Gurudwaras in Canada are controlled by Khalistani supporters. Arya further said that he understands that fear may prevent the silent majority of Sikhs from speaking out in Gurudwaras, but urged them to use the power of voting over which politicians get elected. Due to the deliberate actions of some politicians and the influence of Khalistanis, Canadians now mistakenly equate Khalistanis with Sikhs. Hindus and Sikhs alike must educate Canadians that we stand united in our fight against Khalistani extremists and their political backers, added the post. The Canadian MP called on Hindu and Sikh brothers and sisters across Canada to do two things: First, let politicians know that Hindus and the vast majority of Sikh-Canadians stand united on one side, while Khalistanis are on the other. Second, and importantly, I call on all Hindus and Sikhs in Canada to urge community leaders not to provide a platform at any of our events or temples to politicians unless they publicly recognize and expressly condemn Khalistani extremism.Khalistani extremists attacked Hindu-Canadian devotees within the Hindu Sabha temple premises in Brampton, Canada, on November 3.Following the attacks, the Hindu Canadian Foundation, a non-profit organisation working for the Hindu community in Canada, shared a video of the attack on the temple and said that the Khalistani terrorists attacked kids and women.PM Modi in a post on X also condemned the attack.

Hindus and Sikhs have been united throughout history, are united today, and will continue to be united in the future. We, as Hindus and Sikhs, will not and should not allow vested interests to divide us for their political gain,” added the post.The Canadian MP said that politicians are portraying Hindus and Sikhs as opposing sides regarding the attack on the temple by Khalistani extremists. “This picture is simply not true. The two sides are actually Hindu-Canadians and the vast majority of Sikh-Canadians on one side, and Khalistanis on the other,” he said.Arya’s post also highlighted the influence Khalistani supporters wield over certain Canadian Gurudwaras, quoting Sikh community leader and former British Columbia Premier Ujjal Dosanjh.According to Arya, Dosanjh noted that a “silent majority of Sikhs do not want to have anything to do with Khalistan and that they just don’t speak out because they’re afraid of violence and violent repercussions. Dosanjh also mentioned that many Gurudwaras in Canada are controlled by Khalistani supporters.”Arya further said that he understands that fear may prevent the silent majority of Sikhs from speaking out in Gurudwaras, but urged them to use the power of voting over which politicians get elected. “Due to the deliberate actions of some politicians and the influence of Khalistanis, Canadians now mistakenly equate Khalistanis with Sikhs. Hindus and Sikhs alike must educate Canadians that we stand united in our fight against Khalistani extremists and their political backers,” added the post. The Canadian MP called on Hindu and Sikh brothers and sisters across Canada to do two things: First, let politicians know that Hindus and the vast majority of Sikh-Canadians stand united on one side, while Khalistanis are on the other. Second, and importantly, I call on all Hindus and Sikhs in Canada to urge community leaders not to provide a platform at any of our events or temples to politicians unless they publicly recognize and expressly condemn Khalistani extremism.Khalistani extremists attacked Hindu-Canadian devotees within the Hindu Sabha temple premises in Brampton, Canada, on November 3.Following the attacks, the Hindu Canadian Foundation, a non-profit organisation working for the Hindu community in Canada, shared a video of the attack on the temple and said that the Khalistani terrorists attacked kids and women.PM Modi in a post on X also condemned the attack.\\n\\nI strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada.

The airline, which recently completed the merger of AIX Connect with itself, has a fleet of around 90 aircraft and the count is expected to cross 110 by the end of this fiscal. It also aims to fly to a total of 55 destinations by the end of March 2025 and has also rationalised its network as part of Air India Group strategy. Apart from adding domestic routes, the Tata Group-owned airline will start flights to more foreign destinations, including Bangkok and Phuket in Thailand, the officials said. Air India Express Managing Director Aloke Singh said the airline will focus on Tier 2 and 3 cities and towns as they are the growth engines, and the largest chunk of the market is metro to non-metro. On the regional short haul international network, it will be primarily from Tier 2, 3 cities to points in the Gulf, Middle East, South East Asia and going forward, South Asia. Perhaps, Far East in a couple of years, Singh said at a select media interaction on Friday. He also stressed that the airline's network strategy is also deeply woven into the group network strategy. As part of consolidating its airline business, Tata Group has merged AIX Connect with Air India Express and the integration of Vistara with Air India is scheduled to be completed next week. Air India Express Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Ankur Garg said that Bangkok and Phuket are being looked at to start services. To Bangkok, the flights are likely from Tier 2 cities and to Phuket, the service could be from a metro, Garg said. Among other destinations, the airline might also explore the possibility of flying to Malaysia, Hong Kong and CIS countries in the future. We don't want to spread too thin.

However, he sought permission from the court to advance more arguments, saying the prosecution presented arguments contrary to the facts.He requested the court to defer the decision for one hearing.Judge Arshad Javed of the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) here then announced the decision, allowing Khan's bail petitions in the four cases.Khan, who was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan, has been in jail since then in different cases, with conviction in few of them.Separately, ATC-I judge Manzer Ali Gill gave one last opportunity to Khan's counsel to complete arguments in post-arrest bail petitions in eight other cases connected with the May 9 riots, including an attack on the senior military officer’s residence in Lahore.The judge said a decision in the eight cases will be announced in the light of the record of the cases if the petitioner’s counsel does not appear at the next hearing.The judge adjourned the hearing till November 30.\", 'summary': 'Imran Khan Granted Bail In Four Cases Related To May 9 Violence', 'url': 'https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/imran-khan-granted-bail-in-four-cases-related-to-may-9-violence', 'image': 'https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/imran-khan-offers-apology-if-pti-members-found-guilty-in-may-9-riots-demands-accountability-for-all-1723050255495-9_16.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 13:27:53', 'author': 'Press Trust Of India', 'authors': ['Press Trust Of India'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.199}]}, {'news': [{'id': 263674030, 'title': 'Kerala: Operations at Thiruvananthapuram Airport to remain suspended for five hours today', 'text': 'Ahead of the celebrations for the ‘Alpassi Arattu’ procession, the operations at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport in Kerala will remain suspended on Saturday.

Musk has been a strong supporter of Trump, consistently backing his presidential campaign. Now that Trump has emerged as the President-elect, the focus has shifted to potential roles Musk may play in the upcoming administration.\\n\\nWill Elon Musk Have a Role in Trump Admin\\n\\nDonald Trump had previously suggested that Elon Musk might have a position in his administration, but the specifics of the role remained unclear. However, recent events have given a glimpse into the possible nature of Musk’s involvement. On Wednesday, Musk was present with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s luxurious residence in Palm Beach, Florida, when the President-elect received a call from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\nDuring the call, Trump reportedly handed the phone to Musk and invited him to join the conversation with Zelensky. The exact details of what was discussed between Musk and Zelensky have not been disclosed, but it is unclear whether it involved a shift in U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\\n\\nMusk reassures Zelensky\\n\\nThe call itself lasted around thirty minutes, during which Zelensky congratulated Trump on his electoral victory. Trump, in turn, assured Zelensky of continued U.S. support for Ukraine, though he did not provide specifics regarding future actions. Musk, for his part, reassured Zelensky that he would maintain support for Ukraine through his Starlink satellite network, which has been instrumental in helping Ukraine’s military by facilitating communication and providing real-time data, especially in areas where traditional mobile networks have been disrupted.\\n\\nReactions and Implications\\n\\nAxios reported that there were two major surprises during the call: the involvement of Elon Musk and Zelensky’s reaction to the conversation, which was described as somewhat reassuring. This development underscores the growing influence Musk may have in Trump’s administration, particularly in foreign policy matters. Earlier, Trump had hinted at his desire to end wars, stating in his victory speech that he would work to help end conflicts rather than starting new ones. His ongoing collaboration with Musk, especially regarding Ukraine, signals the potential for a deeper, more active role for Musk in global affairs during Trump’s second term.\\n\\nIn September, Trump and Zelensky met in New York at the United Nations General Assembly, where they discussed potential diplomatic solutions to the ongoing war with Russia. Following this latest call, Zelensky expressed his appreciation, noting that he had a productive conversation with Trump and congratulated him on his victory, signaling a positive outlook on future relations.\\n\\nRead More: Trump Triumph Could Fuel Musk’s Elon Musk’s Mars Dream – Here’s How', 'summary': \"On Wednesday, Musk was present with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's luxurious residence in Palm Beach, Florida, when the President-elect received a call from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\n\\nThe post Elon Musk Joins Trump&#8217;s Call With Zelenskyy In A Sign Of His Possible Role appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/us-elections-2024/elon-musk-joins-trumps-call-with-zelenskyy-in-a-sign-of-his-possible-role/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Elon-Musk-Zelenskyy-Trump-US-election-result-Trump-Adminstration.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 04:56:30', 'author': 'Zubair Amin', 'authors': ['Zubair Amin'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.075}, {'id': 263711976, 'title': 'Elon Musk Joins Trump’s “Excellent” Call With Zelensky Amid Advisory Role Buzz | Russia-Ukraine War', 'text': 'Billionaire Elon Musk took part in a phone call between the Ukrainian President and US President-elect Donald Trump after his election victory, as per a report. \"I confirm it,\" a Ukrainian presidency official told AFP about the call held shortly after Trump secured the presidential election win on Nov. 6.A high-ranking Ukrainian presidential source told AFP that Musk was physically present with Trump during the call.

Rahul Gandhi in an attack on the BJP-led NDA alliance said that they are levelling \"false allegations\" against Congress for not fulfilling its promises. In a social media post on X, Rahul Gandhi wrote, \"In July 2022, PM Modi misled the country by calling Congress\\'s public welfare schemes \\'free revdi\\'. Yet they are campaigning in every state and the country by pasting their slips on the guarantees given by the Congress - and then levelling false allegations against the Congress for not fulfilling its promises. Modiji, our challenge is, come to Karnataka, roam around and see, investigate - we have fulfilled every promise. Congress\\' schemes in Karnataka have changed the fate of crores of women, youth, farmers and the poor. We have also fulfilled promises in Telangana and Himachal. And now in Maharashtra too, INDIA is going to bring big changes with its 5 guarantees.\" Referring to the five guarantees, Rahul Gandhi said that these schemes will give people the strength to fight \"BJP-induced inflation and unemployment.\" He further said that the INDIA\\'s five guarantees will free every section of Maharashtra from injustice and provide them a way to live with self-respect. The tweet added, \"These schemes will give people the strength to fight BJP-induced inflation and unemployment - their standard of living will improve - their access to good education and nutrition will increase. I am saying this with so much confidence because it is tried and tested. Today 1.21 crore women in Karnataka are benefiting from Congress\\'s Mahalakshmi scheme. INDIA\\'s 5 guarantees will free every section of Maharashtra from the labyrinth of injustice and provide them a way to live with self-respect.\" On November 6, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) announced five guarantees ahead of Maharashtra assembly polls at a joint rally in Mumbai. Rahul Gandhi announced Mahalakshmi Yojana for women. Under this scheme, Rs 3,000 will be given per month to one woman in every family. Besides, every woman will be entitled to free bus travel under the scheme. The MVA promised to waive off all farmers\\' agriculture loans up to Rs 3 lakhs.

A criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan alleges that an unnamed official in Iran\\'s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed a contact in September to put together a plan to surveil and ultimately kill Trump.“The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran’s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump ,\" read a press release by the Justice Department.It is learnt that Tehran ordered to pause the deadly attack in case Shakeri was unable to plan the murder plot as the Iranian official believed Trump would lose the polls and it would be easier to assassinate him then, the complaint said.As per the complaint, Shakeri told the FBI he didn\\'t plan to propose a plan to murder Trump within within the timeframe ( seven days) set by the IRGC. Shakeri informed the law enforcement that he was tasked on October 7 this year with providing a plan to kill President-elect Donald J. Trump. He also stated he was tasked with surveilling two Jewish American citizens residing in New York City and offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either victim. He was also tasked with targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka, as per the press release.Who is Farjad Shakeri?A resident of Iran\\'s capital Tehran, Farjad Shakeri (51) immigrated to the United States as a child before being deported in or about 2008 after serving 14 years in prison for a robbery conviction. In recent months, Shakeri used a network of criminal associates he met in prison in the United States to supply the IRGC with operatives to conduct surveillance and assassinations of IRGC targets.Two key members of his network include his co-defendants, Jonathon Loadholt (36) of Staten Island in New York and Carlisle Rivera alias Pop (49) of Brooklyn in New York.The trio have also been charged in a criminal complaint in connection with their alleged involvement in a plot to murder a US citizen of Iranian origin, an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime, in New York. The alleged target of Iran, US citizen, has been the target of multiple prior plots for kidnapping and/or murder directed by the Government of Iran, the Justice Department said.While Rivera and Loadholt was arrested from Brooklyn and Staten Island, respectively, Shakeri remains at large and is believed to be in Iran.Charges Against Farjad Shakeri Shakeri, Rivera, and Loadholt have all been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; and money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. “The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran’s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump.

The 51-year-old allegedly masterminded a murder-for-hire operation in coordination with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).On November 8, Shakeri and two others were charged in a criminal complaint for their alleged involvement in the plot to assassinate a US citizen of Iranian descent in New York. While the other two suspects were arrested, Shakeri remains at large and is believed to be in Iran.According to a criminal complaint, in September 2024, Shakeri was instructed by an official from the IRGC to focus on “assassinating, former President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.” This directive came after Shakeri had already been involved in multiple operations on behalf of the IRGC, utilising his criminal network to support the group\\'s agenda.The criminal complaint added that according to Shakeri, during his meeting with an IRGC official on or about October 7, 2024, he was instructed to provide a plan within seven days to kill Trump. If Shakeri failed to do so within that timeframe, the IRGC official said the plan would be delayed until after the US Presidential elections. It was believed that Trump would lose, and it would then be easier to carry out the assassination. Shakeri told the FBI that he did not intend to propose a plan within the set deadline.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The US Department of Justice stated, “Shakeri has informed law enforcement that he was tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill President-elect Donald J. Trump. During the interview, Shakeri claimed he did not intend to propose a plan to kill Trump within the timeframe set by the IRGC.”Shakeri was also assigned to keep an eye on two Jewish American citizens in New York and was offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either target. Additionally, he was instructed to target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka.Background of Farhad ShakeriShakeri, an asset of the IRGC based in Tehran, immigrated to the US as a child. He was deported in 2008 after serving 14 years for a robbery conviction. In recent months, Shakeri has been involved in leveraging a network of criminal associates he met in US prisons to assist the IRGC. He has reportedly been supplying the IRGC with operatives for conducting surveillance and assassinations targeting individuals of interest, according to the US Department of Justice.Though he was deported in 2008, his parole monitoring continued until 2015. In 2019, he was detained in Sri Lanka in connection with the seizure of a large quantity of heroin, highlighting an ongoing series of alleged criminal activities linked to his network.Shakeri faces multiple charges, including conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, which could result in up to 20 years in prison. He is also charged with providing material support to the same organisation, as well as conspiring to violate sanctions against the Iranian government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, each of which carries a potential 20-year prison sentence.', 'summary': 'Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national who was deported from the United States in 2008, has been accused of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump.', 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-farhad-shakeri-afghan-man-behind-alleged-iran-plot-to-kill-trump-6978018', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/s3p31418_trump-afp_625x300_09_November_24.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 06:01:51', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.202}, {'id': 263713888, 'title': \"Who is Farhad Shakeri, mastermind behind Iran's plot to kill President-elect Trump\", 'text': 'The US Department of Justice on Friday announced charges against a man allegedly directed by Iran to orchestrate the assassination of US President-elect Donald Trump during his campaign period.According to the charges, an operative from Iran\\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps(IRGC), which the US designates as a terrorist organisation, had directed Afghan national Farhad Shakeri to devise the scheme in October.Attorney General Merrick B Garland said: \"There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as Iran.\"Garland elaborated that the Justice Department \"has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran\\'s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump\".FBI Director Christopher Wray said: \"The charges announced today expose Iran\\'s continued brazen attempts to target US citizens, including President-elect Donald Trump, other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the regime in Tehran.\"Based on FBI agents\\' reports, Shakeri revealed details about a planned assassination attempt on Trump during phone discussions in recent months.

The decision came barely 11 days before the upcoming November 20 Maharashtra Assembly elections, taking the SS(UBT) circles by surprise. A terse notification signed by the party Secretary Vinayak Raut was issued this morning on a day when the SS(UBT) President Uddhav Thackeray is expected to address an election rally in Hingoli on Saturday. A party leader in Nagpur said that Wankhede was reportedly attempting to sabotage the prospects of the official MVA candidates in and around Hingoli and making efforts to help the nominees of rival parties. He was also accused of other alleged irregularities, after which the SS(UBT) hit back with the expulsion orders late on Friday night. Earlier with the (undivided) Shiv Sena, Wankhede, 63, served as a MLA thrice from the Hadgaon Assembly seat in 1995, 1999, 2004 and then as Lok Sabha MP from 2009, but lost the Lok Sabha polls in 2014. After the Shiv Sena split in June 2022, Wankhede chose to remain with the Thackeray-led faction and was hopeful of getting a party ticket in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, but the party fielded Nagesh B. Patil-Ashetkar who trounced the rival Shiv Sena's contender Hemant S. Patil. The MVA alliance of Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (SP)-Shiv Sena (UBT) is going full steam in the Maharashtra Assembly polls hoping to unseat the Mahayuti of the Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party-Nationalist Congress Party, under drastically changed circumstances compared with 2019. That year (2019), after a fractured mandate, the MVA alliance took power with Thackeray as the CM. However, after a vertical split in his party, he was unseated and Eknath Shinde took over. A year later in July 2023, the NCP founded by Sharad Pawar also split and one faction headed by his nephew Ajit Pawar joined the Mahayuti regime, presenting challenges for all the parties in the 2024 Assembly polls, with voting scheduled on November 20.

The incident involved two passenger coaches and one parcel van, but fortunately, no injuries or fatalities have been reported. South Eastern Railway officials quickly dispatched accident relief and medical teams to the scene, and buses were arranged to transport affected passengers to Kolkata. Railway authorities are currently investigating the cause of the derailment.\\n\\nDetails of the Incident\\n\\nThe derailment occurred while the train was transitioning from the middle line to the down line near Nalpur station, located about 40 km from Kolkata. Om Prakash Charan, Chief Public Relations Officer of South Eastern Railway, confirmed that at 5:31 AM, the Secunderabad-Shalimar train derailed, involving one parcel van and two passenger coaches. “No major injury or casualty has been reported,” Charan stated, emphasizing the rapid response by railway officials. In addition to sending an accident relief train from Santragachi and Kharagpur, around ten buses were arranged for passengers to continue their journey to Kolkata. Passengers expressed relief at their safety; one traveler noted, “It was a frightening moment, but I’m grateful for how quickly help arrived.”\\n\\nRecent Developments and Official Statements\\n\\nFollowing this incident, railway authorities have activated helplines for passengers affected by the derailment. This event comes on the heels of other derailments in Tamil Nadu and Assam within recent weeks, which also resulted in no injuries but raised concerns about railway safety standards. In a statement regarding overall railway safety improvements, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw noted a significant reduction in annual railway accidents from 171 a decade ago to just 40 currently. Officials are now focused on determining the cause of this latest derailment while ensuring that normal train services are restored as quickly as possible. Advocacy groups have called for enhanced safety measures and more rigorous inspections to prevent future incidents.\\n\\nContext of Railway Safety in India\\n\\nThis derailment highlights ongoing challenges within India’s railway system. Historical data indicates a troubling pattern of accidents over the years, prompting calls for improved safety protocols. In light of recent incidents, experts are urging Indian Railways to invest in modern technology and infrastructure upgrades to enhance passenger safety. As public scrutiny increases, it is crucial for authorities to address these concerns transparently.\\n\\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective\\n\\nThe recent derailment of the Secunderabad-Shalimar Express underscores the critical need for ongoing improvements in railway safety across India. While it is fortunate that no injuries occurred this time, we must advocate for continuous enhancements in infrastructure and safety measures to prevent future incidents.

So the family intervened. And, you know, my mother has no memory of it to this day, and I respect her as the woman who birthed me. But, you know, I’m also glad that my aunt intervened and put me on the right path. She would bring me to some of her places, and I would stay in the library while she cleaned the house. I loved books at an early age, so I was content.”\\nElliston enrolled him on summer courses and encouraged his passion for theatre. She even helped him financially during his initial days as a young actor in New York. Although Todd had reconnected with his mother, he shared that dealing with the difficult experiences from his early years motivated him throughout his career.\\nAlong with wife, Fatima, Tony Todd is survived by his two children, Alex and Ariana.', 'summary': 'Tony Todd passed away on November 6 at his home in Marina del Rey, California.', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/movies/final-destination-star-tony-todd-69-dies-after-long-battle-with-unknown-illness-9114670.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/untitled-design-2024-11-09t161927.847-2024-11-a23702316419a7d3104704f15612986b-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 10:50:40', 'author': 'News18,Sahas,Yatamanyu Narain', 'authors': ['News18', 'Sahas', 'Yatamanyu Narain'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.827}, {'id': 263713270, 'title': 'Woman Working in Paddy Fields Gunned Down by Militants in Manipur', 'text': \"Imphal: A woman working in the paddy fields was gunned down by suspected hills-based militants in Manipur 's Bishnupur district on Saturday, officials said.The incident took place in Saiton area when the woman, along with other farmers, went to tend to the crops when militants opened fire from hill-based positions on the low-lying farmlands in Imphal Valley.The woman died on the spot, the officials said, adding the incident sparked tension in the village with the locals alleging that the central forces deployed in the area were not taking action to thwart such attacks.Additional security forces have been sent to the area.The killing came two days after a 31-year-old woman was killed in an attack by unidentified persons on Zairon Hmar village in Jiribam district on Thursday night.Six houses were burnt in the incident.

Sitharaman said that 40 per cent of all government procurements is coming from MSMEs. “That is why we have more than 2 lakh startups today in India and more than 130 have become unicorns. The opportunity is immense but is not fully utilised,” she said. It is the same with digital banking transformation that is happening in India, she added. According to her, opportunities were created for the common people through Jan Dhan Yojana. “India's approach to spreading digital networks was funded by the government, while many other countries went through private players, resulting in some nominal charges somewhere. Because of this, even micro-level users also access digital banking without having to pay for it,” Sitharaman said, and added that in the future this will only grow. “Therefore, technology will have to be continuously updated so that we don't become redundant.” She also explained the concept of the 'Fund of Funds' offered by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, which is enabled by the Central government by infusing Rs 10,000 crore to help small businesses and innovative ideas needing support. “Private equity funds are also backing this because we have given them concessions,” she added. As for the latest government scheme offering one crore internships to the unemployable, Sitharaman urged the students present to help get the target audience on to the platform so that more youth can become skilled.\", 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/karnataka/patriarchy-did-not-stop-indira-gandhi-from-becoming-pm-nirmala-sitharaman-1836795', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/09/1860879-9nirmalasitharaman.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 12:02:26', 'author': 'PTI', 'authors': ['PTI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.115}, {'id': 263737974, 'title': \"'Patriarchy Did Not Stop Indira Gandhi From Becoming PM': Nirmala Sitharaman\", 'text': 'If patriarchy stopped women from achieving what they want in India, how come Indira Gandhi made it as prime minister, asked Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.\\n\\nShe met the students of CMS Business School here on Saturday and discussed various measures undertaken by the Centre to support innovation as well as the government schemes available for young people, including the 1 crore internships for the ‘unemployable youth\\' in the age group of 21 to 24.\\n\\nReplying to a question about women empowerment, Ms Sitharaman insisted that patriarchy is a concept invented by the Left.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t get carried away by fantastic jargon.

Trump has vowed to carry out the largest mass deportation in US history, stoking fears of increased illegal and irregular migration to Canada.As per the news agency AFP, the day after Trump won the election, online searches in the US over moving to Canada surged with terms like \"immigrate to Canada\" and \"how to move to Canada.\" These search results showed growing anxiety about the incoming administration\\'s immigration policies, though the legal status of those making these inquiries remains unclear.Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sergeant Charles Poirier confirmed that officials are monitoring the US border closely. \"We know that Trump\\'s stance on immigration might drive up illegal and irregular migration to Canada,\" he said, expressing concern that it could lead to a surge in border crossings. RCMP has been ramping up its presence along the 5,525-mile-long border, which is the world’s longest unmilitarized border. In addition to deploying more officers, the Canadian authorities have set up cameras, sensors, and drones to monitor the situation. Real-time information is being exchanged between Canada and the US, but Poirier warned that if thousands of migrants attempt to cross all at once, the situation could become unmanageable.In response, Canada\\'s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland assured the public that the government has a plan in place to handle any potential challenges. \"We have a plan,\" Freeland told during a news conference but declined to provide specifics, reported the news agency AFP. She reassured Canadians that their borders remain \"safe and secure,\" despite concerns about a possible rise in migrant arrivals. As Canada prepares, it is also cutting its own immigration targets, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s government aiming to slow population growth to focus on bolstering infrastructure and social services. Quebec Premier Francois Legault voiced concerns over the strain on the province’s ability to accommodate large numbers of migrants, fearing it could overwhelm housing and resources. Canada’s response comes at a time when the US has made it harder for migrants to make successful asylum claims, particularly for those coming from the United States. The wait time for refugee claims in Canada now extends to up to 44 months, and any migrants attempting to enter through unofficial border points risk being turned back or facing severe dangers. As winter approaches, authorities are particularly concerned about the dangers migrants face when attempting to cross illegally through forests, lakes, and rivers, which can result in frostbite, hypothermia, and even death.', 'summary': \"Canadian authorities are increasing security measures at the US border, anticipating a potential surge in migrants due to President-elect Donald Trump's strict immigration policies.  The RCMP is deploying more resources and collaborating with US officials to monitor the situation, while the Canadian government assures preparedness for potential challenges.\", 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-on-high-alert-braces-for-potential-migrant-surge-from-us-after-trumps-return-to-power/articleshow/115116321.cms', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115116561/115116561.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 12:54:22', 'author': 'Toi World Desk', 'authors': ['Toi World Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': -0.044}, {'id': 263736302, 'title': 'Minor NEET aspirant held hostage, raped for months in Kanpur by coaching teachers', 'text': \"Kanpur: A minor student from Fatehpur who moved here to prepare for her medical entrance exam NEET at a prominent coaching institute was allegedly held hostage for over six months and raped by two of its teachers, police said on Saturday. They said the ordeal began for the student in December 2022, when she was putting up at a city hostel. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Kalyanpur) Abhishek Pandey said the case was registered on Friday after she approached the Kalyanpur police station.Both teachers -- Sahil Siddiqui, who taught biology, and Vikas Porwal, who taught chemistry -- have been arrested and charged with offences of rape, wrongful confinement, criminal intimidation and under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act.

Pune is an IT and manufacturing hub. It is the cultural city of the state. I know voters of Pune will stand behind Mahayuti. If you compare the work done by MVA and Mahayuti, they just stalled all projects like Jalyukt Shivar Yojana, Samruddhi Mahamarg, metro projects and others.

Addressing a crowd in Akola on Saturday, Modi said, “Wherever a Congress government is formed, that state becomes the ATM (Automated Teller Machine) of the party’s ‘shahi parivar’ (royal family). We won’t let Maharashtra become the ATM of the Congress.” The Prime Minister’s remarks were a direct criticism of the party’s alleged financial exploitation of states.\\n\\nModi didn’t hold back from criticizing the Congress’s record on Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s legacy, one of India’s most revered leaders and the architect of the Indian Constitution. He challenged the Congress party to prove its commitment to Ambedkar’s contributions, particularly his vision for a united India.\\n\\n“I challenge the shahi parivar of the Congress to prove if they ever visited Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s panchteerth,” Modi said, referring to five key locations associated with Ambedkar’s life. These include Ambedkar’s birthplace in Mhow, his residence in London, Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur where he embraced Buddhism, Mahaparinirvan Sthal in Delhi, and Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai.

He invoked the slogan “Ek hai to safe hai,” which translates to “we are safe if we are united,” as a rallying cry for solidarity against the Congress’s alleged divisive tactics. Modi further accused the Congress of deliberately weakening the country by fostering caste-based divisions, claiming, “The Congress knows that it will be strengthened only if the country is weakened.”\\n\\nModi also took aim at the Maharashtra-based opposition alliance, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), describing it as synonymous with “corruption and scams worth thousands of crores of rupees.” He emphasized the corruption within the state government and criticized the MVA for its handling of Maharashtra’s resources. The Prime Minister continued his attack on the opposition, painting them as a party driven by self-interest rather than public service.\\n\\nTurning to his government’s achievements, PM Modi stated, “In my first two terms as Prime Minister, I have given four crore pucca houses to the poor,” he stated. The emphasis on the government’s welfare programs was part of his broader appeal to voters in Maharashtra, urging them to support the BJP-led Mahayuti (grand alliance) in the upcoming assembly elections.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister also took the opportunity to reflect on a significant date in Indian history. Referring to November 9, Modi recalled the 2019 Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, saying, “This date of November 9 will also be remembered because after the decision of the Supreme Court, people of every religion showed great sensitivity.” His reference to this key moment in India’s political history served as a subtle reminder of the BJP’s role in shaping the country’s cultural and religious landscape.\\n\\nMUST READ | Uddhav Thackeray Takes A Jibe At Mahayuti ‘Unity,’ Claims Cracks As Ajit Pawar Criticises Yogi’s ‘Katenge’ Slogan', 'summary': \"PM Modi in Akola slams Congress for exploiting states as 'ATMs' and calls for unity with his 'Ek Hai To Safe Hai' slogan, urging voters to support the BJP-led alliance.\\n\\n\\nThe post Maharashtra Election: PM Modi Accuses Congress Of Using States As ATMs appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/assembly-elections-2024/maharashtra/maharashtra-election-pm-modi-accuses-congress-of-using-states-as-atms/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PM-Modi.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 10:05:46', 'author': 'Satyam Singh', 'authors': ['Satyam Singh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.237}, {'id': 263734400, 'title': \"Maharashtra Election: PM Modi Accuses Congress Of 'Dividing' OBCs, Reiterates 'Ek Hain To Safe Hain' Slogan\", 'text': 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi teared into Congress on Saturday, accusing the party of trying to divide the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) for political gain.Speaking at a rally in Nanded, Maharashtra, the Prime Minister asserted that Congress cannot accept having an OBC Prime Minister for the last decade who has aimed to uplift all communities.Congress cannot tolerate the fact that there is an OBC Prime Minister who is taking everyone along with him, PM Modi stated.He alleged that Congress is attempting to fragment the OBC community by splitting it into smaller caste groups, aiming to weaken its collective influence.Congress is playing the game of eliminating the identity of OBC and dividing them into different castes.

So the august forum of United Nations cannot be used in mentioning these types of non-substantive and misleading terms,” Trivedi said.He added that this could have been “possible because of firm foreign policies” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi -led government for a “strong and assertive India on the international stage.” Trivedi is part of a delegation of 12 Members of Parliament from India who are visiting the UN for diverse engagements at the world body.Earlier, delivering a statement on the comprehensive review of peacekeeping operations, Trivedi said that recent conflicts are more challenging, spreading through myriad spectrums with volatile and complex settings now additionally involving terrorism and armed groups who are capitalising on the situation to serve their own objectives.“India stands at the forefront in the effort to contribute to the peacekeeping efforts as the largest cumulative troop contributor to the UN peacekeeping operations.” He added that India’s cumulative experience is that in most cases today, conflict resolution lies in the sociopolitical domain.Highlighting the importance of “realistic mandates”, he said “we must insist on practical and achievable mandates. Mission failures can be attributed to the non-robust mandates.This normally is the result when we keep the troops or police contributing countries out of the initial mandate formulation processes which we should avoid.” He further said that in recent years, peacekeepers have experienced a great level of asymmetric threats ranging from land mines to IEDs. “We cannot remain indifferent in this prospect.” Trivedi also underscored that India upholds the safety and security of peacekeepers as one of the most important aspects of peacekeeping in a complex conflict scenario involving both state and non-state actors.“It is necessary that the perpetrators of crime against peacekeepers need to be brought to justice and accountability for these crimes sought,” he said.He further said that redundant peacekeeping missions existing for political purposes are a drain on depleting resources.\"Exit strategies for peacekeeping missions need to be built in from their very inception,” he said.India is among the largest troop-contributing countries to UN peacekeeping missions.Trivedi also recalled the resolution passed by the General Assembly on establishing a memorial wall for fallen peacekeepers at a prominent location in UN Headquarters. “There are many challenges in front of us, many decisions to be taken to ensure that the memorial wall is established in a manner befitting to its sanctity and its purpose,” he said.“UN peacekeeping is not just an operation, but it is a mission with utmost dedication.

India maintains that UNMOGIP has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control. Later in a post on X, Trivedi said that during discussions in the United Nations on peacekeeping operations, the representative from Pakistan, while speaking on the subject of UN peacekeeping, tried to digress the subject and unnecessarily mentioned that Pakistan's involvement with UN peacekeepers started when UN has put up peacekeepers in 1948 in territory Jammu and Kashmir. Trivedi added that taking a sharp exception of this remark, he exercised the Right of Reply and firmly stated on the floor that the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will remain an integral part of India. It has also recently gone through a proper democratic election. So the august forum of United Nations cannot be used in mentioning these types of non-substantive and misleading terms, Trivedi said. He added that this could have been possible because of firm foreign policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government for a strong and assertive India on the international stage. Trivedi is part of a delegation of 12 Members of Parliament from India who are visiting the UN for diverse engagements at the world body. Earlier, delivering a statement on the comprehensive review of peacekeeping operations, Trivedi said that recent conflicts are more challenging, spreading through myriad spectrums with volatile and complex settings now additionally involving terrorism and armed groups who are capitalising on the situation to serve their own objectives. India stands at the forefront in the effort to contribute to the peacekeeping efforts as the largest cumulative troop contributor to the UN peacekeeping operations. He added that India's cumulative experience is that in most cases today, conflict resolution lies in the sociopolitical domain. Highlighting the importance of realistic mandates , he said we must insist on practical and achievable mandates. Mission failures can be attributed to the non-robust mandates. This normally is the result when we keep the troops or police contributing countries out of the initial mandate formulation processes which we should avoid. He further said that in recent years, peacekeepers have experienced a great level of asymmetric threats ranging from land mines to IEDs. We cannot remain indifferent in this prospect. Trivedi also underscored that India upholds the safety and security of peacekeepers as one of the most important aspects of peacekeeping in a complex conflict scenario involving both state and non-state actors. It is necessary that the perpetrators of crime against peacekeepers need to be brought to justice and accountability for these crimes sought, he said. He further said that redundant peacekeeping missions existing for political purposes are a drain on depleting resources. Exit strategies for peacekeeping missions need to be built in from their very inception, he said. India is among the largest troop-contributing countries to UN peacekeeping missions. Trivedi also recalled the resolution passed by the General Assembly on establishing a memorial wall for fallen peacekeepers at a prominent location in UN Headquarters. There are many challenges in front of us, many decisions to be taken to ensure that the memorial wall is established in a manner befitting to its sanctity and its purpose, he said. UN peacekeeping is not just an operation, but it is a mission with utmost dedication. UN peacekeepers are making sacrifices not for just nationality, but for the whole humanity, he said.\", 'summary': 'At the UN, India criticised Pakistan for bringing up Jammu and Kashmir during a debate on peacekeeping.

Musk has been a strong supporter of Trump, consistently backing his presidential campaign. Now that Trump has emerged as the President-elect, the focus has shifted to potential roles Musk may play in the upcoming administration.\\n\\nWill Elon Musk Have a Role in Trump Admin\\n\\nDonald Trump had previously suggested that Elon Musk might have a position in his administration, but the specifics of the role remained unclear. However, recent events have given a glimpse into the possible nature of Musk’s involvement. On Wednesday, Musk was present with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s luxurious residence in Palm Beach, Florida, when the President-elect received a call from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\nDuring the call, Trump reportedly handed the phone to Musk and invited him to join the conversation with Zelensky. The exact details of what was discussed between Musk and Zelensky have not been disclosed, but it is unclear whether it involved a shift in U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\\n\\nMusk reassures Zelensky\\n\\nThe call itself lasted around thirty minutes, during which Zelensky congratulated Trump on his electoral victory. Trump, in turn, assured Zelensky of continued U.S. support for Ukraine, though he did not provide specifics regarding future actions. Musk, for his part, reassured Zelensky that he would maintain support for Ukraine through his Starlink satellite network, which has been instrumental in helping Ukraine’s military by facilitating communication and providing real-time data, especially in areas where traditional mobile networks have been disrupted.\\n\\nReactions and Implications\\n\\nAxios reported that there were two major surprises during the call: the involvement of Elon Musk and Zelensky’s reaction to the conversation, which was described as somewhat reassuring. This development underscores the growing influence Musk may have in Trump’s administration, particularly in foreign policy matters. Earlier, Trump had hinted at his desire to end wars, stating in his victory speech that he would work to help end conflicts rather than starting new ones. His ongoing collaboration with Musk, especially regarding Ukraine, signals the potential for a deeper, more active role for Musk in global affairs during Trump’s second term.\\n\\nIn September, Trump and Zelensky met in New York at the United Nations General Assembly, where they discussed potential diplomatic solutions to the ongoing war with Russia. Following this latest call, Zelensky expressed his appreciation, noting that he had a productive conversation with Trump and congratulated him on his victory, signaling a positive outlook on future relations.\\n\\nRead More: Trump Triumph Could Fuel Musk’s Elon Musk’s Mars Dream – Here’s How', 'summary': \"On Wednesday, Musk was present with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's luxurious residence in Palm Beach, Florida, when the President-elect received a call from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\n\\nThe post Elon Musk Joins Trump&#8217;s Call With Zelenskyy In A Sign Of His Possible Role appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/us-elections-2024/elon-musk-joins-trumps-call-with-zelenskyy-in-a-sign-of-his-possible-role/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Elon-Musk-Zelenskyy-Trump-US-election-result-Trump-Adminstration.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 04:56:30', 'author': 'Zubair Amin', 'authors': ['Zubair Amin'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.075}, {'id': 263711976, 'title': 'Elon Musk Joins Trump’s “Excellent” Call With Zelensky Amid Advisory Role Buzz | Russia-Ukraine War', 'text': 'Billionaire Elon Musk took part in a phone call between the Ukrainian President and US President-elect Donald Trump after his election victory, as per a report. \"I confirm it,\" a Ukrainian presidency official told AFP about the call held shortly after Trump secured the presidential election win on Nov. 6.A high-ranking Ukrainian presidential source told AFP that Musk was physically present with Trump during the call.

Shakeri informed the law enforcement that he was tasked on October 7 this year with providing a plan to kill President-elect Donald J. Trump. He also stated he was tasked with surveilling two Jewish American citizens residing in New York City and offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either victim.

While the other two suspects were arrested, Shakeri remains at large and is believed to be in Iran.According to a criminal complaint, in September 2024, Shakeri was instructed by an official from the IRGC to focus on “assassinating, former President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.” This directive came after Shakeri had already been involved in multiple operations on behalf of the IRGC, utilising his criminal network to support the group\\'s agenda.The criminal complaint added that according to Shakeri, during his meeting with an IRGC official on or about October 7, 2024, he was instructed to provide a plan within seven days to kill Trump. If Shakeri failed to do so within that timeframe, the IRGC official said the plan would be delayed until after the US Presidential elections.

Allegedly the two accused were sexually assaulting the victim for months, following which a complaint was filed before the police and both the teachers were arrested.As per the police, one of the teachers was arrested a few months ago after CCTV footage of him allegedly sexually harassing another student was widely shared.A senior police official of the Uttar Pradesh police said that the student had gone to Kanpur to prepare for the exam in 2022 and took admission in a coaching centre to prepare for the NEET exams.In her complaint, the victim stated that in January this year, her biology teacher, Sahil Siddiqui (32) invited her to a party at his house which he said was meant for all students. However, when the girl reached his flat, she realised that she was alone. Later, during her stay at his flat, Siddiqui allegedly got her drunk, raped her and filmed the act.Following the incident, the accused, Siddiqui raped her on several occasions after threatening the victim to make her obscene video public and kill her family. He held her hostage at his flat for some time and then coerced her to attend parties there. It was during one such party that she was raped by her 39-year-old chemistry teacher, Vikas Porwal.The student said she had gone home to meet her parents around Holi and Siddiqui had called her and asked her to come back, threatening to harm her family if she did not comply.A video of Siddiqui allegedly sexually harassing another student went viral recently and he was released on bail. An official said this made the student overcome her fear of him and file a police complaint on Thursday.A first information report (FIR) was registered on Friday and both Siddiqui and Porwal were arrested the same night.Assistant Commissioner of Police Abhishek Pandey said, \"The student told us she was raped by the accused on separate occasions. A case has been registered and the two men have been arrested and are being questioned.

We want to focus on Tier 2, 3 markets from the metros. We want to provide connectivity between the full service, long haul, wide body side of the business and the domestic Tier 2, 3 cities,\" Singh said.In response to a question, he said there are no plans to have premium economy class seats in its flights.

They said the ordeal began for the student in December 2022, when she was putting up at a city hostel. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Kalyanpur) Abhishek Pandey said the case was registered on Friday after she approached the Kalyanpur police station.Both teachers -- Sahil Siddiqui, who taught biology, and Vikas Porwal, who taught chemistry -- have been arrested and charged with offences of rape, wrongful confinement, criminal intimidation and under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act. The student was 17 years old when this happened.In her complaint, the survivor told police that in December 2022, Siddiqui invited her to his friend's flat in Kalyanpur's Makdi-Khera area for a New Year's party, saying other students would be there as well.She alleged that when she reached the flat, she found only Siddiqui there who drugged her by lacing her soft drink with sedatives and raped her while also recording the episode on video.According to the complaint, Siddiqui allegedly held her hostage in his flat for over six months, during which he repeatedly raped her and also threatened to share the video online if she spoke to anyone about it.The student alleged that Porwal raped her a few months after this.She said in the FIR that she could not muster the courage to seek police help as she was afraid that it might land her family in danger.Six months later, the girl's mother arrived in Kanpur and took her along.Initially, the girl was hesitant to approach the police but she made up her mind to take the step when she came across a video showing Siddiqui sexually harassing a coaching student.The case was registered against the two teachers under Indian Penal Code sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit an offence), 376(2)(n) (commits rape repeatedly on the same woman), 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 or more days) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and the POCSO Act, an official said.\", 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/minor-neet-aspirant-held-hostage-raped-for-over-six-months-in-kanpur-2-teachers-arrested-1836812', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/09/03/1837639-rape.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 12:46:04', 'author': 'PTI', 'authors': ['PTI'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.263}, {'id': 263730962, 'title': 'Patriarchy did not stop Indira Gandhi from becoming PM: Nirmala Sitharaman', 'text': \"Bengaluru: If patriarchy stopped women from achieving what they want in India, how come Indira Gandhi made it as prime minister, asked Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. She met the students of CMS Business School here on Saturday and discussed various measures undertaken by the Centre to support innovation as well as the government schemes available for young people, including the 1 crore internships for the unemployable youth' in the age group of 21 to 24 years old. Replying to a question about women empowerment, Sitharaman insisted that patriarchy is a concept invented by the Left. “Don't get carried away by fantastic jargons. If you stand up for yourself and speak logically, patriarchy will not stop you from achieving your dreams,” she advised the women in the audience. However, she admitted that women are not facilitated adequately and that more facilitation is needed. Answering a question about the prospects of innovators in India, the finance minister said the Modi government is creating an environment that is conducive to innovators. “We do not just support innovation by bringing out policies,” she said, adding that the Indian government is doing its best to ensure that such innovations find markets too. As an example, she cited the support mechanism that is available for MSMEs. According to her, they are given priority in government procurements. Sitharaman said that 40 per cent of all government procurements is coming from MSMEs. “That is why we have more than 2 lakh startups today in India and more than 130 have become unicorns. The opportunity is immense but is not fully utilised,” she said. It is the same with digital banking transformation that is happening in India, she added. According to her, opportunities were created for the common people through Jan Dhan Yojana. “India's approach to spreading digital networks was funded by the government, while many other countries went through private players, resulting in some nominal charges somewhere. Because of this, even micro-level users also access digital banking without having to pay for it,” Sitharaman said, and added that in the future this will only grow. “Therefore, technology will have to be continuously updated so that we don't become redundant.” She also explained the concept of the 'Fund of Funds' offered by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, which is enabled by the Central government by infusing Rs 10,000 crore to help small businesses and innovative ideas needing support. “Private equity funds are also backing this because we have given them concessions,” she added.

By 2070, climate change under a high-end emissions scenario could cause a loss of around 24.7 per cent of India’s GDP, it warns. The ADB study finds that intense storms in India are currently leading to a 5.5 per cent reduction in fixed assets, while average storms reduce fixed assets by 2.2 per cent. Intense storms decrease sales by 7.8 per cent, and average storms lead to a 3.1 per cent drop in sales. Intense storms in India have caused significant damage, affecting 0.2 per cent of the total fixed capital or around $2.8 billion and 0.3 per cent of total sales or around $14.5 billion in 2021. Superstorms increase the likelihood of no formal education by 4.6 percentage points and reduce higher educational attainment by up to 20 percentage points, indicating long-term de-skilling of affected areas. The reduction in lifetime aggregate earnings, attributed to diminished educational attainment due to a yearly average storm exposure, is estimated at approximately $15.1 billion in 2021. According to the report, India will witness 24.7 per cent loss of GDP due to climate change by 2070. The total loss across the Asia and Pacific region will be 16.9 per cent of GDP. These losses are concentrated in Bangladesh with 30.5 per cent, Viet Nam 30.2 per cent, Indonesia 26.8 per cent and India 24.7 per cent. Losses between 2050 and 2070 will be more than those between 2030 and 2050. For many countries, effects on labour productivity from heat waves are large. The GDP loss in 2070 from reduced labour productivity is found to be 11.6 per cent of the GDP in India and 4.9 per cent for the region. Increased energy demand becomes a substantial economic cost as economies struggle to cope with heat waves. Higher temperatures increase demand for cooling sufficiently to lead to a 3.3 per cent GDP reduction for the Asia and Pacific region by 2070. Losses are concentrated in climates with hotter seasonal temperatures and where energy usage for cooling is highest. These include India with 5.1 per cent and China 3.7 per cent.

Compared to personal loans, for gold loans the cost of borrowing is lesser and processing of the loan hassle-free. Gold prices have gone up more than 30 per cent this year and that means a borrower will receive 30 per cent more finance for the same quantum of gold he pledged last year. Unlike other secured loans like a home loan or car loan, there is no restriction on the end use of gold loans and unlike personal loans, gold loans do not require a good credit history. The loan amount is determined by the grammage of the gold and the requirement of the customer. However, the amount is capped at 75 per cent of the value of the gold. The interest rates of gold loans range from 7.7 per cent and go up to 16 per cent with agricultural gold loans offered by public sector banks having interest rates at the lower end of the spectrum and those offered by non-banking financial companies at the higher end. On the other hand, for personal loans the rates range between 9.99 per cent per annum to 44 per cent, According to Bank Bazaar, the rate depends upon the loan amount, credit score, and the repayment tenure. Most banks do not provide personal loans to customers with poor credit scores and if it is average, the interest rates go up. Compared to personal loans, gold loan approval and disbursal processes are swift and hassle-free. While a gold loan can be sanctioned in 90 to 120 minutes, personal loans take 24 hours to seven days. The processing fees of personal loans range anywhere between 1 per cent to 6 per cent of the loan amount and for gold loans it ranges between 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent.

Vinod Kumar of the Telangana High Court held that individual notices were not required in land acquisition proceedings under Section 21(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act, 2013, (LARR Act) if a public notice has been issued. The judge was dealing with a writ plea filed by Puli Rajesham and 11 others, alleging that they were not personally informed of the acquisition of their lands for the Singareni Collieries Company Limited’s (SCCL) Ramagundam open cast II project. The petitioners contended that they discovered the proceedings through a public notice displayed at the collector’s office. They argued that the authorities had failed to follow the due process of law by not issuing individual notices, despite Supreme Court precedents and stipulations under the Act. It was claimed that this omission impacted their compensation and eligibility for agricultural subsidies, including Rythu Bandhu and PM Kisan benefits. The petitioners expressed concern about the lack of action on their representations, noting a potential loss of state and central government agricultural benefits due to the acquisition. The judge, after hearing the arguments, held that the issuance of a public notice was sufficient and that individual notices were unnecessary as the petitioners did not reside outside the locality. Acknowledging that the petitioners admitted being aware of the acquisition through a public notice, the judge found no violation of the due process of law. However, the judge directed the respondents to consider the representations of the petitioners and address the objections raised, as the same were submitted within the stipulated time frame.Sangareddy bio-waste tender case before HC The Telangana High Court entertained a writ plea challenging the extension of the tender for collecting bio-waste for a cumulative period of three years in Sangareddy municipality. Justice K. Lakshman was dealing with a writ plea filed by Qureshi Butchers Mutton and Chicken Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Society Ltd of Sangareddy. The petitioner challenged the extension of the tender for collection of bio-waste in Sangareddy municipality in favour of Gopi Transport without issuing a public notification. It was the case of the petitioner that, as per the procedure, a notification inviting interested persons to participate in tender proceedings for collecting the bio-waste from shops selling chicken, mutton and fish in the municipality was to be issued but without following this procedure, the tender earlier assigned to Gopi Transport was extended for a cumulative period of three years. The petitioner argued that such an extension of the tender period without issuing a notification inviting interested persons was a violation of the provisions of TS Municipalities Act 2019 and Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. The petitioner sought setting aside the work order issued in favour of the unofficial respondent last December. After hearing the parties, Justice K. Lakshman directed the respondent authorities to file their counter and posted the matter for further adjudication. Renew bar licence: HC Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana High Court directed the commissioner of prohibition and excise and other authorities to renew bar licence and supply liquor stock to Sri Kanakadurga restaurant and bar situated at Sangareddy. This direction came in response to a writ plea filed by the outlet’s managing partner challenging the actions of the respondent authorities in not renewing their licence, despite receiving the first instalment of the licence fee. The petitioner contended that the respondents locked the bar premises and were not considering the renewal application in spite of his having submitted several representations and receiving licence fees to the tune of `20 lakh. The petitioner alleged that the respondents were not supplying liquor stock and brought it to the notice of the judge that no showcause notice was issued nor was any enquiry conducted. The government pleader pointed out that the unofficial respondent, who is also a sleeping partner of the firm, had lodged an objection against renewal of the licence and the application did not bear his signature. After hearing the parties and perusing the material on record, the judge observed that as per the partnership deed, the unofficial respondent was only a sleeping partner. The managing partner possessed the right to sign the renewal application and thus, the rejection was improper. The judge observed that the petitioner established a prima facie case for grant of interim relief and accordingly directed the respondent authorities to renew the bar licence and supply liquor stock to the petitioner.

The said ‘NGOs’ are working specifically among the Muslim community to raise ‘awareness’ and increase the community’s voter turnout against the BJP, the strategy that helped the MVA led by Congress during the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections.\\n\\nAs per the reports, in predominantly Muslim areas such as Shivaji Nagar, Mumbadevi, Byculla, and Malegaon Central, voter turnout during the Lok Sabha election was significantly higher than in nearby assembly segments. This increase has been attributed to heightened ‘awareness’ and concerns within the Muslim community, with targeted efforts over the past year.\\n\\nThe Marathi Muslim Seva Sangh (MMSS), collaborating with over 180 NGOs, has been actively working within Muslim communities to boost voter enrollment. The group has organized meetings and informational sessions for Muslim voters across the state, urging them to vote for the MVA alliance led by the Congress under the guise of spreading ‘vote awareness’.\\n\\n“These efforts resulted in a voter turnout exceeding 60% in the Lok Sabha election about 15% higher than previous averages. We encourage Muslims to support secular candidates and vote in line with constitutional values. Our collaboration with other organizations and religious leaders has produced a stronger response. Over 200 meetings have been conducted statewide, contributing to the increase in turnout,” stated Fakir Mehmood Thakur, the organization’s leader.\\n\\nThakur also highlighted that concerns among Muslim voters regarding central government policies, including the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), contributed to the high voter turnout during the Lok Sabha elections. He added that these issues remain relevant in the ongoing state elections.\\n\\nAlso, a study by Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) on 5th November has also revealed that the Muslims and illegal immigrants in Mumbai are changing the demography of the region and influencing politics by voting for specific political parties. The study, conducted by TISS pro-vice-chancellor Shankar Das and assistant professor Souvik Mondal, also claimed that illegal immigrants are influencing the city’s socio-economy by taking low-skilled employment, resulting in pay suppression and annoyance among locals.\\n\\n“Some political entities are alleged to use illegal immigrants for vote-bank politics, which can disrupt the democratic process. Claims of voter registration manipulation, where undocumented immigrants allegedly obtain fake voter IDs, raise concerns about electoral fairness and the integrity of India’s democratic system,” the study alleged. \\n\\nOpIndia had after the Lok Sabha elections concluded in May-June 2024 reported that the Muslims had mobilized in the state of Maharashtra to specifically defeat the BJP. Islamists had issued fatwas, raised Islamic flags in MVA rallies, and urged voters to vote for Shiv Sena (UBT), INC and NCP (Sharad Pawar). This time also several NGOs under the roof of Marathi Muslim Seva Sangh are urging Muslim voters to vote against BJP, practicing ‘vote jihad’, the conspiracy downplayed by leftist Islamists and its supporters.\\n\\nThe 288 legislative assembly seats will go to the polls in a single phase on November 20 while the counting of votes will take place on November 23.', 'summary': 'All India Ulema Board\\xa0has extended its support to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance led by the Congress party in the Maharashtra assembly elections', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/maharashtra-polls-ulema-board-extends-conditional-support-to-mva-candidates/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BeFunky-collage-2024-11-09T182240.507.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 14:36:07', 'author': 'OpIndia Staff', 'authors': ['OpIndia Staff'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.018}, {'id': 263753668, 'title': 'Amid debate over demography change in poll-bound Jharkhand, 35 Hindu families surrounded by 11,000 Muslim families face challenges of existence in Santhal Pargana', 'text': 'Jharkhand Assembly Elections are just over a week away. Amid the contrasting political narratives of the ruling party, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a lot of traction has been gained in the state. One point raised by the BJP in the campaign is the influx of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and the change in demography in the state. Amid this, a team of Organizer visited so-called Muslim-dominated areas like Santhal Pargana, where 35 Hindu families are struggling to uphold tradition amid the challenges they face, surrounded by over 11,000 Muslim families in the area.\\n\\nHow 35 Hindu families surrounded by 11,000 Muslim families live in Jharkhand\\'s #Santhal Pargana?-They stop the music five times a day during Chhat Puja.-They pay \\'tax\\' to Muslims as they reap produce in \\'Muslim area\\'-They don\\'t put rangoli on the street.-Their cows get… pic.twitter.com/41lgLpwMoU— Subhi Vishwakarma (@subhi_karma) November 8, 2024\\n\\nThis region, with its deep-rooted tribal history and districts such as Sahibganj, Dumka, and Pakur, has become a focal point of the electoral battle, with both parties pushing divergent priorities. The ruling party, JMM, is promoting welfare schemes such as monthly aid of Rs 2,500 for women and a higher Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers. On the other hand, the BJP’s campaign underscores issues of tribal identity (Adivasi Asmita) and highlights concerns about illegal immigration, alleging that unchecked settlements are altering the region’s demographics. JMM, however, has dismissed the concerns of demographic change, claiming that the BJP is fear-mongering.\\n\\nHowever, Organizer’s report tells a different story. When the team reached Santhal Pargana, the Hindu families were demonstrating their resolve to celebrate Chhath Puja despite pressure from the Muslim families in the area. In villages like Mansingha and Rajmahal, Hindu families have almost disappeared. Every few kilometres, there are mosques and madrasas, giving the landscape a completely non-Indian feel. These are the areas where concerns raised by the BJP resonate strongly. The isolated Hindu community in this region often finds itself wrestling with a host of challenges, including restricted fishing rights and imposed ‘taxes’ on their agricultural yield by the local Muslim majority.\\n\\nSpeaking to Organizer, a long-time resident of the area, Dhani Choudhary, said, “We’ve faced these taxes for years. But things shifted after 2014 when we felt supported by the central government to resist. The change brought its own challenges; now, we face threats for venturing into deeper fishing areas.” Another villager, Ashok Choudhary, spoke about celebrating festivals under pressure. “Even during weddings, music is a point of contention. Our baraats have to be silent when prayers are held, and incidents of aggression often mar the joy,” he said.\\n\\nThe Hindu community’s experience highlights important issues during Jharkhand’s election period. As JMM and BJP compete for power, their different promises—JMM’s focus on social welfare and BJP’s emphasis on cultural and demographic security—directly impact these communities. While some may support JMM’s welfare schemes, BJP’s focus on cultural identity and demographic concerns resonates with many Hindus in border areas like Santhal Pargana.\\n\\nAnother resident, Rajkumar Choudhary, expressed fears about the rapid demographic shift. He said, “These newcomers aren’t the Muslims of our land. Month by month, their numbers swell, and soon, they will move beyond, expanding into Bengal.” Amid the demographic change, Chhath Puja has become more than just a celebration; it is a statement of resilience.\\n\\n‘No well for Hindus’\\n\\nSimilar sentiments were expressed by Hindus who spoke to journalist Aditi Tyagi, who visited Madhupur for ground reporting during the elections. Speaking to an old Hindu resident of the area, Aditi was shocked to learn that Hindus cannot even access wells. When Aditi asked the old man about the main election issues for the residents, he got a lump in his throat and said, “The main issue is getting a well. When we went to local minister Hafizul Ansari four months ago to ask for a well, he refused to provide any support, saying Hindus won’t get anything.” He added that the Muslim community receives all the facilities, but Hindus get nothing. Pointing to his field, he said, “If we had the well, there would have been water, and we could have grown vegetables.”\\n\\nजोहार झारखंडMy question बाबा, क्या मुद्दा है यहां? बुज़ुर्ग (भावुक होकर) हम गए यहां पर कुआं मांगने, कहा हिंदु समाज है कुआं नहीं मिलेगा…ये है मधुपुर का हाल pic.twitter.com/awzU3JgyDu— aditi tyagi (@aditi_tyagi) November 6, 2024\\n\\nDurga Visarjan not allowed\\n\\nAnother Hindu resident told Aditi about his ordeal, explaining how Hindus were not allowed to take out the Durga Visarjan procession during Navratri. He said, “Our idol immersion procession was stopped during Durga Puja… during this Durga Puja… pressure is maintained from the police station to every department.” He also alleged that there were attempts to set the house of a Hindu man, Pradeep Modi, on fire. He further alleged that Hafizul Ansari kept pressure on the local administration not to allow Hindus to celebrate festivals and hold events. He said, “They don’t allow us to play DJ during azaan or take out processions through Muslim-dominated areas… wherever Hindus become a minority, they [Muslims] pressurise them.”\\n\\nजोहार झारखंड\"दुर्गा पूजा में हमारा मूर्ति विसर्जन का जुलूस रोक दिया था…इसी दुर्गा पूजा पर …थाना से लेकर हर डिपार्टमेंट में दबाव बनाकर रखा जाता है..\"मधुपुर में ये क्या कह रहे हैं! @nishikant_dubey जी pic.twitter.com/Cvsgksidgn— aditi tyagi (@aditi_tyagi) November 7, 2024\\n\\nStone pelting on Hindus in Gopinathpur\\n\\nIn another video, Hindu women shared their ordeal of how Muslims pelted stones at them in Gopinathpur in June this year. An old man standing nearby said, “There were over 10,000 of them. The police could not control them. They had to fire shots in the air to disperse the mob. It was only because of the police that we were saved that day.” The Hindu woman said, “They still attack us. They enter our homes.”\\n\\nThe situation in Jharkhand where Hindus are in minority is full of the complexities surrounding upcoming elections.

All three series have seen England losing in crucial moments despite giving tough competition to the Windies.Speaking about his return from injury and his future in international cricket, Buttler said \"All sorts of things run through your mind. I think you try and work through everything.\"The England skipper also said that he enjoys being the captain of the side and it is something he believes that he can do well.McCullum, England\\'s current Test coach, will be taking over the white-ball sides from January 2025 onwards ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy to be held from February-March in Pakistan. This development has given Buttler, under fire for poor performances in 50-over and 20-over World Cup defences, a new lease of life.The pair have been friends for a long time and McCullum aims to bring the best out of Buttler during his tenure. McCullum\\'s experience as a white-ball captain for New Zealand in his later stages of the career have inspired Buttler to develop an environment where players can flourish and go to the \"top of the mountain\".\"I had some chats with Baz (Brendon) about how this stage of your career can actually be the most rewarding. He spoke about his own experiences as captain in the last few years of when he was playing, it is not about you at all, it is about creating that environment and letting people flourish and how seeing them go to the top of the mountain was some of the happiest times of his career as a player. And that is exactly what I want to get out of them,\" said Buttler.Buttler is a man with a renewed sense of purpose, with a fresh cycle of ICC white-ball tournaments approaching. With the next year\\'s Champions Trophy, the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka and the 2027 50-over World Cup in Africa in his mind, he wants to play \"as much as he can\" and develop a new generation of white-ball players for England. He also opened up on how time away from the game gave him a new perspective on the game and the desperation, motivation to come back to the field.\"You get a nice perspective of, when cricket has taken away from you (during time spent away from game), how great it is, how important it is and how much you enjoy it. It is all the little things that you sometimes take for granted that you really miss the most, like being around the changing room, pulling the shirt on. When you start to think about it, it gives you a lot of hunger and motivation to get back, put the work in and get playing again,\" said Buttler.\"When you get an injury like that it makes you realise how desperately you want to get back, and the stuff that you really enjoy doing, so that is the mindset of however long I have got back.\"\"I think throughout the three ODIs [against West Indies], Jacob Bethell scoring his maiden fifty, Dan Mousley [also] in the last game, you see those guys getting that opportunity and grabbing it which is incredibly exciting.

The leaders\\' presence also helps countries hold one another accountable for past promises.But the annual COP is just the main event in a continuous process. Country representatives meet year round to build support for new climate action proposals ahead of the COP, where they can be agreed by consensus of all countries.Is the process working?While each summit is meant to advance global climate action from the year before, the event also offers countries a chance to show their citizens the problem is being addressed.Importantly, the exercise has seen countries counting and reporting their emissions, and has helped move hundreds of billions of dollars in climate aid to developing nations.By requiring decisions by consensus, the process also ensures strong global support for agreed actions, improving the chances these actions will be implemented.But the pace of progress has been too slow to contain the rise in global temperatures. Since COP summits began in 1995, both emissions and temperatures have continued to rise, meaning the world is on track for extreme climate change.Proponents of the UNFCCC process say there is no alternative for negotiating major socioeconomic changes to try to limit global warming.What will we get out of COP29?This year\\'s summit is hoping for a few headline agreements: a new annual climate finance target, a deal to get multilateral carbon credit markets working, and more aid money pledged for countries already hit by costly climate disasters.Beyond that, negotiators will continue to work on technical agreements that build on work done at previous summits.Outside the formal COP framework, groups of countries could launch their own initiatives or pledge funding for specific projects. Companies will likely announce commercial deals related to climate action, while financiers try to raise cash for climate investments.What is Azerbaijan\\'s role in COP29?Azerbaijan holds the presidency of COP29 this year, when the rotating COP presidency fell to Central and Eastern Europe.Next year Brazil will serve as Latin America\\'s host for COP30.As summit host, a country works the entire year to steer pre-summit negotiations and lobby other governments for ambitious action. This gives the presidency an important part in defining the summit\\'s priorities.What else happens at COP?Beyond the country negotiations, the COP summit offers a chance for anyone to try to draw attention - or funding - to their cause.Hundreds of side events see activists and scientists rubbing shoulders with industry lobbyists and banking heavyweights.Public-facing conference stages host panel discussions on topics from ocean acidification to designing carbon offset projects.An exhibition hall, dubbed the \"Green Zone,\" features discussions led by national delegations, non-profit organisations and corporations.While some summits have seen big organized protests, such as the rally of thousands outside of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, the last two conferences in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have allowed for protests only in designated, roped-off areas.Azerbaijan, which also has banned public protests, will likely see little civic action outside of the high-security conference site.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)', 'summary': \"Tens of thousands of people from around the globe will gather next week for COP29, the annual UN climate summit, in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku.\", 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-what-is-the-point-of-cop29-an-annual-un-climate-summit-6981494', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/u9j09i_cop29_625x300_04_November_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 14:44:56', 'author': 'Reuters', 'authors': ['Reuters'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.018}, {'id': 263754178, 'title': 'Gujarat: 38 injured in collision involving bus, two vehicles near Ambaji', 'text': 'Atleast 38 people were injured after three vehicles, including a bus, collided with each other near Ambaji in Gujarat on Friday.According to the Civil Superintendent of Danta Government Hospital, Dr KK Singh, among the 38 injured, six people sustained serious injuries and were referred to Palampur for further treatment.

The FICs were transshipped from India by INS Gharial.The handing over ceremony on November 8 was attended by the High Commissioner of India in Mozambique, Robert Shetkintong, India’s newly appointed Defence Adviser at Maputo, Col Puneet Attri, and the Commanding Officer of INS Gharial, Commander Rajan Chib. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of National Defence, Augusto Casimiro Mueio, formally accepted the vessels on behalf of the Government of Mozambique. These water-jet-propelled boats have a top speed of 45 knots and a range of 200 nautical miles at 12 knots. They can carry a crew of five personnel and are equipped with machine guns and bullet-resistant cabins. The two FICs will significantly aid the Government of Mozambique in its effort to combat maritime terrorism and ongoing insurgency in the Cabo Delgado province. Earlier, to bolster the efforts of the Government of Mozambique for maritime security, the Government of India had gifted two large Interceptor vessels in 2019, followed by two FICs of the same class in Jan 2022. The Indian Navy has been seen by several nations in the IOR as the preferred partner for maritime security. The Indian Navy has been collaborating with several friendly littorals of the IOR to equip and train their maritime security forces to counter maritime security challenges like piracy, drug and human trafficking, Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, maritime terrorism, etc. The Indian Navy has also been the first responder to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) support to several nations in the region during natural calamities and other contingencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2019, Indian Naval Ships Sujata & Shardul and Indian Coast Guard Ship Sarathi were diverted from their deployment to assist Mozambique when Cyclone Idai struck its Sofala province. Over a period of two weeks, the ships rescued more than 200 civilians, provided emergency medical treatment to over 2,300 people and supplied 10 Tonnes of food material by boats and helicopter to flood-affected areas.\\n\\nIn March 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, The Government of India donated 100,000 doses and supplied over one million doses of the COVISHIELD vaccine to Mozambique under the COVAX programme.India has provided training opportunities for the Mozambique Armed Forces in various professional institutions of the Indian Armed Forces. India also gifted an Infantry Weapons Training Simulator to Mozambique in November last year to be installed at the Army Practicing School Manhica, near Maputo.On-job training on operating and maintaining the Indian-gifted vessels is also provided by the resident Indian Coast Guard Afloat Support Team at Maputo. The Interceptors vessels gifted by India have played a pivotal role since 2019 in anti-insurgency operations, maritime patrol & interdiction, and logistics support missions.In the last two years, Indian Warships have made regular port calls at Maputo, Beira and Nacala. Indian Naval Ships Tir and Sujata participated in the 2nd edition of the India-Mozambique-Tanzania (IMT) Trilateral Exercise at Nacala, held in March 2023.Previously, Indian Naval Ships Sujata, Sunayna and Sumedha undertook Joint EEZ Surveillance missions with the Mozambique Navy to strengthen maritime security in the region and undertake harbour and sea training for Mozambique Navy personnel.India and Mozambique share a robust strategic partnership that has grown even stronger with each passing year in multiple realms.

After missing out on months of white-ball action, Buttler is back in Barbados for the first T20I of the five-match series against West Indies. After England lost the ODI series 1-2 under the leadership of Liam Livingstone, they would be looking to gain a crucial, confidence-boosting series win over the Windies, who have dominated the Three Lions across both white-ball formats as of late. After a poor 2023 World Cup in India, England has lost both ODI series against WI on their tour to Caribbean and a T20I series as well. All three series have seen England losing in crucial moments despite giving tough competition to the Windies. Speaking about his return from injury and his future in international cricket, Buttler said “All sorts of things run through your mind. I think you try and work through everything.”The England skipper also said that he enjoys being the captain of the side and it is something he believes that he can do well. McCullum, England’s current Test coach, will be taking over the white-ball sides from January 2025 onwards ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy to be held from February-March in Pakistan. This development has given Buttler, under fire for poor performances in 50-over and 20-over World Cup defences, a new lease of life. The pair have been friends for a long time and McCullum aims to bring the best out of Buttler during his tenure. McCullum’s experience as a white-ball captain for New Zealand in his later stages of the career have inspired Buttler to develop an environment where players can flourish and go to the “top of the mountain”. “I had some chats with Baz (Brendon) about how this stage of your career can actually be the most rewarding. He spoke about his own experiences as captain in the last few years of when he was playing, it is not about you at all, it is about creating that environment and letting people flourish and how seeing them go to the top of the mountain was some of the happiest times of his career as a player. And that is exactly what I want to get out of them,” said Buttler. Buttler is a man with a renewed sense of purpose, with a fresh cycle of ICC white-ball tournaments approaching. With the next year’s Champions Trophy, the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka and the 2027 50-over World Cup in Africa in his mind, he wants to play “as much as he can” and develop a new generation of white-ball players for England. He also opened up on how time away from the game gave him a new perspective on the game and the desperation, motivation to come back to the field. “You get a nice perspective of, when cricket has taken away from you (during time spent away from game), how great it is, how important it is and how much you enjoy it. It is all the little things that you sometimes take for granted that you really miss the most, like being around the changing room, pulling the shirt on. When you start to think about it, it gives you a lot of hunger and motivation to get back, put the work in and get playing again,” said Buttler. “When you get an injury like that it makes you realise how desperately you want to get back, and the stuff that you really enjoy doing, so that is the mindset of however long I have got back.”“I think throughout the three ODIs [against West Indies], Jacob Bethell scoring his maiden fifty, Dan Mousley [also] in the last game, you see those guys getting that opportunity and grabbing it which is incredibly exciting. And whatever that means in terms of squads, that is exciting for English cricket,” he concluded. England Squad for the T20Is: Philip Salt(w), Jos Buttler(c), Will Jacks, Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, Dan Mousley, Sam Curran, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Reece Topley, Saqib Mahmood, Jordan Cox, John Turner, Rehan Ahmed, Jafer Chohan, Michael-Kyle PepperWest Indies Squad for the T20Is: Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Nicholas Pooran(w), Rovman Powell(c), Sherfane Rutherford, Roston Chase, Andre Russell, Akeal Hosein, Gudakesh Motie, Matthew Forde, Shamar Joseph, Terrance Hinds, Romario Shepherd, Shai Hope, Shimron Hetmyer.

Captain Ryan Edwards opened the scoring for Chennaiyin after an hour of gritty play right as the clock struck 60′. However, Nathan Rodrigues (63′) levelled the scores again after three minutes in an eventual draw. Farukh Choudhary returned to the starting line-up for the league’s 1000th match, having missed the 5-1 win over Jamshedpur FC with a knock. Mohammad Nawaz, Bikash Yumnam, and Elsinho retained their spots after impressing in the previous game, while Vincy Barretto recovered from an affliction to start again. Nine minutes in, Connor Shields’ creativity split the Mumbai City defense open to create an opportunity in transition for Vincy, who drove forward with the ball before drawing a good save out of Phruba Lachenpa. At the other end, Nawaz stood firm to thwart the visitors’ attempts to alter the scoreline. The best chance of the first half, though, fell to the in-form Wilmar Jordan Gil, who was denied his seventh goal in five games by an acrobatic save from Lachenpa. The two teams picked up where they had left off after the break. In their attempts to establish an advantage, Chennaiyin drew first blood when Shields’ in-swinging set-piece delivery was met by Edwards inside the box. The CFC captain directed his header masterfully inside the post, before wheeling away in celebration. Three minutes later, a similar set-piece situation at the other end saw Mumbai City equalise through Nathan. Late in the game, substitute Daniel Chima Chukwu’s agile effort from the centre of the box was saved by Lachenpa, denying CFC a winner. The draw sees Chennaiyin FC move up to fourth in the league table heading into the international break.

The victim, Nadeem alias Bobby, was travelling with his friends Aman and Shanwaz on a scooter when three assailants on a motorcycle shot at them. Nadeem was hit and later declared dead at GTB Hospital, while Shanwaz sustained a bullet injury to his right leg and is undergoing treatment. The assailants stole Nadeem’s scooter and left their bike at the scene. A case was registered at PS Welcome under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act.Speaking to ANI, Zeeshan, a relative of Nadeem, said, “My cousin brother Nadeem had gone to get food with his friend Shahnawaz and as he was returning, some boys fired at him and attacked him with a knife, due to which he died on the spot. Shahnawaz has also been shot and is admitted in the hospital. Nadeem used to work in a jeans printing outfit. Nadeem did not have any enmity with anyone. We don’t understand why he was shot, but we want crimes like this to stop. Nowadays, criminals commit crimes with the help of minors.”Minutes after the murder, another firing incident was reported at PS Jyoti Nagar. The complainant, Rahul, a 24-year-old resident of New Kardampuri, told the police that at 1:26 AM, three persons on a scooter fired shots at his house. Six empty cartridges and one live cartridge were found at the scene. A second case was registered under the Arms Act and related sections.Rahul’s mother, Urmila, also spoke to ANI, and said, “When we were sleeping around 1:30 AM, we heard the sound of a gunshot. When we came out, some boys were running away and six bullets had been fired at our house. The shells are with the police.

In the case of the Jyoti Nagar firing, they stated that the attack was carried out under the instructions of a local criminal.

These were presumed to be banned, but we can’t be sure now. Books like Stanley Wolpert’s Nine Hours to Rama, Aubrey Menen’s The Ramayana, Arthur Koestler’s The Lotus and the Robot. \\n\\nThe Satanic Verses notification was issued by the Finance Ministry, and Rushdie was only one of millions who wondered why that agency should decide what the country may or may not read. When an Indian citizen went to court five years ago, asking why he could not purchase the book in India, he was directed to the customs order. And given the usual run around. \\n\\nFive years later, presumably after having searched every inch of the customs department and nearby restaurants where the officials might have eaten, it emerges that there is no such order. Either that, or someone, like a spy in a cheap novel, swallowed it to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Anything you say about Indian bureaucracy is usually true! \\n\\nVictory of incompetence\\n\\nYet, by this act of forgetfulness or misplacement or poor housekeeping, the bureaucracy has righted a wrong perpetrated 36 years ago. This is not so much a triumph of the freedom of expression as a victory for incompetence. That detail , however, might be lost to history decades from now. \\n\\nThis wasn’t a ban on literary grounds (even if Verses isn’t one of Rushdie’s best works), but on political ones. The conditions that led to the ban can be rekindled any time by politicians: one lot who want to project themselves as leaders of the community, and another who might see in protests a diversion from the real issues. \\n\\nIn his book on censorship published three decades ago, the novelist J M Coetzee made the point that “the very notion of entrusting the name of the Almighty to the protection of the law courts has taken on an increasingly anachronistic air.” If only that were true.', 'summary': 'Perhaps the notification that banned the import of Salman Rushdie’s\\xa0Satanic Verses was as fictitious as the characters in the novel', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/incompetence-rights-a-wrong-but-for-how-long/article68848971.ece', 'image': 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/fyltsw/article68849866.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_08SM_rushdie.jpg_2_1_5MB84QL0.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-09 15:03:04', 'author': 'Suresh Menon', 'authors': ['Suresh Menon'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.082}, {'id': 263754474, 'title': 'Seaplanes have potential to woo high-budget tourists to Kerala: Biju Prabhakar', 'text': 'Blessed with ample number of waterbodies and the Centre sponsoring the fare for nine seats in seaplanes for a three-year period, Kerala has immense potential to woo high-budget tourists if these amphibious aircraft link tourism locales in the State, Biju Prabhakar, Aviation Secretary and Chairman of KSEB, said here on Saturday. \\n\\nThe State could even compete with the Maldives where over 100 seaplanes link tourism locales within that country.

Here's how he did it\", 'text': \"From Pennsylvania to Florida to Texas, areas with high numbers of Hispanics often had little in common on Election Day other than backing Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris for president. Trump, the president-elect, made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of eastern Pennsylvania where the vice president spent the last full day of her campaign. Trump turned South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, a decadeslong Democratic stronghold populated both by newer immigrants and Tejanos who trace their roots in the state for several generations. He also improved his standing with Hispanic voters along Florida's Interstate 4 corridor linking the Tampa Bay area - home to people of Cuban, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan, Colombian and Puerto Rican origin - with Orlando, where Puerto Ricans make up about 43% of the local Hispanic population. Trump was the first Republican since 1988 to win Miami-Dade County, home to a sizable Cuban population and the country's metropolitan area with the highest share of immigrants. It was a realignment that, if it sticks, could change American politics. Texas and Florida are already reliably Republican, but more Hispanics turning away from Democrats in future presidential races could further dent the party's blue wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, that had helped catapult it to the White House before Trump romped through all three this time. The shift might even make it harder for Democrats to win in the West, in states such as Arizona and Nevada. Harris tried to highlight the ways Trump may have insulted or threatened Latinos. Trump, in his first term, curtailed the use of Temporary Protected Status, which Democratic President Joe Biden extended to thousands of Venezuelans, and tried to terminate the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He also delayed the release of relief aid to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 until nearly the end of his term, having long blasted the island's officials as corrupt and inept. Once he returns to the White House, Trump has pledge to stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. That could affect millions of families in mixed-status homes, where people who are in the United States illegally live with American citizens or those with legal residency. But the Democratic warnings did not appear to break through with enough voters for Harris. Now the party must figure out how to win back votes from a critical, fast-growing group. Trump, he's a very confounding figure, said Abel Prado, a Democratic operative and pollster who serves as executive director of the advocacy group Cambio Texas. We have no idea how to organize against him. We have no idea how to respond. We have no idea how to not take the bait. Ultimately, concerns about immigration did not resonate as much as pocketbook issues with many Hispanics. About 7 in 10 Hispanic voters were very concerned about the cost of food and groceries, slightly more than about wo-thirds of voters overall, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Nearly two-thirds of Hispanic voters said that they were very concerned about their housing costs, compared with about half of voters overall. Trump had a clear edge among Hispanic voters who were very concerned about the cost of food. Half said he would better handle the economy, compared with about 4 in 10 for Harris. Among Hispanic voters who were very worried about crime in their community, Trump had a similar advantage. When they looked at both candidates, they saw who could improve our economy and the quality of life, said Marcela Diaz-Myers, a Colombian immigrant who headed a Hispanic outreach task force for the Pennsylvania Republican Party. Did he sometimes offend? Yes. But that happens in political campaigns. Many of the people who voted for President Trump were able to get past this and trust that he will move the country in the right direction. Harris promised to lower grocery prices by cracking down on corporate price gouging and to increase federal funding for first-time homebuyers. Also, recent violent crime rates have declined in many parts of the country. Shen also spent many of the final days of the campaign trying to capitalize on remarks by a comic who spoke at a Trump rally in New York and joked that Puerto Rico was a floating island of garbage. She even leaned on Puerto Rican celebrities - from Bad Bunny to Jennifer Lopez - to decry racism. But Trump nonetheless gained ground in some of the areas with the highest concentration of Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania, the state where Harris spent more time campaigning than any other. He won the counties of Berks, Monroe and Luzerne - and lost Lehigh County by fewer than 5,000 votes against Harris. Biden had carried it by nearly three times that margin in 2020. Trump's victory was even wider in Florida, where nearly one-quarter of residents are Hispanic. He won the state by 13 percentage points - or about four times his 2020 margin. Trump also flipped the central Florida counties of Seminole and Osceola, where many Venezuelans have immigrated as their home country becomes increasingly unstable, and narrowed Democrats' advantage in Orange County, which is also heavily Venezuelan. Farther south, Trump won Miami-Dade County with an 11-percentage point advantage after losing it by 7 percentage points to Biden and by 30 percentage points to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Kevin Marino Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was state director for Trump's 2020 campaign, said Hispanics rejected the woke ideology. Trump has made his opposition to transgender rights central to his campaign. To be clear, Hispanic voters are not buying what Democrats are selling, Cabrera said. The same was true in South Texas, where Hispanics are largely of Mexican descent. Prado, the Democratic operative and pollster, lives in Hidalgo County, which is 92% Hispanic and the most populous part of the Rio Grande Valley. Trump carried it after losing by more than 40 percentage points in 2016. Trump swept all the major counties along the Texas-Mexico border. Prado said Democratic county commissioners and state legislators helped secure funding for new bridges across the Texas-Mexico border and for other initiatives that have sparked commerce and economic and job growth in the area. Yet, he said, the Republican Party has done a really good job of inserting themselves as an answer to nonexistent problems and then taking credit for (things) that they didn't do. Prado said many Hispanics in the Rio Grande Valley, particularly devoutly religious ones, were alienated by national Democrats' focus on reproductive and transgender rights, with the latter becoming a key political weapon for Republicans. This nonsense about you're going to send your son to school and he's gonna come back a girl, he said. Our side scoffed because we said, 'No one's going to believe that.' But, no, it struck a chord. Others were simply looking to cast a defiant vote, Prado said, or were inspired by the idea of self-made people embracing the American dream, even though Trump got his start in business with a large loan from his father. Daniel Alegre, CEO of TelevisaUnivision, which owns the Spanish-language television Univision, along with other television and radio properties, said Trump's gain among Hispanics was less about party than issues and that Hispanics were most concerned about the economy and immigration. Alegre, whose network hosted town halls in October with both Trump and Harris, also noted that there's a growing feeling among Hispanic citizens that new immigrants were getting more government services than were available when immigrants who have been here longer arrived in the United States - and that the Trump campaign tapped into resentment around that issue. The most important thing either party can do is keep their ears to the ground and stay connected to the community, he said, and in this case, the Trump campaign clearly accomplished that.\", 'summary': \"Donald Trump made significant gains among Hispanic voters in the 2020 presidential election, winning in areas like Florida, Texas, and parts of Pennsylvania.
