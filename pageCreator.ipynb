Waltz, a Trump loyalist who also served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the United States to be ready for a potential conflict in the region. The national security adviser is a powerful role, which does not require Senate confirmation. Waltz will be responsible for briefing Trump on key national security issues and coordinating with different agencies. While slamming the Biden administration for a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Waltz has publicly praised Trump's foreign policy views. Disruptors are often not nice ... frankly our national security establishment and certainly a lot of people that are dug into bad old habits in the Pentagon need that disruption, Waltz said during an event earlier this year. Donald Trump is that disruptor, he said. Waltz has a long history in Washington's political circles. He was a defense policy director for defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates and was elected to Congress in 2018. He is the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee overseeing military logistics and also on the select committee on intelligence. Waltz is also on the Republican's China Task Force and has argued the U.S. military is not as prepared as it needs to be if there is conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. In a book published earlier this year titled Hard Truths: Think and Lead Like a Green Beret, Waltz laid out a five part strategy to preventing war with China, including arming Taiwan faster, re-assuring allies in the Pacific, and modernizing planes and ships. On Ukraine, Waltz has said his views have evolved. After Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he called for the Biden administration to provide more weapons to Kyiv to help them push back Russian forces. But during an event last month, Waltz said there had to be a reassessment of the United States' aims in Ukraine. Is it in America's interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly? Waltz asked. Waltz has praised Trump for pushing NATO allies to spend more on defense, but unlike the president-elect has not suggested the United States pull out of the alliance. Look we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations, Waltz said last month.\", 'summary': 'Waltz, a Trump loyalist who also served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the United States to be ready for a potential conflict in the region.', 'url': 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/donald-trump-selects-mike-waltz-as-national-security-adviser-sources-say/articleshow/115197200.cms', 'image': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115197202,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-332474,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 01:00:37', 'author': 'Reuters', 'authors': ['Reuters'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.046}, {'id': 264190032, 'title': 'Trump Picks India Caucus Head Mike Waltz As National Security Adviser', 'text': 'US President-elect Donald Trump picked Mike Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and the head of India caucus, as his National Security Adviser, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press on Monday (local time).\\n(This is a breaking story.

Waltz, a retired Army Green Beret officer and National Guard colonel, is a three-term congressman known for his experience in military and national security matters. He has a long history in Washington\\'s political circles.Waltz, who represents east-central Florida, made history as the first Green Beret elected to the US House of Representatives. He has served on key committees, including the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on readiness, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the House Intelligence Committee. Recently re-elected, Waltz has earned a reputation for his strong stance on defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding China and US military readiness.A Strong Voice on National SecurityWaltz has been vocal about his concerns over threats posed by countries like China and Iran. He is particularly focused on US-China relations, frequently highlighting the need to hold China accountable for issues including the origins of COVID-19 and its treatment of minority Uighur Muslims. Waltz even called for a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as a stand against China’s policies.He has also criticised the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it chaotic and demanding accountability for the deaths of U.S. service members and stranded allies. Waltz has argued that the US military should focus on preparedness rather than “woke” diversity initiatives, advocating for a return to priorities that strengthen the armed forces.In a statement last year, Waltz said that as head of the readiness subcommittee: “I am ready to get to work to better equip our military and turn our focus away from woke priorities and back to winning wars. Our national security depends on it.”Background and ExperienceA graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, Waltz served in the Army and completed multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa. He was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two for valor. Waltz also served as a policy adviser in the Pentagon under defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates.In Congress , Waltz has consistently championed a stronger defense policy. He emphasized the need to re-prioritize the military, saying, “I am ready to get to work to better equip our military and turn our focus away from woke priorities and back to winning wars. Our national security depends on it.”Welcomed SupportRichard Goldberg, who served in Trump’s National Security Council, praised Waltz as an impressive pick, citing his military and legislative experience. “With fires raging across the world right now, Waltz is well positioned to help the President put out those fires,” said Goldberg.With Waltz as his national security adviser, Trump gains a strategic thinker ready to address pressing security issues, from aiding Ukraine to monitoring North Korea-Russia ties and countering Iran’s influence in the Middle East.Trump Announces Key AppointmentsPresident-elect Trump has also nominated Republican Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as the next US Ambassador to the United Nations, according to CNN. Trump praised Stefanik, describing her as \"an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.\" He stated, “I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as US Ambassador to the United Nations.”Stefanik, currently the House Republican Conference Chair, holds the title of the most senior Republican in New York. She first made history in 2014 as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress .In addition to Stefanik’s appointment, Trump named Tom Homan, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during his previous term, to manage the nation’s border security.Trump’s Historic Political ComebackIn a historic comeback, Trump secured a second term as President of the United States in the 2024 election, winning 295 electoral votes and defeating Democratic opponent Kamala Harris , who received 226 votes. This victory makes Trump the first US president since 1892 to return to office after losing a prior election.Trump’s re-election is only the second time in US history that a president has served non-consecutive terms, with Grover Cleveland being the first, serving in 1884 and 1892.

The announcement confirms that Mike Waltz, a representative congressman for Florida, has been selected as the new appointee to the position by President-elect Donald Trump. He is a strong supporter of Donald Trump and an ardent critic of China. He is known for his aggressive stances on national security issues, particularly concerning US relations with India and China.\\n\\nBackground and Role in US-India Relations\\n\\nWaltz leads the India Caucus in the Congress while an ardent proponent of increasing defense and security cooperation between the US and India. He has made several tours in Afghanistan and the Middle East where he received the Bronze Star and currently serves as an advisor on Afghanistan policy to the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. Waltz has also said that the withdrawal under Biden was wrong, citing that in all the chaos at the end, military equipment was left to the Taliban.\\n\\nStrong Trump Supporter and Controversial Views\\n\\nA strong Trump supporter, Waltz has been among the Republicans campaigning to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election. He also seems to be on the same page with his criticism that the “woke” military was more focused on matters of diversity and inclusion than doing its actual job. The confirmation is just another indication of his close relationship with Trump, who keeps looking for people to share his perception on national security and defense issues.\\n\\nChinese Practices Criticism and Advocating Boycotts\\n\\nWaltz has been vociferously critical of China, especially its economic practices, namely intellectual property theft, unfair trade, and the role played by China in the US supply chain. He argued to make US less dependent on Chinese manufacturing and secure American technology. Waltz also supported a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as a protest against China’s treatment of Uighur Muslims and over reported Chinese “involvement” in the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nNational Security Challenges Under Waltz’s Leadership\\n\\nAs NSA, Waltz will face very broad national security challenges, mainly on US foreign policy. The war that continues in Ukraine and the one in the Middle East are plausibly going to be principal concerns, and not least of them, the formation of the alliance between Russia and North Korea that has sounded the alarm bell in Washington. Waltz must accordingly navigate all those challenges in this new position for himself.\\n\\nPolitical Dynamics and Implications\\n\\nWaltz’s appointment arrives at a time when the fears on Capitol Hill are growing that Trump may make questionable choices for key government jobs. The likelihood of appointees from the House being having to trigger new elections to fill their places may cause the political terrain to become even more unsettled as Trump enters the presidential term.\\n\\nWaltz’s hard stand about national security issues, China and his close relationship with Trump have underpinned a very significant position for himself in the new ex-president plan of changing the US foreign policy norms.\\n\\nRead More : Lee Zeldin Tapped As EPA Administrator By President-elect Trump', 'summary': 'National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has been appointed, said sources close to the matter on Monday.\\n\\n\\nThe post Mike Waltz, India Caucus Head and China Hawk, Named Trump’s National Security Advisor appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/world/mike-waltz-india-caucus-head-and-china-hawk-named-trumps-national-security-advisor/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mike-Waltz.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 03:31:21', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.026}, {'id': 264200464, 'title': \"Who is Mike Waltz, Donald Trump's national security advisor, and why is it good news for India but bad for China?\", 'text': \"In what appears to be a calculated stance against China, US President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Florida Representative Mike Waltz as his national security advisor. Waltz, a retired Army Green Beret known for his extensive knowledge in military operations and policy, is a vocal critic of China and a staunch advocate for bolstering US strategic readiness in the Indo-Pacific.Impact on China Waltz's selection highlights the incoming administration’s focus on addressing the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist Party. He has previously called for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to concerns over Covid-19's origins and China's treatment of Uighurs.Waltz and former Pentagon strategist Matthew Kroenig, in a joint Economist article penned before the elections, emphasized the need for America to shift attention from Europe and the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific. “The next president should act urgently to bring the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to a swift conclusion and finally focus strategic attention where it should be: countering the greater threat from the Communist Party,” they stated.A consistent proponent of strengthening the US military to deter potential Chinese aggression, particularly towards Taiwan, Waltz highlights in his writings, America is not building armed forces to deny a Chinese attack on Taiwan. He emphasizes an increase in defense spending and revitalization of the defense-industrial base as crucial steps for military preparedness.Waltz takes on his new role amidst already tense US-China relations, fueled by trade disputes, military activities in the South China Sea, and ideological standoffs.India and US Relations: A Promising Signal Waltz’s crucial role in Trump’s administration not only marks a tougher approach towards China but also suggests a deepening of Indo-US relations. For India, wrestling its own conflicts with China, Waltz’s strategic focus appears as a promising development.As the co-head of the India Caucus in Congress, Waltz has supported enhanced US-India ties, an indication that his new role could further strengthen this partnership. Amid heightened tensions along the Line of Actual Control, India may find an opportunity to bolster defense and strategic ties under an NSA aligned with Indo-Pacific strategic priorities.The Broader Picture Mike Waltz, at 50, brings significant experience, having served in the Army and undertaken strategic roles, including serving at the Pentagon. Known for his strong stance on maintaining US military prowess, he has critiqued President Joe Biden's foreign policy strategies, particularly the Afghan withdrawal.Trump’s decision to include Waltz aligns with his America First strategy, prioritizing US security and strength. This may raise eyebrows among Nato allies, who remember Trump’s previous critical stance on the alliance and membership requirements. Waltz's focus on China could further ignite unease among European partners fearing a shift in US alliances.Donald Trump's Strategic AppointmentsTrump's choice of Waltz forms part of a strategic assembly shaping his upcoming administration. Appointments, such as Elise Stefanik as US ambassador to the UN and Tom Homan as border czar, embody Trump’s America First narrative. With Waltz's military and policy expertise, the administration emphasizes hard power and strategic rivalry over diplomatic endeavors.For China, Waltz’s bold perspectives suggest a US less willing to relent, while India sees a pathway to solidify its strategic partnership amid shared threats. As China escalates initiatives like the Belt and Road and South China Sea activities, the Indo-US alignment under Waltz offers a counterbalance.What Lies Ahead The upcoming months will define US foreign policy, with Waltz playing a crucial part in enhancing military capability in the Indo-Pacific. Expect stronger diplomatic connections with India and an increased focus on fortifying defense ties. This may lead to new bilateral agreements, collaborative military exercises, and unified regional strategies through platforms like the Quad. Nato and European allies must reassess their strategies as US efforts pivot towards China.(With inputs from agencies)115197200115025084\", 'summary': 'Donald Trump selected Mike Waltz as his new national security advisor.

Mike Waltz as his White House National Security Advisor (NSA). In an exclusive report by the Wall Street Journal, it has been revealed that while Florida Senator Marco Rubio may become Secretary of State, Waltz is seen as Trump’s choice for NSA.\\n\\nMike Waltz is known for his firm stance on national security and global defence, bringing a veteran’s perspective to key global issues including Pakistan, China, and NATO. In the past, he has voiced opinions that align closely with Trump’s stand on foreign policy. Waltz has advocated for a more robust US position on global security threats, balancing burdens with allies, and strengthening ties with democratic partners like India.\\n\\nMike Waltz on China – confronting an ‘aggressive force’ in the Indo-Pacific\\n\\nAccording to Waltz, there is a need to confront China’s increasing influence and authoritarian policies, specifically within the Indo-Pacific region. When he was a member of the House China Task Force, Waltz worked to shape US policy towards a more assertive stance against encroachments by China in regions like Taiwan, the South China Sea, and areas of strategic importance to allies like India and Australia.\\n\\nIn an interview with WION network, Mike Waltz highlighted his stance, stating, “The Chinese Communist Party is a destabilising force across the Indo-Pacific. It’s not just the Chinese people who suffer under this authoritarian regime; it’s also Taiwan, the Philippines, India, the United States, and more. Democracies need to come together to deter this type of aggression.”\\n\\nSince US congressman Michael Waltz @michaelgwaltz is expected to be Trump's NSA, here is his interview to @WIONews last year during Delhi visit (Aug 2023). Spoke on India ties, Pakistan, China, & condemned Khalistan violence as well. https://t.co/icKotP3v3T pic.twitter.com/bULrv908JZ— Sidhant Sibal (@sidhant) November 12, 2024\\n\\nFurthermore, he emphasised that the US-India relationship is central to countering China’s influence in the region. In the same interview, he remarked, “The trajectory of the US-India relationship is only getting higher and stronger. We’re working together in various spheres, from defence to energy,” which is vital for stabilising the Indo-Pacific and presenting a unified front against Chinese aggression in the region.\\n\\nWaltz on Pakistan – condemning the use of terrorism as state policy\\n\\nWaltz has been outspoken about Pakistan’s continuous support for terrorist organisations. He has warned against the destabilising impact of such policies on South Asia. Waltz has urged Pakistan to abandon any affiliation with groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba that threaten both regional and global security. During the interview with WION, he said, “I’ve said to my Pakistani counterparts many times that terrorism cannot be a tool of foreign policy. And whether that’s through Lashkar-e-Taiba or other types of terrorist groups, it’s just unacceptable. And the Pakistani government and the Pakistani military and intelligence services have to move past that, and we will continue to press them to move in the right direction and not use terrorism as an instrument.”\\n\\nMike Waltz on NATO – advocating for European burden sharing\\n\\nMike Waltz has been a longtime advocate of equitable burden-sharing within NATO and has strongly endorsed Trump’s position that European allies should contribute more substantially to collective defence efforts. In September 2023, he wrote an op-ed for Fox News, where Waltz outlined his stance, stating, “Stopping Russia before it draws NATO, and therefore the US, into war is the right thing to do. But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass. There must be policy space between Biden’s current strategy of ‘as long as it takes’ and those demanding ‘not another dollar.’”\\n\\nHe also pointed out instances where major European powers, including Germany, fell short of their defence commitments pledged during the 2014 NATO Summit. He wrote, “Germany, the largest economy in Europe and the most pivotal balancer to Russia, pulled back at the last minute from enshrining the two percent annual commitment into law. That needs to change – the administration cannot expect American taxpayers to pay for European security indefinitely.”\\n\\nWaltz specifically cited the Biden administration’s lack of assertiveness in compelling European allies to uphold their promises. He said, “In the near term, US military aid must be contingent on European burden-sharing and equal European assistance going forward. The US has provided nearly as much military aid to Ukraine – a reported $46.6 billion – as every other nation combined.” \\n\\nHis views reflect Trump’s broader “America First” philosophy, aimed at pushing for a recalibrated NATO where European nations meet their defence commitments so that the US can allocate resources to its borders.\\n\\nWaltz on Ukraine – ‘The era of blank cheques is over’\\n\\nOver time, Waltz has been a vocal critic of the US’s unconditional support for Ukraine. He emphasises the need for a clear objective in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In his op-ed, he argued that the era of Ukraine’s blank cheque from Congress is over. He asserted that, while most Americans are sympathetic to Ukraine, there is a need for a clear and achievable American objective. He questioned the Biden administration’s strategy, stating, “The Biden administration has neither explained the American objective in Ukraine nor his strategy to achieve it. Will American military spending continue until Ukraine has pushed Russia back to its prewar boundaries? Its pre-2014 boundaries? Or until the Putin regime collapses? We don’t know because Biden refuses to tell us. ‘As long as it takes’ is a slogan, not a strategy.”\\n\\nWaltz called for conditional support based on European burden-sharing and stressed that US taxpayers should not be expected to fund the majority of Ukraine’s defence. He said, “As long as Biden refuses to secure our southern border, Americans shouldn’t be asked to continue funding the defence of Ukraine.” His approach reflects a shift towards a more calculated support model that aligns with Trump’s foreign policy preferences.\\n\\nOn strengthening India-US ties\\n\\nWaltz has often expressed admiration for India as a strategic and democratic ally. He has previously described the relationship between India and the US as “essential” for regional stability. In his interview with WION, he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and the progress India has made in various sectors, including biotechnology, energy, and defence. Notably, in June 2023, Mike Waltz and Andry Barr introduced a legislation to allow weapon sales to India from the US to be fast-tracked and deepen the US-India defence ties.\\n\\nWaltz, who participated in India’s Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort, said, “It was a beautiful, amazing setting and what a historic setting. I mean the place of India’s first Independence Day speech by Nehru, the first prime minister. But I think what really jumped out at me was to hear Prime Minister Modi’s vision for India to be a fully developed nation by the 100th year anniversary, by 2047. It was very detailed, it was very forceful, very forward-looking. I thought it was a great speech and it was an honour to be there.”\\n\\nHighlighting India’s “Make in India” policy, he said, “I support it. I think every strong economy and strong democracy wants to be able to defend itself and to be able to make that equipment. But it’s not just the co-production, which I support. It’s also conducting joint exercises, like the Malabar exercise, that’s happening right now in Australia with the Australian, Indian, and the US militaries all working together. So how do we employ that equipment in our training, operations, tactics, and planning together, which I think will help stabilise the Indo-Pacific and serve to deter a very aggressive Chinese Communist Party from many of the bad actions it’s currently taking right now.”\\n\\nFuture role and alignment with Trump’s policies\\n\\nWaltz’s name being forwarded as NSA signals Trump’s intent to foster alliances with democratic nations while demanding fair contributions from NATO allies and partners. Waltz’s alignment with Trump’s foreign policy positions is evident in his straightforward approach to tackling issues of terrorism, burden-sharing in alliances, and the recalibration of US global commitments.\\n\\nWith Waltz as NSA, the Trump administration is expected to maintain a tough stance on adversaries while prioritising US interests.\", 'summary': 'President-elect Trump reportedly picked Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser, who has strong stances on China, Pakistan, NATO, and alliances with democratic partners like India.', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/donald-trump-picks-pro-india-mike-waltz-as-national-security-adviser/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Feature-Images-101-200-OpIndia-1-3.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 08:43:13', 'author': 'Anurag', 'authors': ['Anurag'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.201}, {'id': 264292834, 'title': 'Donald Trump Appoints Congressman Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser', 'text': 'President Donald Trump has chosen Congressman Mike Waltz, co-chair of the India Caucus and a veteran Army Green Beret, as his pick for National Security Adviser.

These actions are part of an ongoing probe into alleged demographic changes in Jharkhands tribal regions, particularly Santhal Pargana and Kolhan. The issue has sparked political controversy over suspected illegal immigration.Political tensions have risen as the enforcement branch of Jharkhand coordinates these raids. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have accused the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha government of permitting illegal Bangladeshi immigrants to settle on indigenous tribal lands. As elections approach, BJP leaders argue that such infiltration threatens the regions culture and demographics.Political Reactions to Immigration ConcernsEarlier this month, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh addressed a public rally in Ranchi on November 5. He promised that if the BJP gained power in Jharkhand, they would implement strict measures against illegal Bangladeshi immigration to protect tribal lands. Singhs statement highlighted the BJPs stance on safeguarding local rights and reversing demographic trends.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also spoke on November 10 about the threat posed by Bangladeshi infiltrators. At a rally in Deoghar, Chouhan stated, These Bangladeshi infiltrators not only endanger our land and women but also the very Sanatan Sanskriti. They want to annihilate our civilization.Legal Actions and InvestigationsThe EDs actions follow an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) filed under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This was initiated after an FIR by Jharkhand police at Bariyatu police station in Ranchi in June. The investigation focuses on unlawful infiltration by Bangladeshi nationals into Jharkhand and nearby areas.Earlier this month, six Bangladeshi citizens, including three transgenders, were arrested at a rail terminus in West Tripura while allegedly planning to travel to Mumbai. These arrests highlight ongoing concerns about smuggling people from Bangladesh.Impact on Upcoming ElectionsThe presence of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants has become a significant issue ahead of the Jharkhand elections.

This was a follow-up on a comprehensive probe into money laundering allegedly coming from such funds. The ED has tried to find out illegal operations connected with human trafficking and generation of crime proceeds.\\n\\nAccording to reports, the raids were conducted in several districts of election-bound Jharkhand and at some places in neighboring West Bengal. The operation forms part of an ongoing investigation into a case related to the illegitimate entry of Bangladeshi nationals, particularly women, on the Indian mainland allegedly for trafficking and forced labor purposes. The ED had initiated the case under the PMLA after an inquiry into human trafficking activities in which slush funds were created.\\n\\nThe case came to the fore in September 2024, when the Enforcement Directorate filed an official case to probe infiltration and trafficking of Bangladeshi women in Jharkhand. Probe is being conducted on the complaint filed in June 2024 by a Bangladeshi woman in Ranchi. She, as per a complaint filed by her in June 2024, had been trafficked from Bangladesh into India with the help of touts through the India-Bangladesh border.\\n\\nAllegations Of Trafficking And Fraud\\n\\nIn the compliant, the woman had implicated several people for trafficking women including herself to India on false pretenses. Among the six women listed as suspects were several who were arrested after a raid was carried out at a local resort. The victim reportedly managed to escape from one such guesthouse and then migrated to a police station. When the police during the probe interrogated them, they found that one of the women was carrying a forged Aadhaar card.\\n\\nIn the complaint statement, it was revealed that the women were trafficked to India on the pretext of jobs but were converted upon arrival into prostitution. This is the desperate case of a larger human trafficking issue and exploitation of vulnerable people across borders.\\n\\nED Expands Probe To Overall Region\\n\\nThis probe by Enforcement Directorate into the trafficking case doesn’t limit itself to just this case but probes into a larger scheme of illegal infiltration along the borders, particularly in the tribal districts of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan of Jharkhand. According to ED, the inquiry will cover the full scope of infiltration activities into the region from Bangladesh, which is said to experience the most serious impact of such illicit networks.\\n\\nBJP Blames Jharkhand Government\\n\\nThe political connotations of these raids have been huge, as allegations have been leveled against the Jharkhand government. Several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have named the Jharkhand government in public for helping illegals enter India and alleged that this has demographic implications in the tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions, wherein many expect that this inflow would alter the local socio-political structure.\\n\\nChief Minister Yogi Adityanath followed suit, accusing the Rohingya refugee and Bangladeshi infiltrator-welcoming coalition headed by the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) of turning the state into a “dharmashala.” That’s part of a broader BJP campaign against the state government ahead of next month’s assembly elections.\\n\\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah announced that in the event the BJP government came to power in Jharkhand, a committee would be formed for identifying and streamlining the elimination of infiltrators from the state. The committee will also pay attention to reclaiming lands which are said to be occupied by these illegal immigrants.\\n\\nMUST READ | Indian Army Celebrates National Education Day At Assam’s Tinsukia District School', 'summary': 'The Enforcement Directorate raided 17 locations in Jharkhand and West Bengal in connection with a money laundering probe related to alleged illegal Bangladeshi infiltration.\\n\\n\\nThe post ED Cracks Down On Bangladeshi Infiltration Case, 17 Locations Raided in Jharkhand, West Bengal appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/ed-cracks-down-on-bangladeshi-infiltration-case-17-locations-raided-in-jharkhand-west-bengal/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ED-conducts-raids.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 06:08:32', 'author': 'Satyam Singh', 'authors': ['Satyam Singh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.025}, {'id': 264239080, 'title': 'ED raids in Jharkhand, West Bengal in illegal Bangladeshi infiltration case', 'text': 'Ranchi: The Enforcement Directorate Tuesday raided multiple locations in poll-bound Jharkhand apart from West Bengal in a money laundering investigation linked to alleged illegal infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals, official sources said.\\n\\nA total of 17 places are being covered in the two neighbouring states by the Ranchi office of the federal probe agency, a day before the first phase of polling in Jharkhand.\\n\\nVisuals of CRPF personnel positioned outside a hotel located on Bariatu Road in Ranchi and a resort in the city were captured by press teams as ED teams scoured for documents, ledger entries and financial records inside.\\n\\nThe agency had in September filed a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to probe an instance of alleged infiltration and trafficking of some Bangladeshi women into Jharkhand leading to the generation of alleged slush funds.\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have accused the state government of aiding such infiltration leading to the altering of the demographic landscape of the tribal-dominated areas of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions during the recent poll campaign.\\n\\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Monday accused the ruling JMM-led coalition of converting Jharkhand into a ‘dharmashala’ for Rohingyas and Bangladeshi infiltrators.\\n\\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah announced in Seraikela Monday that a committee would be formed, if BJP is voted to power in Jharkhand, to identify and drive out infiltrators from the state besides reclaiming land grabbed by them.\\n\\nThe first phase of the Assembly polls is slated for 43 constituencies Wednesday, while the second for 38 seats will be held November 20.\\n\\nThe ECIR (enforcement case information report) filed by the federal agency under various sections of the PMLA stems from a Jharkhand Police FIR filed at the Bariyatu police station in the state capital Ranchi in June.\\n\\nThe police FIR, filed on the complaint of a Bangladeshi woman who allegedly infiltrated into the country from along the India-Bangladesh border with the help of touts to find work, has named around six women as accused who were arrested following a raid at a local resort.\\n\\nThe woman who filed the complaint escaped from a similar guest house and reached the police station.

Senior advocate Rohatgi sought adjournment due to his bad throat. The actor had approached the Supreme Court seeking anticipatory bail in connection with the rape case.

The case is being investigated by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Kerala government.Siddique was booked by the museum police in Thiruvananthapuram on August 27 under the charges of rape and criminal intimidation, based on a complaint filed by a young actor. However, Siddique categorically denied the allegation.This came after the Malayalam film industry was rocked by a “Me Too” movement exposing various allegations of sexual abuse earlier in August this year.Following the allegations, Siddique resigned from his position as general secretary of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA). Consequently, the entire 17-member executive committee of AMMA also resigned.Serious accusations have been made by several women actors against prominent figures in the industry, including director Ranjith and actors Mukesh, Jayasurya, and Edavela Babu, among others.The surge in these allegations came in the wake of the release of the Justice Hema Committee report, which exposed disturbing accounts of harassment, exploitation, and the systematic mistreatment of women in the industry.The report, made public on August 19, after redacting the names of witnesses and the accused, noted that the Malayalam film industry is controlled by about 10 to 15 male producers, directors, and actors who dominate and exert control over the industry', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/sc-extends-interim-protection-from-arrest-to-actor-siddique-in-rape-case/', 'image': 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 06:43:32', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.46}, {'id': 264222510, 'title': \"Mollywood MeToo: Actor Siddique's Interim Protection From Arrest Extended\", 'text': \"The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended the interim protection from arrest granted to Malayalam film actor Siddique in an alleged rape case.

This dark comedy on the oppression of the peasants by the zamindars was adapted from a play by Mitra.Mitra had around 100 one-act and full-length plays to his credit besides film scripts.His major full-length plays include \\'Narak Guljar\\' (The Great Hell), \\'Aswathama\\', \\'Chakbhanga Madhu\\' (Honey from Broken Hive), \\'Mesh O Rakhash\\' (The Lamb and the Monster), \\'Galpo Hekim Saheb\\' (Tale of a Hekim), \\'Rajdarshan\\' (Visiting the King), \\'Alokanandar Putra Kanya\\' (Alokananda\\'s Son and Daughter), \\'Sajano Bagan\\' (Decorated Garden), \\'Chhayar Prashad\\' (The Palace of Shadows) and \\'Jene Shune Bish\\' (Poison, Knowingly).Partition of the country, Naxalite movement of Bengal, tyranny of the ruling class, religious fundamentalism and other major issues were highlighted in Mitra\\'s plays.Among his key one-act plays are \\'Mrityur Chokhe Jal\\' (Tears in the Eyes of Death), \\'Chokhe Angul Dada\\' (The Fault Finder), \\'Ami Madan Bolchhi\\' (Hello I am Madan), \\'Takshak\\' and others.According to academician and translator Mousumi Roy Chowdhury, in Mitra’s plays, conscience has a major role.\"Not strictly restricted to an instrumental moral sense, conscience here is used in the larger sense of consciousness that reaches beyond the closures and binaries of the regulating norms of the political theatre,\" Roy Chowdhury said in an anthology of plays translated by her.He also acted in more than 80 films including Satyajit Ray\\'s classics \\'Ghare Baire\\' (Home and the World, 1984) and \\'Ganashatru\\' (An Enemy of the People, 1989). Mitra also worked on projects of Tapan Sinha - \\'Adalat O Ekti Meye\\' (The Court and a Woman, 1982) and \\'Wheel Chair\\' (1995).After the 1984 superhit potboiler \\'Shatru\\' (Enemy) in which he essayed the role of a notorious leader, Mitra got a chance to act in Bollywood films. He, however, rejected that proposal apprehending that it would impact his involvement in theatre.Mitra was born December 22, 1938, in a village in Khulna district of undivided Bengal. His father was a government officer.Interestingly, though plays were enacted at his family home during the festive days of Durga puja, children were not allowed to watch them. Backdrops, props, costumes and other articles associated with the staging of plays stored at home kindled his passion for plays.Mitra permanently came to India from East Pakistan at the age of 12. He cleared his MA in Philosophy in 1960.During the college and university days, he wrote short stories and plays. However, after his play \\'Mrityur Chokhe Jal\\' earned him first prize at a statewide competition, he focused only on this field. His acting prowess mesmerised veteran actors of that time as the 21-year-old youth effortlessly metamorphosed into an elderly man in \\'Mrityur Chokhe Jal\\'.Also in the film \\'Banchharamer Bagan\\', adapted from his play \\'Sajano Bagan\\' (1977), he essayed the role of the 90-year-old protagonist when Mitra was in his 40s. He bagged the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the movie.The playwright was conferred with the Sangeet Natak Award (1985) and the Asiatic Society Award (2005) for his overall contribution to theatre, among numerous other awards.Mitra also headed the theatre group \\'Sundaram\\' for many years. He was a professor of philosophy in a college in West Bengal.

Our client states that it is apposite to put the true and correct facts leading to the issuance of the present notice,\" the legal notice read.The document further mentions that Rupali Ganguly endured mental trauma due to these statements, requiring medical treatment, and faced humiliation on set, which also led to the loss of professional opportunities. The notice explains that while the actress initially chose to remain silent out of dignity, she was forced to take legal action after she and her husband Ashwin Verma\\'s 11-year-old son was dragged into the matter. She has also demanded an immediate, unconditional public apology. Failure to comply will result in further legal action, as stated in the notice.The legal notice further clarified that Rupali Ganguly had been friends with Ashwin Verma for 12 years before he separated from his second wife (Esha\\'s mother) in 2009. It also mentioned that the actress and her husband Ashwin Verma, had tried to support Esha\\'s career by providing her with opportunities, such as arranging photoshoots and special audition arrangements, in an effort to help her break into the entertainment industry.It all started after Esha Verma made serious allegations against her father Ashwin Verma and Rupali Ganguly. In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, the 26-year-old accused Rupali of physically assaulting her mother in Mumbai, stating, \"Rupali physically hit my mother in person in Mumbai.\" Esha also accused Ashwin of being \"a very abusive man physically and emotionally.\" She went on to say, “I was devastated, crying in high school because of the women who deliberately came into our lives, who broke my parent\\'s marriage, who physically hit my mother in person in Mumbai in my grandparent\\'s house. To see her win, that\\'s the most devastating thing which I have gone through. I\\'m not pinpointing just Rupali here; I have also gathered the strength to say that it is my father\\'s fault. He was also a very abusive man physically and emotionally so it\\'s a two-party street.\"Esha further claimed that when the news of her allegations first went viral, she was terrified and pressured by her father to delete her post. She also recounted an unsettling experience when Rupali travelled to their home in New Jersey and allegedly slept in the bed shared by Esha\\'s parents. \"It was Rupali who told my father to give my mother the divorce papers,\" Esha revealed. She expressed her disbelief over Ashwin\\'s recent comments on social media, where he denied Rupali\\'s involvement. Esha countered, saying, \"I don\\'t know what Rupali and Ashwin will now say further to these allegations and comments. I know my father has said something on Twitter now X. He said that Rupali was not involved, and that is the biggest lie because Rupali was the one who came to my house in New Jersey and slept on my mother\\'s bed—the bed that my father and mother shared. She has done so much, physically, mentally, verbally, and emotionally, abusing me and my mom. I feel like that was a lot of trauma I had to deal with and suffer with and my mom did too. We suffered a lot, and we don\\'t have that exposure as she does.”Last week, Ashwin K Verma issued a statement on X (previously Twitter) and addressed the allegations levelled against him and Rupali. He wrote, \"I do have two daughters from previous relationships, something Rupali and I have always been open about that I care a great deal about. I understand that my younger daughter still holds a lot of hurt about the dissolution of her parent\\'s relationship as divorce is a difficult experience that can greatly affect and harm the children of that marriage. But marriages end for many reasons, and my relationship with my second wife had multiple challenges that led to our separation-challenges that were between she and I and that had nothing to do with any other person. I only want the best for my children and my wife and it saddens me to see anyone being pulled into cycles of negativity by the media.”A sincere reflection on recent remarks. pic.twitter.com/QfpN324fwB— Ashwin K Verma (@AshwinKVerma) November 3, 2024Esha, now 26, is the daughter of Ashwin and Sapna Verma and currently resides in the United States.

Visuals of CRPF personnel positioned outside a hotel located on Bariatu Road in Ranchi and a resort in the city were captured by press teams as ED teams scoured for documents, ledger entries and financial records inside. The agency issued a statement on its official X handle at around 3 pm, saying it has recovered \"incriminating\" items like fake Aadhaar cards, forged passports, illegal arms, immovable property documents, cash, jewellery, printing paper and machines and blank proformas used for forging Aadhaar during the raids. Searches are continuing, it said, as the agency attached pictures of these recoveries with the said post. The agency had in September filed a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to probe an instance of alleged infiltration and trafficking of some Bangladeshi women into Jharkhand leading to the generation of alleged slush funds. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have accused the state government of aiding such infiltration leading to the altering of the demographic landscape of the tribal-dominated areas of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions during the recent poll campaign. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday accused the ruling JMM-led coalition of converting Jharkhand into a \\'dharmashala\\' for Rohingyas and Bangladeshi infiltrators. Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced in Seraikela on Monday that a committee would be formed, if BJP is voted to power in Jharkhand, to identify and drive out infiltrators from the state besides reclaiming land grabbed by them. The first phase of the Assembly polls is slated for 43 constituencies on Wednesday, while the second for 38 seats will be held on November 20. The ECIR (enforcement case information report) filed by the federal agency under various sections of the PMLA stems from a Jharkhand Police FIR filed at the Bariyatu police station in the state capital Ranchi in June. The police FIR, filed on the complaint of a Bangladeshi woman who allegedly infiltrated into the country from along the India-Bangladesh border with the help of touts to find work, has named around six women as accused who were arrested following a raid at a local resort. The woman who filed the complaint escaped from a similar guest house and reached the police station. Police also recovered a \"fake\" Aadhaar card from one of these women. Police pressed multiple IPC sections like 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 34 (common intention) in the FIR. It also slapped section 12 of the Passport Act (knowingly furnishing any false information or suppressing any material information with a view to obtaining a passport or travel document) and 14A of the Foreigners Act (penalty for entry in restricted area) in the complaint. The FIR quoted the woman complainant saying they were trafficked into India from Bangladesh allegedly for prostitution by luring them in the name of getting a job in beauty salons. ED sources had earlier said the agency will investigate the \"entire gamut\" of infiltration from across the eastern borders, including Bangladesh, into Jharkhand including in the tribal districts of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan. Prime Minister Modi, while addressing a poll rally a few months ago, accused the Jharkhand government of encouraging Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltration for vote bank politics and criticised it for \"rampant corruption\". The prime minister asserted that these infiltrators pose a significant threat to the state by altering the demographic landscape of the Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions. Modi accused the JMM of \"supporting infiltrators\" and claimed that \"illegal immigrants from the neighbouring country have managed to gain influence over the ruling party in the state.\" He criticised the Jharkhand government for refusing to acknowledge the infiltration issue despite a high court order to establish an independent panel to investigate the influx of Bangladeshi immigrants. The Union government had informed the Jharkhand High Court that illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are living in the state.

It is understood he has communicated the decision to the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) and will continue playing T20Is. Ever since his international debut in 2009, Nabi has been a part of the Afghanistan side, which has beaten over 30 countries, out of which many are still striving towards the full-member, Test-playing status which Afghanistan got in 2017. From wins over unknown teams like Denmark, Italy, Argentina, and Tanzania to much stronger associate nations like Scotland, UAE, Namibia, Netherlands etc, Afghanistan have come a long way, beating Test-playing teams like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, England, Australia, New Zealand, West Indies.Most of these Test-playing nations are either current world champions or have held a world championship in 50-over/Test/T20I format previously.Even at the age of 39, Nabi’s contribution to the Afghanistan team remains unparalleled. In their recent ODI series triumph, he ended the series as top run-getter with a tally of 135. He even chipped in with the ball, bagging two wickets across three ODIs. Overall, Nabi has 3,600 ODI runs under his belt in 167 matches, averaging 27.48 while striking at 86.99, making him the second-highest run-getter for Afghanistan in the format. His contribution as a player for Afghanistan becomes even more valuable when one looks at his statistics with the ball. With his off-spin, Nabi has scythed 172 wickets, the second-highest for Afghanistan, while averaging 32.47.The upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025 will mark the maiden appearance for Afghanistan in the event.

Videos of the incident doing rounds on social media showed people fighting and brandishing poles during the protest.\\n\\nResponding to the violence, which broke out at the Hindu Sabha Temple, a venue of clash between two groups.

In a post on social media, he demanded immediate action from Canadian authorities to ensure justice and maintain law and order. “Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,” he wrote.\\n\\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also condemned violence and stated that all people in Canada have the right to live in their religion freely and safely. The attack further strained the already sour relationship between India and Canada that was already in controversy over allegations of involvement by India in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\\n\\nArrests during Violent Protest\\n\\nIn relation to violent protests, Peel Regional Police have arrested a 35-year-old Brampton resident Inderjeet Gosal who is also the Canadian coordinator for the separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Gosal has been charged with assault with a weapon. Sikhs for Justice is banned in India for its pro-Khalistan stance. Gosal was taken into custody on November 8, 2024, and was granted bail later with conditions and further appearance in court.\\n\\nIndian authorities have been sounding the alarm regarding their citizens’ safety in Canada, particularly over the growing influence of pro-Khalistan elements allowed to operate freely in this nation. The Indian government called for legal action against those responsible for violent protests, while making sure that attacks like these would not go without consequences.\\n\\nCurrent Tensions Between Canada and India\\n\\nThis happens at a time of heightened diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, further fueled by the dubious claims from September 2023 made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau regarding Indian involvement in the killing of Khalistan separatist leader Nijjar. India has termed these accusations as “absurd,” insisting that the real issue remains Canada’s tolerance of groups in favor of pro-Khalistan operating from its soil.\\n\\nAs these incidents come into sight, the Canadian government can face more pressure in responding to the security needs of the country and taking more aggressive actions against violent separatist elements.\\n\\nRead More : BJP Seeks EC Censure For Rahul Gandhi’s ‘False Statements’ During Maharashtra Election Drive', 'summary': 'The Brampton Triveni Community Centre in Canada has cancelled a scheduled consular camp for November 17, 2024, after intelligence warnings stated there is an \"extremely high and imminent threat level\" of violent protests.\\n\\n\\nThe post Brampton Temple In Canada Halts Event Amidst Khalistani Separatist Threats appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/brampton-temple-in-canada-halts-event-amidst-khalistani-separatist-threats/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Khalistani-protests.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 03:10:20', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.416}, {'id': 264209262, 'title': 'Hindu temple in Brampton forced to cancel event amid threats', 'text': \"Ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections, the issue of Maratha reservation has garnered wind.

According to sources interviewed by The New York Times, the decision has been made: Rubio, a seasoned Republican and once a presidential rival, will be the Department of State’s new secretary.\\n\\nMarc Rubio, 52, has emerged as the latest high-profile contender on the reported shortlist of President Trump’s possible picks for Secretary of State. Despite intense political battles over the years between the two, this is potentially a watershed moment in Rubio’s ties with the president. Reports claimed Rubio has led the pack of contenders, others including Ric Grenell, former US ambassador to Germany, in Trump’s preference over the last week.\\n\\nDuring a talk on a high profile cabinet seat, Rubio further expressed the zeal to serve the nation by saying while talking on CNN, “I am always interested in serving this country.”\\n\\nRubio’s Way From Critic To Loyalist\\n\\nThe naming of Rubio, a Cuban-American and known for his hardline stance on foreign policy, means that the president is shifting his way towards former critics’ joining him in the inner circle. Rubio has had many past bitter political exchanges with Trump. Rubio went on a strong verbal attack against Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, calling the latter a “con artist” and “the most vulgar person to ever seek the presidency.” Since those red hot words, however, Rubio has found himself gravitating toward Trump’s policies and even endorsed Trump for the presidency in 2024. This means that the two Republicans now seem to be on one page with their goals for the country’s foreign policy.\\n\\nRubio’s Political Career\\n\\nMarco Rubio’s political service has spanned more than two decades. Rubio started as a city commissioner in West Miami. Born to Cuban immigrants in Miami, Florida, Rubio earned his bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Florida in 1993 and received a law degree from a later date. His political trail didn’t end yet, as in the year 2000, he won his election to represent Florida’s 111th district in the state’s House of Representatives and eventually made his way to Speaker from 2006 to 2008.\\n\\nIn the year 2010, Rubio won without contest a seat in the U.S. Senate with an unrelenting support faction of the Republican party-the Tea Party movement, infamous for its ultra-conservatism. Since then, Rubio has been developed as an advocate on foreign policy issues focused on U.S.-Latin America relations. His efforts during the first term of Trump earned him the unofficial title of “virtual secretary of state for Latin America.” If nominated, sustained engagement in this space may determine much of his vision as Secretary of State.\\n\\nImpact Of Rubio In Current Elections\\n\\nRubio was re-elected into the senate for a third term in 2022, where he won against the Democrat, Val Demings, and made sure he was secured as Florida’s senior senator after Bill Nelson stepped down in 2019. Rubio endorsed the presidential campaign by Trump in early 2024, ahead of the Iowa caucuses, making sure that Rubio’s affirmation was further sealed with the President-elect.\\n\\nMUST READ | Kai Trump Shares Vlog Of Mar-A-Lago Election Celebration For Her Grandfather Donald Trump’s Win | WATCH', 'summary': 'Florida Senator Marco Rubio, once a Trump critic, now stands as a top pick for Secretary of State.

He is known for his hawkish stance on countries like China, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio’s selection is seen as an effort by Trump to diversify his administration's leadership, potentially strengthening his appeal among Latino voters, a demographic that has traditionally leaned Democratic but shifted in Trump's favour during the recent election.While Rubio has been a vocal advocate for a strong US presence on the world stage, he has, in recent years, adjusted some of his positions to align with Trump’s approach of restraint. Early Life, education, and political riseRubio’s parents emigrated from Cuba in 1956, settling first in Miami and later in Las Vegas, where his father worked as a bartender and his mother as a hotel housekeeper. Although raised Catholic, Rubio was briefly baptized as a Mormon before returning to his Catholic roots. The family returned to Florida in 1985, where Rubio graduated from the University of Florida in 1993 before earning a law degree from the University of Miami.Rubio’s political career began early. He worked for Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen before serving on the West Miami City Commission. In 1999, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, where he served until 2008, including stints as majority leader and speaker.Senate careerIn 2009, Rubio launched his campaign for the US Senate seat left vacant by Mel Martinez’s resignation. Initially trailing Florida Governor Charlie Crist, Rubio’s fortunes changed when Crist broke from the Republican Party and declared himself an independent. Rubio won the 2010 election by a significant margin in a three-way race.Once in the Senate, Rubio aligned himself with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. He opposed key Democratic initiatives such as gun control, the Affordable Care Act, and climate-change legislation. Despite this, he broke with many in his party when he co-authored a 2013 immigration reform bill that sought to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill ultimately failed to pass.Rubio also became known for his foreign policy views, particularly his opposition to the Obama administration's attempts to normalize relations with Cuba. His foreign policy stance has often reflected an interventionist approach, particularly regarding China and the Middle East.2016 presidential campaign and shift to populismRubio’s 2016 presidential campaign was initially seen as a strong challenge to Donald Trump. He positioned himself as a candidate who could unite the Republican Party establishment but struggled against Trump’s dominance in the race. After a brutal series of defeats, Rubio suspended his campaign after losing the Florida primary.Following his return to the Senate, Rubio began to embrace more populist conservative views, aligning more closely with Trump’s America First agenda. He became a vocal supporter of Trump and developed a strong working relationship with him. Although Rubio initially backed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, he ultimately voted to certify Joe Biden’s victory after the January 6 Capitol attack.Foreign policy Rubio’s foreign policy views align with Trump on many fronts, though there are some key differences. Both have been critical of Nato, with Rubio co-sponsoring legislation that would make it more difficult for a president to withdraw from the alliance without Senate approval. Rubio is also a staunch critic of China, pushing for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in US technology and advocating for a hardline approach on issues like Huawei’s influence.One of Rubio’s most personal stances is his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba, a policy he shares with Trump. He is also a vocal critic of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, reflecting his deep personal connection to the island through his Cuban-American heritage.Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, whom he met as a teenager, and they have four children. He has authored two books: An American Son (2012), a memoir about his upbringing, and American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone (2015), which outlines his policy views.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump has selected Senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for Secretary of State.

This move is seen as a significant consolidation in the civil aviation sector in India, with Singapore Airlines retaining a 25.1% stake in the merged entity.The transition from Vistara to Air India is being handled with meticulous attention to detail to ensure a smooth experience for passengers. The merged entity has introduced a new code, AI2XXX, for all former Vistara flights, making it easier for travelers to identify their bookings. This change is part of a broader strategy to integrate the operations, staff, and customer service under the Air India banner seamlessly. According to Air India CEO and MD Campbell Wilson, teams from both airlines have been collaborating for months to facilitate the transfer of aircraft, crew, and support staff, aiming to make the transition as seamless as possible for their valued customers.First International and Domestic Flights Post-MergerIn the wake of the merger, the first international flight under the Air India-Vistara banner left Doha for Mumbai, marking a significant milestone as the first international operation by the newly integrated airline. This flight, designated AI2286, embarked on its journey at approximately 10.07 pm local time, with a scheduled arrival in Mumbai in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The flight duration was nearly three hours, symbolizing the new beginning for the combined entity. On the domestic front, the merged airlines inaugural flight, AI2984, took off from Mumbai, heading to Delhi, shortly after 1.30 am on Tuesday. This flight was operated using an A320 aircraft, further indicating the smooth continuation of operations post-merger.Despite the cessation of Vistaras brand, its aircraft, routes, and crew will maintain their operations until at least March, ensuring continuity and minimal disruption for passengers. This strategy is indicative of the careful planning and consideration behind the integration process, aiming to preserve the quality and reliability of service that customers have come to expect from both Air India and Vistara.The Implications of the MergerThe merger of Air India and Vistara is not just a significant event in the Indian aviation sector; it also represents a strategic consolidation move by the Tata Group. By merging these two airlines, the group aims to create a more robust and competitive entity capable of standing toe-to-toe with global aviation giants. For Singapore Airlines, the decision to merge Vistara with Air India and retain a stake in the joint entity underscores their long-term commitment to the Indian aviation market and their confidence in the mergers success.This landmark integration of Air India and Vistara marks the end of an era for Vistara, which had been a significant player in Indian aviation since its inception on January 9, 2015, up until its last day of operations on November 11, 2024.The journey of Vistara, from its launch to its merger with Air India, has been a transformative period for Indian aviation, setting new standards for service and operational excellence.

Infiltrators are grabbing land by marrying our daughters. We will bring legislation to prevent the transfer of land to infiltrators if they marry tribal women.

They use them according to their will, while the BJP respects and honours the tribal brothers and sisters. The people of Jharkhand consider them their own,” Shah claimed.

This election sees the states 2.6 crore voters, split almost evenly between 1.3 crore million men and 1.29 crore women, ready to cast their ballots.Notably, the youth vote is strong, with 66.84 lakh voters aged between 20 and 29, including 11.84 crore first-time voters aged 18 and 19, poised to make their voices heard.In the 2019 Assembly elections, the Mahagathbandhan, a coalition comprising the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress, and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), emerged victorious in 44 seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 30 constituencies. The dynamics of this election are closely watched, given the historical context and the distribution of power among the various political entities vying for control.Key Constituencies and Candidates to WatchOne of the pivotal seats in this election is Barhait, where incumbent Chief Minister Hemant Soren of the JMM is contesting. The BJP has nominated Gamaliyan Hembrom to challenge Soren. Back in 2019, Soren secured the seat with 73,725 votes, surpassing his closest competitor, Simon Marandi of the BJP, by a significant margin.Another crucial contest is in Gandey, with Hemant Sorens wife, Kalpana Soren, representing the JMM, and Muniya Devi running on the BJP ticket. Kalpana Sorens entry into the race follows her victory in a 2024 assembly by-election, where she received 109,827 votes, defeating BJPs Dilip Verma.In Dumka, a Scheduled Tribes (ST) seat, the competition sees Hemant Sorens brother Basant Soren on the JMM ticket going up against Sunil Soren from the BJP. Basant Soren managed to outpace BJPs Lois Marandi in the 2020 by-election, marking a significant win.Ranchi presents a battleground where JMMs Rajya Sabha MP Mahua Maji challenges BJPs CP Singh, a stronghold for the BJP where Singh has won six times. Majis attempt to unseat Singh in the last assembly election saw her providing stiff competition, though Singh ultimately won by over 5,000 votes.In Lohardaga, a constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes and of significant political importance due to its substantial tribal population, the Congress has fielded Rameshwar Oraon against Niru Shanti Bhagat of the BJP. Oraons victory in 2019 marked a significant moment for the Congress party in the region.The Dhanwar seat, located in the Giridih district and part of the Koderma Lok Sabha constituency, sees incumbent MLA Babulal Marandi of the BJP facing off against JMMs Niazamuddin Ansari. Marandi, who joined the BJP in 2019, successfully contested the seat as part of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Democratic), defeating Laxman Prasad Singh of the BJP by a margin of 17,550 votes.With the stage set for an engaging electoral battle, the outcomes in these key constituencies could significantly influence the political landscape in Jharkhand.

The decision follows a violent pro-Khalistani demonstration on November 3, where protesters attacked devotees outside a nearby temple, including women and children. In a statement, the Brampton Triveni Mandir highlighted an “extremely high and imminent threat level of violent protests” as the reason for the event’s cancellation, based on intelligence received from Peel Regional Police.\\n\\nA Community Event Canceled Due to Security Threats\\n\\nThe Brampton Triveni Mandir was set to host a life certificate camp organized by the Indian Consulate. However, heightened security risks forced a change in plans. An open letter from the temple explained the rationale, pointing to official police intelligence warning of imminent threats from protests, potentially endangering temple visitors and local residents.\\n\\nIn its statement, the temple said, “Please be advised that the Life Certificate Event scheduled at Brampton Triveni Mandir by the Indian Consulate on November 17, 2024, has been cancelled. This is due to official intelligence from Peel Regional Police, stating that there is an Extremely High and Imminent Threat Level of violent protests.”\\n\\nFollowing this advisory, temple officials made the difficult decision to cancel, apologizing to community members who relied on the event for official documentation. “On the advice of Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah, we must make the appropriate decision to cancel to ensure the safety of Brampton Triveni Mandir devotees, community visitors, and the general public,” the statement continued.\\n\\nPlanned Temple Protests\\n\\nThe cancellation comes after Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, leader of the pro-Khalistani group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), publicly announced targeted actions against Hindu temples. In an alarming statement, Pannun said that SFJ would focus on Indian diplomats at temples on November 16 and 17, marking the Triveni Mandir in Brampton and the Kalibari Mandir in Mississauga as specific targets. Pannun claimed the group would “shake the foundations of Ayodhya” and criticized Canadian authorities, alleging that Indian diplomats are responsible for espionage against Canadian Sikhs.\\n\\nThe heightened threat has sparked concern within the local Hindu community. Temple representatives called on Peel Police to take protective action, emphasizing the need for stronger security to allow Hindu Canadians to worship safely.\\n\\nEscalating Concerns for Community Safety\\n\\nThe recent incident at Brampton’s Hindu Sabha Temple has amplified fears among Hindu Canadians. On November 3, an Indian consular camp held at the temple was disrupted by pro-Khalistani protesters, who clashed with attendees and security personnel. Videos circulated widely on social media captured chaotic scenes of physical confrontations, with individuals using flagpoles as weapons on the temple grounds. This incident drew condemnation from both Canadian and Indian leaders.\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grave concern, calling the attack on the Hindu temple a “deliberate” and “cowardly” act meant to intimidate the Indian diaspora. “I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,” Modi stated on X.\\n\\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also condemned the violence, asserting that every Canadian has the right to worship freely and safely. In response to the unrest, the Consulate General of India in Toronto canceled several planned consular camps across Canada, citing an inability to guarantee the necessary security measures.\\n\\nGrowing Anxiety Among Hindu Canadians\\n\\nThe Brampton Triveni Mandir, an important religious and community center for Hindu Canadians, expressed regret over the cancellation and concern for the safety of its devotees. “We are deeply saddened that Canadians now feel unsafe coming to Hindu Temples in Canada,” the statement read. The temple urged authorities to address the ongoing threats and called for security measures to safeguard worshippers and community members.\\n\\nThe consular camps, such as the one originally planned for November 17, provide vital services, including life certificate renewals for Indian-origin Hindus and Sikhs. These documents are essential for accessing a range of official benefits. However, pro-Khalistani activists like Pannun have publicly disparaged such initiatives. Referring to the cancellation of events as a “victory for Pro Khalistan Sikhs,” Pannun claimed that these consular camps are “not life certificate camps but death certificate camps” and even urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to close Indian consulates permanently.', 'summary': 'Brampton’s Triveni Mandir and Community Centre in Canada announced the cancellation of a life certificate event scheduled for November 17\\n\\n\\nThe post Canada: Brampton Triveni Mandir Cancels Event Amid Threat Of Violent Protests By SFJ Terrorist Pannun appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/world/canada-brampton-triveni-mandir-cancels-event-amid-threat-of-violent-protests-by-sfj-terrorist-pannun/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DEV-PATEL.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 08:46:11', 'author': 'Sfj Terrorist Pannun,Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Sfj Terrorist Pannun', 'Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.223}]}, {'news': [{'id': 264207526, 'title': \"Video: Vistara Ground Staff's Emotional Farewell To Last Flight\", 'text': 'Ground staff and crew members at Odisha\\'s Biju Patnaik International Airport bid an emotional goodbye to the last Vistara flight on Monday.\\n\\nThe Delhi-bound flight was the full service carrier\\'s last before its merger with Air India.

We should be prepared for all future contingencies. It is more than just protecting our borders; it is about securing our future,\" he said.

Let them oppose it; the BJP will pass the Bill to amend the Waqf Act. No one can stop us.”He also highlighted BJP’s intent to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), vowing it would exclude tribals and serve as a measure against infiltration. “No one can stop implementation of the UCC in Jharkhand,” he added.Jharkhand’s assembly elections are set to take place in two phases, with the first on Wednesday and the second on November 20.

Those words ring loud in my ears once again today, love you Bro for always motivating me and not judging me during our meets.”\\nSukesh’s letter also mentions that his companies, LS Holdings and LS Gaming LLC, plan to expand their investments in the United States, with a projected increase of $500 million (₹4200 crore) over the next two years.\\nNotably, Sukesh refers to Jacqueline Fernandez in the letter, claiming their relationship as he elaborates on his grand gesture inspired by advice he recalls from Trump. “I remember your other advice to me, ‘Treat your women always with dignity and make her always feel special’. On that note, LS Holdings is buying stakes of 135 million USD in a large studio producing shows and movies in Los Angeles. I have finalized this buy for my lady love Jacqueline, just like the advice you gave me, to ‘make your women feel special’,” he writes.\\nSukesh was originally arrested in 2015 in connection with a multi-crore fraud case and has been held in Mandoli Jail.

      "[{'id': 264188090, 'title': 'Donald Trump selects Mike Waltz as national security adviser, sources say', 'text': \"WASHINGTON: President-elect Donald Trump has picked Republican Representative Mike Waltz to be his national security adviser, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, tapping a retired Army Green Beret who has been a leading critic of China. Waltz, a Trump loyalist who also served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the United States to be ready for a potential conflict in the region. The national security adviser is a powerful role, which does not require Senate confirmation. Waltz will be responsible for briefing Trump on key national security issues and coordinating with different agencies. While slamming the Biden administration for a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Waltz has publicly praised Trump's foreign policy views. Disruptors are often not nice ... frankly our national security establishment and certainly a lot of people that are dug into bad old habits in the Pentagon need that disruption, Waltz said during an event earlier this year. Donald Trump is that disruptor, he said. Waltz has a long history in Washington's political circles. He was a defense policy director for defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates and was elected to Congress in 2018. He is the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee overseeing military logistics and also on the select committee on intelligence. Waltz is also on the Republican's China Task Force and has argued the U.S. military is not as prepared as it needs to be if there is conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. In a book published earlier this year titled Hard Truths: Think and Lead Like a Green Beret, Waltz laid out a five part strategy to preventing war with China, including arming Taiwan faster, re-assuring allies in the Pacific, and modernizing planes and ships. On Ukraine, Waltz has said his views have evolved. After Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he called for the Biden administration to provide more weapons to Kyiv to help them push back Russian forces. But during an event last month, Waltz said there had to be a reassessment of the United States' aims in Ukraine. Is it in America's interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly? Waltz asked. Waltz has praised Trump for pushing NATO allies to spend more on defense, but unlike the president-elect has not suggested the United States pull out of the alliance.

He has a long history in Washington\\'s political circles.Waltz, who represents east-central Florida, made history as the first Green Beret elected to the US House of Representatives. He has served on key committees, including the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on readiness, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the House Intelligence Committee. Recently re-elected, Waltz has earned a reputation for his strong stance on defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding China and US military readiness.A Strong Voice on National SecurityWaltz has been vocal about his concerns over threats posed by countries like China and Iran. He is particularly focused on US-China relations, frequently highlighting the need to hold China accountable for issues including the origins of COVID-19 and its treatment of minority Uighur Muslims. Waltz even called for a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as a stand against China’s policies.He has also criticised the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it chaotic and demanding accountability for the deaths of U.S. service members and stranded allies. Waltz has argued that the US military should focus on preparedness rather than “woke” diversity initiatives, advocating for a return to priorities that strengthen the armed forces.In a statement last year, Waltz said that as head of the readiness subcommittee: “I am ready to get to work to better equip our military and turn our focus away from woke priorities and back to winning wars. Our national security depends on it.”Background and ExperienceA graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, Waltz served in the Army and completed multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa. He was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two for valor. Waltz also served as a policy adviser in the Pentagon under defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates.In Congress , Waltz has consistently championed a stronger defense policy. He emphasized the need to re-prioritize the military, saying, “I am ready to get to work to better equip our military and turn our focus away from woke priorities and back to winning wars. Our national security depends on it.”Welcomed SupportRichard Goldberg, who served in Trump’s National Security Council, praised Waltz as an impressive pick, citing his military and legislative experience. “With fires raging across the world right now, Waltz is well positioned to help the President put out those fires,” said Goldberg.With Waltz as his national security adviser, Trump gains a strategic thinker ready to address pressing security issues, from aiding Ukraine to monitoring North Korea-Russia ties and countering Iran’s influence in the Middle East.Trump Announces Key AppointmentsPresident-elect Trump has also nominated Republican Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as the next US Ambassador to the United Nations, according to CNN. Trump praised Stefanik, describing her as \"an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.\" He stated, “I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as US Ambassador to the United Nations.”Stefanik, currently the House Republican Conference Chair, holds the title of the most senior Republican in New York. She first made history in 2014 as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress .In addition to Stefanik’s appointment, Trump named Tom Homan, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during his previous term, to manage the nation’s border security.Trump’s Historic Political ComebackIn a historic comeback, Trump secured a second term as President of the United States in the 2024 election, winning 295 electoral votes and defeating Democratic opponent Kamala Harris , who received 226 votes. This victory makes Trump the first US president since 1892 to return to office after losing a prior election.Trump’s re-election is only the second time in US history that a president has served non-consecutive terms, with Grover Cleveland being the first, serving in 1884 and 1892.

The announcement confirms that Mike Waltz, a representative congressman for Florida, has been selected as the new appointee to the position by President-elect Donald Trump. He is a strong supporter of Donald Trump and an ardent critic of China. He is known for his aggressive stances on national security issues, particularly concerning US relations with India and China.\\n\\nBackground and Role in US-India Relations\\n\\nWaltz leads the India Caucus in the Congress while an ardent proponent of increasing defense and security cooperation between the US and India. He has made several tours in Afghanistan and the Middle East where he received the Bronze Star and currently serves as an advisor on Afghanistan policy to the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. Waltz has also said that the withdrawal under Biden was wrong, citing that in all the chaos at the end, military equipment was left to the Taliban.\\n\\nStrong Trump Supporter and Controversial Views\\n\\nA strong Trump supporter, Waltz has been among the Republicans campaigning to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election. He also seems to be on the same page with his criticism that the “woke” military was more focused on matters of diversity and inclusion than doing its actual job. The confirmation is just another indication of his close relationship with Trump, who keeps looking for people to share his perception on national security and defense issues.\\n\\nChinese Practices Criticism and Advocating Boycotts\\n\\nWaltz has been vociferously critical of China, especially its economic practices, namely intellectual property theft, unfair trade, and the role played by China in the US supply chain. He argued to make US less dependent on Chinese manufacturing and secure American technology.

Waltz, a retired Army Green Beret known for his extensive knowledge in military operations and policy, is a vocal critic of China and a staunch advocate for bolstering US strategic readiness in the Indo-Pacific.Impact on China Waltz's selection highlights the incoming administration’s focus on addressing the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist Party. He has previously called for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to concerns over Covid-19's origins and China's treatment of Uighurs.Waltz and former Pentagon strategist Matthew Kroenig, in a joint Economist article penned before the elections, emphasized the need for America to shift attention from Europe and the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific. “The next president should act urgently to bring the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to a swift conclusion and finally focus strategic attention where it should be: countering the greater threat from the Communist Party,” they stated.A consistent proponent of strengthening the US military to deter potential Chinese aggression, particularly towards Taiwan, Waltz highlights in his writings, America is not building armed forces to deny a Chinese attack on Taiwan. He emphasizes an increase in defense spending and revitalization of the defense-industrial base as crucial steps for military preparedness.Waltz takes on his new role amidst already tense US-China relations, fueled by trade disputes, military activities in the South China Sea, and ideological standoffs.India and US Relations: A Promising Signal Waltz’s crucial role in Trump’s administration not only marks a tougher approach towards China but also suggests a deepening of Indo-US relations. For India, wrestling its own conflicts with China, Waltz’s strategic focus appears as a promising development.As the co-head of the India Caucus in Congress, Waltz has supported enhanced US-India ties, an indication that his new role could further strengthen this partnership. Amid heightened tensions along the Line of Actual Control, India may find an opportunity to bolster defense and strategic ties under an NSA aligned with Indo-Pacific strategic priorities.The Broader Picture Mike Waltz, at 50, brings significant experience, having served in the Army and undertaken strategic roles, including serving at the Pentagon. Known for his strong stance on maintaining US military prowess, he has critiqued President Joe Biden's foreign policy strategies, particularly the Afghan withdrawal.Trump’s decision to include Waltz aligns with his America First strategy, prioritizing US security and strength. This may raise eyebrows among Nato allies, who remember Trump’s previous critical stance on the alliance and membership requirements. Waltz's focus on China could further ignite unease among European partners fearing a shift in US alliances.Donald Trump's Strategic AppointmentsTrump's choice of Waltz forms part of a strategic assembly shaping his upcoming administration. Appointments, such as Elise Stefanik as US ambassador to the UN and Tom Homan as border czar, embody Trump’s America First narrative. With Waltz's military and policy expertise, the administration emphasizes hard power and strategic rivalry over diplomatic endeavors.For China, Waltz’s bold perspectives suggest a US less willing to relent, while India sees a pathway to solidify its strategic partnership amid shared threats. As China escalates initiatives like the Belt and Road and South China Sea activities, the Indo-US alignment under Waltz offers a counterbalance.What Lies Ahead The upcoming months will define US foreign policy, with Waltz playing a crucial part in enhancing military capability in the Indo-Pacific. Expect stronger diplomatic connections with India and an increased focus on fortifying defense ties. This may lead to new bilateral agreements, collaborative military exercises, and unified regional strategies through platforms like the Quad.

Mike Waltz as his White House National Security Advisor (NSA). In an exclusive report by the Wall Street Journal, it has been revealed that while Florida Senator Marco Rubio may become Secretary of State, Waltz is seen as Trump’s choice for NSA.\\n\\nMike Waltz is known for his firm stance on national security and global defence, bringing a veteran’s perspective to key global issues including Pakistan, China, and NATO. In the past, he has voiced opinions that align closely with Trump’s stand on foreign policy. Waltz has advocated for a more robust US position on global security threats, balancing burdens with allies, and strengthening ties with democratic partners like India.\\n\\nMike Waltz on China – confronting an ‘aggressive force’ in the Indo-Pacific\\n\\nAccording to Waltz, there is a need to confront China’s increasing influence and authoritarian policies, specifically within the Indo-Pacific region. When he was a member of the House China Task Force, Waltz worked to shape US policy towards a more assertive stance against encroachments by China in regions like Taiwan, the South China Sea, and areas of strategic importance to allies like India and Australia.\\n\\nIn an interview with WION network, Mike Waltz highlighted his stance, stating, “The Chinese Communist Party is a destabilising force across the Indo-Pacific. It’s not just the Chinese people who suffer under this authoritarian regime; it’s also Taiwan, the Philippines, India, the United States, and more. Democracies need to come together to deter this type of aggression.”\\n\\nSince US congressman Michael Waltz @michaelgwaltz is expected to be Trump's NSA, here is his interview to @WIONews last year during Delhi visit (Aug 2023). Spoke on India ties, Pakistan, China, & condemned Khalistan violence as well. https://t.co/icKotP3v3T pic.twitter.com/bULrv908JZ— Sidhant Sibal (@sidhant) November 12, 2024\\n\\nFurthermore, he emphasised that the US-India relationship is central to countering China’s influence in the region. In the same interview, he remarked, “The trajectory of the US-India relationship is only getting higher and stronger. We’re working together in various spheres, from defence to energy,” which is vital for stabilising the Indo-Pacific and presenting a unified front against Chinese aggression in the region.\\n\\nWaltz on Pakistan – condemning the use of terrorism as state policy\\n\\nWaltz has been outspoken about Pakistan’s continuous support for terrorist organisations. He has warned against the destabilising impact of such policies on South Asia. Waltz has urged Pakistan to abandon any affiliation with groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba that threaten both regional and global security. During the interview with WION, he said, “I’ve said to my Pakistani counterparts many times that terrorism cannot be a tool of foreign policy. And whether that’s through Lashkar-e-Taiba or other types of terrorist groups, it’s just unacceptable. And the Pakistani government and the Pakistani military and intelligence services have to move past that, and we will continue to press them to move in the right direction and not use terrorism as an instrument.”\\n\\nMike Waltz on NATO – advocating for European burden sharing\\n\\nMike Waltz has been a longtime advocate of equitable burden-sharing within NATO and has strongly endorsed Trump’s position that European allies should contribute more substantially to collective defence efforts. In September 2023, he wrote an op-ed for Fox News, where Waltz outlined his stance, stating, “Stopping Russia before it draws NATO, and therefore the US, into war is the right thing to do. But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass. There must be policy space between Biden’s current strategy of ‘as long as it takes’ and those demanding ‘not another dollar.’”\\n\\nHe also pointed out instances where major European powers, including Germany, fell short of their defence commitments pledged during the 2014 NATO Summit. He wrote, “Germany, the largest economy in Europe and the most pivotal balancer to Russia, pulled back at the last minute from enshrining the two percent annual commitment into law. That needs to change – the administration cannot expect American taxpayers to pay for European security indefinitely.”\\n\\nWaltz specifically cited the Biden administration’s lack of assertiveness in compelling European allies to uphold their promises. He said, “In the near term, US military aid must be contingent on European burden-sharing and equal European assistance going forward. The US has provided nearly as much military aid to Ukraine – a reported $46.6 billion – as every other nation combined.” \\n\\nHis views reflect Trump’s broader “America First” philosophy, aimed at pushing for a recalibrated NATO where European nations meet their defence commitments so that the US can allocate resources to its borders.\\n\\nWaltz on Ukraine – ‘The era of blank cheques is over’\\n\\nOver time, Waltz has been a vocal critic of the US’s unconditional support for Ukraine. He emphasises the need for a clear objective in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In his op-ed, he argued that the era of Ukraine’s blank cheque from Congress is over. He asserted that, while most Americans are sympathetic to Ukraine, there is a need for a clear and achievable American objective. He questioned the Biden administration’s strategy, stating, “The Biden administration has neither explained the American objective in Ukraine nor his strategy to achieve it. Will American military spending continue until Ukraine has pushed Russia back to its prewar boundaries? Its pre-2014 boundaries? Or until the Putin regime collapses? We don’t know because Biden refuses to tell us. ‘As long as it takes’ is a slogan, not a strategy.”\\n\\nWaltz called for conditional support based on European burden-sharing and stressed that US taxpayers should not be expected to fund the majority of Ukraine’s defence. He said, “As long as Biden refuses to secure our southern border, Americans shouldn’t be asked to continue funding the defence of Ukraine.” His approach reflects a shift towards a more calculated support model that aligns with Trump’s foreign policy preferences.\\n\\nOn strengthening India-US ties\\n\\nWaltz has often expressed admiration for India as a strategic and democratic ally. He has previously described the relationship between India and the US as “essential” for regional stability. In his interview with WION, he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and the progress India has made in various sectors, including biotechnology, energy, and defence. Notably, in June 2023, Mike Waltz and Andry Barr introduced a legislation to allow weapon sales to India from the US to be fast-tracked and deepen the US-India defence ties.\\n\\nWaltz, who participated in India’s Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort, said, “It was a beautiful, amazing setting and what a historic setting. I mean the place of India’s first Independence Day speech by Nehru, the first prime minister. But I think what really jumped out at me was to hear Prime Minister Modi’s vision for India to be a fully developed nation by the 100th year anniversary, by 2047. It was very detailed, it was very forceful, very forward-looking. I thought it was a great speech and it was an honour to be there.”\\n\\nHighlighting India’s “Make in India” policy, he said, “I support it. I think every strong economy and strong democracy wants to be able to defend itself and to be able to make that equipment. But it’s not just the co-production, which I support. It’s also conducting joint exercises, like the Malabar exercise, that’s happening right now in Australia with the Australian, Indian, and the US militaries all working together. So how do we employ that equipment in our training, operations, tactics, and planning together, which I think will help stabilise the Indo-Pacific and serve to deter a very aggressive Chinese Communist Party from many of the bad actions it’s currently taking right now.”\\n\\nFuture role and alignment with Trump’s policies\\n\\nWaltz’s name being forwarded as NSA signals Trump’s intent to foster alliances with democratic nations while demanding fair contributions from NATO allies and partners. Waltz’s alignment with Trump’s foreign policy positions is evident in his straightforward approach to tackling issues of terrorism, burden-sharing in alliances, and the recalibration of US global commitments.\\n\\nWith Waltz as NSA, the Trump administration is expected to maintain a tough stance on adversaries while prioritising US interests.\", 'summary': 'President-elect Trump reportedly picked Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser, who has strong stances on China, Pakistan, NATO, and alliances with democratic partners like India.', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/donald-trump-picks-pro-india-mike-waltz-as-national-security-adviser/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Feature-Images-101-200-OpIndia-1-3.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 08:43:13', 'author': 'Anurag', 'authors': ['Anurag'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.201}, {'id': 264292834, 'title': 'Donald Trump Appoints Congressman Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser', 'text': 'President Donald Trump has chosen Congressman Mike Waltz, co-chair of the India Caucus and a veteran Army Green Beret, as his pick for National Security Adviser.

These actions are part of an ongoing probe into alleged demographic changes in Jharkhands tribal regions, particularly Santhal Pargana and Kolhan. The issue has sparked political controversy over suspected illegal immigration.Political tensions have risen as the enforcement branch of Jharkhand coordinates these raids. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have accused the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha government of permitting illegal Bangladeshi immigrants to settle on indigenous tribal lands. As elections approach, BJP leaders argue that such infiltration threatens the regions culture and demographics.Political Reactions to Immigration ConcernsEarlier this month, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh addressed a public rally in Ranchi on November 5. He promised that if the BJP gained power in Jharkhand, they would implement strict measures against illegal Bangladeshi immigration to protect tribal lands. Singhs statement highlighted the BJPs stance on safeguarding local rights and reversing demographic trends.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also spoke on November 10 about the threat posed by Bangladeshi infiltrators. At a rally in Deoghar, Chouhan stated, These Bangladeshi infiltrators not only endanger our land and women but also the very Sanatan Sanskriti. They want to annihilate our civilization.Legal Actions and InvestigationsThe EDs actions follow an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) filed under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This was initiated after an FIR by Jharkhand police at Bariyatu police station in Ranchi in June. The investigation focuses on unlawful infiltration by Bangladeshi nationals into Jharkhand and nearby areas.Earlier this month, six Bangladeshi citizens, including three transgenders, were arrested at a rail terminus in West Tripura while allegedly planning to travel to Mumbai. These arrests highlight ongoing concerns about smuggling people from Bangladesh.Impact on Upcoming ElectionsThe presence of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants has become a significant issue ahead of the Jharkhand elections.

This was a follow-up on a comprehensive probe into money laundering allegedly coming from such funds. The ED has tried to find out illegal operations connected with human trafficking and generation of crime proceeds.\\n\\nAccording to reports, the raids were conducted in several districts of election-bound Jharkhand and at some places in neighboring West Bengal. The operation forms part of an ongoing investigation into a case related to the illegitimate entry of Bangladeshi nationals, particularly women, on the Indian mainland allegedly for trafficking and forced labor purposes. The ED had initiated the case under the PMLA after an inquiry into human trafficking activities in which slush funds were created.\\n\\nThe case came to the fore in September 2024, when the Enforcement Directorate filed an official case to probe infiltration and trafficking of Bangladeshi women in Jharkhand. Probe is being conducted on the complaint filed in June 2024 by a Bangladeshi woman in Ranchi. She, as per a complaint filed by her in June 2024, had been trafficked from Bangladesh into India with the help of touts through the India-Bangladesh border.\\n\\nAllegations Of Trafficking And Fraud\\n\\nIn the compliant, the woman had implicated several people for trafficking women including herself to India on false pretenses. Among the six women listed as suspects were several who were arrested after a raid was carried out at a local resort. The victim reportedly managed to escape from one such guesthouse and then migrated to a police station. When the police during the probe interrogated them, they found that one of the women was carrying a forged Aadhaar card.\\n\\nIn the complaint statement, it was revealed that the women were trafficked to India on the pretext of jobs but were converted upon arrival into prostitution. This is the desperate case of a larger human trafficking issue and exploitation of vulnerable people across borders.\\n\\nED Expands Probe To Overall Region\\n\\nThis probe by Enforcement Directorate into the trafficking case doesn’t limit itself to just this case but probes into a larger scheme of illegal infiltration along the borders, particularly in the tribal districts of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan of Jharkhand. According to ED, the inquiry will cover the full scope of infiltration activities into the region from Bangladesh, which is said to experience the most serious impact of such illicit networks.\\n\\nBJP Blames Jharkhand Government\\n\\nThe political connotations of these raids have been huge, as allegations have been leveled against the Jharkhand government. Several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have named the Jharkhand government in public for helping illegals enter India and alleged that this has demographic implications in the tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions, wherein many expect that this inflow would alter the local socio-political structure.\\n\\nChief Minister Yogi Adityanath followed suit, accusing the Rohingya refugee and Bangladeshi infiltrator-welcoming coalition headed by the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) of turning the state into a “dharmashala.” That’s part of a broader BJP campaign against the state government ahead of next month’s assembly elections.\\n\\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah announced that in the event the BJP government came to power in Jharkhand, a committee would be formed for identifying and streamlining the elimination of infiltrators from the state. The committee will also pay attention to reclaiming lands which are said to be occupied by these illegal immigrants.\\n\\nMUST READ | Indian Army Celebrates National Education Day At Assam’s Tinsukia District School', 'summary': 'The Enforcement Directorate raided 17 locations in Jharkhand and West Bengal in connection with a money laundering probe related to alleged illegal Bangladeshi infiltration.\\n\\n\\nThe post ED Cracks Down On Bangladeshi Infiltration Case, 17 Locations Raided in Jharkhand, West Bengal appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/ed-cracks-down-on-bangladeshi-infiltration-case-17-locations-raided-in-jharkhand-west-bengal/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ED-conducts-raids.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 06:08:32', 'author': 'Satyam Singh', 'authors': ['Satyam Singh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.025}, {'id': 264239080, 'title': 'ED raids in Jharkhand, West Bengal in illegal Bangladeshi infiltration case', 'text': 'Ranchi: The Enforcement Directorate Tuesday raided multiple locations in poll-bound Jharkhand apart from West Bengal in a money laundering investigation linked to alleged illegal infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals, official sources said.\\n\\nA total of 17 places are being covered in the two neighbouring states by the Ranchi office of the federal probe agency, a day before the first phase of polling in Jharkhand.\\n\\nVisuals of CRPF personnel positioned outside a hotel located on Bariatu Road in Ranchi and a resort in the city were captured by press teams as ED teams scoured for documents, ledger entries and financial records inside.\\n\\nThe agency had in September filed a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to probe an instance of alleged infiltration and trafficking of some Bangladeshi women into Jharkhand leading to the generation of alleged slush funds.\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have accused the state government of aiding such infiltration leading to the altering of the demographic landscape of the tribal-dominated areas of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions during the recent poll campaign.\\n\\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Monday accused the ruling JMM-led coalition of converting Jharkhand into a ‘dharmashala’ for Rohingyas and Bangladeshi infiltrators.\\n\\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah announced in Seraikela Monday that a committee would be formed, if BJP is voted to power in Jharkhand, to identify and drive out infiltrators from the state besides reclaiming land grabbed by them.\\n\\nThe first phase of the Assembly polls is slated for 43 constituencies Wednesday, while the second for 38 seats will be held November 20.\\n\\nThe ECIR (enforcement case information report) filed by the federal agency under various sections of the PMLA stems from a Jharkhand Police FIR filed at the Bariyatu police station in the state capital Ranchi in June.\\n\\nThe police FIR, filed on the complaint of a Bangladeshi woman who allegedly infiltrated into the country from along the India-Bangladesh border with the help of touts to find work, has named around six women as accused who were arrested following a raid at a local resort.\\n\\nThe woman who filed the complaint escaped from a similar guest house and reached the police station.

The case is being investigated by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Kerala government.Siddique was booked by the museum police in Thiruvananthapuram on August 27 under the charges of rape and criminal intimidation, based on a complaint filed by a young actor. However, Siddique categorically denied the allegation.This came after the Malayalam film industry was rocked by a “Me Too” movement exposing various allegations of sexual abuse earlier in August this year.Following the allegations, Siddique resigned from his position as general secretary of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA). Consequently, the entire 17-member executive committee of AMMA also resigned.Serious accusations have been made by several women actors against prominent figures in the industry, including director Ranjith and actors Mukesh, Jayasurya, and Edavela Babu, among others.The surge in these allegations came in the wake of the release of the Justice Hema Committee report, which exposed disturbing accounts of harassment, exploitation, and the systematic mistreatment of women in the industry.The report, made public on August 19, after redacting the names of witnesses and the accused, noted that the Malayalam film industry is controlled by about 10 to 15 male producers, directors, and actors who dominate and exert control over the industry', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/sc-extends-interim-protection-from-arrest-to-actor-siddique-in-rape-case/', 'image': 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 06:43:32', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.46}, {'id': 264222510, 'title': \"Mollywood MeToo: Actor Siddique's Interim Protection From Arrest Extended\", 'text': \"The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended the interim protection from arrest granted to Malayalam film actor Siddique in an alleged rape case.

A legendary actor, he immortalised the character of Banchharam in Tapan Sinha\\'s 1980 film \\'Banchharamer Bagan\\' (The Garden of Banchharam). This dark comedy on the oppression of the peasants by the zamindars was adapted from a play by Mitra.Mitra had around 100 one-act and full-length plays to his credit besides film scripts.His major full-length plays include \\'Narak Guljar\\' (The Great Hell), \\'Aswathama\\', \\'Chakbhanga Madhu\\' (Honey from Broken Hive), \\'Mesh O Rakhash\\' (The Lamb and the Monster), \\'Galpo Hekim Saheb\\' (Tale of a Hekim), \\'Rajdarshan\\' (Visiting the King), \\'Alokanandar Putra Kanya\\' (Alokananda\\'s Son and Daughter), \\'Sajano Bagan\\' (Decorated Garden), \\'Chhayar Prashad\\' (The Palace of Shadows) and \\'Jene Shune Bish\\' (Poison, Knowingly).Partition of the country, Naxalite movement of Bengal, tyranny of the ruling class, religious fundamentalism and other major issues were highlighted in Mitra\\'s plays.Among his key one-act plays are \\'Mrityur Chokhe Jal\\' (Tears in the Eyes of Death), \\'Chokhe Angul Dada\\' (The Fault Finder), \\'Ami Madan Bolchhi\\' (Hello I am Madan), \\'Takshak\\' and others.According to academician and translator Mousumi Roy Chowdhury, in Mitra’s plays, conscience has a major role.\"Not strictly restricted to an instrumental moral sense, conscience here is used in the larger sense of consciousness that reaches beyond the closures and binaries of the regulating norms of the political theatre,\" Roy Chowdhury said in an anthology of plays translated by her.He also acted in more than 80 films including Satyajit Ray\\'s classics \\'Ghare Baire\\' (Home and the World, 1984) and \\'Ganashatru\\' (An Enemy of the People, 1989). Mitra also worked on projects of Tapan Sinha - \\'Adalat O Ekti Meye\\' (The Court and a Woman, 1982) and \\'Wheel Chair\\' (1995).After the 1984 superhit potboiler \\'Shatru\\' (Enemy) in which he essayed the role of a notorious leader, Mitra got a chance to act in Bollywood films. He, however, rejected that proposal apprehending that it would impact his involvement in theatre.Mitra was born December 22, 1938, in a village in Khulna district of undivided Bengal. His father was a government officer.Interestingly, though plays were enacted at his family home during the festive days of Durga puja, children were not allowed to watch them. Backdrops, props, costumes and other articles associated with the staging of plays stored at home kindled his passion for plays.Mitra permanently came to India from East Pakistan at the age of 12. He cleared his MA in Philosophy in 1960.During the college and university days, he wrote short stories and plays. However, after his play \\'Mrityur Chokhe Jal\\' earned him first prize at a statewide competition, he focused only on this field. His acting prowess mesmerised veteran actors of that time as the 21-year-old youth effortlessly metamorphosed into an elderly man in \\'Mrityur Chokhe Jal\\'.Also in the film \\'Banchharamer Bagan\\', adapted from his play \\'Sajano Bagan\\' (1977), he essayed the role of the 90-year-old protagonist when Mitra was in his 40s. He bagged the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the movie.The playwright was conferred with the Sangeet Natak Award (1985) and the Asiatic Society Award (2005) for his overall contribution to theatre, among numerous other awards.Mitra also headed the theatre group \\'Sundaram\\' for many years. He was a professor of philosophy in a college in West Bengal.

The legal notice was filed in response to what the actress claims are \"false and damaging statements\" made by Esha. Rupali\\'s legal team, led by lawyer Sana Raees Khan, has taken this step to safeguard her reputation.The notice, addressed to Esha, states that Rupali Ganguly was shocked by the posts and comments made by her on various social media platforms, including Twitter (now X), Instagram and Facebook. It goes on to clarify that the notice has been issued to present the true facts of the situation.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"Our client states that she was shocked to see the posts and comments published by you on various social media platforms including Twitter (now X), Instagram, and Facebook.

The notice explains that while the actress initially chose to remain silent out of dignity, she was forced to take legal action after she and her husband Ashwin Verma\\'s 11-year-old son was dragged into the matter. She has also demanded an immediate, unconditional public apology. Failure to comply will result in further legal action, as stated in the notice.The legal notice further clarified that Rupali Ganguly had been friends with Ashwin Verma for 12 years before he separated from his second wife (Esha\\'s mother) in 2009. It also mentioned that the actress and her husband Ashwin Verma, had tried to support Esha\\'s career by providing her with opportunities, such as arranging photoshoots and special audition arrangements, in an effort to help her break into the entertainment industry.It all started after Esha Verma made serious allegations against her father Ashwin Verma and Rupali Ganguly. In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, the 26-year-old accused Rupali of physically assaulting her mother in Mumbai, stating, \"Rupali physically hit my mother in person in Mumbai.\" Esha also accused Ashwin of being \"a very abusive man physically and emotionally.\" She went on to say, “I was devastated, crying in high school because of the women who deliberately came into our lives, who broke my parent\\'s marriage, who physically hit my mother in person in Mumbai in my grandparent\\'s house. To see her win, that\\'s the most devastating thing which I have gone through. I\\'m not pinpointing just Rupali here; I have also gathered the strength to say that it is my father\\'s fault. He was also a very abusive man physically and emotionally so it\\'s a two-party street.\"Esha further claimed that when the news of her allegations first went viral, she was terrified and pressured by her father to delete her post. She also recounted an unsettling experience when Rupali travelled to their home in New Jersey and allegedly slept in the bed shared by Esha\\'s parents. \"It was Rupali who told my father to give my mother the divorce papers,\" Esha revealed. She expressed her disbelief over Ashwin\\'s recent comments on social media, where he denied Rupali\\'s involvement. Esha countered, saying, \"I don\\'t know what Rupali and Ashwin will now say further to these allegations and comments. I know my father has said something on Twitter now X. He said that Rupali was not involved, and that is the biggest lie because Rupali was the one who came to my house in New Jersey and slept on my mother\\'s bed—the bed that my father and mother shared. She has done so much, physically, mentally, verbally, and emotionally, abusing me and my mom. I feel like that was a lot of trauma I had to deal with and suffer with and my mom did too. We suffered a lot, and we don\\'t have that exposure as she does.”Last week, Ashwin K Verma issued a statement on X (previously Twitter) and addressed the allegations levelled against him and Rupali. He wrote, \"I do have two daughters from previous relationships, something Rupali and I have always been open about that I care a great deal about. I understand that my younger daughter still holds a lot of hurt about the dissolution of her parent\\'s relationship as divorce is a difficult experience that can greatly affect and harm the children of that marriage. But marriages end for many reasons, and my relationship with my second wife had multiple challenges that led to our separation-challenges that were between she and I and that had nothing to do with any other person. I only want the best for my children and my wife and it saddens me to see anyone being pulled into cycles of negativity by the media.”A sincere reflection on recent remarks. pic.twitter.com/QfpN324fwB— Ashwin K Verma (@AshwinKVerma) November 3, 2024Esha, now 26, is the daughter of Ashwin and Sapna Verma and currently resides in the United States.

Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy was insulted by Jameer Ahmed Khan as “Kala Kumaraswamy” (Black Kumaraswamy) in Urdu.

Apart from that, these words of racial hatred coming from the mouth of Jameer Ahmed, who has uplifted a community and encouraged people to deteriorate the peace and order in the society, are an unforgivable crime.”The party also demanded the state Home Minister G Parameshwara and Ramnagar district police to immediately take appropriate legal action against minister Jameer Ahmed for “racial abuse, racism and trying to disturb peace in the society.”The tweet added, “The Secular Janata Dal Party demands that the Home Minister @DrParameshwara and @spramanagara Ramnagar district police immediately take appropriate legal action against minister Jameer Ahmed for racial abuse, racism and trying to disturb peace in the society. Mr. @kharge and @INCIndia president of National Congress should get the resignation of this racist Jameer first if he can maintain morals for the party. @INCKarnataka.”The bypolls on Shiggaon, Sandur and Channapatna is scheduled for November 13 and the results for the respective seats will be announced on November 23.

The corresponding index and inflation for the month of September 2024 were 162.4 and 5.39 per cent, respectively. This is the first time that the rate of retail inflation has crossed the RBI\\'s upper limit of 6 per cent. The RBI is waiting for the retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth. Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that although the RBI had shifted towards a softer neutral monetary policy stance to spur growth this did not mean that an interest rate cut would happen immediately. Addressing a media event, the RBI Governor said: \"A change in stance doesn\\'t mean there will be a rate cut in the very next monetary policy meeting.\" He said there were still significant upside risks to inflation and \"a rate cut at this stage would be very risky\". The RBI at its monetary policy review kept interest rates unchanged for the 10th straight meeting, but switched its monetary policy stance to \\'neutral\\' from \\'withdrawal of accommodation.\\' This had led to speculation that the way had been paved for an interest rate cut.

Visuals of CRPF personnel positioned outside a hotel located on Bariatu Road in Ranchi and a resort in the city were captured by press teams as ED teams scoured for documents, ledger entries and financial records inside. The agency issued a statement on its official X handle at around 3 pm, saying it has recovered \"incriminating\" items like fake Aadhaar cards, forged passports, illegal arms, immovable property documents, cash, jewellery, printing paper and machines and blank proformas used for forging Aadhaar during the raids. Searches are continuing, it said, as the agency attached pictures of these recoveries with the said post. The agency had in September filed a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to probe an instance of alleged infiltration and trafficking of some Bangladeshi women into Jharkhand leading to the generation of alleged slush funds. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have accused the state government of aiding such infiltration leading to the altering of the demographic landscape of the tribal-dominated areas of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions during the recent poll campaign. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday accused the ruling JMM-led coalition of converting Jharkhand into a \\'dharmashala\\' for Rohingyas and Bangladeshi infiltrators. Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced in Seraikela on Monday that a committee would be formed, if BJP is voted to power in Jharkhand, to identify and drive out infiltrators from the state besides reclaiming land grabbed by them. The first phase of the Assembly polls is slated for 43 constituencies on Wednesday, while the second for 38 seats will be held on November 20. The ECIR (enforcement case information report) filed by the federal agency under various sections of the PMLA stems from a Jharkhand Police FIR filed at the Bariyatu police station in the state capital Ranchi in June. The police FIR, filed on the complaint of a Bangladeshi woman who allegedly infiltrated into the country from along the India-Bangladesh border with the help of touts to find work, has named around six women as accused who were arrested following a raid at a local resort. The woman who filed the complaint escaped from a similar guest house and reached the police station. Police also recovered a \"fake\" Aadhaar card from one of these women. Police pressed multiple IPC sections like 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 34 (common intention) in the FIR. It also slapped section 12 of the Passport Act (knowingly furnishing any false information or suppressing any material information with a view to obtaining a passport or travel document) and 14A of the Foreigners Act (penalty for entry in restricted area) in the complaint. The FIR quoted the woman complainant saying they were trafficked into India from Bangladesh allegedly for prostitution by luring them in the name of getting a job in beauty salons. ED sources had earlier said the agency will investigate the \"entire gamut\" of infiltration from across the eastern borders, including Bangladesh, into Jharkhand including in the tribal districts of Santhal Pargana and Kolhan. Prime Minister Modi, while addressing a poll rally a few months ago, accused the Jharkhand government of encouraging Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltration for vote bank politics and criticised it for \"rampant corruption\". The prime minister asserted that these infiltrators pose a significant threat to the state by altering the demographic landscape of the Santhal Pargana and Kolhan regions. Modi accused the JMM of \"supporting infiltrators\" and claimed that \"illegal immigrants from the neighbouring country have managed to gain influence over the ruling party in the state.\" He criticised the Jharkhand government for refusing to acknowledge the infiltration issue despite a high court order to establish an independent panel to investigate the influx of Bangladeshi immigrants. The Union government had informed the Jharkhand High Court that illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are living in the state.

The first such instance was Grover Cleveland, who served as president in 1884 and 1892.Trump had earlier served as US President from 2016 to 2020.', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/melania-trump-not-expected-to-attend-white-house-meeting-with-jill-biden/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/melania-trump-not-expected-to-attend-white-house-meeting-with-jill-biden.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 06:34:14', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.398}, {'id': 264194436, 'title': '‘Nothing Is Ever Really Lost’: Megan Fox Announces Pregnancy With Fiancé Machine Gun Kelly After Previous Miscarriage', 'text': \"Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly are set to become parents again.

The 39-year-old, who has witnessed the fall and rise of Afghanistan cricket, is now looking forward to his last dance in the 50-over format. “In my mind, from the last World Cup, I was retired, but then we qualified for the Champions Trophy, and I felt if I could play that, it would be great…We will see, but no, I will not play for long.

It is understood he has communicated the decision to the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) and will continue playing T20Is. Ever since his international debut in 2009, Nabi has been a part of the Afghanistan side, which has beaten over 30 countries, out of which many are still striving towards the full-member, Test-playing status which Afghanistan got in 2017. From wins over unknown teams like Denmark, Italy, Argentina, and Tanzania to much stronger associate nations like Scotland, UAE, Namibia, Netherlands etc, Afghanistan have come a long way, beating Test-playing teams like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, England, Australia, New Zealand, West Indies.Most of these Test-playing nations are either current world champions or have held a world championship in 50-over/Test/T20I format previously.Even at the age of 39, Nabi’s contribution to the Afghanistan team remains unparalleled. In their recent ODI series triumph, he ended the series as top run-getter with a tally of 135. He even chipped in with the ball, bagging two wickets across three ODIs. Overall, Nabi has 3,600 ODI runs under his belt in 167 matches, averaging 27.48 while striking at 86.99, making him the second-highest run-getter for Afghanistan in the format. His contribution as a player for Afghanistan becomes even more valuable when one looks at his statistics with the ball. With his off-spin, Nabi has scythed 172 wickets, the second-highest for Afghanistan, while averaging 32.47.The upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025 will mark the maiden appearance for Afghanistan in the event.

The Indian Consulate-organised event hoped to provide Indian-origin Hindus and Sikhs the opportunity to renew important life certificates.\\nThreats and Security Concerns Prompt Cancellation\\n\\nOfficial statement issued by the community center on Sunday says that because of a serious threat, the event was cancelled. “Please be advised that the Life Certificate Event scheduled at Brampton Triveni Mandir by the Indian Consulate on November 17, 2024, has been canceled, owing to official intelligence from Peel Regional Police, stating that there is an Extremely High and Imminent Threat Level of violent protests,” it said.\\n\\nIn this regard, the community center appealed to Peel Police to tighten their words into action quickly to address the threats put against the Brampton Triveni Mandir and ensure safety for both the Hindu community and the public.

Videos of the incident doing rounds on social media showed people fighting and brandishing poles during the protest.\\n\\nResponding to the violence, which broke out at the Hindu Sabha Temple, a venue of clash between two groups. By account of the authorities, tensions between the two parties turned into physical altercation leading to attacks.\\n\\nCanadian and Indian Leaders Condemn Violence\\n\\nThe attack on the Hindu temple, in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words, was “a deliberate and cowardly attempt to intimidate” Indian diplomats. In a post on social media, he demanded immediate action from Canadian authorities to ensure justice and maintain law and order. “Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,” he wrote.\\n\\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also condemned violence and stated that all people in Canada have the right to live in their religion freely and safely. The attack further strained the already sour relationship between India and Canada that was already in controversy over allegations of involvement by India in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\\n\\nArrests during Violent Protest\\n\\nIn relation to violent protests, Peel Regional Police have arrested a 35-year-old Brampton resident Inderjeet Gosal who is also the Canadian coordinator for the separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Gosal has been charged with assault with a weapon. Sikhs for Justice is banned in India for its pro-Khalistan stance. Gosal was taken into custody on November 8, 2024, and was granted bail later with conditions and further appearance in court.\\n\\nIndian authorities have been sounding the alarm regarding their citizens’ safety in Canada, particularly over the growing influence of pro-Khalistan elements allowed to operate freely in this nation. The Indian government called for legal action against those responsible for violent protests, while making sure that attacks like these would not go without consequences.\\n\\nCurrent Tensions Between Canada and India\\n\\nThis happens at a time of heightened diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, further fueled by the dubious claims from September 2023 made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau regarding Indian involvement in the killing of Khalistan separatist leader Nijjar. India has termed these accusations as “absurd,” insisting that the real issue remains Canada’s tolerance of groups in favor of pro-Khalistan operating from its soil.\\n\\nAs these incidents come into sight, the Canadian government can face more pressure in responding to the security needs of the country and taking more aggressive actions against violent separatist elements.\\n\\nRead More : BJP Seeks EC Censure For Rahul Gandhi’s ‘False Statements’ During Maharashtra Election Drive', 'summary': 'The Brampton Triveni Community Centre in Canada has cancelled a scheduled consular camp for November 17, 2024, after intelligence warnings stated there is an \"extremely high and imminent threat level\" of violent protests.\\n\\n\\nThe post Brampton Temple In Canada Halts Event Amidst Khalistani Separatist Threats appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/brampton-temple-in-canada-halts-event-amidst-khalistani-separatist-threats/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Khalistani-protests.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 03:10:20', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.416}, {'id': 264209262, 'title': 'Hindu temple in Brampton forced to cancel event amid threats', 'text': \"Ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections, the issue of Maratha reservation has garnered wind.

According to sources interviewed by The New York Times, the decision has been made: Rubio, a seasoned Republican and once a presidential rival, will be the Department of State’s new secretary.\\n\\nMarc Rubio, 52, has emerged as the latest high-profile contender on the reported shortlist of President Trump’s possible picks for Secretary of State. Despite intense political battles over the years between the two, this is potentially a watershed moment in Rubio’s ties with the president. Reports claimed Rubio has led the pack of contenders, others including Ric Grenell, former US ambassador to Germany, in Trump’s preference over the last week.\\n\\nDuring a talk on a high profile cabinet seat, Rubio further expressed the zeal to serve the nation by saying while talking on CNN, “I am always interested in serving this country.”\\n\\nRubio’s Way From Critic To Loyalist\\n\\nThe naming of Rubio, a Cuban-American and known for his hardline stance on foreign policy, means that the president is shifting his way towards former critics’ joining him in the inner circle. Rubio has had many past bitter political exchanges with Trump. Rubio went on a strong verbal attack against Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, calling the latter a “con artist” and “the most vulgar person to ever seek the presidency.” Since those red hot words, however, Rubio has found himself gravitating toward Trump’s policies and even endorsed Trump for the presidency in 2024. This means that the two Republicans now seem to be on one page with their goals for the country’s foreign policy.\\n\\nRubio’s Political Career\\n\\nMarco Rubio’s political service has spanned more than two decades. Rubio started as a city commissioner in West Miami. Born to Cuban immigrants in Miami, Florida, Rubio earned his bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Florida in 1993 and received a law degree from a later date. His political trail didn’t end yet, as in the year 2000, he won his election to represent Florida’s 111th district in the state’s House of Representatives and eventually made his way to Speaker from 2006 to 2008.\\n\\nIn the year 2010, Rubio won without contest a seat in the U.S. Senate with an unrelenting support faction of the Republican party-the Tea Party movement, infamous for its ultra-conservatism. Since then, Rubio has been developed as an advocate on foreign policy issues focused on U.S.-Latin America relations. His efforts during the first term of Trump earned him the unofficial title of “virtual secretary of state for Latin America.” If nominated, sustained engagement in this space may determine much of his vision as Secretary of State.\\n\\nImpact Of Rubio In Current Elections\\n\\nRubio was re-elected into the senate for a third term in 2022, where he won against the Democrat, Val Demings, and made sure he was secured as Florida’s senior senator after Bill Nelson stepped down in 2019. Rubio endorsed the presidential campaign by Trump in early 2024, ahead of the Iowa caucuses, making sure that Rubio’s affirmation was further sealed with the President-elect.\\n\\nMUST READ | Kai Trump Shares Vlog Of Mar-A-Lago Election Celebration For Her Grandfather Donald Trump’s Win | WATCH', 'summary': 'Florida Senator Marco Rubio, once a Trump critic, now stands as a top pick for Secretary of State.

He is known for his hawkish stance on countries like China, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio’s selection is seen as an effort by Trump to diversify his administration's leadership, potentially strengthening his appeal among Latino voters, a demographic that has traditionally leaned Democratic but shifted in Trump's favour during the recent election.While Rubio has been a vocal advocate for a strong US presence on the world stage, he has, in recent years, adjusted some of his positions to align with Trump’s approach of restraint. Early Life, education, and political riseRubio’s parents emigrated from Cuba in 1956, settling first in Miami and later in Las Vegas, where his father worked as a bartender and his mother as a hotel housekeeper. Although raised Catholic, Rubio was briefly baptized as a Mormon before returning to his Catholic roots. The family returned to Florida in 1985, where Rubio graduated from the University of Florida in 1993 before earning a law degree from the University of Miami.Rubio’s political career began early. He worked for Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen before serving on the West Miami City Commission. In 1999, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, where he served until 2008, including stints as majority leader and speaker.Senate careerIn 2009, Rubio launched his campaign for the US Senate seat left vacant by Mel Martinez’s resignation. Initially trailing Florida Governor Charlie Crist, Rubio’s fortunes changed when Crist broke from the Republican Party and declared himself an independent. Rubio won the 2010 election by a significant margin in a three-way race.Once in the Senate, Rubio aligned himself with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. He opposed key Democratic initiatives such as gun control, the Affordable Care Act, and climate-change legislation. Despite this, he broke with many in his party when he co-authored a 2013 immigration reform bill that sought to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill ultimately failed to pass.Rubio also became known for his foreign policy views, particularly his opposition to the Obama administration's attempts to normalize relations with Cuba. His foreign policy stance has often reflected an interventionist approach, particularly regarding China and the Middle East.2016 presidential campaign and shift to populismRubio’s 2016 presidential campaign was initially seen as a strong challenge to Donald Trump. He positioned himself as a candidate who could unite the Republican Party establishment but struggled against Trump’s dominance in the race. After a brutal series of defeats, Rubio suspended his campaign after losing the Florida primary.Following his return to the Senate, Rubio began to embrace more populist conservative views, aligning more closely with Trump’s America First agenda. He became a vocal supporter of Trump and developed a strong working relationship with him. Although Rubio initially backed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, he ultimately voted to certify Joe Biden’s victory after the January 6 Capitol attack.Foreign policy Rubio’s foreign policy views align with Trump on many fronts, though there are some key differences. Both have been critical of Nato, with Rubio co-sponsoring legislation that would make it more difficult for a president to withdraw from the alliance without Senate approval. Rubio is also a staunch critic of China, pushing for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in US technology and advocating for a hardline approach on issues like Huawei’s influence.One of Rubio’s most personal stances is his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba, a policy he shares with Trump. He is also a vocal critic of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, reflecting his deep personal connection to the island through his Cuban-American heritage.Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, whom he met as a teenager, and they have four children. He has authored two books: An American Son (2012), a memoir about his upbringing, and American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone (2015), which outlines his policy views.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump has selected Senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for Secretary of State.

This move is seen as a significant consolidation in the civil aviation sector in India, with Singapore Airlines retaining a 25.1% stake in the merged entity.The transition from Vistara to Air India is being handled with meticulous attention to detail to ensure a smooth experience for passengers. The merged entity has introduced a new code, AI2XXX, for all former Vistara flights, making it easier for travelers to identify their bookings. This change is part of a broader strategy to integrate the operations, staff, and customer service under the Air India banner seamlessly. According to Air India CEO and MD Campbell Wilson, teams from both airlines have been collaborating for months to facilitate the transfer of aircraft, crew, and support staff, aiming to make the transition as seamless as possible for their valued customers.First International and Domestic Flights Post-MergerIn the wake of the merger, the first international flight under the Air India-Vistara banner left Doha for Mumbai, marking a significant milestone as the first international operation by the newly integrated airline. This flight, designated AI2286, embarked on its journey at approximately 10.07 pm local time, with a scheduled arrival in Mumbai in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The flight duration was nearly three hours, symbolizing the new beginning for the combined entity. On the domestic front, the merged airlines inaugural flight, AI2984, took off from Mumbai, heading to Delhi, shortly after 1.30 am on Tuesday. This flight was operated using an A320 aircraft, further indicating the smooth continuation of operations post-merger.Despite the cessation of Vistaras brand, its aircraft, routes, and crew will maintain their operations until at least March, ensuring continuity and minimal disruption for passengers. This strategy is indicative of the careful planning and consideration behind the integration process, aiming to preserve the quality and reliability of service that customers have come to expect from both Air India and Vistara.The Implications of the MergerThe merger of Air India and Vistara is not just a significant event in the Indian aviation sector; it also represents a strategic consolidation move by the Tata Group. By merging these two airlines, the group aims to create a more robust and competitive entity capable of standing toe-to-toe with global aviation giants. For Singapore Airlines, the decision to merge Vistara with Air India and retain a stake in the joint entity underscores their long-term commitment to the Indian aviation market and their confidence in the mergers success.This landmark integration of Air India and Vistara marks the end of an era for Vistara, which had been a significant player in Indian aviation since its inception on January 9, 2015, up until its last day of operations on November 11, 2024.The journey of Vistara, from its launch to its merger with Air India, has been a transformative period for Indian aviation, setting new standards for service and operational excellence.

Infiltrators are grabbing land by marrying our daughters. We will bring legislation to prevent the transfer of land to infiltrators if they marry tribal women. We will also form a committee to identify infiltrators to drive them out and reclaim land grabbed by them,” he said. \\nThe veteran BJP leader, who held three rallies during the day, said infiltrators are a threat to “Roti, Beti and Maati” of Jharkhand. \\n“For the Congress party and JMM, the tribals are merely a vote bank and property which they can use as their own. They use them according to their will, while the BJP respects and honours the tribal brothers and sisters. The people of Jharkhand consider them their own,” Shah claimed. He claimed that Champai Soren was insulted when he raised the issue of illegal immigration and was forced to resign from the CM’s post by Hemant Soren. \\n“Former Jharkhand Chief Minister Champai Soren, a close aide of JMM supremo Shibu Soren, was insulted and humiliated for raising his voice against corruption and infiltration, which is an insult to the entire tribal community.” \\nAccusing the leaders of the JMM, Congress and RJD of working for personal gain, he said, “Corrupt leaders of the JMM-led coalition will be sent behind bars if the BJP forms government in Jharkhand.” \\nShah alleged that the JMM-led dispensation “devoured” Rs 3.90 lakh crore sent by the Centre. \\n“The JMM-led alliance was a coalition of scams – Rs 1,000 crore MNREGA scam, Rs 600 crore land scam, Rs 1,000 crore mining scam and multi-crore liquor scam,” he claimed. \\nShah promised that once the BJP is voted to power, it will ensure that if the Centre sends one rupee to Jharkhand, 25 more paise is added to it by the state so that Rs 1.25 reaches the people. \\nAddressing another election rally in Tamar in Ranchi district, he called the Congress a “sinking ship” and said that it could not “save” Soren in the elections. \\nShah alleged the ruling JMM-led coalition destroyed Jharkhand, and promised that the BJP would make it the most prosperous state in the next five years if it is voted to power. He alleged that the JMM and Congress consider tribals as a mere “vote bank” and do not respect them. \\n“Tribals are facing extinction due to infiltrators who are the vote bank of the JMM-led coalition,” he claimed. \\n“The people of Jharkhand do not trust Hemant Soren’s guarantees because those guarantees will never be fulfilled. Hemant Soren had promised to provide unemployment allowance to the youth but did not fulfil it. The BJP after forming government will provide Rs 2,000 allowance to every unemployed youth,” he said. \\nAttacking the Congress, Shah said that even “four generations of Rahul Gandhi” cannot restore Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. \\n“The Congress, JMM and RJD had protested against the removal of Article 370 in Parliament. It was said that if Article 370 was removed from Jammu and Kashmir, there would be bloodshed but Article 370 was abolished. Six years have passed but there has been no violence in the state.

This election sees the states 2.6 crore voters, split almost evenly between 1.3 crore million men and 1.29 crore women, ready to cast their ballots.Notably, the youth vote is strong, with 66.84 lakh voters aged between 20 and 29, including 11.84 crore first-time voters aged 18 and 19, poised to make their voices heard.In the 2019 Assembly elections, the Mahagathbandhan, a coalition comprising the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress, and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), emerged victorious in 44 seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 30 constituencies. The dynamics of this election are closely watched, given the historical context and the distribution of power among the various political entities vying for control.Key Constituencies and Candidates to WatchOne of the pivotal seats in this election is Barhait, where incumbent Chief Minister Hemant Soren of the JMM is contesting. The BJP has nominated Gamaliyan Hembrom to challenge Soren. Back in 2019, Soren secured the seat with 73,725 votes, surpassing his closest competitor, Simon Marandi of the BJP, by a significant margin.Another crucial contest is in Gandey, with Hemant Sorens wife, Kalpana Soren, representing the JMM, and Muniya Devi running on the BJP ticket. Kalpana Sorens entry into the race follows her victory in a 2024 assembly by-election, where she received 109,827 votes, defeating BJPs Dilip Verma.In Dumka, a Scheduled Tribes (ST) seat, the competition sees Hemant Sorens brother Basant Soren on the JMM ticket going up against Sunil Soren from the BJP. Basant Soren managed to outpace BJPs Lois Marandi in the 2020 by-election, marking a significant win.Ranchi presents a battleground where JMMs Rajya Sabha MP Mahua Maji challenges BJPs CP Singh, a stronghold for the BJP where Singh has won six times. Majis attempt to unseat Singh in the last assembly election saw her providing stiff competition, though Singh ultimately won by over 5,000 votes.In Lohardaga, a constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes and of significant political importance due to its substantial tribal population, the Congress has fielded Rameshwar Oraon against Niru Shanti Bhagat of the BJP. Oraons victory in 2019 marked a significant moment for the Congress party in the region.The Dhanwar seat, located in the Giridih district and part of the Koderma Lok Sabha constituency, sees incumbent MLA Babulal Marandi of the BJP facing off against JMMs Niazamuddin Ansari. Marandi, who joined the BJP in 2019, successfully contested the seat as part of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Democratic), defeating Laxman Prasad Singh of the BJP by a margin of 17,550 votes.With the stage set for an engaging electoral battle, the outcomes in these key constituencies could significantly influence the political landscape in Jharkhand.

The decision follows a violent pro-Khalistani demonstration on November 3, where protesters attacked devotees outside a nearby temple, including women and children. In a statement, the Brampton Triveni Mandir highlighted an “extremely high and imminent threat level of violent protests” as the reason for the event’s cancellation, based on intelligence received from Peel Regional Police.\\n\\nA Community Event Canceled Due to Security Threats\\n\\nThe Brampton Triveni Mandir was set to host a life certificate camp organized by the Indian Consulate. However, heightened security risks forced a change in plans. An open letter from the temple explained the rationale, pointing to official police intelligence warning of imminent threats from protests, potentially endangering temple visitors and local residents.\\n\\nIn its statement, the temple said, “Please be advised that the Life Certificate Event scheduled at Brampton Triveni Mandir by the Indian Consulate on November 17, 2024, has been cancelled. This is due to official intelligence from Peel Regional Police, stating that there is an Extremely High and Imminent Threat Level of violent protests.”\\n\\nFollowing this advisory, temple officials made the difficult decision to cancel, apologizing to community members who relied on the event for official documentation. “On the advice of Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah, we must make the appropriate decision to cancel to ensure the safety of Brampton Triveni Mandir devotees, community visitors, and the general public,” the statement continued.\\n\\nPlanned Temple Protests\\n\\nThe cancellation comes after Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, leader of the pro-Khalistani group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), publicly announced targeted actions against Hindu temples. In an alarming statement, Pannun said that SFJ would focus on Indian diplomats at temples on November 16 and 17, marking the Triveni Mandir in Brampton and the Kalibari Mandir in Mississauga as specific targets. Pannun claimed the group would “shake the foundations of Ayodhya” and criticized Canadian authorities, alleging that Indian diplomats are responsible for espionage against Canadian Sikhs.\\n\\nThe heightened threat has sparked concern within the local Hindu community. Temple representatives called on Peel Police to take protective action, emphasizing the need for stronger security to allow Hindu Canadians to worship safely.\\n\\nEscalating Concerns for Community Safety\\n\\nThe recent incident at Brampton’s Hindu Sabha Temple has amplified fears among Hindu Canadians. On November 3, an Indian consular camp held at the temple was disrupted by pro-Khalistani protesters, who clashed with attendees and security personnel. Videos circulated widely on social media captured chaotic scenes of physical confrontations, with individuals using flagpoles as weapons on the temple grounds. This incident drew condemnation from both Canadian and Indian leaders.\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grave concern, calling the attack on the Hindu temple a “deliberate” and “cowardly” act meant to intimidate the Indian diaspora. “I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,” Modi stated on X.\\n\\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also condemned the violence, asserting that every Canadian has the right to worship freely and safely. In response to the unrest, the Consulate General of India in Toronto canceled several planned consular camps across Canada, citing an inability to guarantee the necessary security measures.\\n\\nGrowing Anxiety Among Hindu Canadians\\n\\nThe Brampton Triveni Mandir, an important religious and community center for Hindu Canadians, expressed regret over the cancellation and concern for the safety of its devotees. “We are deeply saddened that Canadians now feel unsafe coming to Hindu Temples in Canada,” the statement read. The temple urged authorities to address the ongoing threats and called for security measures to safeguard worshippers and community members.\\n\\nThe consular camps, such as the one originally planned for November 17, provide vital services, including life certificate renewals for Indian-origin Hindus and Sikhs. These documents are essential for accessing a range of official benefits. However, pro-Khalistani activists like Pannun have publicly disparaged such initiatives. Referring to the cancellation of events as a “victory for Pro Khalistan Sikhs,” Pannun claimed that these consular camps are “not life certificate camps but death certificate camps” and even urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to close Indian consulates permanently.', 'summary': 'Brampton’s Triveni Mandir and Community Centre in Canada announced the cancellation of a life certificate event scheduled for November 17\\n\\n\\nThe post Canada: Brampton Triveni Mandir Cancels Event Amid Threat Of Violent Protests By SFJ Terrorist Pannun appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/world/canada-brampton-triveni-mandir-cancels-event-amid-threat-of-violent-protests-by-sfj-terrorist-pannun/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DEV-PATEL.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 08:46:11', 'author': 'Sfj Terrorist Pannun,Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Sfj Terrorist Pannun', 'Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.223}, {'id': 264207526, 'title': \"Video: Vistara Ground Staff's Emotional Farewell To Last Flight\", 'text': 'Ground staff and crew members at Odisha\\'s Biju Patnaik International Airport bid an emotional goodbye to the last Vistara flight on Monday.\\n\\nThe Delhi-bound flight was the full service carrier\\'s last before its merger with Air India.

The defence minister said adaptive defence must be the \"mantra\" of India\\'s strategic formulations and operational responses.Singh described adaptive defence as not merely a strategic choice but a necessity. \"As the threats to our nation have evolved, so too must our defence systems and strategies. We should be prepared for all future contingencies. It is more than just protecting our borders; it is about securing our future,\" he said. In the address at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Singh said India is aiming to become a drone hub of the world.\"Several initiatives have been taken in this regard.

He noted that traditional notions of war are being reshaped by emerging technologies and evolving strategic partnerships, with new perspectives, doctrines and concepts of operations emerging within the armed forces.The defence minister threw light on the diverse range of security challenges faced by India -- from the traditional border-related threats to unconventional issues such as terrorism, cyber-attacks, and hybrid warfare.

Let them oppose it; the BJP will pass the Bill to amend the Waqf Act. No one can stop us.”He also highlighted BJP’s intent to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), vowing it would exclude tribals and serve as a measure against infiltration. “No one can stop implementation of the UCC in Jharkhand,” he added.Jharkhand’s assembly elections are set to take place in two phases, with the first on Wednesday and the second on November 20.

He writes, “I remember during our last meet, a decade ago, you had given me an advice, ‘Accept the World the way it is or see it the way you want it to be’. Those words ring loud in my ears once again today, love you Bro for always motivating me and not judging me during our meets.”\\nSukesh’s letter also mentions that his companies, LS Holdings and LS Gaming LLC, plan to expand their investments in the United States, with a projected increase of $500 million (₹4200 crore) over the next two years.\\nNotably, Sukesh refers to Jacqueline Fernandez in the letter, claiming their relationship as he elaborates on his grand gesture inspired by advice he recalls from Trump. “I remember your other advice to me, ‘Treat your women always with dignity and make her always feel special’. On that note, LS Holdings is buying stakes of 135 million USD in a large studio producing shows and movies in Los Angeles. I have finalized this buy for my lady love Jacqueline, just like the advice you gave me, to ‘make your women feel special’,” he writes.\\nSukesh was originally arrested in 2015 in connection with a multi-crore fraud case and has been held in Mandoli Jail.

In the wake of the encounter, a shutdown was observed from 5 am on Tuesday in areas predominantly inhabited by the Kuki-Zo community in the hills.This was in protest against the deaths of the suspected insurgents during a clash with security forces. The deceased militants, who were donned in camouflage outfits and equipped with advanced weaponry, reportedly launched an indiscriminate attack on a local police station and a neighbouring CRPF camp in Jiribam, resulting in injuries to two CRPF personnel.Efforts to Trace Missing IndividualsFollowing the violent confrontation, it was reported that three women and three children were unaccounted for. IGP (operations) I K Muivah stated, The security forces are carrying out operations to trace the missing people. This search operation forms part of a broader strategy to secure peace and order in the region, which has been marred by ethnic strife between the Meitei and Kuki communities. The conflict has led to numerous deaths and displaced thousands, making the restoration of normalcy a pressing concern for authorities.The situation in Jiribam was described as calm yet tense on Tuesday morning, with police conducting patrols at critical points to maintain order. This measure came amidst reports of fresh violence in several areas within the Imphal Valley, where armed factions exchanged gunfire. In response, operations were intensified to neutralize the threat posed by militants, with reinforcement teams from the Assam Rifles and CRPF being dispatched to the affected zones.Manipurs challenges with armed ethnic conflict underscore the complexities faced by security forces and local administrations in restoring peace. The recent violence not only highlights the ongoing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities but also the resilience of the local population in the face of such adversity. As security operations continue, the focus remains on safeguarding civilians, tracing the missing individuals, and facilitating a return to normalcy in the troubled state.', 'summary': \"In a tragic development from Manipur's Jiribam district, two men were discovered deceased on Tuesday morning, following a fierce encounter that led to the death of 10 militants the previous day.

Created by Dr. Mantha Ram Murthy, a marine biologist and former zoology professor, the park is located on a three-acre plot at the Rani Chandramani Devi (RCD) Government Hospital. Dr. Murthy’s vision was to inspire the people of Visakhapatnam to appreciate and protect nature. Today, the park is home to various plant species, offering a space where people of all ages can connect with the environment and deepen their understanding of the natural world.In 2001, Dr. Murthy and his wife Mangathayi founded the Dolphin Nature Conservation Society (DNCS) and transformed a neglected wasteland on the hospital grounds into a vibrant biodiversity park. Supported by volunteers, students, and generous donors, the project has grown into a unique conservation effort that now features over 2,000 plant species and 130 butterfly species. Once a dumping ground for plastic and medical waste, the area has been transformed into a flourishing ecosystem, with sacred groves, desert zones, ponds, a greenhouse, and a cacti house. The park also attracts more than 60 bird species, including the Golden-backed Woodpecker, Spotted Owlet, and Purple Sunbird. The project began modestly, with just 1,000 square feet allocated by the hospital. Dr. Murthy and his team cleared the area of garbage, de-silted the land, and enriched the soil with organic compost. Seeds were sourced from various parts of India, and ex-situ conservation methods were used to protect endangered plant species outside their natural habitats. Today, the park is divided into ten zones, each dedicated to different plant types, from medicinal herbs to ornamental and aquatic species. Among its collection are 500 species of medicinal plants and 300 varieties of succulents. The park’s butterfly population, which feeds on nectar, pollen, and minerals from wet soil, spans six families, further contributing to the park’s ecological richness. Despite facing persistent financial and environmental challenges, including the devastation caused by Cyclone Hudhud in 2014, Dr. Murthy’s dedication and the support of the local community have ensured the park’s resilience and growth. The project has required an investment of around Rs. 70,00,000, funded by Dr. Murthy’s personal savings, donations from individuals and corporations, and assistance from the district administration. However, the park continues to face funding shortages and requires additional resources to continue its work. Among the park’s most remarkable features are rare plant species like the Maidenhair Tree (Ginkgo biloba) and the Mickey Mouse Tree, which add to the diversity of flora in this unique space. \"The flora and fauna of this park exemplify what humanity must learn about life — our deep connection with nature,\" says Dr. Murthy, whose vision has transformed a once barren plot of land into a thriving sanctuary of biodiversity. A three-acre area at the Rani Chandramani Devi (RCD) Government Hospital has been transformed into a biodiversity park, attracting nature lovers from across the region.', 'summary': 'Marine biologist transforms hospital wasteland into flourishing ecosystem, with sacred groves, desert zones, ponds, a greenhouse, and a cacti house.', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/andhra-pradesh/andhra-pradesh-from-dumping-ground-to-biodiversity-oasis-1837613', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/12/1861976-rcd4.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 14:16:30', 'author': 'Aruna', 'authors': ['Aruna'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.509}, {'id': 264316296, 'title': 'BREAKING: Mithun Chakraborty Gets Y-Plus Security After Threats on Social Media', 'text': 'Kolkata: Veteran actor and the BJP leader, Mithun Chakraborty, was on Tuesday provided Y-plus security cover after he received threats on social media.

He claimed that the BJD’s leadership structure had been compromised, saying the reins were handed over to bureaucrat-turned-politician V.K. Pandian and the late Pyari Mohapatra, leaving party loyalists and workers sidelined. These remarks followed recent statements from top BJD leaders, who indicated that the party could form a government in Odisha by partnering with Congress and independents. At a rally in Kendrapada’s Mahakalapada district on Saturday, former minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak reaffirmed his confidence in Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’s leadership, even if it meant securing Congress's support. “Our party has 51 members in the Assembly, Congress has 14, and there are three Independents,” Nayak said, suggesting a potential alliance that could come close to a majority. This sentiment has been echoed by other BJD leaders, including MPs Debashish Samantaray and Munna Khan, as well as former MP Amar Patnaik. Despite this display of confidence from the BJD, Congress leader Mohammed Moquim dismissed the possibility of aligning with the BJD. “There is no question of joining hands with BJD, which supported the BJP government at the Center on all issues when it was in power. The regional outfit has no future, and Congress will grow on its own in Odisha,” Moquim stated. “This back-and-forth has further stirred the political atmosphere in Odisha as rural elections and urban elections loom. With BJD under fire from BJP leaders and Congress distancing itself from any coalition talk, the coming months promise an intense political battle in the state,” observed political analyst Prasanna Mohanty.\", 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/andhra-pradesh-from-dumping-ground-to-biodiversity-oasis-1837615', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/12/1861979-bjpleaderjayanarayanmishra.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 14:22:13', 'author': 'Akshaya Kumar Sahoo', 'authors': ['Akshaya Kumar Sahoo'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.251}, {'id': 264316294, 'title': 'India Shifts From Savers To Investors: Rashesh Shah On Financial Growth At Economic Summit', 'text': 'India Economic Summit : At the fourth edition of Republic Media Network\\'s India Economic Summit , themed “Viksit Bharat,” Edelweiss Group Chairman and CEO Rashesh Shah offered insights on India’s economic path, emphasizing ambitious growth targets, the evolving investment culture, and the importance of job creation. Shah, a prominent voice in finance, explored the transformation of India\\'s economy and investment landscape, projecting a potential $25-30 trillion economy by 2047.India’s Economic Growth and “Golden Age of Compounding”“India is at a stage… I call it the golden age of compounding for India,” Shah said, emphasizing that the economy has been steadily growing over the last 30 years, doubling in size approximately every six years. As of now, India has reached a $4 trillion economy, and with continued growth, Shah projected it could hit $11-12 trillion by 2035 and potentially reach $25-30 trillion by 2047.From Saving to Investing: A Cultural ShiftShah noted that India is moving from a \"country of savers to a country of investors,\" which he sees as a crucial step for wealth creation on a national level. The growth of the mutual fund industry, capital markets, and insurance has spurred this shift, allowing Indians to invest rather than simply save. He added, “When you start investing that smartly and get return, the family income really starts galloping away… We are compounding at scale.”Job Creation: A Necessary Objective of Market GrowthWhile acknowledging the financial market’s growth, Shah highlighted the need for data to track job creation within these sectors. He argued that regulators and agencies should require filings on job creation, noting that while the market is flourishing, its impact on employment needs clearer articulation.“It also has to create jobs for the country at large… we need to articulate that,” he said, emphasizing that stock market success should coincide with job creation and capital formation for India to fully realize its economic potential.Check Out the Video: Targeting 10% Growth for India’s “Bullseye”Shah envisions India reaching a 10% growth rate without economic overheating, seeing this as vital for raising per capita income from the current $3,000 to $8,000-10,000. He stated, “I think for all of us in India, the bullseye has to be, can we get to 10% growth… with our investment, our consumption, our savings.”Expansion of Investment Products and Democratization of CapitalHe pointed to the diversification in investment avenues, including REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), INVITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts), and other financial products, which allow Indian investors to own shares in physical assets like office complexes and infrastructure.“We are financializing a lot of assets,” Shah said, explaining how these products have expanded beyond traditional stocks, making investment opportunities more inclusive and accessible across India. He likened the spread of entrepreneurship from major cities to Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions to the rise of diverse sports talent in the country.Call for Balanced RegulationOn policy and regulation, Shah urged for a balanced approach. He suggested a system of “regulate and deregulate,” ensuring that outdated regulations are phased out to allow new businesses and innovations to thrive. He noted, “The biggest victim of over-regulation… it creates entry barriers for new firms, stops innovation.”Long-term Market Outlook: Growth Amidst VolatilityWith over 35 years in the financial industry, Shah reflected on the exponential growth he’s witnessed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), which rose from 700 points in 1989 to approximately 80,000 today. He predicted continued long-term growth, though with inherent volatility: “In the long term, it will be up, but it will be highly volatile,” he remarked, adding that this fluctuation provides both opportunities for investors and a source of interest for the media.Shah’s insights underscored a vision for India’s financial future, one in which economic growth, job creation, and investment opportunities are interwoven to achieve a thriving, self-sufficient India by 2047.', 'summary': 'India Shifts From Savers To Investors: Rashesh Shah On Financial Growth At Economic Summit', 'url': 'https://www.republicworld.com/india/india-shifts-from-savers-to-investors-rashesh-shah-on-financial-growth-at-economic-summit', 'image': 'https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/india-shifts-from-savers-to-investors-rashesh-shah-on-financial-growth-at-economic-summit-1731420218417-9_16.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 14:03:44', 'author': 'Digital Desk', 'authors': ['Digital Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.295}, {'id': 264317198, 'title': 'Why Was Mark Zuckerberg Accused Of Causing Social Media Addiction?', 'text': 'Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg can not be held be personally liable in a set of 25 lawsuits accusing Meta of addicting children to social media, declared the US District Court of Northern California on November 8.

As per the lawsuit document, Automattic wants WP Engine to pay “tens of millions of dollars per year” to use its trademarks, including WordPress, and WooCommerce. While Automattic holds that WP Engine is using its trademarks without authorisation, WP Engine argues that the “WP” abbreviation isn’t covered under WordPress trademarks.\\n\\nComments on Automattic’s tracker’s Github page have pointed out the irony in the fact that while the Automattic vs WP Engine debate deals with improper usage of trademarks, the tracker uses WP Engine’s trademark without permission. \\n\\nDemands to dismiss the lawsuit:\\n\\nIn a court petition filed on October 31, Mullenweg and Automattic’s lawyers argue that WP Engine conjured its legal claim “out of thin air” urging the court to dismiss the lawsuit. The petition argues that WP Engine exploits free resources, “while refusing to meaningfully give back to the WordPress community.”\\n\\nAutomattic says that WP Engine hasn’t always infringed on its trademarks, instead its priorities changed in 2018 when a private equity firm took control of three board seats. “In the years following Silver Lake’s assumption of control over WP Engine, WP Engine began to progressively shift how it uses the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks and to change the features it offers in connection with the WordPress software and its overall customer service in order to maximize profit and to trade off the goodwill associated with the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks,” the company argues. It explains that the company first infringed WordPress trademark when it incorporated the WordPress name into its own product offering which it called “Headless WordPress.” \\n\\nFurther, the petition gives a rebuttal to WP Engine’s claims about WordPress’ trademark policy. WP Engine argues that in 2010, Automattic transferred the WordPress trademarks and source code to the nonprofit WordPress Foundation. The foundation, in turn, licensed the commercial rights back to Automattic. WP Engine argues that Mullenweg did not disclose this transaction in WordPress Foundation’s tax filings. “WP Engine also attempts to frame Automattic’s assignment of the WordPress trademarks to the Foundation as some nefarious act when in fact most for profit companies would never consider such a transfer of trademark rights,” Automattic’s petition reads. \\n\\nWP Engine made changes to its site before filing a lawsuit:\\n\\nAccording to Automattic and Mullenweg, days before filing its lawsuit, WP Engine “scurried to delete various unauthorized uses of the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks from its website”.

This practice helped identify preliminary information about the caller and further eliminate the access of unknown and spam callers to the user. Later, in October 2023, the feature went through an upgrade with an “Ask if urgent” option for incoming calls from users on the contacts list.\\n\\nGoogle also rolled out a provision of ‘contextual call screen replies’ in Android 12 in a bid to “easily respond in a way that fits the situation” last December. This feature, termed “dobby,” enabled the Google Assistant to meet out tailored and context-aware responses. For instance, in response to a call asking for a booking confirmation for a table at a restaurant, Google would display options such as “confirm” or “cancel booking,” streamlining the call process. However, the ‘contextual call screen replies’ are only available to a small set of responses.\\n\\n‘AI Replies’ feature to curate smart responses\\n\\nAdding to the preexisting ‘Contextual Call Screen’, the new feature seeks to leverage AI technology to curate smart replies based on the responses detailed on the Call Screen.

India’s newly enacted Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act drove this migration. The law requires companies to store sensitive data within Indian borders.\\n\\nHow Did Delhivery Complete Data Migration?\\n\\nDelhivery, which services over 18,000 pin codes across India, has grown exponentially in recent years, with its data lake powering business and analytics applications. However, with India’s DPDP Act mandating data residency within the country, Delhivery had to migrate over 70 million objects to AWS Regions in India.\\n\\nTo meet this compliance requirement, Delhivery partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to migrate its vast data infrastructure to the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region. The migration process involved the use of Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) and S3 Batch Operations, tools that allowed Delhivery to replicate data in near real-time and transfer historical data.\\n\\nThe DATA migration process occurred in two stages:\\n\\nS3 Cross-Region Replication: Delhivery implemented real-time replication for newly generated data.

Users can deploy their applications across multiple zones for enhanced resilience.\\n\\nTo manage the large-scale migration, Delhivery used AWS’s cloud capabilities, including Amazon S3 CRR and S3 Batch Operations. These tools ensured minimal disruption to operations while executing data replication. Delhivery’s existing data infrastructure included over 800 data pipelines, processing 60,000 messages per second. The system ingested 350 GB of data daily.\\n\\nCompliance with India’s Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023\\n\\nThe DPDP Act, enacted in 2023, mandates that all critical personal data of Indian citizens must be stored within India’s geographical boundaries.

The US courts have also found the FTX founder previously guilty of wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. \\n\\nSo why is FTX suing Binance?\\n\\nThe lawsuit states that in 2019, Binance acquired a 20% equity stake in FTX, purchasing it through a million Binance exchange tokens (BNB). Later in 2020, when Bankman-Fried expanded his company under the umbrella of WRS, Binance bought an 18.4% stake in this business for two dollars. \\n\\nFinally, in 2021, Binance sold its stake in FTX and WRS back, but since FTX was insolvent at the time and couldn’t afford to buy back the stake, it did so by spending about $1 billion of FTX depositors’ capital to do so. The transaction closed at BNB tokens’ fair market value at the time which was $1.76 billion. The lawsuit document goes on to say that given the fact that FTX was insolvent when the transaction happened, the shares repurchased were worthless. \\n\\nAlleged attacks against FTX:\\n\\n“Having divested himself of his equity stake in his rival FTX, Zhao then set outto destroy his now-unaffiliated competitor,” the lawsuit suggests. Around the time of the share repurchase in 2021, Binance was facing accusations of skirting banking and securities regulations, it explains. Then in 2022, governments around the world began considering crypto regulation and FTX/Bankman-Fried adopted a pro-regulation stance. \\n\\nOn the other hand, Binance and Zhao had a pro-decentralisation stance. “Some crypto influencers, who, upon information and belief, were partially funded by Binance, published explosive tweets calculated to turn customers against FTX, in part because of its public support for crypto regulation,” the lawsuit explains. FTX management was suspicious that Binance was engaging in a coordinated campaign to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt against it.\\n\\nThe reasons behind the bank run on FTX:\\n\\nThe lawsuit further claims that FTX suspected that Binance leaked details of Alameda Research’s financials (which was a firm closely tied to FTX) to the crypto news platform CoinDesk around November 1. Then, on November 6, 2022, the Binance CEO made a series of false tweets to destroy FTX as the company was becoming a clear threat to Binance’s market dominance. These tweets documented that FTX share repurchase and also informed people that Binance was planning on getting rid of any FTX exchange tokens (FTTs) on its books. \\n\\n“Zhao’s false tweets triggered a predictable avalanche of withdrawals at FTX – the proverbial run on the bank that Zhao knew would cause FTX to collapse,” the lawsuit document adds. On November 6 and November 7, 2022, FTX.com and FTX.US. exchanges processed approximately $6 billion in net customer withdrawals, with many of the customers withdrawing more than 90% of their account values. The lawsuit also claims that around the same time, Binance saw significant growth with a surge in new years, an increase in trading volume and liquidity, and a significant increase in its market share.', 'summary': 'FTX has filed a lawsuit against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao for $1.76 billion, asserting Binance’s role in FTX’s 2022 collapse. According to FTX, its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, financed a share buyback using customer funds—a transaction the suit claims was motivated by Zhao’s alleged attempts to sabotage FTX’s market position.\\n\\n\\nThe post FTX Sues Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, Alleging Fraudulent Buyback, Sabotage appeared first on MEDIANAMA.', 'url': 'https://www.medianama.com/2024/11/223-ftx-lawsuit-binance-zhao/', 'image': 'https://www.medianama.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IAMAI-dissolves-Crypto-Council-amid-regulatory-uncertainties-main.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 07:21:55', 'author': 'Kamya Pandey', 'authors': ['Kamya Pandey'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.402}, {'id': 264317756, 'title': \"Mohammed Shami's Absence A Major Blow For India in Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Says Paul Adams\", 'text': 'Ahead of the highly-anticipated five-match Test series against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, starting on November 22 at Perth, former South Africa cricketer Paul Adams, expressed his belief that pacer Mohammed Shami’s absence will be a significant blow to India’s chances on the fast and bouncy Australian pitches.\\nAdams, who acknowledged Shami’s ability to make an impact in all conditions, emphasised, “I think he (Mohammad Shami) will be a major miss for India against Australia eyeing the conditions. The pace and bouncy wickets in Australia would have helped India in gaining an upper hand if Shami had been in the squad but that’s not in the selector’s hand as he is recovering, but I think he will be missed,” Adams told IANS in a virtual interaction arranged by SA20.\\nShami’s contributions to India’s first-ever Test series win in Australia during the 2018/19 tour are well-documented. Over the course of four matches, he picked up 16 wickets at an average of 26.18, showcasing his skill in extracting bounce and seam movement.\\nThough injuries have disrupted his career at key moments, Shami has remained one of India’s most formidable pace bowlers. His absence on the 2020/21 tour due to a fractured right forearm was felt, though India famously triumphed 2-1.\\nALSO READ | Mohammed Shami Is Back! Star Pacer Set To Play For Bengal In Ranji Trophy\\nAdams pointed out that Shami’s absence places additional pressure on Jasprit Bumrah, the Indian vice-captain, and the rest of the pace unit. “We all saw what he did in the ODI World Cup 2023, he single-handedly carried the Indian pace attack and he is someone who has the ability to extract from any pitches around the world despite the conditions. The seam position and the length are just extraordinary. The pressure will be on vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah and other pacers but I believe it will be all-rounders who will play a huge role for India, especially Ravindra Jadeja,” he added.\\nShami, who has taken 229 wickets in 64 Tests, last played for India in the ODI World Cup final in November 2023 in Ahmedabad. He emerged as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament, with 24 wickets at an impressive average of 10.70, despite not featuring in India’s initial matches. His ability to generate reverse swing and extract movement from any pitch stood out, further cementing his reputation as one of the world’s premier fast bowlers.\\nShami has been sidelined for over a year due to an Achilles tendon injury, which required surgery in February 2024 in London. Since then, he has been undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, focusing on a gradual return to bowling. Shami recently confirmed during a promotional event that he is now 100% pain-free and expressed a strong desire to play a few domestic matches before making a full-fledged comeback.\\nShami is set to make his competitive return for Bengal against Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group C match in Indore. This opportunity will allow him to gain match fitness and test his form against quality domestic opposition. However, despite his recovery, the BCCI did not name Shami in the five-Test squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, opting for a cautious approach.', 'summary': 'Paul Adams feels Mohammed Shami’s absence places additional pressure on Jasprit Bumrah and the rest of the pace unit.', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/cricket/mohammed-shamis-absence-a-major-blow-for-india-in-border-gavaskar-trophy-says-paul-adams-9118193.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/10/mohammed-shami-practice-pti-2024-10-7e000c98977d4d1ce942592a4bd3db50-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 14:23:56', 'author': 'News18,Ritayan Basu', 'authors': ['News18', 'Ritayan Basu'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.147}, {'id': 264316500, 'title': \"North Korea Ratifies Defence Treaty With Russia, Kim Sent ‘Storm Corps' Soldiers but Not His A-team?\", 'text': 'North Korea has ratified a landmark defence pact with Russia on November 12, sealing a deepening security cooperation with Moscow.

The notice concerns a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a policy for mandatory age checks at all alcohol sale locations. This comes amid rising public outrage over fatal road accidents involving underage, intoxicated drivers.\\n\\nJustices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan led the Bench and requested the Union Government to respond to the writ petition.

He also highlighted the availability of door-to-door alcohol delivery options. Justice Gavai remarked: “Door delivery first started in Bihar because of the prohibition.” To this, Suresh added, “Wherever prohibition is imposed, they don’t call it a dry state, they call it a try state, because if you try, you can get it.”, reported Verdictum. \\n\\nThe bench initially remarked that individuals could still have someone else, like a domestic worker, purchase alcohol on their behalf or buy it under another name.

She has a significant background in Florida politics, having assisted Ron DeSantis in his initial gubernatorial victory. Six years later, she played a critical role in Trump’s primary defeat of DeSantis in 2024.\\n\\nTrump’s decision to appoint Wiles as his first major hire is expected to be a significant test for the new administration, given her close working relationship with him. Her ability to keep Trump on track reportedly stems from her method of earning his respect rather than critiquing his impulses, which led to a notably disciplined campaign.\\n\\nTrump picks Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser\\n\\nTrump selected Mike Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to serve as his national security adviser, according to a source familiar with the matter. Waltz is expected to face numerous national security challenges, including supporting Ukraine, managing concerns over Russia and North Korea’s alliance, and responding to Middle East crises involving Iran-backed forces, as well as pushing for a ceasefire in Israel’s conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah.\\n\\nA three-term GOP congressman from Florida, Waltz served in Afghanistan and worked as a policy adviser at the Pentagon under Defense Chiefs Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. Known for his hawkish stance on China, he previously advocated for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics due to issues involving COVID-19 origins and Uighur treatment.\\n\\nTom Homan, picked by Trump as ‘Border Czar’\\n\\nTrump has designated Tom Homan, 62, to oversee his priority of implementing the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. Homan, who led U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump’s first term, was widely anticipated to take on a border-related role. He has expressed support for a humane approach to this large undertaking and reiterated his willingness to “run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen” during a July conference in Washington.\\n\\nHoman has faced criticism from Democrats for supporting Trump’s “zero tolerance” border policy, which led to the separation of numerous families seeking asylum.\\n\\nElise Stefanik, United Nations Ambassador\\n\\nElise Stefanik, a New York representative and consistent Trump defender since his first impeachment, is Trump’s pick for U.N. ambassador. Stefanik, who became House Republican Conference chair in 2021 following Liz Cheney’s removal, has continued to play a prominent role in GOP leadership.\\n\\nStefanik’s public questioning of university presidents on antisemitism contributed to the resignation of two presidents, further elevating her profile. If confirmed, her U.N. representation will align with Trump’s stated aims to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict and support peace amid Israel’s actions in Gaza and Lebanon.\\n\\nStephen Miller, Picked as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy by Trump\\n\\nStephen Miller, an immigration hardliner and prominent advocate for Trump’s proposed mass deportations during the campaign, will serve as deputy chief of staff for policy. Miller played a key role in Trump’s previous administration, particularly in the decision to separate migrant families.\\n\\nFollowing Trump’s 2021 departure, Miller led America First Legal, an organization of former Trump aides focused on challenging the Biden administration, media entities, and universities on issues such as free speech and national security.\\n\\nLee Zeldin, Environmental Protection Agency\\n\\nTrump has selected former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. While Zeldin lacks direct experience in environmental matters, he has been a strong Trump supporter.

The move that seemed a lick of luck at first went wrong and landed in trouble on the grounds of controversies on environmental issues and illegal deforestation in the state.\\n\\nThe trouble started with reports surfacing that, during a shoot in Karnataka, several trees were felled without taking permission from the local forest department. According to officials, the trees fall under a protected area and are being cut by breaking both state and national environmental regulations. The Karnataka Forest Department immediately launched an investigation, the consequent filing of FIR against the production team of Toxic.\\n\\nThis incident takes place when the state government has been cracking down on illegal deforestation and environmental degradation, so this matter becomes very sensitive. The forest department said they were investigating the matter thoroughly and would take appropriate legal action against the responsible ones.\\n\\nFor Yash, who has had a back-to-back blockbuster role as Rocky in the KGF franchise, the incident could prove to be damaging to his public image. Unlike earlier when stars like Yash were invariably aligned with good causes, the actor himself was largely seen as someone supporting social causes. The current row over the Toxic shoot is starkly contrasting with the general image of the actor as an environmentally conscious individual.\\n\\nMUST READ: Dharma Announces Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta’s THIS Movie To Re-Release\\n\\nThe felling of trees, especially in ecologically sensitive areas, is highly taboo in India. There are strong feelings about environmental protection, and the incident draws unwarranted attention to the film industry at a time when it already stands judged based on its resource requirement.Environmental activists have filed complaints regarding such insensitive actions causing harm to the environment, thus making a more responsible approach to shoot locations.\\n\\nTill now, no official reaction has been heard coming from Yash or his production house regarding the FIR. However, the industry sources state that the actor might still be expected to take an appropriate stance on the issue sooner rather than later, either through his team or personally to put all things right. With public opinion as well as legal scrutiny already growing, pressure on Yash and his team to do away with the matter is getting inescapably sterner.\\n\\nOn nothing else, the process of felling itself remains unclear whether it is a spate of random acts or otherwise, it raises the most pertinent questions on accountability and responsibility within the film industry. Where forests are such a significant determinant for biodiversity preservation and check climate change, actions of such severity in a state like Karnataka need no special description.\\n\\nThis controversy brings to the fore the larger issue of environmental sustainability within the entertainment industry. Films are a very powerful medium of cultural expression and storytelling but at an enormously immense cost for the environment. The logistics of location shooting, huge crews, and entailed prodigious sets sometimes take it out on nature.\\n\\nThe demands for tight regulation when filming in forests or ecologically sensitive sites are several. While a few film directors worry about the environmental aspect of their production some ignore the consequences of their activities on nature. As the film industry continues to grow, filmmakers must wake up to the long-term impact of their actions and hence assume more holistic practices.\\n\\nThe investigation will not make the film easy for Yash and his team. In fact, it will attract massive media attention, which will create a turning point not only for the actor but also for the entire Indian film industry that needs to stand up against environmental issues and prove to be committed to sustainability.\\n\\nThe probe could find serious punishment for the Toxic team in the form of hefty fines, legal action, or a ban on future projects in protected areas, but to Yash and the film industry, it also came as a golden opportunity to show leadership in dealing with environmental concerns and ensuring that such incidents don’t happen again.\\n\\nWhile the coming weeks are of huge interest not only to the fans of Yash but also to environmentalists and the common public, it will only be known how the controversy unfolds. Will Yash take proactive efforts to address the issue and repair damage to his public image, or will the long-term curvature of his career be decided by the legal and environmental ramifications?\\n\\nALSO READ: Aamir Khan Shares Tips To Kiran Rao On ‘How to Be a Better Wife’, Her Hilarious Response Revealed', 'summary': 'KGF star Yash faces legal trouble as Karnataka Forest Department files FIR over alleged tree cutting during the shoot of his film Toxic.\\n\\n\\nThe post KGF Actor Yash Faces FIR Over Alleged Tree Cutting During &#8216;Toxic&#8217; Movie Shoot In Karnataka appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/entertainment/kgf-actor-yash-faces-fir-over-alleged-tree-cutting-during-toxic-movie-shoot-in-karnataka/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Yashs-Toxic-To-Go-On-Floors-On-August-8.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 14:06:49', 'author': 'Swati Pandey', 'authors': ['Swati Pandey'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.176}, {'id': 264317056, 'title': 'Security Agencies Conduct Mock Drill At Jammu And Kashmir’s Chenab Bridge', 'text': 'Jammu, Nov 12: Multiple security agencies conducted a mock drill at the Chenab Railway Bridge, the world’s highest rail bridge and a critical infrastructure of the country, in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district on Tuesday, an official said.\\nSpanning over 1.3 kilometres, the bridge is a vital link in the 111-km stretch from Katra to Banihal, which forms part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla section of the Kashmir Railway project, officials said.\\n“The district police in Reasi, along with various security agencies, successfully conducted a full-scale mock drill at the Chenab Railway Bridge in Kouri, lasting over two hours,” a police officer said.\\nSeven security agencies participated in the drill, including the Police, Special Operations Group (SOG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), General Railway Police (GRP), Railway Protection Force (RPF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), and Village Defence Groups (VDG), the officer added.\\nFire and Emergency Services, as well as medical teams, also were a part of the mock drill at Kouri.\\nThe exercise was designed to assess the preparedness of the forces to respond quickly and effectively to potential threats from anti-national elements. “This was a proactive step to safeguard critical infrastructure,” the officer said.\\nThe Chenab bridge, an engineering marvel, is an arched steel and concrete structure connecting Baramulla to Jammu via the Udhampur-Katra-Qazigund route, with a travel time of approximately six-and-a-half hours, railway officials said.\\nStanding 35 metres higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the bridge is designed to withstand a blast of up to 40 kg of TNT and an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale.

The leaders collectively called for an immediate and complete Israeli withdrawal from these territories, citing humanitarian and geopolitical concerns. According to the BBC, the Crown Prince warned Israel specifically against any escalation of hostilities toward Iran.\\n\\nSaudi Foreign Minister’s Statement on Global Inaction\\n\\nSaudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, also voiced sharp criticism of the international community’s apparent failure to end the conflict. He highlighted what he described as a lack of concerted efforts to address “Israel’s aggression” and prevent further suffering among Gaza’s civilian population. Prince Faisal stated, “Where the international community has primarily failed is in stopping the immediate conflict and ending Israel’s aggression,” stressing that delays in diplomatic actions have contributed to severe humanitarian consequences, including what he termed widespread “starvation” within Gaza.\\n\\nAccusations of Genocide and Targeting of Civilians\\n\\nIsrael has consistently refuted accusations of genocide, maintaining that its military actions focus solely on Hamas, the governing authority in Gaza. However, reports from within the region have painted a stark picture of the toll on civilians. The United Nations and humanitarian groups have condemned Israel’s strikes on UN facilities in Gaza, with particular concern over attacks that have affected UN staff members. The criticism intensified after Israel passed legislation banning the UN Palestinian Refugee Agency (UNRWA) from operating in Israel and East Jerusalem, claiming the agency had ties with Hamas. This move has drawn concern from international bodies, with the United States and the United Kingdom voicing alarm over the potential impact on humanitarian aid access for Gaza’s residents.\\n\\nFrom October Attacks to Ongoing War\\n\\nThe current conflict erupted on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a large-scale, deadly assault on Israeli communities, resulting in the deaths of over 1,200 people and the taking of 251 hostages. Israel’s military response has been extensive, leading to substantial casualties in Gaza. According to the health ministry run by Hamas in Gaza, the death toll from Israeli strikes has now exceeded 43,400. Both sides have continued hostilities, and the conflict has become the focus of international diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire.\\n\\nThe Gulf’s Perspective on U.S. Involvement\\n\\nAs regional tensions remain high, some Gulf leaders are also casting an eye toward the potential return of former U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House. Known for his close relationships with several Gulf leaders, Trump is seen as a figure with the deal-making skills and regional familiarity to potentially negotiate peace agreements.

This new record follows her previous donation milestone of 1,569.79 liters, making her one of the most prolific breastmilk donors globally. Ogletree’s commitment to helping vulnerable babies has transformed lives across Texas and beyond, with her donations reaching countless infants who rely on breastmilk for their survival.\\n\\nOgletree’s Impact on Preterm Babies\\n\\nOgletree has been donating her milk to the Mothers’ Milk Bank of North Texas, an organization dedicated to providing milk to preterm and critically ill newborns. According to the milk bank, just one liter of breastmilk can support 11 preterm babies. Based on her total donations, Ogletree estimates that nearly 350,000 newborns have benefited from her milk. Her dedication to giving has not only set records but has also contributed to the well-being of countless infants whose lives depend on the nourishing qualities of breastmilk.\\n\\nThe Journey to Breastmilk Donation\\n\\nOgletree’s journey began unexpectedly after the birth of her first son, Kyle, who is now 14 years old. Discovering she was producing an excess of milk and discarding it, she was encouraged to donate by a nurse at the hospital who witnessed the overflow of milk filling up their freezer. In an interview with Guinness World Records, Ogletree shared, “Our first child, Kyle, was in the hospital, and I was filling the nurses’ freezer. A nurse asked if I was donating, which I didn’t know was possible, and that is when I learned about it.” This moment inspired her to begin a journey of donation that would span over a decade and lead to multiple record-breaking achievements.\\n\\nOgletree’s Motivation Behind the Donations\\n\\nOgletree expressed her profound sense of fulfillment from her ability to donate breastmilk, especially given that financial donations are not always feasible for her family. Speaking to Guinness World Records, she explained, “I have a big heart. At the end of the day, I’m not made of money, and I can’t give away money to good causes over and over because I have a family I have to support for.” This perspective has driven her to provide what she could, knowing her milk is a vital resource for infants who may not otherwise survive.\\n\\nEncouraging Other Women to Join the Cause\\n\\nAs a mother of three and a surrogate, Ogletree’s goal extends beyond her donations. She hopes to inspire other women to consider donating their breastmilk, especially those who, like her, may produce an abundant supply. “It’s one of the best feelings in the world,” Ogletree said, referring to the joy she finds in helping other mothers and babies. She also emphasizes the importance of healthy habits that have helped her maintain a high production level, including staying hydrated, eating nutritious meals, and keeping a consistent pumping schedule.\\n\\nA Journey Fueled by Compassion\\n\\nThroughout her journey, Ogletree has continued to donate even after becoming a mother of three: Kyle, now 14; Kage, 12; and Kory, 7. Her dedication has not waned, and her incredible achievement has positioned her as an inspirational figure within the breastfeeding and milk donation communities.

It was an eyebrow-raising moment: a tech magnate embroiled in consistent battles in matters related to technology and AI development, throwing his weight behind a businessman known for his unpredictable relationship with Silicon Valley. However, as the votes came in and Trump secured a win, the tech industry is now watching in anticipation. \\n\\nMusk's support for Trump isn’t as unlikely though. Musk has been a fierce advocate for technological advancement (he co-founded OpenAI, the parent to ChatGPT) with cautious regulation. He likely saw an alignment with Trump’s past AI initiatives, which aim to make America the leader in AI development, light regulations, and fostering innovation. \\n\\nCampaigning for Trump worked in his favour. Musk's strategic move led to a surge in Tesla stocks making him richer by $50 billion. Not just Musk, several tech giants have benefitted from Trump’s win. The likes of Google and Nvidia have seen a jump in their stocks of over 6% while Amazon, Microsoft and more have observed a jump of over 4%. Since November 6. The markets might have reacted swiftly, however, tech leaders are approaching this win with caution, especially since Trump’s policies have often clashed with them. What does Trump’s return to the White House mean for the trajectory of tech giants and AI?\\n\\nTrump’s stance on AI \\n\\nAI policies during Donald Trump's first tenure as President from 2017 to 2021 were designed to bolster U.S. competitiveness in technology and maintain its leadership on the global stage. \\n\\nHis need for the US to lead might be mainly because he sees China as a threat. In a podcast, he mentioned that “we (America) have to take the lead over China.” \\n\\nHis AI-related policies and initiatives during his first tenure include ‘The American AI Initiative (2019)’ focusing on US leadership in AI development, prioritising and funding AI research and development through federal agencies. His administration also highlighted the impact of AI on the job market and the initiative aimed to prepare the workforce for the AI-driven economy.\\n\\nTrump has also increased federal investments in AI research. His administration's budget proposals included increased funding for agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), mainly in AI research and development.\\n\\nAdditionally, Trump's policies focused on forming international dialogues and alliances with like-minded nations to counter the influence of China. He has contributed to the development of global AI principles, including the G7 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines which aimed at ensuring that AI development is ethical, transparent, and accountable.\\n\\nAdditionally, Trump’s administration favoured minimal regulations in AI. This won’t work in favour of Joe Biden’s AI policies. During his election campaign, Trump pledged to repeal the Biden administration's order on artificial intelligence. The U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI) is an institution created by the Biden Administration in November for AI safety. Its primary goal is to conduct research, develop safety standards, and provide guidance on mitigation of the potential harms of AI, including issues related to bias, fairness, accountability and transparency.\\n\\nConsidering Trump’s controversial personal stance of bias towards minority groups, AI’s currently faulty work in accurate representation might not be his administration’s concern. The 2024 Republican platform criticises Biden’s order on AI as ‘dangerous,’ claiming it stifles innovation and imposes ‘radical leftwing ideas’ on AI development. Trump publicly stated that he would eliminate the order on his first day in office, aligning with Republican views that AI development should prioritise ‘free speech and human flourishing’. \\n\\nTrump has himself been a victim of deepfakes but with his attention towards ‘free speech’, he has participated in deepfake use during the election campaign. \\n\\nTrump’s return to office could mean an emphasis on strengthening the U.S. position as a global leader in AI and light regulations that could spark debates about ethics and job impacts. Additionally, it could also affect tech companies. While CXOs of tech giants congratulated the businessman on his presidential win, they have often clashed with Trump.\\n\\nTrump’s love-hate relationship with tech giants\\n\\nDonald Trump's history with tech companies is complicated. During his first tenure, he frequently accused social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google of political bias by censoring conservative voices. He claimed they were suppressing right-wing viewpoints, which led to him signing an executive order in May 2020 on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This act shields tech companies from liability for user-generated content and Trump aimed to limit these legal protections.\\n\\nHis administration also clashed with matters related to antitrust issues. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission launched investigations into the business practices of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. He often singled out Amazon and Jeff Bezos, accusing them of exploiting tax loopholes and competing unfairly and attacked The Washington Post (owned by Bezos) for its coverage of his presidency.\\n\\nPreviously, Trump also attempted to ban TikTok, which might be set in stone now that he has been re-elected. His controversial opinions also got him banned from X (formerly Twitter) in 2021, later being welcomed back once Musk took control of the micro-blogging platform. \\n\\nChallenges and Opportunities Ahead\\n\\nWhile his win has prompted tech companies to feel optimistic, albeit with slight caution, Trump’s stance on overreliance on China could pose problems for tech companies. China plays a huge role in research and development and manufacturing products for companies like Apple. Trump could double on tariffs imposed which could be harmful for companies reliant on China. \\n\\nAdditionally, the administration's stance on regulations could accelerate innovation but may also lead to ethical concerns. Michael Kratsios, Trump’s former Chief Technology Officer, once emphasised a ‘trustworthy AI’ that aligns with American values, yet, striking the balance between rapid innovation and ethical oversight remains a grey area.\\n\\nFurther, social and environmental considerations could take a backseat under Trump. He has often shown scepticism toward climate change and complex global issues. Considering AI development and model training can lead to harmful effects on natural resources like fresh water, this is concerning.\\n\\nGlobally, Trump’s AI policies could reshape international collaboration. The administration’s cautious stance on partnerships, shaped by concerns over intellectual property and security, may limit cooperative research but push other nations to advance their capabilities. \\n\\nElon Musk once said that AI development can prove to be more dangerous than nukes (nuclear weapons). With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, there could be an acceleration in AI innovation, all while raising important questions about ethics and intense scrutiny of the tech industry, potentially proving Musk right.\", 'summary': \"The 2024 U.S. presidential election took an unexpected turn when tech billionaire Elon Musk, known for his often controversial stances, publicly endorsed and campaigned for Donald Trump.

If our threats are transnational so should be our solutions, he stated.\\n\\nThe Minister termed ‘Adaptive Defence’ as a strategic approach where a nation’s military and defence mechanisms continuously evolve to counter emerging threats effectively.\\n\\n“‘Adaptive Defence’ is not merely responding to what has happened but anticipating what could happen, and preparing for it proactively. In essence, it involves cultivating a mindset and capability to adapt, innovate and thrive, even in the face of unpredictable and evolving circumstances. Situational awareness, flexibility at strategic and tactical levels, resilience, agility, and integration with the futuristic technologies are the keys to understand and create adaptive defence. It must be the mantra of our strategic formulations and operational responses,” Mr. Singh said. He was addressing the inaugural Delhi Defence Dialogue organised by Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.\\n\\nMr. Singh pointed out that traditional notions of war are being reshaped by emerging technologies and evolving strategic partnerships, with new perspectives, doctrines and concepts of operations emerging within the armed forces in keeping with the changing nature of threats and challenges. In this regards, he stressed that jointness cannot and should not be restricted to the military domain of individual countries. “Our interconnectedness is as much a blessing as it is a challenge. If our threats are transnational so should be our solutions.”\\n\\nMr. Singh observed that drones and swarm technologies are bringing fundamental changes in the ways and means of warfare. “India is aiming to become a drone hub of the world. Several initiatives have been taken in this regard. This would not only help the Indian economy but also significantly contribute to our Make in India and the Aatmanirbhar Bharat programme. We are already working to improve research and development through reliable certification mechanisms, and facilitate Indian Intellectual Property creation in this sector...,” he added.\\n\\nTalking of the successes in the ‘Make in India’ campaign, Mr. Singh said India is exporting defence items to over 100 nations, with the top three destinations for defence exports in 2023-24 being the U.S.A., France, and Armenia. “We hope to achieve the target of ₹50,000 crore worth of defence exports by 2029,” he added.\\n\\nThe Minister said the current geopolitical dynamics and cross-border issues make a collaborative approach to defence essential. The ambiguities of the cyberspace, AI and the vast potential of quantum and nanotechnologies further demand collaboration and sharing of knowledge, perspectives, information and strategies, if possible, he stressed.', 'summary': 'Minister Rajnath Singh referred to ‘Adaptive Defence’ as a strategic approach where a nation’s defence mechanisms continuously evolve to counter emerging threats effectively', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/if-our-threats-are-transnational-so-should-be-our-solutions-rajnath/article68859735.ece', 'image': 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/u16kc0/article68860256.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI11_12_2024_000051A.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 14:15:00', 'author': 'The Hindu Bureau', 'authors': ['The Hindu Bureau'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.3}, {'id': 264315992, 'title': 'Diwali 2024 sees 14% rise in online sales and 42% jump in traffic: Criteo report', 'text': 'As the Indian festive season unfolds, Criteo, the commerce media company, released insights into online retail sales, traffic, consumer behaviour, and preferences during Diwali 2024.

The most deliberate shoppers took over one and a half months to finalise their purchases, highlighting a careful selection process during the festive season.\\n\\nCompared to the same two-week period before Diwali in 2023, online retail sales saw an impressive 14% increase on average in 2024, underscoring Diwali as a crucial event for India’s retail landscape.

Gnanavelraja to deposit ₹20 crore, on or before Wednesday midnight, to the credit of the Official Assignee of the Madras High Court. \\n\\nA Division Bench of Justices G. Jayachandran and C.V. Karthikeyan ordered that the movie, also starring Bollywood actors Bobby Deol and Disha Patani, should not be released as scheduled on Thursday without depositing the money within the stipulated time. \\n\\nThe orders were passed on an application filed by the Official Assignee urging the court to modify an order passed by it on August 12 permitting the release of Kanguva on deposit of just ₹1 crore. The applicant insisted that the producer should be directed to deposit entire liability of ₹26.34 crore. \\n\\nThe dispute related to the litigation dates back to 2011 when Mr. Gnanavelraja had entered into an agreement with businessman Arjunlal Sunderdas (since dead) for co-producing a movie by investing ₹40 crore each. As per the agreement, the businessman had invested ₹12.85 crore before backing off from the project. \\n\\nSubsequently, in 2014, the High Court declared Arjunlal Sunderdas as an insolvent and directed the Official Assignee to take stock of all his assets and liabilities so that hundreds of people who had deposited money in his real estate and finance companies could be repaid their dues. \\n\\nWhile conducting an assessment as directed by the court, the Official Assignee found that Mr. Gnanavelraja had to repay ₹10.35 crore to the insolvent, and therefore, filed an application before the High Court in 2016 seeking a direction to him to repay the amount with 18% interest from 2013. \\n\\nThe Division Bench allowed the application in 2019 and directed the producer to repay the entire liability of ₹10.35 crore with interest to the credit of the Official Assignee. Though he took the order on appeal to the Supreme Court, the latter dismissed his appeal on September 2, 2024. \\n\\nIn the meantime, the Official Assignee had been filing applications after applications before the High Court for recovering the dues, before every release of a new film, but had succeeded in recovering only ₹3.93 crore including ₹1 crore recovered before the release of Vikram-starrer Thangalaan. \\n\\nThough Mr. Gnanavelraja attempted to dissociate himself from Studio Green Films Private Limited, which had produced Thangalaan as well as Kanguva, and claimed to have not produced any movie in the last two and a half years, the Division Bench refused to accept his claim. \\n\\n“The decree holder (Official Assignee) having waited for nearly six years after obtaining decree is unable to pay the creditors to the insolvent who are waiting for nearly 10 years after the insolvency petition was instituted. The leniency shown to the Judgement Debtor so far believing that he has bonafide intention to discharge the debt substantially, if not in full, appears to be a misplaced sympathy. Therefore, this court has no other alternative except to pass the inevitable order of restraining the second respondent to release the movie by name ‘Kanguva’ without discharging the decree,” the Bench wrote.', 'summary': 'Justices G.

It\\'s also an oddity in that it\\'s four matches long, rather than three or five.For all that, it\\'s been extremely competitive, and at 1-1 could be shaping up for a blockbuster second half. After sharing honours on the coast, South Africa and India now move to the pace, true bounce and high altitude of the Highveld with all to play for.Given that both sides are testing out young players and new combinations, neither team will read too much into how individuals have fared so far. But there are broad, team-level issues they may want to look into.South Africa have faced 16 overs from India\\'s two wristspinners, and scored 91 while losing 12 wickets. The format is different, but Ravi Bishnoi and, in particular, Varun Chakravarthy seem to be exerting the same sort of influence that Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal did on the ODI leg of India\\'s tour of this country in 2017-18, when they shared 35 wickets in five games.India\\'s issue is structural, and one that\\'s cropped up from time to time over recent years: their batting in the first two T20Is seemed to stop at No. 7. They only scored 40 runs in the last six overs of the first match, and failed to turn Sanju Samson\\'s storming century into a truly awe-inspiring total. In the second, they lost early wickets, and never recovered thanks in part to this lack of depth.How the two teams sort out or work around these issues could well determine how this series finishes.Form guideSouth Africa WLLWL (last five completed T20Is, most recent first)India LWWWWIn the spotlight - David Miller and Abhishek SharmaIn this series so far, David Miller has been out twice to Varun - the second off a peach that turned past his outside edge and bowled him for a golden duck - in 13 balls, while scoring 14 runs off them. Miller prides himself on his spin game, which he has transformed over the last three years, and will undoubtedly be working extra-hard on picking Varun\\'s variations and getting on top of him.He announced himself with an audacious 47-ball 100 against Zimbabwe in only his second appearance, but his eight other T20I innings have brought Abhishek Sharma only 70 runs, with only two of them going past the ten-ball mark. Abhishek\\'s no-holds-barred approach, which is exactly what earned him his international call-up, comes with the in-built risk of early failure, and getting the best out of him will require India\\'s team management to ensure they judge him on processes and not outcomes, helping him become a more rounded player while backing his attacking instincts.Lutho Sipamla has been brought in for the last two T20Is, and he has form behind him•Getty ImagesTeam newsLutho Sipamla has joined South Africa\\'s squad for the third and fourth T20Is, and the fast bowler comes into the series with form behind him. He picked up the Player-of-the-Match award for his four-wicket haul in the final of the CSA T20 Challenge in late October, and followed it up with another match-winning contribution for Lions against Titans, a first-innings four-wicket haul in the CSA 4-Day Series. If South Africa bring him into their XI, either Andile Simelane or the legspinner Nqaba Peter may have to make way.South Africa (possible): 1 Ryan Rickelton, 2 Reeza Hendricks, 3 Aiden Markram (capt), 4 Tristan Stubbs, 5 Heinrich Klaasen (wk), 6 David Miller, 7 Marco Jansen, 8 Andile Simelane/Lutho Sipamla, 9 Gerald Coetzee, 10 Keshav Maharaj, 11 Nqabayomzi PeterThere is no quick-fix for India\\'s batting depth issue within their squad, but they could try and mix things up nonetheless. Three players in their squad are still awaiting their first T20I caps: fast bowlers Vijaykumar Vyshak and Yash Dayal and the explosive lower-middle-order hitter Ramandeep Singh.India (possible): 1 Sanju Samson (wk), 2 Abhishek Sharma, 3 Suryakumar Yadav (capt), 4 Tilak Varma, 5 Hardik Pandya, 6 Rinku Singh, 7 Axar Patel, 8 Arshdeep Singh, 9 Ravi Bishnoi, 10 Avesh Khan, 11 Varun ChakravarthyPitch and conditionsCenturion hosted two incredibly high-scoring T20Is in the space of two days last year. First, South Africa clattered their way to 131 in a rain-shortened, 11-overs-a-side contest, only for West Indies to haul down their target with three balls to spare. Then the hosts exacted a spectacular revenge, with Quinton de Kock\\'s 44-ball 100 helping them haul down 259 in just 18.5 overs and set a new record for the highest T20I chase. Expect plenty of runs, then, though the steep bounce at the venue could also bring fast bowlers into play if there\\'s a little bit of help from the surface. A clear and pleasant day is expected.Stats and trivia\\n Of the six South African grounds that have hosted at least three T20Is since the start of the decade, Centurion has been the highest-scoring, with batting teams going at 10.90 per over and averaging 33.25 runs per wicket.\\n Miller (81) has the most catches by a non-wicketkeeper in all T20Is.\\n Varun already has eight wickets in this series, and has a great chance, with two matches remaining, of going past the Indian record of most wickets in a bilateral T20I series of nine, held jointly by R Ashwin and Bishnoi.\\n Since his debut in July 2022, no Full Member player has taken more wickets than Arshdeep Singh\\'s 89.\\nQuotes\"Everyone on the team hates losing. In the first game, we didn\\'t play at our best, if we can call it as it is. And then the second game, the whole focus was just to try and give us the best chance to win. In the second game, we were a lot more focused on winning those small battles because in T20 two or three overs is actually [significant], there\\'s a lot that can happen. So for us, it was just a focus point in terms of just trying to win those small battles. And I think we won most of the small battles, even though it was a low-scoring game.\"South Africa allrounder Marco Jansen\"I\\'ve had a really good bowling partner in Jassi bhai. He has helped me enormously in taking a lot of wickets by creating pressure from the other end. So a lot of credit goes to him as well. But the main thing is how well I can adapt to the conditions and the situations of the game, how I can attack the batsman early on and take some early wickets. And even at the death how I can outsmart them and bring the game back into our hands.India fast bowler Arshdeep Singh on Jasprit Bumrah\\'s role in his growth as an international cricketerKarthik Krishnaswamy is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo\\r\\n\\r\\nSource link', 'summary': 'Big picture &#8211; both teams have issues to address This series is a bit of an oddity, with two sides at below full strength, with a number of big names rested for more pressing engagements, facing off in a format that&#8217;s taken a bit of a back seat in terms of wider relevance, with no &#8230;', 'url': 'https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/sa-vs-ind-3rd-t20i-pace-and-bounce-of-the-highveld-adds-spice-to-high-octane-series/', 'image': 'https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/390618.6.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-12 13:51:16', 'author': 'Reporter', 'authors': ['Reporter'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'sports', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.148}, {'id': 264315382, 'title': 'Air India officially completes merger with Vistara, unifying under one brand', 'text': \"The Tata Group Tuesday said it has completed the merger of Air India and Vistara, creating a unified full-service airline under the Air India brand. Singapore Airlines (SIA), previously a 49% stakeholder in Vistara, now holds a 25.1% stake in the expanded Air India group, and will invest more capital in the entity.Campbell Wilson, managing director of Air India, said in the statement that the merger culminates the “consolidation and restructuring phase” of Air India Group’s transformation following Tata’s acquisition from the Indian government in January 2022.“Over the past two years, teams across the four airlines have worked closely together and with other stakeholders to ensure that the transition of people, assets, operations, and, most importantly, customers, was as seamless as possible,” he said.In a separate statement, Singapore Airlines emphasized its commitment to India’s aviation sector, highlighting its direct stake in the growing market. “This merger reinforces SIA’s multi-hub strategy and underscores its long-standing commitment to India”..The merged entity now operates over 5,600 weekly flights across 90 domestic and international destinations, using a fleet of 208 aircraft.

The airline now serves 103 domestic and 71 international routes, connecting over 100 destinations. The consolidated group will handle over 120,000 passengers daily, with extended connectivity to over 800 global destinations through 75 codeshare and interline agreements.More than 6,000 Vistara employees have joined Air India’s organization, alongside the consolidation of over 4,000 vendor contracts. Additionally, 4.5 million Club Vistara loyalty accounts have been transferred to the newly revamped Air India frequent flyer program, Maharaja Club, enhancing the airline’s customer loyalty offerings.Wilson explained the complexity of the merger, citing the transfer of 270,000 customer bookings and extensive collaboration between teams to streamline operations. The merger of Air India and Vistara completes the consolidation and restructuring phase of the Air India Group's post-privatization transformation journey and is thus a significant milestone, he added.As part of its operational restructuring, Vistara flights now operate under Air India’s ‘AI’ code, with four-digit numbers beginning with ‘2’ (e.g., UK 955 is now AI 2955). The unified brand aims to provide a seamless booking experience for customers while retaining some familiarity with former Vistara flight codes.Tata Group has invested significantly in the future of Air India as part of its five-year Vihaan.AI transformation plan. The group has committed to over 500 new aircraft and announced a $400 million interior retrofit program to upgrade legacy aircraft. Air India has also opened a 600,000-square-foot training facility with a capacity to train 2,000 employees per day, bolstering its workforce and operational readiness. Additionally, a 12-bay maintenance facility is under construction, expected to be operational by early 2026.SIA said that its stake in Air India represents a strategic commitment to growth in India’s aviation market, one of the world’s fastest-growing sectors. SIA and its partner Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting the growth and success of the Air India Group, which has a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments (full service, low-cost, international, and domestic), SIA said.The integrated entity’s first flights have already launched under the new Air India code. Flight AI2286 operated between Doha and Mumbai as the group’s inaugural international service, while AI2984 flew from Mumbai to Delhi, marking the first domestic route.
