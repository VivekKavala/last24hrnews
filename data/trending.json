        "text": "Independent Lok Sabha MP from Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir, Engineer Rashid surrendered at Tihar Jail on Monday after his interim bail in a terror-funding case currently being investigated by the NIA expired.The Patiala House Court in New Delhi has deferred the pronouncement of order on regular bail for him till November 19 this year. On October 14, the court extended his interim bail on the health grounds of his ailing father and directed him to surrender to Tihar on October 28. The engineer initially got interim bail for campaigning in the recently held Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections.Polls for the 90-member Jammu and Kashmir Assembly were conducted in three phases from September 18 to October 1, with results announced on October 8, revealing a decisive victory for the National Conference-Congress alliance, which secured 48 seats.In 2005, Engineer Rashid was arrested by the Special Operations Group (SOG) in Srinagar for allegedly supporting militants and was held for three months and 17 days. He faced charges of anti-national activities and was incarcerated in Cargo, Humhama, and Raj Bagh prisons. However, the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Srinagar later dropped all charges against him on humanitarian grounds. In August 2019, Rashid was again arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). During his incarceration, he filed his nomination for the 2024 parliamentary elections from jail and won by a margin of 204,000 votes, defeating former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah",

There is no room for Australia\u2019s Test stars as they will continue their preparation for the crucial five-match Test series against India that starts on November 22, meaning the Aussies will need to find a new skipper for the Pakistan series.Fast bowling trio Xavier Bartlett, Nathan Ellis and Spencer Johnson all return to the squad after recovering from injury, with white-ball regulars Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa and Josh Inglis also named for the series that commences in Brisbane on November 14, as per ICC. Regular white-ball skipper Mitch Marsh and Test captain Pat Cummins will be in Perth ahead of the opening Test against India, leaving selectors with the chance to appoint a new player to lead the side for the first time against Pakistan.Selection Chair George Bailey is looking forward to seeing what the group can produce in the absence of many of their first-choice player away on Test duties.\u201cThis group of players have all represented Australia in T20 cricket, so we look forward to them continuing to enhance their international experience throughout this series. We are excited by the mix of experience combined with those closer to the start of their international journeys,\u201d Bailey said as quoted by ICC. \u201cIt is particularly encouraging to have Xavier, Spencer and Nathan back in the national setup. It\u2019s another opportunity for them to continue to show their ability on the international stage, as they have done in the past,\u201d he added.
