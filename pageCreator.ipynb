In 2024, Pooran was just behind Rahul on the run-charts and he also was the interim captain-cum-wicketkeeper during the first half after Rahul sat out due to a niggle.Considered one of the best power-hitters in the game, Pooran, 29, was bought by LSG ahead of the 2024 season for INR 16 crore (USD 1.927 approx). Pooran\\'s price tag has continued to soar since his maiden IPL season in 2017 when Mumbai Indians bought him for INR 30 lakhs. Two years later, Punjab Kings bought him for INR 4.2 crore ($575,000 approx). At the 2022 mega auction, Sunrisers Hyderabad paid INR 10.75 crore ($1.433 million approx then) before releasing him a season later. Surprisingly, SRH fiercely bid for Pooran at that auction, but he was signed by LSG eventually.Mayank picked up two Player-of-the-Match awards in his first two IPL matches clocking 150-plus kph deliveries with ease in 2024. While a side strain restricted him to play just four matches, the national selectors quickly added him to the list of quicks handed fast-bowling contracts. Bought by LSG for INR 20 lakhs in the 2024 auction, Mayank has only played seven matches, all T20s: four in the IPL followed by his international debut in the T20 series against Bangladesh recently. Mayank is currently at the BCCI\\'s newly opened Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru.Bishnoi was one of the three players LSG picked ahead of the mega auction before IPL 2022 for INR 4 crore, as he was then an uncapped player. In 2022, when LSG made the playoffs, Bishnoi picked up 13 wickets at 8.44. A year later, now an international, Bishnoi was 13th on the list of leading wicket-takers, with 16 wickets at 7.74 and played a role in LSG reaching the playoffs once again. Last season, though, he picked up only 10 wickets in 14 matches at 8.77.Badoni and Mohsin, both uncapped and bought for INR 20 lakhs each in the 2022 auction, have been integral to LSG\\'s success. An aggressive middle-order batter, Badoni\\'s best season came in 2023 when he made 238 runs at a strike rate of 138 in 12 innings. He recently also played in the Emerging Series for India A.Mohsin, the 6\\'3\" left-arm fast bowler from Uttar Pradesh, impressed straightaway in his maiden IPL season in 2022. He picked up 14 wickets at a sub-6 economy in just nine matches which made him one of the potential candidates for the T20 World Cup later that year. He was not considered due to a career-threatening injury where he nearly lost an arm.

In case the sum paid exceeds that, then a higher amount will be deducted from Rs 120 crore purse of each franchise that they have been given to build their squads. It is understood the top retention will be Pooran, followed by Mayank and Bishnoi. In the 2024 IPL, with 499 runs in 14 matches and three fifties, the left-hander was only behind KL (520 runs in 14 matches with four fifties) in run-scoring charts and has dominated T20 cricket this year, with 2,251 runs in 68 matches with a century and 15 fifties at a strike rate of 160.90.

In 2024, Pooran was just behind Rahul on the run-charts and he also was the interim captain-cum-wicketkeeper during the first half after Rahul sat out due to a niggle.Considered one of the best power-hitters in the game, Pooran, 29, was bought by LSG ahead of the 2024 season for INR 16 crore (USD 1.927 approx). Pooran\\'s price tag has continued to soar since his maiden IPL season in 2017 when Mumbai Indians bought him for INR 30 lakhs. Two years later, Punjab Kings bought him for INR 4.2 crore ($575,000 approx). At the 2022 mega auction, Sunrisers Hyderabad paid INR 10.75 crore ($1.433 million approx then) before releasing him a season later. Surprisingly, SRH fiercely bid for Pooran at that auction, but he was signed by LSG eventually.Mayank picked up two Player-of-the-Match awards in his first two IPL matches clocking 150-plus kph deliveries with ease in 2024. While a side strain restricted him to play just four matches, the national selectors quickly added him to the list of quicks handed fast-bowling contracts. Bought by LSG for INR 20 lakhs in the 2024 auction, Mayank has only played seven matches, all T20s: four in the IPL followed by his international debut in the T20 series against Bangladesh recently. Mayank is currently at the BCCI\\'s newly opened Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru.Bishnoi was one of the three players LSG picked ahead of the mega auction before IPL 2022 for INR 4 crore, as he was then an uncapped player. In 2022, when LSG made the playoffs, Bishnoi picked up 13 wickets at 8.44. A year later, now an international, Bishnoi was 13th on the list of leading wicket-takers, with 16 wickets at 7.74 and played a role in LSG reaching the playoffs once again. Last season, though, he picked up only 10 wickets in 14 matches at 8.77.Badoni and Mohsin, both uncapped and bought for INR 20 lakhs each in the 2022 auction, have been integral to LSG\\'s success. An aggressive middle-order batter, Badoni\\'s best season came in 2023 when he made 238 runs at a strike rate of 138 in 12 innings. He recently also played in the Emerging Series for India A.Mohsin, the 6\\'3\" left-arm fast bowler from Uttar Pradesh, impressed straightaway in his maiden IPL season in 2022. He picked up 14 wickets at a sub-6 economy in just nine matches which made him one of the potential candidates for the T20 World Cup later that year. He was not considered due to a career-threatening injury where he nearly lost an arm.

The exact amount of money for which these five stars have been signed for is not known yet, but based on retention slabs of the IPL, Rs 51 crores will be deducted from LSG’s purse. In case the sum paid exceeds that, then a higher amount will be deducted from Rs 120 crore purse of each franchise that they have been given to build their squads. It is understood the top retention will be Pooran, followed by Mayank and Bishnoi. In the 2024 IPL, with 499 runs in 14 matches and three fifties, the left-hander was only behind KL (520 runs in 14 matches with four fifties) in run-scoring charts and has dominated T20 cricket this year, with 2,251 runs in 68 matches with a century and 15 fifties at a strike rate of 160.90. He was also the interim captain and wicketkeeper during the first half when KL missed out due to injury. Pooran is considered as one of the best hitters in the game and the 29-year-old was brought by LSG in the 2023 season for Rs 16 crore. Mayank picked up two Player of the Match awards in his first IPL, which was an injury-cut affair. He still impressed with seven wickets in four matches, clocking 150 kmph consistently. His performances saw him being handed over a fast bowling contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and made his international debut against Bangladesh recently. He was brought by LSG for Rs 20 lakhs in the 2024 season. Bishnoi was one of three players picked by LSG ahead of IPL 2022 for Rs 4 crores as an uncapped player.

Even though it is said that it is increasing due to Diwali, but there are a lot of reasons for it, it would be wrong to attribute it to just Diwali. There should be a proper system to tackle the issue of pollution. There are a lot of engineering colleges here, some way we should use new techniques and innovation, the government should control it and take some steps instead of politicising it,” he told ANI.He further compared the air quality between greater Noida and Delhi, saying that he feels it is worse in the national capital. “Now as a student I travel, so if I compare to greater Noida and Delhi, I think the air quality here is worse,” he added.Another person, Sukhram said that he has had trouble breathing and been sick due to pollution for the past few days, which is forcing him to return to his village. “There is a lot of pollution here in Delhi, for the last 7 days I have been sick.

However, they increased 2 per cent on a month-on-month basis. In the first half of the FY2025, prices are down by 10 per cent.

The shadow economy siphons off vital resources from legitimate businesses and fuels anti-social elements which threatens to derail the entire growth trajectory of countries. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the far-reaching impact of illicit trade, it is important to view it through the lens of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). An alarming fact is that every SDG is severely impacted by illicit trade. Let’s delve further into the impact of illicit trade on societal, economic, and environmental goals.The financial toll As per the FICCI report, titled 'Illicit Markets: A Threat to Our National Interests' by FICCI's Committee Against Smuggling and Counterfeiting Activities Destroying the Economy (CASCADE), the Central government is estimated to have lost as much as Rs 58,521 crore in taxes in 2019-20 due to illicit trade in goods in key industries- FMCG, mobile phone, tobacco products, and alcohol - with the size of illicit markets in these industries at a little over Rs 2.60 lakh crore for the year 2019-20. Tobacco products and alcoholic beverages- two highly regulated industries - account for nearly 49% of the overall tax loss in these industries.The illicit cigarette trade is a huge challenge in India. According to Euromonitor’s 2023 report, illicit cigarette volumes in India reached 30.2 billion sticks in 2022, trailing only behind China and Brazil. Unfortunately, this is not just an India problem, but more of a cross-border problem. The loss of taxes to the exchequer results in starving the nation of resources as the money could have been otherwise spent on infrastructure and funding other vital public initiatives. The silent epidemicZooming in on the alcohol sector, about 40% of the Indian market, almost close to half of the consumption of alcohol in India is illicit. Recently, there was news pertaining to deaths in Tamil Nadu due to consumption of illicit alcohol. What has been noticed is that many individuals are caught unaware as they cannot differentiate between legitimate and illicit products, however, there are others who choose illicit products as they are available at a cheaper price. It is therefore important to raise awareness of the harmful effects of using sub-standard products. Hidden threat to ecology Increasingly, we are witnessing the huge impact of illicit trade on the environment - be it air, water, or soil. There are unsustainable practices right from manufacturing to transportation, to the way the products and waste created are being disposed of. Let’s look at the example of illicit pesticides used within India. A few years ago, there were incidences of counterfeit pesticides being used in Punjab which led to farmers losing their crops and irreversible damage to the soil, resulting in huge economic loss.Counterfeiting also expands to other crimes such as wildlife. Chennai airport frequently witnesses large quantities of wildlife, especially exotic animals such as snakes, tortoises, or pangolins for their medical value. The authorities are connecting this to organized crime, money laundering, and other such criminal activities. Illicit trade is a challenge that needs to be addressed on a war footing as it is crucial for maintaining economic stability, public health, and achieving sustainable goals. Necessary to suppressing this threat is the adoption of regulation that supports enforcement of non-compliant products at the origin and fostering transnational co-operation throughout the illicit supply chain.The article is authored by Suriya Padmanaabhan, Director of Programs, Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT).\", 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/environment/illicit-trade-compromising-attainment-of-sustainable-development-goals-worldwide-1831079', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/10/18/1853524-untitleddesign-2024-10-18t174553936.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 12:18:52', 'author': 'DC Correspondent', 'authors': ['DC Correspondent'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.061}, {'id': 260190996, 'title': 'WBA INDIA Congress-2024 Set to Unlock India’s Biogas Potential', 'text': 'Hyderabad: The World Biogas Association (WBA) announced that its World Biogas Association INDIA Congress 2024, would be conducted from October 23 to 24 at Le Méridien, New Delhi.

With India solidifying its role in the global energy landscape, the World Biogas Association INDIA Congress 2024 will be critical in advancing Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s goal of commissioning 5,000 large-scale compressed biogas (CBG) plants by 2030. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)\\'s Renewables 24 report, India\\'s CBG market is set to grow by 88 per cent by 2030 under current policies, with the potential to exceed 150 per cent with stronger policy support. The focus will be on decarbonizing energy, reducing air and water pollution, fulfilling climate commitments, and enhancing energy security by lowering reliance on imported LNG. This Congress will bring together key government officials, industry leaders, and international experts to explore policies, technological innovations, and investment opportunities that will drive growth in the biogas sector. The World Biogas Association INDIA Congress 2024 will feature prominent speakers and dignitaries, reflecting biogas\\'s critical role in India\\'s energy and environmental strategy. Key attendees include Tarun Kapoor, Advisor, PMO; Shri Amitabh Kant, G20 Sherpa of India and Former CEO, Government of India and the former Chief Executive of the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog); Pankaj Jain, IAS, Secretary of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas; and P.K.

Over the past year, WBA has been actively working on its flagship #MakingBiogasHappen Programme, which includes the development of a Global Biogas Regulatory Framework and an International Anaerobic Digestion Certification Scheme (ADCS). These initiatives aim to standardize regulations and certification practices globally, promoting significant growth within the biogas sector. Charlotte Morton OBE, Chief Executive of the World Biogas Association, expressed her excitement about the event, stating, \"The 2nd World Biogas Association INDIA Congress comes at a pivotal time for India\\'s biogas industry. With the market projected to grow from USD 1.47 billion in 2022 to USD 2.25 billion by 2029, we’re witnessing tremendous opportunities. This Congress will play a crucial role in bringing together key stakeholders to accelerate this growth and unlock the full potential of biogas in India’s sustainable energy future.\" The Congress will provide a platform for policymakers, business leaders, and investors to explore the best ways to deploy anaerobic digestion and biogas technologies in India as part of the broader green energy transition.

Kohli, who batted at No. 3 for the second time in this Test, turned the tables after being dismissed for a duck in the first innings on October 17.Prior to this match, Kohli had last batted at No. 3 in 2016 and had a modest average of 19.40 in that position. However, he showcased his class in the second innings, notching up his first Test half-century since December 2023. Alongside Sarfaraz Khan, Kohli forged a crucial partnership of 136 runs that revived India’s innings.Needing 53 runs to surpass the 9,000-run mark, Kohli reached his half-century off 70 balls, featuring five boundaries and a majestic six off Ajaz Patel. He then carefully accumulated the additional three runs needed to reach the milestone, taking a further nine balls.According to Wisden, Kohli became the 18th player to score 9,000 runs in Test cricket and joined Joe Root and Steve Smith as the only active players in this exclusive club. He also became the fourth Indian to achieve this feat, following in the footsteps of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and Sunil Gavaskar.In terms of innings taken to reach 9,000 runs, Kohli’s 197 innings make him the sixth-slowest to achieve the milestone. The record for the slowest is jointly held by Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Steve Waugh, who both took 216 innings. Kumar Sangakkara holds the record for the fastest to 9,000 runs, achieving it in just 172 innings, followed by Smith and Dravid. Kohli is the slowest among the Indian players in this group, with Dravid taking 174 innings, Tendulkar 179, and Gavaskar 192.Looking ahead, Kohli’s next target on the all-time run-scoring list is Graeme Smith, who is currently over 200 runs ahead as per Wisden. Within the Indian context, Kohli needs another 1,100 runs to surpass Gavaskar for third place on India’s all-time run-scorers list. With two more Tests against New Zealand and a five-Test series in Australia in December, Kohli is well-positioned to climb higher in the rankings by the end of the year.

They are exposed. They are mercenaries for something which is antithetical to human rights. Look at the kind of barbarity, torture, and traumatised experiences of boys, girls, and women.

I call upon everyone in the country to seriously reflect, think if you were one of those,” Dhankhar said. He further said that evidence, episode after episode, is piling up that the deep state is engaging in lawfare against rising powers.“Somehow, it seems they are unable to digest the rise of civilisational states in the international system who assert their own identity. Let me reflect a little away from the issue. Does the United Nations Security Council reflect a sense of human rights when it keeps one-sixth of humanity away from it? There has to be an auditing of its performance. The discourse of human rights is calibrated for political projects. Get a project, get money, get some people employed. You are applauded only when you talk negatively about this country. I know of an institution in the world that claims to be at its peak. They call them Ivy League institutions. A book has been written, Snakes in the Ganges over it,” he said.Dhankhar further pointed out the importance of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and said that the act is an affirmative step to give citizenship to those who are being hunted, and persecuted and this is not limited to one religion, many religions.“Domestically, we should be wary of elements that use human rights to advance their political agenda. I am addressing the community of politicians. Citizen Amendment Act–how can this be an issue? The act does not deprive any citizen of this country of his or her citizenship. The act does not handicap any person on the globe to take recourse to take citizenship of this country. The act is an affirmative step to give citizenship to those who are being hunted, and persecuted and this is not limited to one religion, many religions. Even such a soothing aspect is to be challenged. Well, we have a situation deep state takes shape only in this way. Therefore, nip it ruthlessly in the bud when it is seen,” he said. “Look at the prime example I indicated, there couldn’t be a better gesture of social magnanimity collectively expressed by an act of parliament in CAA. Stateless refugees were to flee from India under severe repression for committing the “sin” of choosing to follow their conscience from our neighbourhood. They had the option to be here, they committed the “sin” of conscience when they were suffering day in and day out and this is being opposed. This balm is a soothing medicine that is being opposed on the plank of human rights. How sharper the serpent’s tooth could it be?” Dhankhar said. The Vice President said that always remember, human rights preservation, blossoming and sustainability are in our hands.“It is our collective and societal duty that we must unfailingly perform,” he said.

It also argues strongly for replacing the poverty-based vulnerability measure with a comprehensive disaster vulnerability index.\\n\\nThe study noted that, if the revised parameters are in place, high-risk States such as Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh would “justifiably receive more funding”. In Kerala’s case, the SDRF allocation would increase from ₹1,389.60 crore to ₹2,321.80 crore.\\n\\nThe Centre contributes 75% of the SDRF allocation in general category States/UTs and 90% in special category States. For determining the SDRF share, the 15th Finance Commission (2021-22 to 2025-26) adopted a methodology based on population, geographical area, average past expenditure and the Disaster Risk Index (DRI) which uses the probability of hazards (score of 70) and vulnerability (score of 30) to arrive at a composite score. The below poverty line (BPL) population is used as a basic measure to assess vulnerability.\\n\\nThe GIFT study argues that this system fails to accurately reflect a given State’s vulnerability to disasters. While the population criterion, which employs the 2011 census, penalises States with successful population control, ‘geographical area’ does not adequately reflect vulnerability.\\n\\nA more practical approach to ecological fiscal transfers would be to replace them with population density and geographical sub divisions, the study said. “Natural disasters impact specific geographical divisions like hilly regions, wetlands, and coastal areas more than others. Instead of simply considering the area, the allocation criteria need to consider the proportion of wetlands, hilly regions and the length of coastal lines,” it said.\\n\\nThe study also recommends replacing the poverty-based vulnerability with a comprehensive vulnerability index provided by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The change shifts the focus from poverty vulnerability to a more holistic assessment of disaster vulnerability, the study said.\\n\\nFurther, the reliance on ‘past expenditure’ under the current methodology serves to perpetuate inequalities among States. “This predominant focus on historical expenditure means that states with higher past expenditures receive more funds, regardless of their current risk and vulnerability to natural disasters.” the study said.\\n\\nThe study estimates that, if the suggested revisions were to be adopted, the total SDRF allocation would increase from ₹1,28,122.40 crore to ₹1,75,089.97 crore. Kerala’s SDRF allocation under the 15th Finance Commission is ₹1,852.80 crore, inclusive of a Central share of ₹1,389.60 crore. Under the revised parameters, they would, respectively, increase to ₹2,901.88 crore and ₹2,321.50 crore.\\n\\n“By addressing the shortcomings of the current system, the States may receive funds proportionate to their actual disaster risks and vulnerabilities. The 16th Finance Commission needs to consider these recommendations to strengthen India’s disaster preparedness and response capabilities in the face of growing climate-related challenges,” the study notes.\\n\\nIt was the second Finance Commission that introduced disaster risk financing through Finance Commission grants. It was later replaced with the Calamity Relief Fund and the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF). The Disaster Management Act, 2005, mandated the creation of the SDRF and the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).', 'summary': 'The present approach leaves ‘high-risk’ States such as Kerala at a disadvantage, study says, recommends revised parameters including population density and specific geographical features for fund allocation', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/its-time-to-revisit-criteria-governing-disaster-fund-allocations-says-new-study-by-gulati-institute-of-finance-and-taxation/article68768865.ece', 'image': 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 13:33:46', 'author': 'Gulati Institute', 'authors': ['Gulati Institute'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.44}, {'id': 260202902, 'title': 'Revenue, DTCP officials begin to probe complaints of encroachments in Panjapur', 'text': 'Officials of the Directorate of Town and Country Plan (DTCP) and the Revenue Department have begun a study on the rapid growth in new layouts and the potential threat of encroaching government lands along the Tiruchi-Madurai highway in the wake of construction of the integrated bus terminus (IBT) at Panjapur. \\n\\nSince the announcement of the construction of IBT in 2021, the land prices at Panjapur began to increase.

Wu also lamented the threats to her safety and that of others resulting from her protest, reported Taiwan News.Later that day, the full board rejected the subcommittee’s recommendation and issued a formal disciplinary response. The probation would last from May 17-20, according to an email sent to Wu. In addition to Wu, two other students who had protested the ambassador’s remarks were also placed on probation, including Tsering Yangchen, the co-president of Boston’s Students for a Free Tibet chapter, while the identity of the other student has not been publicised.Zou was later identified as a master’s candidate at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education and an officer in the university’s branch of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, which reportedly has ties to the CCP. Zou had also been one of the organisers of Xie’s speech. Harvard notified Zou via email that he had breached the university’s policy on physical violence. However, the Harvard Graduate School of Education did not impose any sanctions on him, partly due to the online backlash Zou had received.Kevin Boehm, the assistant dean for student affairs at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, sent a letter about Zou on May 8 to Martin West, the school’s Academic Dean, Taiwan News reported.Boehm cited Zou’s claim that he did not use excessive force and that he was the victim of doxxing (having one’s residential information and personal identity unwillingly revealed) on social media following the incident. On May 10, West sent an email to Boehm saying that instead of referring Zou for discipline, the school had written a letter of censure.West later took a conciliatory tone in an email sent to Zou on May 22, saying, “I understand that your intentions were to prevent the event from being further disrupted.” West also apologised for the online response to Zou’s actions, stating, “I also acknowledge that you and your family have experienced significant harm as a result of the event, which I deeply regret.”Harvard’s official correspondence did not mention that Zou’s actions against Wu during the speech had been reported to the Massachusetts State Police on April 20 as assault and battery.', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/harvard-disciplines-taiwanese-american-student-for-disrupting-chinese-ambassadors-speech/', 'image': 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 12:34:09', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.25}, {'id': 260195220, 'title': '“Hindi not language of imposition,”say TN Governor RN Ravi, CM Stalin criticises him', 'text': 'Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi on Friday addressed the issue of the language acceptance and noted that there are forces, both within and outside India, aiming to hinder the country’s growth, following the strong opposition from the Tamil Nadu government over the celebration of the Hindi Month valedictory function along with the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Chennai Doordarshan.Ravi, acknowledged the changing perception of the Hindi language in Tamil Nadu and said that initially it met resistance but he later found that many students in the state have become proficient in Hindi. He emphasised that Hindi should not be viewed as an imposition but as a language to be celebrated alongside other languages.“First, when I came here, Hindi was not a welcome language in Tamil Nadu but when I started meeting students, I was happily surprised that their Hindi was better than mine. There is a greater acceptance of Hindi among people of Tamil Nadu… Hindi is not a language of imposition of language in Tamil Nadu. Each language is to be celebrated. Each language is for all of us to be proud of,” the governor said.“There are entities from India inside and outside to make India not grow… Today India is awake with confidence. We are among the top three start-ups in the world. We have gone the moon and way beyond. The world is acknowledging,” he added.The governor expressed concern over a perceived attempt to isolate Tamil Nadu from the rest of India, describing such efforts as a “toxic and separatist policy” and saying that this cannot weaken the nation. He said the country was moving forward with PM Modi and that India is rising in its way but there are forces trying to weaken India, taking us back to where it drives us from inside and outside.He pointed out that while 27 states in India have embraced a three-language formula, Tamil Nadu has been resistant to the inclusion of other languages, which he believes hampers communication and unity among states. He remarked that this linguistic isolation creates challenges for youth in Tamil Nadu, making it difficult for them to connect with peers in neighbouring states like Karnataka.“There is a consistent attempt to isolate Tamil Nadu from India… A toxic and separatist policy cannot weaken the Bharat. Today, when our country is moving forward with PM Modi… India is rising, and at the same time there are forces trying to weaken India and take us back where it drives from inside and outside,” Ravi said.“We have 28 states in this country. Where 27 states have three language formulas. Tamil Nadu is the only state that does not allow even other languages. they want to break the communication with other states of India. Their attitude today is that our youth find it difficult to go to Karnataka, etc,” he added.Discussing the role of Doordharshan, Ravi emphasised the importance of accurate information dissemination and criticised the narrative created over the past 50 years over toxic and separatist policy. He asserted that DD prioritised national interest in its programming.“As far as DD is concerned, a lot of toxicity was made in the last 50 years to the people of our country. DD worked on it…There is a great degree of ignorance among our people… DD is nation first… and should give correct information. Most of the channels are compromised here. It’s DD should make correct information to people,” he said.Following this, the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin slammed the Governor and questioned if he was an “Aryan.”“Governor? Are you an Aryan? Removing the word Dravidian and chanting Tamil Thai greetings is against the law of Tamil Nadu! A person who does not act according to the law and acts according to his will is not fit to hold that office. In the guise of celebrating India, the governor is insulting the unity of the country and the people of different races living in this land,” Stalin said.He also called for the recall of the governor for “deliberately insulting” the people of Tamil Nadu.“Will the governor who suffers from Dravidian allergy ask them to leave out Dravidian in the national anthem?

OKRs thus present a refined form of management system wherein the goals and performance of an organization are optimized at every level to ensure fast growth. With his unique approach to OKR, Suresh Mansharmani has not only streamlined the internal processes of SMEs but also enhanced employee engagement and transparency. The best part of OKR's strategy is that it brings flexibility and preparedness for unforeseen crises, which ensures sustainability and autonomy across departments. Today, MSMEs are facing a huge crisis due to financial crunch and are struggling to survive. In such times, the idea of growing takes a back seat as they are just trying to stay afloat in the market competition. Mr. Mansharmani has encountered many such SMEs and helped them out of this trap using his OKR framework which he says is the best strategy for MSMEs in India given the unique challenges that this market poses. OKR is a data-driven model that is able to ensure the best utilization of resources, distribution of responsibilities, and development of self-organization through a goal-setting system. Establishing this system requires discipline and a deep understanding of employee potential and needs. Suresh Mansharmani shares insights into setting up the perfect system MSMEs can begin by Defining about 3 or 5 key objectives that it wish to achieve in a frame of 90 days. Why 90? Because short-term goals are the key to achieving something big. The 90-day cycle allows flexibility and continuity in tracking progress. It ensures that the organization can align its functioning with all the changes that are happening in the market. Not more than 5 Objectives must be defined, to ensure realistic goal setting. The next step is to define how the performance shall be measured after 90 days. This is where most companies falter. It's easy to set goals, but how to come up with a quantifiable metric to measure the same? This is because at times goals are highly qualitative or have several dimensions to them. This is different from the regular KPI setting. Suresh Mansharmani is celebrated as the God of OKR precisely because of his ability to ensure measurable results. OKR, as we see it, is not another objective-focused system or framework of management. Suresh Mansharmani sheds light on how the system involves a systematic breakup of the organization’s structure and identifying the key areas of working. One can go for one department at a time or for all departments depending upon its existing resources and needs, which makes the framework applicable by MSMEs who often are tight on resources, both human and financial. The system not only benefits the top management but ensures employee well-being too and brings teamwork. Suresh Mansharmani emphasizes the key role of employees' emotional well-being and their personal development in ensuring the success of the organization. OKR leaves scope for redefining goals and objectives while ensuring that the employees know their purpose. The management can convey what is expected from them and the whole team works in sync to achieve the common goals- breeding cooperation instead of competition. The key is not just focusing on achieving the goals by hook or crook, but working towards a common goal and improving in the process. Suresh Mansharmani says that the OKR strategy works by ensuring that employees and motivated and when goals are not met, their motivation will allow them to study the gaps on their own and rework a more efficient strategy to achieve the goal. Till date, Suresh Mansharmani has helped over 5000 MSMEs and large corporations to implement OKRs. As the only Global OKR coach in India, and the founder of India’s fastest-growing community of MSMEs, the Tajurba network, he is on a mission to help 500 SMEs in India to scale and launch their IPOs. A certified Gallup strengths coach-time, four-time TEDx speaker, he has had his company listed at the Bombay Stock Exchange and the IPO was oversubscribed 300 times back in 1996 followed by a Presidential Award.

Based on various sources, the IVF market in the country is expected to increase and reach 3.7 billion by 2030 from 793 million in 2020 in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nLancet fertility rate projections for India:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFertility rate data: (Source: National Family Health Survey-5)\\r\\n\\r\\n• National Average: 1.9 to 2.0 children per woman\\r\\n\\r\\n• Delhi - 1.6\\r\\n\\r\\n• Telangana - 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\n• Andhra Pradesh - 1.7\\r\\n\\r\\n• Gujarat - 1.9\\r\\n\\r\\n• Karnataka - 1.7\\r\\n\\r\\n• Kerala - 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\n• Tamil Nadu - 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nSome important points:\\r\\n\\r\\n• Population will remain stable if TFR of 2.1 children per woman is maintained\\r\\n\\r\\n• In India, on an average, 2.25 lakh IVF cycles are taken-up every year\\r\\n\\r\\n• drop in fertility rates leading to mushrooming of IVF centres even in tier-II cities\\r\\n\\r\\n• Despite drop in fertility rates, population of India by 2050 will be 1.6 billion\\r\\n\\r\\n• Researchers warn States must plant for emerging threats due to drop in fertility rates\\r\\n\\r\\nChange in fertility rates over the years: (South India)\\r\\n\\r\\n• Andhra Pradesh:\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-1 (1992-93): 2.6\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-2 (1998-99): 2.3\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-3 (2005-06): 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-4 (2015-16) 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-5 (1.7)\\r\\n\\r\\n• Telangana:\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-4 (2015-16) 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-5 (1.7)\\r\\n\\r\\n• Tamil Nadu:\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-1 (1992-93): 2.5\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-2 (1998-99): 2.2\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-3 (2005-06): 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-4 (2015-16) 1.7\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-5 (1.8)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-1 (1992-93): 2.0\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-2 (1998-99): 2.0\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-3 (2005-06): 1.9\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-4 (2015-16) 1.6\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-5 (1.8)\\r\\n\\r\\n• Karnataka:\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-1 (1992-93): 2.9\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-2 (1998-99): 2.1\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-3 (2005-06): 2.1\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-4 (2015-16) 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nNFHS-5 (1.7)\\r\\n\\r\\nFactors influencing fertility rates: Obesity, stress, smoking, environmental pollution, promotion of smaller families, success of family planning, reduction of IMR, or improved child survival, urbanization, women employment, delaying childbearing age, choosing fewer children.', 'summary': 'The dramatic decline of fertility rates in the State is a clear indication of the challenges, including dwindling young workforce and the economic burden due to healthcare costs and other social security systems due to an aging population, which the state has to focus proactively.', 'url': 'https://telanganatoday.com/telangana-witnesses-sharp-decline-in-fertility-rates', 'image': 'https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fertility.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 13:31:18', 'author': 'M.

The Chief Minister went further, stating that Savarkar was among the accused in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, though acquitted due to lack of evidence.

Mahato\\'s letter raises alarm over the state\\'s approach to hiring civic volunteers instead of regular police personnel, a practice he alleged is detrimental to both public safety and employment opportunities for young aspirants.In his letter, Mahato said that the ongoing recruitment of civic volunteers — coupled with the suspension of permanent police hiring —has dire consequences for the security landscape of West Bengal. \"The West Bengal government, under Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, has been persistently hiring civic volunteers on a contractual basis, thereby undermining the regular police recruitment process. The Supreme Court has recently voiced serious concerns regarding this matter in the RG Kar Hospital case, urging the state government to disclose its recruitment procedures for civic volunteers,\" the letter read. Mahato also pointed out the court\\'s apprehension about delegating law enforcement responsibilities to people who may be politically affiliated with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).He further noted that the Calcutta High Court had previously criticised the West Bengal government\\'s reliance on civic volunteers instead of enlisting permanent police officers. The court pointed out that many of these volunteers lack the necessary training and accountability, resulting in significant lapses in law and order. \"One civic volunteer was even implicated as the prime suspect in the heinous rape and murder case at RG Kar Hospital, bringing to the forefront the alarming ramifications of this recruitment strategy,\" Mahato added.The MP expressed concerns that the trend of contracting civic volunteers has fostered an ineffective police force more beholden to political interests than to the rule of law. \"These volunteers, often under-trained and underpaid, are particularly susceptible to corruption and manipulation. The Supreme Court has echoed grave concerns about the political patronage afforded to these individuals, calling for an exhaustive review of the system,\" he wrote, warning that this practice erodes the integrity of law enforcement and creates a parallel system that undermines the state\\'s governance.To combat these issues, Mahato urged a thorough investigation into the recruitment of civic volunteers to curb political manipulation, while advocating for a rigorous oversight of the state government\\'s submissions in ongoing Supreme Court hearings regarding these individuals.The BJP leader also emphasised the necessity of promoting permanent police recruitment based on merit to protect the aspirations of young citizens. He insisted that the West Bengal government must ensure fair integration of Agniveers into the police force and safeguard against the misuse of the OBC quota for political gain.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Oct 18, 2024ALSO READ | No sign of sex assault: Police sources after woman’s burnt body found in BengalALSO READ | Supreme Court grants ED one week to submit reply on Partha Chatterjee\\'s bail pleaMust Watch', 'summary': \"BJP MP writes to Amit Shah over 'flawed' civic volunteer recruitment in Bengal\", 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bengal-civic-volunteer-recruitment-bjp-mp-jyotirmoy-singh-mahato-letter-amit-shah-2619366-2024-10-18', 'image': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202410/bengal-bjp-mp-writes-to-amit-shah-over-flawed-civic-volunteer-recruitment-183135218-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=rh0LBS74iNijDezN_G_kX51wG0GbPigE?size=1280:720', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 16:20:13', 'author': 'Suryagni Roy', 'authors': ['Suryagni Roy'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.121}, {'id': 260199364, 'title': 'CPM removes PP Divya as Kannur district panchayat president amid probe', 'text': 'The CPI(M) has officially removed PP Divya from her role as Kannur district panchayat president.

He was eliminated just one year after he commanded his terrorist-subjects to invade Israel and murder, rape, torture, burn people alive and kidnap Israelis. The damage this Hamas invasion into Israel caused to Israel’s national self-esteem, national pride, to individual people and property could not be repaired other than by all-out retaliation and total destruction of Hamas.\\n\\nThe sequence of events that led to the elimination of Sinwar was set out by Israel military sources as follows:\\n\\nOn Wednesday, October 16, 2024, an IDF infantry brigade was in Tel Sultan, in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. They were about to detonate a bomb that had not exploded. As the IDF soldiers were getting ready to defuse the bomb, they noticed four terrorists running to take cover, afraid that once the bomb exploded it would kill them. And they noticed a fifth terrorist.\\n\\nAt 10:00 a.m., a soldier from Battalion 450 operating in that area alerted the brigade commander and the force began to move toward the target, suspecting the presence of active terrorists.\\n\\nAround 3:00 p.m. that day, as tanks and infantry forces were deployed to assist, a drone identified four figures moving from house to house. The fifth terrorist followed. An IDF tank fired at the terrorists, hitting them, and they began to scatter.\\n\\nThe terrorist squad split up, one entered a building, while others entered another building. The tank force fired a shell into the second building eliminating most of the terrorists.\\n\\nAn IDF platoon commander from Battalion 450 entered the building where the other terrorist was believed to be. The terrorist threw two grenades at the IDF soldiers while other soldiers continued operating drones. A shoulder rocket was fired at the terrorist but he did not die.\\n\\nThe force then deployed another drone, which spotted a figure in one of the upstairs rooms. He was sitting in an armchair, masked and wounded in the hand. The terrorist saw the drone hovering near him, and threw a wooden stick at it, videoed by the IDF drone. At this point the terrorist lifted up his head and an IDF sniper fired a shot, hitting him in the head.\\n\\nExpecting the building to be booby-trapped, the IDF soldiers did not enter the building at that time.\\n\\nThe next morning, the force sent another drone to inspect the area and before entering the building they knew could be booby-trapped, the drone showed the body in the rubble. Only then did they realize that this body bore a resemblance to Yahya Sinwar.\\n\\nThe body was removed from the rubble for examination. DNA test results, including fingerprints and DNA confirmed Yahya Sinwar went to meet his devilish creator.\\n\\nThere was a hole in his head from the sniper shot. Of the five terrorists in this incident, he was the last one to be killed.\\n\\nAt the time he was killed the night before, no one knew it was him.\\n\\nA large sum of cash was found on Sinwar’s body, plus a fake passport, a hand-written map of tunnels which the IDF did not know existed, and a vest full of grenades.\\n\\nIt appeared that Sinwar was on the last leg of an attempted escape trip to cross the border into Egypt so he could run away from the nightmare he helped to create.\\n\\nSome fluke played a fine retaliation game with one of the masterminds of the October 7th, 2023 massacre that Hamas perpetrated on Israel.\\n\\nSinwar planned to abandon his people while leaving them to fight and die.\\n\\nTwo terrorists who were killed near Sinwar were identified as senior members of the Hamas Rafah Brigade. Another body was of the Khan Yunis battalion commander who was with Sinwar since the beginning of the war.\\n\\nThe Intelligence Warning That Wasn’t True\\n\\nSince the beginning of the war and for a whole year, Israelis were told by different intelligence sources that Sinwar had surrounded himself with living hostages as a life insurance policy.\\n\\nFor the fear of hurting the hostages, no War Cabinet nor Israeli general would have approved his elimination. In this case had they known it was Sinwar he may not have been eliminated.\\n\\nThis is exactly why, when this incident became public, Prime Minister Netanyahu’s first order was to update the hostages’ families, confirming to them that no abductees were present during the operation, and none were hurt.\\n\\nA small group of young soldiers were doing their work in the Rafah area. While eliminating a group of Hamas terrorists, among them, Sinwar. These soldiers brought about the elimination of the most sought after terrorist and a mastermind of the October 7, 2023 massacre in southern Israel. They did it almost nonchalantly, something IDF generals and elite units were not allowed to do.\\n\\nHow do we say it? God works in mysterious ways!\\n\\nIsrael’s Knesset-Parliament Speaker Amir Ohana posted a message in Arabic on the X social network: “A year ago he [Sinwar] was victorious, now he is annihilated. Where will you [the rest of Hamas] be in a year from now?

Many people have decided to mitigate these risks, and vote early.\\n\\nOther reasons that may cause people not to do their civic duty are, a person forgets to go to vote; they have an emergency to take care of; they have an unexpected office meeting, or a woman went into labor on that very day or some other emergency.\\n\\nWhy Should More Voters Choose Early Voting in 2024?\\n\\nIf a citizen has concerns about the way the country is shaping in its current polity, with two weeks to election date he or she is already well informed about their voting choices and are prepared to place their ballot.\\n\\nThe availability of early voting will simply help the ballot counting to be processed faster.\\n\\nWith questions that arose from previous election conduct outcomes, our election officials encouraged the registered voters to take advantage of the early voting approach, indicating that such a step could help shape the outcome better.\\n\\nIn some states the voting polls are already open and you can vote early. We are already hearing of record participation before Election Day. However, in states that the voting polls will be open close to November 5, the option of voting-in-by mail is afforded.\\n\\nVote Early in California\\n\\nIn California, ballots went out by mail to every registered voter a few weeks before the election. The instructions were: “keep an eye on your mailbox! Be sure to mail it back so that it is postmarked by Election Day, or drop it in the nearest post office or a drop box where available before or on Election Day. You can also vote in person if you prefer to do so and California offers early voting, starting October 26, 2024. Mail-in ballot comes with an efficient tracking ballot.”\\n\\nEarly voting is a safeguard against any difficulty one may encounter that prevents him or her from voting on Voting Day.\\n\\nDoes Voting Early Protect Your Vote?\\n\\nEarlier voting may mean greater election security-not less. Experts say that expanded voting through early and mail-in ballots helps ensure that elections are safer, despite claims to the contrary.\\n\\nThe COVID pandemic restrictions changed the face of U.S. elections. Many of these changes have remained. Though the Election Day habit is instilled in many and early voting is strange to many Americans, the results show that voters voted more securely than ever in early voting.\\n\\nBy extending the election so that it covers a longer period-several weeks or even a full month-the system can roll with the punches in a new way.\\n\\nIf you have everyone voting on Election Day, it makes it harder to deal with any issue that arises. If voters get stuck in lines, if equipment used has issues, voters have fewer options to remedy the situation.\\n\\nBy having more opportunities to vote, election security becomes easier. Any problem’s severity, whether a technical glitch or a malicious attack, is greatly reduced.\\n\\nElection Interference\\n\\nOne example is that in October 2020, when registered Democrats in Florida started receiving intimidating emails warning them to “Vote Trump or else,” the emails claimed to be from the American group The Proud Boys. Shortly after analyzing the evidence, American intelligence officials figured out that they were actually sent by Iranians attempting to interfere in the election.\\n\\nAfter the 2020 election, questions arose about the election process. The task for the election officials was to improve the next election.\\n\\nIn order to restore integrity to the electoral process, in many states, state legislatures reasserted their constitutional power over the electoral process and passed measures to ensure the elections are conducted properly, free from fraud, and reflect the will of the American voter. Early voting affords time to correct where the voting process may have gone awry.\\n\\nThe involvement of citizens in the political process is an essential part of democracy. Since the 2020 election, tactics and strategies for increased citizen participation in local governance have increased throughout the U.S. Many concerned citizens have run for local office, became involved in local partisan activities and poll watching.\\n\\nHow Early Voting Can Change the Outcome of the 2024 Election\\n\\nEarly voting could be decisive in the right places. In general, early voting is convenient and has been shown to boost participation and help voter turnout. The reason many states have expanded their early voting options is because it has been shown to spur participation.\\n\\nThe “all-mail” or “vote-by-mail” or “vote-at-home” voting method provides the strongest signal of turnout since upwards of ninety percent of voters will return their ballots before Election Day. In the 2018 midterm election, it was the vote-by-mail states that provided the first indicators of unusually high voter turnout when their early voting exceeded the number of votes cast in any prior midterm election, even when controlling for population growth.\\n\\nMost importantly, if you vote early, there is time to appeal, explain, encourage and even help others to cast their ballot.', 'summary': 'We are two weeks until the November 5, 2024 presidential election in the United States of America.

He also mentioned that he had undertaken several initiatives to advance the Tamil language in different states across the country, with the most recent efforts coming with the establishment of a Tamil diploma course at Gauhati University in collaboration with the Assam government.“Hon’ble Chief Minister Thiru MK Stalin has issued a regrettable tweet this evening in which he made a racist remark against me and levelled false allegation of showing disrespect to Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu. He knows it well that I recite full Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu at every function and do so with reverence, pride and precision. He also knows that under leadership Hon’ble Prime Minister Thiru Narendra Modi, the Central govt has proudly created several institutions for spread of Tamil language and heritage within India including Tamil Nadu and several countries of the world. PM Modi took Tamil even to the United Nations,” Ravi said in X.“As a proud Indian I myself have taken numerous substantive initiatives to spread Tamil, the oldest and richest living language, in other states of the country, the latest being to set up , with cooperation of the Assam govt, a Tamil diploma course in Gauhati University for spread of Tamil in the North East. Making racist remarks and alleging incorrect imputations against governor by the chief minister is unfortunately cheap and lowers the dignity of the high constitutional office of the chief minister. Since he rushed to public with his racist remarks and false imputations, I am constrained to respond,” the governor added.This came following when the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, MK Stalin, slammed the governor and questioned if he was an “Aryan” earlier today.“Governor? Are you an Aryan? Removing the word Dravidian and chanting Tamil Thai greetings is against the law of Tamil Nadu! A person who does not act according to the law and acts according to his will is not fit to hold that office. In the guise of celebrating India, the governor is insulting the unity of the country and the people of different races living in this land,” Stalin said.He also called for the recall of the governor for “deliberately insulting” the people of Tamil Nadu.“Will the governor who suffers from Dravidian allergy ask them to leave out Dravidian in the national anthem? The Union Government should immediately recall the governor who is deliberately insulting Tamil Nadu and the sentiments of the people of Tamil Nadu,” he added.Earlier today, MK Stalin raised concerns over linguistic diversity and representation and strongly condemned the celebration of the Hindi Month valedictory function along with the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Chennai Doordarshan.He also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasising that the Indian Constitution does not grant national language status to any language, and Hindi and English are only for official purposes. He suggests avoiding Hindi language programs in non-Hindi-speaking states.“It has been announced that the closing ceremony of the Hindi Month celebrations and Golden Jubilee celebrations of Chennai Television will be held this evening at Doordarshan Tamil in Chennai, and Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi will be the special guest. This blatant attempt to impose Hindi is strongly condemned. India has 122 languages spoken by a significant number of people and 1599 other languages. There is no justification for celebrating only one language when India is a diverse country. In a country where more than 1700 languages are spoken, especially in a state where the world’s oldest language, Tamil, is spoken only in Hindi, it will affect the country’s diversity. The central government should not be responsible for this,” he wrote.He stated that in a multilingual country like India, celebrating the Hindi month in non-Hindi-speaking states was seen as an attempt to belittle the other languages.Further in his letter, Stalin suggested that the Hindi language-oriented events could be avoided in the non-Hindi speaking states if possible or if allowed the celebration of the local language should also take place in respective states with equal warmth.In response, the Tamil Nadu Governor addressed the issue of the language acceptance and noted that there are forces, both within and outside India, aiming to hinder the country’s growth, following the strong opposition from the Tamil Nadu government.Ravi acknowledged the changing perception of the Hindi language in Tamil Nadu and said that initially it met resistance but he later found that many students in the state have become proficient in Hindi. He emphasised that Hindi should not be viewed as an imposition but as a language to be celebrated alongside other languages.“First, when I came here, Hindi was not a welcome language in Tamil Nadu but when I started meeting students, I was happily surprised that their Hindi was better than mine. There is a greater acceptance of Hindi among people of Tamil Nadu… Hindi is not a language of imposition of language in Tamil Nadu. Each language is to be celebrated. Each language is for all of us to be proud of,” the governor said', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/war-of-words-erupts-as-tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-claims-hindi-imposition-over-valedictory-function-governor-hits-back/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/war-of-words-erupts-as-tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-claims-hindi-imposition-over-valedictory-function-governor-hits-back.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 16:48:33', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.266}, {'id': 260224264, 'title': 'Honouring our real heroes: Ex-servicemen felicitation ceremony held in Jammu', 'text': 'Indian Army’s Tiger Division organised a Veterans Outreach Program cum Ex-servicemen Felicitation Ceremony on Friday at Jammu.The event was conducted to honour and felicitate the Gallantry Awardees and Disabled Soldiers for their selfless sacrifice in service of the Nation.

Speaking after the match, Stokes defended his team’s strategy and highlighted the challenges posed in the game.When asked if England could have changed their approach slightly, Stokes responded firmly, “No, not at all. If you look throughout the Test match, the guys who had success from our side and Pakistan’s side were the ones who put the spin bowlers under pressure. Ben Duckett’s first innings hundred showed us the way. The sweep shots made it very difficult to control the run-rate and set fields to. When you get extreme conditions like that, you got to find a way to negate that spin which we managed to do in some good parts, but we’d have liked to go on, especially myself and a couple of guys who got starts.”Reflecting on the missed chances, particularly dropping Agha Salman twice, Stokes emphasized the importance of taking opportunities, “I don’t like to live by hindsight. It just proves how important taking the chances are out here. You don’t get them very often behind the wickets. You take those chances, the game might look a little different.”Stokes also praised the efforts of his seamers, Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse, who toiled tirelessly in tough conditions, “In conditions like these, spinners will get spoken about a lot. Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse kept charging in spell after spell, ball after ball and created so much atmosphere when the spinners needed a break. That’s what you want. There’s a lot that we look in terms of attitude, they both certainly showed that. They constantly felt that they were a big threat which massively helps.”Acknowledging the physical demands of the match, Stokes noted, “Good to get through this game, worked hard to get fit for this game. Nothing can prepare you for standing in the field for as long as we did and in this heat. Looking forward to the next week now. It’s been a great series so far.”Coming to the match, Pakistan kept a tight leash on the match after staging a comeback as they brought about a mid-order collapse for the visitors in the first innings.The resounding victory came after Pakistan lost the first Test match by an innings.England faltered in their final innings, managing only 144 runs chasing a target of 297.England resumed Day 4 with a score of 36/2, but their innings quickly unravelled. Sajid Khan struck early, dismissing Ollie Pope for 22, setting the tone for the day. The in-form Joe Root soon followed, falling to Noman Ali for 18, leaving England struggling at 55/4.Harry Brook, who previously scored a triple century on this ground in the first Test, could only muster 16 runs before being dismissed by Noman Ali. Jamie Smith was trapped for 6, marking Noman’s fourth wicket of the innings.Captain Ben Stokes attempted a counter-attack, scoring a resilient 37, but his departure at 125/7 marked the beginning of the end for England. Brydon Carse (27), Jack Leach (1), and Shoaib Bashir (0) were quickly sent back to the pavilion, all falling to Noman Ali’s masterful bowling.Noman Ali delivered a career-best performance in the Multan Cricket Stadium, claiming 8/46 in the second innings. His remarkable effort brought his match total to 11 wickets for 147 runs, showcasing his dominance.Sajid Khan, who took 7 wickets in England’s first innings, added 2 more in the second.

Despite repeated calls for improvements, the Pakistani government has continually ignored these problems, leaving people to suffer or, in the worst cases, die, Pamir Times reported.The recent spike in cases of rabies and deliberate dog attacks on locals have further underscored the incompetence of the Pakistani administration, resulting in tragic losses of life.In response to these concerns, a Medical Superintendent told Pamir Times, “The cases of dog bites are on the rise in PoGB, and several deaths have already been reported. Rabies infection, if untreated, can also be fatal. I urge pet owners to vaccinate their animals and keep them from roaming freely. Additionally, I request parents to keep their children at home, as there is a risk of attacks if they go outside, which could potentially lead to rabies.”The rising cases of rabies and dengue fever in PoGB present a significant challenge. The deprivation of basic necessities such as clean drinking water and proper sanitation, coupled with poor healthcare services, a lack of essential supplies, and the absence of modern medical equipment, has not only led to inadequate treatment but has also worsened the situation for the local population without substantial improvements in healthcare and environmental management, the ongoing health crisis in PoGB is likely to escalate further.Imtiaz Ahmed, a doctor in Chilas, told Pamir Times, “I have been working in the hospital for the past four years. There has been an outbreak of dengue, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, with cases increasing rapidly. In our hospital alone, more than a hundred cases have been reported in just the span of two to three weeks.”The local administration’s failure to address rising health concerns and provide basic necessities in PoGB exposes both corruption and ineptitude.

It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under the PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the Juvenile Justice Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,” the apex court said.Delivering a judgement on a PIL alleging a rise in child marriages in the country, the apex court issued a slew of guidelines for achieving the elimination of child marriage while bearing in mind the delicate socio-economic interplay.The judgement came on a PIL by the Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action, saying that despite the enactment of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, the rate of child marriages in India is alarming and highlighted the failure of authorities to prevent child marriages.The top court in its verdict emphasised the need for more comprehensive approaches and community-driven strategies to ensure the complete eradication of child marriages.The PCMA as social legislation will only succeed through the collective efforts of all stakeholders to address the issue within a broader social framework that emphasises the need for multi-sectoral coordination, the verdict stated.“This necessitates the enhancement of reporting mechanisms, expansion of public awareness campaigns, and investment in the training and capacity-building of law enforcement officers and related actors. It is also crucial to regularly monitor the implementation of the Act, conduct evaluations to identify gaps, and establish feedback mechanisms to continually refine and improve responses to child marriage,” it added.The apex court said that it framed the guidelines for the effective and useful implementation of the PCMA and the orientation of these guidelines is to prioritise prevention before protection and protection before penalisation.It said the focus of penalisation reflects on a harm-based approach, which has been proven ineffective and the guidelines issued by the top court are on awareness campaigns, funding campaigns, community involvement, education, social support, etc.“We are cognizant of the impact that criminalisation has on families and communities. To ensure effective use of penal provisions in the PCMA, there must be widespread awareness and education about child marriage and the legal consequences of its commission. We must not be understood to discourage prosecution of those who commit illegal acts. However, the aim of the law enforcement machinery must not be solely focused on increasing prosecutions without making the best efforts to prevent and prohibit child marriage. The focus on penalisation reflects a harm-based approach that waits for harm to occur before taking any steps. This approach has proven to be ineffective at bringing about social change,” it added.The 141-page judgement said that addressing child marriage requires an intersectional approach that acknowledges the overlapping vulnerabilities experienced by children, especially girls from marginalised communities.“Intersectionality involves considering factors like gender, caste, socioeconomic status, and geography, which often increase the risks of early marriage. Preventive strategies should therefore be tailored to the unique needs of various communities and focus on addressing the root causes of child marriage, such as poverty, gender inequality, lack of education, and entrenched cultural practices,” it stated.It further said that state governments also must monitor and enforce compliance with these laws and work closely with civil society organisations to implement effective interventions.The top court further said that the state’s role is not limited to merely punishing offenders but extends to creating an enabling environment where children can exercise their rights freely.“This includes the responsibility to not only to legislate against child marriage but also to address the underlying socio-economic factors–poverty, lack of education, and gender discrimination–that perpetuate this practice,” added the verdict.It further stressed that the right to childhood belongs to all sexes. “Education–primary, sexual and life-enhancing–is integral to the right to childhood. Realisation of this right is crucial in dealing with the evils of child marriage,” stated the judgement', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/takes-away-their-choice-of-partner-violates-their-rights-sc-urges-parliament-to-outlaw-child-betrothals/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/takes-away-their-choice-of-partner-violates-their-rights-sc-urges-parliament-to-outlaw-child-betrothals.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 16:34:37', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.173}, {'id': 260224252, 'title': 'YS Sharmila Reddy takes dig at Chandrababu Naidu government, asks when will it implement free travel for women', 'text': 'Andhra Pradesh Congress chief YS Sharmila Reddy on Friday travelled on Road Transport Bus and took a dig at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, saying “women across the state are asking when the free bus travel will be implemented”.The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Jana Sena Party in their manifesto for Andhra Pradesh elections earlier this year had promised free bus travel for women. YS Sharmila Reddy took a ticket and travelled on a ‘Pallevelugu’ RTC bus from Vijayawada Bus Stand to Tenali on Friday as part of her outreach efforts.This initiative aims to connect with the public and engage directly with constituents in the region.She has written a postcard to Chandrababu Naidu, demanding the immediate implementation of the poll promise of TDP. The state Congress chief said Chandrababu Naidu has been in power for four months, yet no decision has been made on free bus travel for women.“Women across the state are asking when the free bus travel will be implemented. In Telangana, the scheme was implemented within a week. Why is the delay in Andhra Pradesh? Is it because the government fears they’ll need to fund RTC (Road Transport Corporation)?”She said that around two million women travel daily in the state.“The RTC earns Rs 7 crore daily through these women. Are you afraid of compensating RTC with these Rs 300 crore if free travel is granted? You took votes from women and promised this benefit. Now, can’t you spend Rs 300 crore for them? Four out of your six key promises were for women, and free bus travel is the least expensive among them. If such a low-cost scheme cannot be implemented, how will larger promises be fulfilled? Will you delay for the next five years?” she asked.The Congress leader said that free bus travel ensures the safety of women, and many women would depend on buses if this scheme is implemented. “This is a very beneficial scheme, and we are demanding that Chandrababu Naidu immediately implement it. Similarly, other schemes promised to women must also be implemented without delay. Provide free gas cylinders to women as promised. Prices of essential commodities have already increased, adding to the burden on women. Women need support and assurance and steps must be taken to improve their safety,” she said.“The government has reduced alcohol prices which could lead to an increase in crimes against women. We are sending a letter to the Chief Minister, demanding free bus travel for women. In the coming days, we will send thousands of postcards. We hope this will prompt Chandrababu Naidu to immediately implement free bus travel for women,” she added', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/ys-sharmila-reddy-takes-dig-at-chandrababu-naidu-government-asks-when-will-it-implement-free-travel-for-women/', 'image': 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-18 15:53:54', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.036}, {'id': 260217096, 'title': '50-m area around Mysuru zoo and Karanji lake declared as ‘silent zone’', 'text': 'The city police have declared an area of up to 50 m from Mysuru zoo and Karanji Lake Nature Park as a ‘silent zone’ and banned bursting of crackers, use of loudspeakers, and sounding of horns in the area.\\n\\nThe police had declared the roads around the zoo viz.
