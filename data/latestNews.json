        "text": "Andhra Pradesh Congress chief YS Sharmila Reddy on Friday travelled on Road Transport Bus and took a dig at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, saying \u201cwomen across the state are asking when the free bus travel will be implemented\u201d.The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Jana Sena Party in their manifesto for Andhra Pradesh elections earlier this year had promised free bus travel for women. YS Sharmila Reddy took a ticket and travelled on a \u2018Pallevelugu\u2019 RTC bus from Vijayawada Bus Stand to Tenali on Friday as part of her outreach efforts.This initiative aims to connect with the public and engage directly with constituents in the region.She has written a postcard to Chandrababu Naidu, demanding the immediate implementation of the poll promise of TDP. The state Congress chief said Chandrababu Naidu has been in power for four months, yet no decision has been made on free bus travel for women.\u201cWomen across the state are asking when the free bus travel will be implemented. In Telangana, the scheme was implemented within a week. Why is the delay in Andhra Pradesh? Is it because the government fears they\u2019ll need to fund RTC (Road Transport Corporation)?\u201dShe said that around two million women travel daily in the state.\u201cThe RTC earns Rs 7 crore daily through these women. Are you afraid of compensating RTC with these Rs 300 crore if free travel is granted? You took votes from women and promised this benefit. Now, can\u2019t you spend Rs 300 crore for them? Four out of your six key promises were for women, and free bus travel is the least expensive among them. If such a low-cost scheme cannot be implemented, how will larger promises be fulfilled? Will you delay for the next five years?\u201d she asked.The Congress leader said that free bus travel ensures the safety of women, and many women would depend on buses if this scheme is implemented. \u201cThis is a very beneficial scheme, and we are demanding that Chandrababu Naidu immediately implement it. Similarly, other schemes promised to women must also be implemented without delay. Provide free gas cylinders to women as promised. Prices of essential commodities have already increased, adding to the burden on women. Women need support and assurance and steps must be taken to improve their safety,\u201d she said.\u201cThe government has reduced alcohol prices which could lead to an increase in crimes against women. We are sending a letter to the Chief Minister, demanding free bus travel for women. In the coming days, we will send thousands of postcards. We hope this will prompt Chandrababu Naidu to immediately implement free bus travel for women,\u201d she added",

        "title": "Takes away their choice of partner; violates their rights: SC urges Parliament to outlaw child betrothals",
        "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday, while stating that marriages fixed in the minority of a child have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, said that Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006.A bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said child betrothal takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency.\u201cWe note that while the PCMA seeks to prohibit child marriages, it does not stipulate on betrothals. Marriages fixed in the minority of a child also have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood. It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under the PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the Juvenile Justice Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,\u201d the apex court said.Delivering a judgement on a PIL alleging a rise in child marriages in the country, the apex court issued a slew of guidelines for achieving the elimination of child marriage while bearing in mind the delicate socio-economic interplay.The judgement came on a PIL by the Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action, saying that despite the enactment of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, the rate of child marriages in India is alarming and highlighted the failure of authorities to prevent child marriages.The top court in its verdict emphasised the need for more comprehensive approaches and community-driven strategies to ensure the complete eradication of child marriages.The PCMA as social legislation will only succeed through the collective efforts of all stakeholders to address the issue within a broader social framework that emphasises the need for multi-sectoral coordination, the verdict stated.\u201cThis necessitates the enhancement of reporting mechanisms, expansion of public awareness campaigns, and investment in the training and capacity-building of law enforcement officers and related actors. It is also crucial to regularly monitor the implementation of the Act, conduct evaluations to identify gaps, and establish feedback mechanisms to continually refine and improve responses to child marriage,\u201d it added.The apex court said that it framed the guidelines for the effective and useful implementation of the PCMA and the orientation of these guidelines is to prioritise prevention before protection and protection before penalisation.It said the focus of penalisation reflects on a harm-based approach, which has been proven ineffective and the guidelines issued by the top court are on awareness campaigns, funding campaigns, community involvement, education, social support, etc.\u201cWe are cognizant of the impact that criminalisation has on families and communities. To ensure effective use of penal provisions in the PCMA, there must be widespread awareness and education about child marriage and the legal consequences of its commission. We must not be understood to discourage prosecution of those who commit illegal acts. However, the aim of the law enforcement machinery must not be solely focused on increasing prosecutions without making the best efforts to prevent and prohibit child marriage. The focus on penalisation reflects a harm-based approach that waits for harm to occur before taking any steps. This approach has proven to be ineffective at bringing about social change,\u201d it added.The 141-page judgement said that addressing child marriage requires an intersectional approach that acknowledges the overlapping vulnerabilities experienced by children, especially girls from marginalised communities.\u201cIntersectionality involves considering factors like gender, caste, socioeconomic status, and geography, which often increase the risks of early marriage. Preventive strategies should therefore be tailored to the unique needs of various communities and focus on addressing the root causes of child marriage, such as poverty, gender inequality, lack of education, and entrenched cultural practices,\u201d it stated.It further said that state governments also must monitor and enforce compliance with these laws and work closely with civil society organisations to implement effective interventions.The top court further said that the state\u2019s role is not limited to merely punishing offenders but extends to creating an enabling environment where children can exercise their rights freely.\u201cThis includes the responsibility to not only to legislate against child marriage but also to address the underlying socio-economic factors\u2013poverty, lack of education, and gender discrimination\u2013that perpetuate this practice,\u201d added the verdict.It further stressed that the right to childhood belongs to all sexes. \u201cEducation\u2013primary, sexual and life-enhancing\u2013is integral to the right to childhood. Realisation of this right is crucial in dealing with the evils of child marriage,\u201d stated the judgement",

        "text": "The government in Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan (PoGB) has consistently overlooked the pressing issues and concerns of its residents, as reported by Pamir Times. Currently, the population is grappling with alarming problems, including dire health and sanitation conditions. As a result, many lives have been lost to diseases like rabies and dengue, highlighting the ineffectiveness of the administration, according to Pamir Times.The healthcare situation in PoGB is increasingly concerning, characterized by inadequate infrastructure, a shortage of medical staff, and severe water scarcity. Despite repeated calls for improvements, the Pakistani government has continually ignored these problems, leaving people to suffer or, in the worst cases, die, Pamir Times reported.The recent spike in cases of rabies and deliberate dog attacks on locals have further underscored the incompetence of the Pakistani administration, resulting in tragic losses of life.In response to these concerns, a Medical Superintendent told Pamir Times, \u201cThe cases of dog bites are on the rise in PoGB, and several deaths have already been reported. Rabies infection, if untreated, can also be fatal. I urge pet owners to vaccinate their animals and keep them from roaming freely. Additionally, I request parents to keep their children at home, as there is a risk of attacks if they go outside, which could potentially lead to rabies.\u201dThe rising cases of rabies and dengue fever in PoGB present a significant challenge. The deprivation of basic necessities such as clean drinking water and proper sanitation, coupled with poor healthcare services, a lack of essential supplies, and the absence of modern medical equipment, has not only led to inadequate treatment but has also worsened the situation for the local population without substantial improvements in healthcare and environmental management, the ongoing health crisis in PoGB is likely to escalate further.Imtiaz Ahmed, a doctor in Chilas, told Pamir Times, \u201cI have been working in the hospital for the past four years. There has been an outbreak of dengue, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, with cases increasing rapidly. In our hospital alone, more than a hundred cases have been reported in just the span of two to three weeks.\u201dThe local administration\u2019s failure to address rising health concerns and provide basic necessities in PoGB exposes both corruption and ineptitude. Their inaction on critical issues such as healthcare, clean water, and sanitation has left the population vulnerable to serious diseases like rabies and dengue.",

        "text": "England captain Ben Stokes expressed his thoughts on the team\u2019s approach and the missed opportunities in their loss to Pakistan by 152 runs in the second Test in Multan. Speaking after the match, Stokes defended his team\u2019s strategy and highlighted the challenges posed in the game.When asked if England could have changed their approach slightly, Stokes responded firmly, \u201cNo, not at all. If you look throughout the Test match, the guys who had success from our side and Pakistan\u2019s side were the ones who put the spin bowlers under pressure. Ben Duckett\u2019s first innings hundred showed us the way. The sweep shots made it very difficult to control the run-rate and set fields to. When you get extreme conditions like that, you got to find a way to negate that spin which we managed to do in some good parts, but we\u2019d have liked to go on, especially myself and a couple of guys who got starts.\u201dReflecting on the missed chances, particularly dropping Agha Salman twice, Stokes emphasized the importance of taking opportunities, \u201cI don\u2019t like to live by hindsight. It just proves how important taking the chances are out here. You don\u2019t get them very often behind the wickets. You take those chances, the game might look a little different.\u201dStokes also praised the efforts of his seamers, Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse, who toiled tirelessly in tough conditions, \u201cIn conditions like these, spinners will get spoken about a lot. Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse kept charging in spell after spell, ball after ball and created so much atmosphere when the spinners needed a break. That\u2019s what you want. There\u2019s a lot that we look in terms of attitude, they both certainly showed that. They constantly felt that they were a big threat which massively helps.\u201dAcknowledging the physical demands of the match, Stokes noted, \u201cGood to get through this game, worked hard to get fit for this game. Nothing can prepare you for standing in the field for as long as we did and in this heat. Looking forward to the next week now. It\u2019s been a great series so far.\u201dComing to the match, Pakistan kept a tight leash on the match after staging a comeback as they brought about a mid-order collapse for the visitors in the first innings.The resounding victory came after Pakistan lost the first Test match by an innings.England faltered in their final innings, managing only 144 runs chasing a target of 297.England resumed Day 4 with a score of 36/2, but their innings quickly unravelled. Sajid Khan struck early, dismissing Ollie Pope for 22, setting the tone for the day. The in-form Joe Root soon followed, falling to Noman Ali for 18, leaving England struggling at 55/4.Harry Brook, who previously scored a triple century on this ground in the first Test, could only muster 16 runs before being dismissed by Noman Ali. Jamie Smith was trapped for 6, marking Noman\u2019s fourth wicket of the innings.Captain Ben Stokes attempted a counter-attack, scoring a resilient 37, but his departure at 125/7 marked the beginning of the end for England. Brydon Carse (27), Jack Leach (1), and Shoaib Bashir (0) were quickly sent back to the pavilion, all falling to Noman Ali\u2019s masterful bowling.Noman Ali delivered a career-best performance in the Multan Cricket Stadium, claiming 8/46 in the second innings. His remarkable effort brought his match total to 11 wickets for 147 runs, showcasing his dominance.Sajid Khan, who took 7 wickets in England\u2019s first innings, added 2 more in the second. His pivotal role in dismantling the English batting lineup earned him the Player of the Match award.This is Pakistan\u2019s first victory at home since February 2021.The team last won a test match at home in Rawalpindi as they defeated South Africa. Pakistan have played 11 Tests on their home soil since February 2021 and four of them have resulted in a draw while they have lost eight matches.Pakistan and England will clash in the third and final Test at Rawalpindi from October 24.

This is not only an anti-Dalit decision but also a blatant anti-reservation decision,\u201d Mayawati posted on X. She further said that central BJP leadership\u2019s failure to intervene against this decision demonstrates that \u201clike the Congress\u201d, they are engaged in a conspiracy to render reservations \u201cThe fact that the central leadership of BJP did not come forward to stop the Haryana government from doing this proves that like the Congress, the BJP is also engaged in a conspiracy to first make the reservation inactive and ineffective and ultimately abolish it, which is completely unfair and the BSP is strongly opposed to it,\u201d she added. The BSP chief further underlined the BSP\u2019s commitment to combating the \u201cdivide and rule\u201d tactics employed by \u201ccasteist parties\u201d. \u201cIn reality, BSP is the name of the struggle against the divide and rule policy of casteist parties in SC-ST and OBC society and their anti-reservation conspiracy etc. Our struggle to organize and unite these classes and make them the ruling class will continue,\u201d she said. This comes after Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said the state will also implement the Supreme Court\u2019s decision empowering states to make sub-classifications within the Scheduled Castes for granting reservation \u201ctoday itself\u201d",

        "title": "War of words erupts as Tamil Nadu CM Stalin claims Hindi imposition over valedictory function; Governor hits back",
        "text": "A war of words erupted over the celebration of the Hindi Month valedictory function along with the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Chennai Doordarshan, Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi hurled back at the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, stating that it was \u201cunfortunately cheap\u201d and \u201clowers the dignity\u201d of the constitutional office of the Chief Minister following Stalin\u2019s \u201cracist remarks\u201d and allegations of \u201cincorrect imputations\u201d against the Governor over this issue.Taking to social media platform X, Ravi on Friday said that he was constrained to respond over Stalin\u2019s remarks and \u201cfalse imputations\u201d against him, further stating that the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister\u2019s remarks had disrespected the \u201cTamizh Thaai Vaazhthu.\u201dThe governor further mentioned that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Central government has made significant strides in promoting the Tamil language, both within India and internationally. He also mentioned that he had undertaken several initiatives to advance the Tamil language in different states across the country, with the most recent efforts coming with the establishment of a Tamil diploma course at Gauhati University in collaboration with the Assam government.\u201cHon\u2019ble Chief Minister Thiru MK Stalin has issued a regrettable tweet this evening in which he made a racist remark against me and levelled false allegation of showing disrespect to Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu. He knows it well that I recite full Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu at every function and do so with reverence, pride and precision. He also knows that under leadership Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister Thiru Narendra Modi, the Central govt has proudly created several institutions for spread of Tamil language and heritage within India including Tamil Nadu and several countries of the world. PM Modi took Tamil even to the United Nations,\u201d Ravi said in X.\u201cAs a proud Indian I myself have taken numerous substantive initiatives to spread Tamil, the oldest and richest living language, in other states of the country, the latest being to set up , with cooperation of the Assam govt, a Tamil diploma course in Gauhati University for spread of Tamil in the North East. Making racist remarks and alleging incorrect imputations against governor by the chief minister is unfortunately cheap and lowers the dignity of the high constitutional office of the chief minister. Since he rushed to public with his racist remarks and false imputations, I am constrained to respond,\u201d the governor added.This came following when the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, MK Stalin, slammed the governor and questioned if he was an \u201cAryan\u201d earlier today.\u201cGovernor? Are you an Aryan? Removing the word Dravidian and chanting Tamil Thai greetings is against the law of Tamil Nadu! A person who does not act according to the law and acts according to his will is not fit to hold that office. In the guise of celebrating India, the governor is insulting the unity of the country and the people of different races living in this land,\u201d Stalin said.He also called for the recall of the governor for \u201cdeliberately insulting\u201d the people of Tamil Nadu.\u201cWill the governor who suffers from Dravidian allergy ask them to leave out Dravidian in the national anthem? The Union Government should immediately recall the governor who is deliberately insulting Tamil Nadu and the sentiments of the people of Tamil Nadu,\u201d he added.Earlier today, MK Stalin raised concerns over linguistic diversity and representation and strongly condemned the celebration of the Hindi Month valedictory function along with the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Chennai Doordarshan.He also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasising that the Indian Constitution does not grant national language status to any language, and Hindi and English are only for official purposes. He suggests avoiding Hindi language programs in non-Hindi-speaking states.\u201cIt has been announced that the closing ceremony of the Hindi Month celebrations and Golden Jubilee celebrations of Chennai Television will be held this evening at Doordarshan Tamil in Chennai, and Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi will be the special guest. This blatant attempt to impose Hindi is strongly condemned. India has 122 languages spoken by a significant number of people and 1599 other languages. There is no justification for celebrating only one language when India is a diverse country. In a country where more than 1700 languages are spoken, especially in a state where the world\u2019s oldest language, Tamil, is spoken only in Hindi, it will affect the country\u2019s diversity. The central government should not be responsible for this,\u201d he wrote.He stated that in a multilingual country like India, celebrating the Hindi month in non-Hindi-speaking states was seen as an attempt to belittle the other languages.Further in his letter, Stalin suggested that the Hindi language-oriented events could be avoided in the non-Hindi speaking states if possible or if allowed the celebration of the local language should also take place in respective states with equal warmth.In response, the Tamil Nadu Governor addressed the issue of the language acceptance and noted that there are forces, both within and outside India, aiming to hinder the country\u2019s growth, following the strong opposition from the Tamil Nadu government.Ravi acknowledged the changing perception of the Hindi language in Tamil Nadu and said that initially it met resistance but he later found that many students in the state have become proficient in Hindi. He emphasised that Hindi should not be viewed as an imposition but as a language to be celebrated alongside other languages.\u201cFirst, when I came here, Hindi was not a welcome language in Tamil Nadu but when I started meeting students, I was happily surprised that their Hindi was better than mine. There is a greater acceptance of Hindi among people of Tamil Nadu\u2026 Hindi is not a language of imposition of language in Tamil Nadu. Each language is to be celebrated. Each language is for all of us to be proud of,\u201d the governor said",

He noted, \u201cSapta Sindhu is also mentioned in the Vedas. It is a vast region of seven rivers, out of which four rivers Sutlej, Beas, Chenab, and Ravi flow through Himachal Pradesh. Therefore, Himachal is called the Dev Bhoomi of the Sapta Sindhu region,\u201d said Shiv Pratap Shukla.The Governor expressed pride that Himachal Pradesh was chosen as the venue for the presentation of the inaugural Sapta Sindhu Award.Reflecting on Maharaja Dahir Sen\u2019s legacy, Shukla remarked, \u201cThis award is being given in the name of Sindhu Naresh Maharaja Dahir Sen, who never compromised against the invaders and sacrificed his life for the country.\u201d he added.He lamented the lack of recognition for such a notable historical figure, stating, \u201cSuch a great person was not given a proper place in history.\u201d He expressed hope that the award would encourage historians to revisit and honour Maharaja Dahir Sen\u2019s contributions.The Governor also highlighted the accomplishments of Nirmal Thakur, emphasizing her lifelong dedication to education in Himachal Pradesh. \u201cHer honour is the honour of the people of the entire state,\u201d he said.\u201cToday, the students taught by her are in high positions in many fields. The biggest honour for any teacher is their students. When the students taught by them progress in various fields of life, their teachers get twice as much happiness from them.\u201d Shukla added.He further noted her contributions to literature, mentioning her renowned poetry collections, \u2018Realm of Thoughts\u2019 and \u2018Understanding of Life\u2019, which have made a significant impact on the literary scene of Himachal Pradesh. \u201cHer poems are emotional and express various aspects of life philosophy,\u201d he observed, commending her continued active involvement in social work, even at the age of around 90.In her acceptance speech, Nirmal Thakur expressed her gratitude to the Governor and the Foundation. She shared that receiving the award had given her renewed motivation, stating, \u201cReceiving this award has further boosted my morale and has encouraged me to strengthen the power of my pen as a writer.\u201d She also emphasized the importance of family support, saying, \u201cFor the success of your goal in life, you need the support and strength of your family at every step, and I consider myself fortunate that I get it in abundance.\u201dThakur attributed her achievements to her late husband, Justice H.S. Thakur, a former judge of the Himachal Pradesh High Court, who inspired her literary pursuits.Earlier in the event, Prof. Kuldeep Chand Agnihotri, President of the Sapta Sindhu Foundation, welcomed the Governor and provided insights into the Foundation\u2019s work and the significance of the Sapta Sindhu Samman. Dr Arun Kumar Sharma from Himachal Pradesh Central University delivered the vote of thanks.The ceremony was attended by various dignitaries, including Justice Suresh Thakur, Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, and C.P.

        "text": "The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda\u2019s plea seeking direction to stay his conviction in a coal scam case, to contest upcoming polls. The bench of Justice Neena Bansal Krishna dismissed the application, which Koda filed to enable him to contest in the upcoming assembly elections. Koda, along with ex-coal secretary H.C. Gupta, former Jharkhand chief secretary A.K. Basu, and aide Vijay Joshi, received three-year prison sentences for corruption and conspiracy related to the allocation of the Rajhara North coal block to Vini Iron and Steel Udyog Ltd.Koda\u2019s plea argued that with elections in Jharkhand scheduled for November 2024, he risks being deprived of the chance to contest, given his history as a former Chief Minister and multiple-time MP/MLA, unless his conviction is stayed. The CBI opposed this application, citing maintainability, pointing out that a similar request had been denied in May 2020. CBI\u2019s Lawyers Senior Advocate R.S. Cheema and lawyer Tarannum Cheema emphasized that the previous court had thoroughly considered the issue of decriminalizing politics and dismissed Koda\u2019s application without appeal, allowing that judgment to stand.In 2017, a Delhi court convicted Koda of criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act, sentencing him to three years in prison and imposing a fine of INR 5 lakh. Although he was granted bail and a stay on the fine in 2018, the Delhi High Court rejected a stay on his conviction in 2020. Now, four years later, Koda again approached the High Court, citing new factual and legal developments as he seeks to stay on his conviction, noting that his criminal appeal has been pending since 2017 and the case has not been scheduled for a hearing",

Pakistan kept a tight leash on the match after staging a comeback as they brought about a mid-order collapse for the visitors in the first innings.The resounding victory came after Pakistan lost the first Test match by an innings. England faltered in their final innings, managing only 144 runs chasing a target of 297.England resumed Day 4 with a score of 36/2, but their innings quickly unravelled. Sajid Khan struck early, dismissing Ollie Pope for 22, setting the tone for the day. The in-form Joe Root soon followed, falling to Noman Ali for 18, leaving England struggling at 55/4.Harry Brook, who previously scored a triple century on this ground in the first Test, could only muster 16 runs before being dismissed by Noman Ali. Jamie Smith was trapped for 6, marking Noman\u2019s fourth wicket of the innings.Captain Ben Stokes attempted a counter-attack, scoring a resilient 37, but his departure at 125/7 marked the beginning of the end for England. Brydon Carse (27), Jack Leach (1), and Shoaib Bashir (0) were quickly sent back to the pavilion, all falling to Noman Ali\u2019s masterful bowling.Noman Ali delivered a career-best performance in the Multan Cricket Stadium, claiming 8/46 in the second innings. His remarkable effort brought his match total to 11 wickets for 147 runs, showcasing his dominance.Sajid Khan, who took 7 wickets in England\u2019s first innings, added 2 more in the second. His pivotal role in dismantling the English batting lineup earned him the Player of the Match award.This is Pakistan\u2019s first victory at home since February 2021.

Pakistan have played 11 Tests on their home soil since February 2021 and four of them have resulted in a draw while they have lost eight matches.Pakistan and England will clash in the third and final Test at Rawalpindi from October 24.Brief Score: Pakistan 366 & 221 (Agha Salman 63, Saud Shakeel 31, Shoaib Bashir 4/66) vs England 291 & 144 in 33.3 overs (Ben Stokes 37, Brydon Carse 27; Noman Ali 8/46).

We are among the top three start-ups in the world. We have gone the moon and way beyond. The world is acknowledging,\u201d he added.The governor expressed concern over a perceived attempt to isolate Tamil Nadu from the rest of India, describing such efforts as a \u201ctoxic and separatist policy\u201d and saying that this cannot weaken the nation. He said the country was moving forward with PM Modi and that India is rising in its way but there are forces trying to weaken India, taking us back to where it drives us from inside and outside.He pointed out that while 27 states in India have embraced a three-language formula, Tamil Nadu has been resistant to the inclusion of other languages, which he believes hampers communication and unity among states. He remarked that this linguistic isolation creates challenges for youth in Tamil Nadu, making it difficult for them to connect with peers in neighbouring states like Karnataka.\u201cThere is a consistent attempt to isolate Tamil Nadu from India\u2026 A toxic and separatist policy cannot weaken the Bharat.

Their attitude today is that our youth find it difficult to go to Karnataka, etc,\u201d he added.Discussing the role of Doordharshan, Ravi emphasised the importance of accurate information dissemination and criticised the narrative created over the past 50 years over toxic and separatist policy. He asserted that DD prioritised national interest in its programming.\u201cAs far as DD is concerned, a lot of toxicity was made in the last 50 years to the people of our country. DD worked on it\u2026There is a great degree of ignorance among our people\u2026 DD is nation first\u2026 and should give correct information. Most of the channels are compromised here.

        "text": "Harvard University has imposed disciplinary probation on Taiwanese-American student Cosette Wu for disrupting a speech by China\u2019s US Ambassador, Xie Feng. The Chinese student, Zou Hongji, who forcibly removed her from the venue, was not sanctioned, Taiwan News reported.Documents shared by the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with the Washington Free Beacon revealed that Harvard placed Wu on probation in May for \u201cinappropriate social behaviour.\u201d In contrast, Zou was not disciplined for his actions against Wu and instead received an apology from the university.Wu\u2019s protest occurred on April 20 during the opening ceremony of the Harvard Kennedy School China Conference. As Ambassador Xie began his speech, Wu shouted slogans condemning Beijing\u2019s human rights abuses. Before Wu could finish, Zou, who grabbed her by the arm and pulled her away, removed her from the venue.Harvard\u2019s disciplinary board voted to place Wu on probation for breaching the university\u2019s rules on free speech, although the university\u2019s letter did not specify which guidelines Wu had broken. On May 17, an administrative board subcommittee initially recommended only a reprimand, as Wu had apologised during a meeting for her disruption. Wu explained that her main intent was to protect free speech by showing dissent against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representative, enabling the audience to think more critically about the ambassador\u2019s speech. She claimed she was unaware that her actions had broken university rules and believed her actions had not prevented the ambassador from speaking. Wu also lamented the threats to her safety and that of others resulting from her protest, reported Taiwan News.Later that day, the full board rejected the subcommittee\u2019s recommendation and issued a formal disciplinary response. The probation would last from May 17-20, according to an email sent to Wu. In addition to Wu, two other students who had protested the ambassador\u2019s remarks were also placed on probation, including Tsering Yangchen, the co-president of Boston\u2019s Students for a Free Tibet chapter, while the identity of the other student has not been publicised.Zou was later identified as a master\u2019s candidate at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education and an officer in the university\u2019s branch of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, which reportedly has ties to the CCP. Zou had also been one of the organisers of Xie\u2019s speech. Harvard notified Zou via email that he had breached the university\u2019s policy on physical violence. However, the Harvard Graduate School of Education did not impose any sanctions on him, partly due to the online backlash Zou had received.Kevin Boehm, the assistant dean for student affairs at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, sent a letter about Zou on May 8 to Martin West, the school\u2019s Academic Dean, Taiwan News reported.Boehm cited Zou\u2019s claim that he did not use excessive force and that he was the victim of doxxing (having one\u2019s residential information and personal identity unwillingly revealed) on social media following the incident. On May 10, West sent an email to Boehm saying that instead of referring Zou for discipline, the school had written a letter of censure.West later took a conciliatory tone in an email sent to Zou on May 22, saying, \u201cI understand that your intentions were to prevent the event from being further disrupted.\u201d West also apologised for the online response to Zou\u2019s actions, stating, \u201cI also acknowledge that you and your family have experienced significant harm as a result of the event, which I deeply regret.\u201dHarvard\u2019s official correspondence did not mention that Zou\u2019s actions against Wu during the speech had been reported to the Massachusetts State Police on April 20 as assault and battery.",

        "title": "\u201cDeepening silence of so-called moral preachers\u201d: VP Dhankhar expressed concern over plight of Hindus in neighbouring countries",
        "text": "Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday expressed concern over the plight of Hindus in neighbouring countries and criticised the \u201csilence of so-called moral preachers and custodians of human rights.\u201dHe emphasized that excessive tolerance of such transgressions is inappropriate and urged the public to reflect on these matters seriously.Addressing the National Human Rights Commission\u2019s Foundation Day programme in New Delhi, Dhankhar said, \u201cThe most disheartening aspect of the plight of Hindus in our neighbourhood is the deepening silence of so-called moral preachers, custodians of human rights. They are exposed. They are mercenaries for something which is antithetical to human rights. Look at the kind of barbarity, torture, and traumatised experiences of boys, girls, and women. Look at our religious places being sacrilege. We are too tolerant and have been too tolerant of such transgressions. This is not appropriate. I call upon everyone in the country to seriously reflect, think if you were one of those,\u201d Dhankhar said. He further said that evidence, episode after episode, is piling up that the deep state is engaging in lawfare against rising powers.\u201cSomehow, it seems they are unable to digest the rise of civilisational states in the international system who assert their own identity. Let me reflect a little away from the issue. Does the United Nations Security Council reflect a sense of human rights when it keeps one-sixth of humanity away from it? There has to be an auditing of its performance. The discourse of human rights is calibrated for political projects. Get a project, get money, get some people employed. You are applauded only when you talk negatively about this country. I know of an institution in the world that claims to be at its peak. They call them Ivy League institutions. A book has been written, Snakes in the Ganges over it,\u201d he said.Dhankhar further pointed out the importance of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and said that the act is an affirmative step to give citizenship to those who are being hunted, and persecuted and this is not limited to one religion, many religions.\u201cDomestically, we should be wary of elements that use human rights to advance their political agenda. I am addressing the community of politicians. Citizen Amendment Act\u2013how can this be an issue? The act does not deprive any citizen of this country of his or her citizenship. The act does not handicap any person on the globe to take recourse to take citizenship of this country. The act is an affirmative step to give citizenship to those who are being hunted, and persecuted and this is not limited to one religion, many religions. Even such a soothing aspect is to be challenged. Well, we have a situation deep state takes shape only in this way. Therefore, nip it ruthlessly in the bud when it is seen,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the prime example I indicated, there couldn\u2019t be a better gesture of social magnanimity collectively expressed by an act of parliament in CAA. Stateless refugees were to flee from India under severe repression for committing the \u201csin\u201d of choosing to follow their conscience from our neighbourhood. They had the option to be here, they committed the \u201csin\u201d of conscience when they were suffering day in and day out and this is being opposed. This balm is a soothing medicine that is being opposed on the plank of human rights. How sharper the serpent\u2019s tooth could it be?\u201d Dhankhar said. The Vice President said that always remember, human rights preservation, blossoming and sustainability are in our hands.\u201cIt is our collective and societal duty that we must unfailingly perform,\u201d he said. The unrest in Bangladesh began with student protests against the country\u2019s quota system, which reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives and dependents of freedom fighters. The protests eventually spread, demanding the abolition of the quota system, which was seen as discriminatory and contrary to equal opportunity rights",
