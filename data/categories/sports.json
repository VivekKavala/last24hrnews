All were unable to do so, but Verstappen left it late to put his Red Bull into P1.\r\n\r\nRussell will join Verstappen on the front row, with Leclerc and Norris behind in third and fourth ahead of Sainz and the Haas of Nico Hulkenberg in fifth and sixth places.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton lines up in seventh for Mercedes, alongside Haas\u2019s Kevin Magnussen in a solid eighth, while RB\u2019s Yuki Tsunoda and the Williams of Franco Colapinto round out the top 10.\r\n\r\nSergio Perez found himself eliminated in SQ2 after his sole effort proved not to be enough to see him through, putting the Red Bull in P11. Joining him on the sixth row will be the Alpine of Pierre Gasly.\r\n\r\nAston Martin had a disappointing day, with Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso ending the session in 13th and 14th respectively. Behind them was Liam Lawson in 15th for RB as the New Zealander makes his return to the grid in place of Daniel Ricciardo.\r\n\r\nThere was drama in SQ1 when Oscar Piastri had his final lap time deleted due to exceeding track limits at Turn 19, dropping the McLaren driver down to P16 and putting him out of the session. Alex Albon, meanwhile, had a spin in the Williams as he approached the line, leaving him unable to improve in P18.\r\n\r\nAlso exiting in the first segment of Sprint Qualifying were Alpine\u2019s Esteban Ocon in 17th, Valtteri Bottas in 19th and the Finn\u2019s Kick Sauber teammate Zhou Guanyu in 20th place.",

        "text": "New Zealand's golden generation, led by the inspirational Sophie Devine, will have one last chance to lay hands on a global ICC trophy when it meets a gritty South Africa in the summit clash of the T20 World Cup which is set to throw a new champion, here Sunday. New Zealand's women's team had won the ODI World Cup back in 2000 but none of the current squad members were part of that historic title triumph. Before this event began, New Zealand were in the trenches having lost 10 matches on the trot in the format but under Devine this bunch, comprising of the venerable Suzie Bates and the assuring Amelia Kerr, has done wonders, bringing the side in contention for the ultimate prize.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");It is most probably the last time the Black Shirts will have Devine, Bates and Lea Tahuhu playing of the national side in a global tournament.Devine, 35, has more than 7000 runs under her belt in white-ball formats while the 37-year-old Bates has more than 10,000 runs to her name.Pacer Tahuhu, 34, has 112 wickets in ODIs and 93 in T20Is.They won't leave any stone unturned to ensure that they have a World Cup trophy in their cabinet.South Africa on the other side will be equally determined to complete the unfinished business as they had lost the 2023 World Cup final to Australia at home. They have an opportunity to erase painful memories as they had lost by a mere 19 runs in the close contest.New Zealand have one or other player to rise the occasion in the tournament and in the semifinal against the West Indies, if they failed to set a target big enough to daunt the free-flowing Caribbean batters, their bowlers responded with tidy spells throughout the game to eke out a memorable win.Kerr's wicket tally has swelled to 12 in the tournament as she found apt support from the other end in the likes of Eden Carson (8), Rosemary Mair (7) and the experienced Lea Tahuhu.New Zealand announced their intentions with a big win against India first up and followed that up with consistent performances across departments.A 60-run loss to Australia, arguably the strongest team in the competition, notwithstanding, the Kiwis weren't unnerved as they went on to pip the West Indies in the final over of their low-scoring semifinal to make their third final.When the tournament began towards the end of the first decade of this century, New Zealand appeared to be the team to beat as they made two consecutive finals but got pipped by England and Australia once each.Bates and Devine, the survivors from those campaigns, will thus get a third crack in winning the first ICC trophy for New Zealand in white-ball cricket since 2000 when the men's team won the Champions Trophy in Kenya.But against them will be the formidable South Africa who scripted history of sorts to have stopped the all-dominating Australian team from reaching their eighth consecutive final in the last 15 years and seven editions of the T20 World Cup.If New Zealand has Kerr topping the charts for most successful bowlers, South Africa have two of their top-order batters \u2014 Laura Wolvaardt (190 runs) and Tazmin Brits (170 runs) \u2014 lodged at the top of the batting charts in this tournament.South Africa's all-round might will pose the sternest challenge as the Proteas side is coming off a comprehensive eight-wicket thrashing of Australia, having restricted them to a mere 135/5 and knocked off the target with more than two overs to spare.While a lot will depend on the pair of Wolvaardt and Brits at the top, SA will need the likes of Anneke Bosch and Marizanne Kapp to chip in with the bat too.Similarly, Nonkululeko Mlaba (10 wickets) would also need the rest of the bowlers to replicate their performance from the semifinal, in which they collectively kept it tight to not allow Australia to get away with the bat.Squads:New Zealand: Sophie Devine (captain), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Isabella Gaze (wk), Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Amelia Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder (wk), Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon.Time: 7:30PM IST.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

You never know how much you can push, but the car was working well.\"Of course I'm very happy to be first, it's been a while.\"The Dutchman added: \"It's always very hectic and you know this track is amazing to drive.\"Norris was left frustrated after struggling for set-up balance with his car.\"That was not very good. We are struggling.

        "title": "Bigg Boss Telugu 8 Day 47 Highlights: Gautam Takes the Lead as Mega Chief",
        "text": "The current season of Bigg Boss Telugu, aptly titled \"Limitless Entertainment,\" has been delivering a blend of drama and excitement week after week. The entry of wildcard contestants, known as the Royals, in the fifth week has added a new layer of competition, often overshadowing the original housemates, referred to as the OG clan. This week\u2019s main task, \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers,\" tested the participants' concentration, strategy, and resilience. Here are some highlights from Day 47 of Bigg Boss Telugu 8:\r\n1. The Cushion Challenge:\r\nThe day began with the continuation of the \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers\" task. Bigg Boss introduced the Cushion Challenge, a twist on the Memory game. Contestants were required to match images displayed on a screen with cushions placed in the garden area, carrying the cushions to a designated grid to score points. \r\n\r\nDespite facing early setbacks, the Over Smartphones team emerged victorious, earning the advantage of eliminating two players from the Over Smart Chargers from the Mega Chief race. They chose to remove Nabeel and Nikhil from the competition.\r\n2. The Conclusion:\r\nThe weekly challenge concluded with four contestants from the OG clan and eight from the Royals still in the game. After the weekly task concluded, Teja and Prithvi were released from their punishment as the week's worst performers, regaining access to their suitcases.\r\n3. Comic Relief from Bigg Boss:\r\nBigg Boss humorously reprimanded Mehaboob and Avinash for napping during the day. The housemates were then summoned to the garden, where they found miniature coffee cups, bun masks, and a violin cutout\u2014a playful nod to Avinash\u2019s earlier requests for coffee and pain relief spray. Both the housemates and viewers enjoyed this lighthearted moment.\r\n4. A Hair-Raising Opportunity:\r\nDuring breakfast, Gautam playfully challenged Prithvi to shave his beard, which Prithvi declined. Bigg Boss then introduced a unique chance to add money to the winner's prize by offering Avinash and Prithvi cash rewards of \u20b925,000, \u20b950,000, or \u20b91 lakh for various haircuts. \r\n\r\nAlthough Prithvi declined, Avinash accepted the \u20b950,000 haircut after much deliberation, adding humour to the situation. He sportingly underwent the haircut, entertaining the audience with his witty remarks.\r\n5. Additional Reward:\r\nIn recognition of Avinash's spirit and courage, Bigg Boss added \u20b950,000 to the winner's prize pool. Furthermore, the house was granted an extra two hours of kitchen time as an additional reward.\r\n6. Selection of the Mega Chief:\r\nThe competition for the prestigious Mega Chief position was through a task called \"Pattuko ledha thappuko,\" in which contenders had to grab a bone placed in a circle before others. The first to seize the bone gained the advantage of eliminating one or two competitors from the race. Gautam ultimately secured the Mega Chief role after a fierce fight.\r\n7. A Slight Commotion:\r\nAt one point, Manikanta grabbed the bone and initially decided to eliminate Hariteja and Teja, citing a pre-game agreement with Gautam to stay in the competition until the end. \r\n\r\nHowever, Gautam denied having made any such deal, leading Manikanta to reconsider his choice and decide to eliminate Teja and Gautam. The situation was resolved by Nikhil, who, as the task Sanchalak, upheld Manikanta's original decision to remove Teja and Hariteja, despite Hariteja's objections.\r\n8. Gautam\u2019s Tribute for Women:\r\nAs the newly appointed Mega Chief, Gautam declared the upcoming week for the women in honour of the female audience. He announced that the women in the house would be exempt from performing household chores unless they volunteered, which garnered appreciation from the housemates and the audience.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the week's episodes, viewers eagerly await the weekend's special broadcasts, during which the host will analyze the housemates' performances\u2013 the weekend episodes air at 9 pm, half an hour earlier than the weekday schedule, on Disney+ Hotstar and Star Maa. \r\n\r\nBased on the above highlights of Day 47 and the promos, a compelling critique of the contestants' strategies and gameplay can be expected in Bigg Boss Telugu 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStay tuned to Yo!

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan's first century in Test cricket and Rishabh Pant's magnificent 99 may not be enough to stop New Zealand from securing their first Test victory on Indian soil in 36 years, with only 107 runs needed on the final day of a captivating series opener.As bad light and subsequent rain forced an early end to the fourth evening, Tom Latham (0) and Devon Conway (0) remained at the crease. The last time New Zealand emerged victorious in a Test match in India was in 1988, when Sir Richard Hadlee claimed 10 wickets at the Wankhede Stadium, ensuring a resounding 136-run triumph.114376004Latham's team is on the verge of making history, despite a valiant comeback by India, who scored 462 in their second innings. This was largely due to Sarfaraz's penchant for scoring big hundreds, which he carried from first-class to Test cricket with a brilliant 150 off 195 balls, and a partnership of 177 with a partially fit Rishabh Pant, who fell short of his seventh Test century by just one run.114376403India's resilience in Test cricket has been exemplified by remarkable second-innings performances, resulting in some of the most significant improvements in team scores between the first and second innings. 114373829The highest such improvement occurred during the iconic 2001 Kolkata Test against Australia, where India improved by 486 runs, going from 171 all out to declaring at 657/7. In 1999, India witnessed a 422-run improvement against New Zealand in Mohali, from 83 to 505/3 declared.114366921In a recent 2024 Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, India bounced back from a dismal 46 in the first innings to score 462, an improvement of 416 runs. A 375-run improvement took place in 1965 at Brabourne Stadium, where India posted 88 and then 463/5 declared, also against New Zealand. Finally, in Headingley, 1967, India turned the tables against England, improving by 346 runs, going from 164 to 510 in the second innings.",

        "text": "Dubai [UAE], October 19 (ANI):Both teams will be eying their first Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title as neither have won a Women\u2019s ODI World Cup earlier.South Africa, however, will be playing their second successive Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final after losing to Australia in the summit clash of the 2023 edition.The Protea women, however, knocked out three-time defending champions Australia, also record six-time Women\u2019s T20 WC winners, in the semi-finals this year.After defeating West Indies by 10 wickets in their opening Group B encounter, South Africa endured a seven-wicket defeat against England.Laura Wolvaardt\u2019s charges, however, bounced right back by beating Scotland and Bangladesh by 80 runs and 7 wickets, respectively, to make the semis, where they shocked Australia by eight wickets to earn a title shot.New Zealand, who were on a 10-match losing streak in T20Is heading into the tournament, followed a similar path to the final. The White Ferns beat India by 58 runs in their Group A opener but succumbed to a 60-run loss to Australia in their second outing.An eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and a comfortable 54-run win against Pakistan saw Sophie Devine\u2019s team cross paths with 2016 champions West Indies in the top four.A narrow eight-run win over the Windies saw New Zealand make their first summit clash since 2010. The White Ferns reached the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final in the first two editions but lost to England in 2009 before coming up short against Australia the following year.The 2024 Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final promises to be a fascinating contest between bat and ball with South African captain Laura Wolvaardt leading the run-scoring charts in the tournament while New Zealand spinner Amelie Kerr is the top wicket-taker.South Africa, though, seems the more balanced of the two sides ahead of the contest with Tazmin Brits, the tournament\u2019s second-highest run-scorer, and Nonkululeko Mlaba, the tournament\u2019s second-highest wicket-taker, also in their ranks. Head-to-head record, however, tilts the scale in New Zealand\u2019s favour, who have won 11 of the 16 meetings between the two sides. South Africa have four victories under their belt. \n\nSquads: South Africa-Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon.Travelling Reserve: Miane Smit.New Zealand-Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.

        "text": "Jordan Cox is poised to make his Test debut as England's wicketkeeper during their upcoming tour of New Zealand. This opportunity arises as Jamie Smith is set to miss part of the series due to paternity leave. Cox, who will turn 24 on Monday as per ESPNcricinfo, has been England's reserve batter for the last five Tests and now has the chance to make his mark in December. Smith and his partner are expecting their first child in mid-December, coinciding with either the second or third Test against New Zealand.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"Being at the birth of my son is not something I want to miss,\" he told the Daily Mail recently, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\"It will be a memory that I cherish more than any in cricket anyway, so if I lost my place because of it, so be it,\" he added.Cox made his international debut in England's T20I series against Australia last month and will soon join the squads for their upcoming white-ball tour to the Caribbean. Although he was unable to keep wicket for Essex this summer due to a severe finger injury sustained in the Hundred last year, he has been refining his wicketkeeping skills with Brendon McCullum in Pakistan.\"It's life, right?\" McCullum, who is the head coach of the England Cricket team said of Smith's absence.\"People have kids and we wish them all the best, to be there and support their partners. At this stage, it looks like Jamie will probably play the first [Test in New Zealand] and may miss the next two. We're not totally sure - it's up to Mother Nature a little - but we know we've got Jordan Cox in the squad here,\" McCullum said, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.England is confident in Cox's abilities, despite his limited recent experience behind the stumps, a belief reinforced by Smith's own selection earlier this summer while being second-choice at Surrey. McCullum, drawing from his own experience, considers New Zealand to be a comfortable place for wicketkeeping and is eager to evaluate Cox's performance at the Test level. McCullum describes Cox's glovework as \"solid.\"Cox, known for his self-assured nature, admitted that he would get \"bored\" after reaching 40 runs while playing for a struggling Kent side last year. Seeking a change to reignite his passion for four-day cricket, he moved to Essex, where he scored four centuries and averaged 65.57 in his first County Championship season.He took over the No. 4 spot at Essex, vacated by Dan Lawrence's move to Surrey. Lawrence's own recent experiences underscore the challenges of being England's spare batter. After performing well in the Caribbean in March 2022, Lawrence waited over two years for another opportunity in the middle order, only to be placed as an opener with predictable results. Consequently, Cox has now moved ahead of Lawrence in the selection order.Unless England loses a batter to injury or illness before Thursday's third Test in Rawalpindi, Cox will be added to the white-ball squads and travel to the Caribbean, likely alongside Rehan Ahmed. Marcus Trescothick, serving as interim white-ball coach for the three ODIs and five T20Is against the West Indies, has already departed Pakistan in preparation for that tour.Cox is expected to make his ODI debut during the Caribbean series, providing him with an opportunity to stake a late claim for a spot in England's squad for next year's Champions Trophy. However, it is the prospect of a Test debut later this year that could truly satisfy his ambitions and validate the extensive travel he will undertake in the first half of the English winter.\"He's annoyingly good at everything he does - particularly on the golf course,\" McCullum said.\"He's one of those guys that you look at and say he's got a high ceiling in terms of talent, particularly with bat in hand. There's a fair chance that he'll get the opportunity in New Zealand, if Jamie does return home, to bat down the order and take the gloves,\" he noted.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

This is in addition to speeding up the renovation works of rainwater-holding structures. As part of this effort, HYDRAA commissioner A.V. Ranganath, GHMC Khairatabad zonal commissioner Anuraag Jayanti and additional commissioner of city traffic P. Vishwaprasad inspected stormwater drains at the Lakdikapul area. The officials commenced the works to end waterlogging on the roads of the Lakdikapul area within a week.For this, the GHMC would renovate the stormwater drains, which are in a dilapidated condition, in and around the Lakdikapul area. The drain under the Lakdikapul railway bridge will also have to be renovated. The HYDRAA, in a press release, highlighted that due to the renovation of the rainwater-holding structure at the Raj Bhavan Road, the roads are not getting waterlogged even when that area receives 5 cm of rain. Earlier, the water used to stagnate on these roads even for a 2-cm rain.",

        "text": "Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) pipped their arch-rivals East Bengal FC (EBFC) by 2-0 in the high-octane Kolkata Derby of the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 campaign at the Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Saturday.As per the media release by ISL, Mohun Bagan Super Giant controlled the tempo of the match from start to finish, as a goal each from Jamie Maclaren and Dimitrios Petratos in either half was enough for Jose Molina\u2019s men to secure their eighth win against the Red and Gold Brigade (EBFC) in ISL.It was the 400th meet between both the sides overall.The players took their time to settle into the electrifying atmosphere of 60,000 odd fans buzzing at the stadium. It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. However, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.Despite the frustration, the Mariners (MBSG) maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.Their relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.The second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.Looking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.The 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.The Scottish midfielder was adjudged the player of the match and he continues to be Mohun Bagan Super Giant\u2019s main man in midfield. Stewart created three chances on the night while registering eight crosses. He also completed 31 out of his 35 attempted passes as per the media release by ISL.East Bengal FC will travel to Bhubaneswar to face Odisha FC in search of their first win of the season on October 22. On the other hand, Mohun Bagan Super Giant will be back in action again on October 30 when they will lock horns against Hyderabad FC away from home.",

        "text": "Manchester United eased the pressure on beleaguered boss Erik ten Hag as they fought back to beat Brentford 2-1, while Tottenham got back on track with a 4-1 rout of West Ham on Saturday. Ten Hag had defiantly slammed \"fairy tales and lies\" about his United future on Friday as the Dutchman insisted he was not in danger of the sack.

It is only one win, we have to build on this.\"United's first win in six games in all competitions was only their third victory in eight Premier League matches this term.They sit 10th in the table ahead of an intriguing week, featuring a Europa League trip to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce and a visit to West Ham.Tottenham scored three goals in eight second-half minutes against West Ham to ease the pain of their recent collapse in a 3-2 loss at Brighton. Mohammed Kudus' opener for West Ham was cancelled out before the break by Dejan Kulusevski.Tottenham ran riot after the interval thanks to Yves Bissouma's strike, an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and a fourth from Son Heung-min.It was a third win in four league games for Ange Postecoglou's men, heaping pressure on new West Ham coach Julen Lopetegui after his side's spluttering start to the season.\"Second half was outstanding from the lads -- good energy, good goals, good football,\" Postecoglou said.Leicester's great escapeBrighton moved up to fifth place with a 1-0 victory at Newcastle on a day of mixed emotions for Danny Welbeck, who scored the 35th-minute winner but was later stretchered off with a back injury that left him needing an oxygen mask.Leicester staged a stirring fightback to snatch a dramatic 3-2 victory at winless Southampton.Cameron Archer struck in the eighth minute before Joe Aribo's 28th-minute goal increased the lead for the bottom-of-the-table hosts.But Leicester's Facundo Buonanotte bundled home in the 64th minute before Ryan Fraser was sent off for conceding a penalty with a foul on Jamie Vardy.Vardy stroked in the 74th-minute leveller from the spot and Jordan Ayew drilled into the bottom corner in the eighth minute of stoppage-time.Fourth-placed Aston Villa have made their best start for 26 years after a 3-1 win at Fulham.Raul Jimenez netted in the fifth minute, but Villa's Morgan Rogers equalised four minutes later.Andreas Pereira had a penalty saved by Villa 'keeper Emiliano Martinez before the interval.Ollie Watkins' 59th-minute header completed the comeback and Fulham's Joachim Andersen was sent off for a professional foul on the Villa striker five minutes later.Issa Diop's 69th-minute own-goal sealed the win, although Villa had Jaden Philogene sent off for two yellow cards in three minutes.Everton clinched their first away win in 16 games in all competitions with a 2-0 victory against Ipswich.Iliman Ndiaye and Michael Keane scored to leave fourth-bottom Ipswich without a win in eight league games.Third-placed Arsenal will go top of the table if they win at Bournemouth in Saturday's final match.On Sunday, Liverpool, currently in pole position, host sixth-placed Chelsea, while champions Manchester City travel to Wolves.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Using a play on words with Klopp's last name, the home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and used a quote from their side's former boss: \"I like people until the point they disappoint me.\" A larger banner, in big red letters, asked Klopp if he had \"forgotten everything we gave you?\". A former player at the club, Klopp coached Mainz for seven years, taking the team to the top flight for the first time before moving to Borussia Dortmund and later Liverpool. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Klopp stepped down as Liverpool manager in the summer having won several titles, including the Premier League and Champions League. In October, Klopp announced he would join energy drink company Red Bull, which owns clubs in Leipzig, Salzburg and New York, as their global head of football from January 2025.His decision to take up the job at Red Bull has annoyed supporters in Germany -- particularly at ex-clubs Dortmund and Mainz -- who have a long-standing dislike of RB Leipzig.Some fans believe Leipzig, founded in 2009, are not consistent with Germany's 50+1 rule, which requires member control of clubs, while others have hit out at the multi-club ownership model used by Red Bull.Leipzig's win at Mainz sent the club, who are yet to lose in the league this season, top of the table -- at least until Bayern Munich's match against Stuttgart at home later on Saturday.Leipzig coach Marco Rose, who played under Klopp for several years at Mainz, dismissed the fans' criticism as a minority opinion. \"There are 35,000 people in the stadium, many of whom have an opinion. I believe that around 34,936 people love Kloppo for the fact that he shaped an era here, that we achieved something great together,\" said Rose. \"He was here in Mainz for a long time.\"Everyone has their own life somewhere and the right to decide things freely and for themselves. Not everyone has to love it.\"Rose added that: \"(He) didn't even notice (the banner), so it can't have been that wild.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Omar Marmoush sent Frankfurt 1-0 up, before Robert Andrich equalised for the champions midway through the first half and Boniface completed the comeback in the second period.

Marmoush showed Boniface how it is done, blasting a low shot left to give the visitors the lead on 16 minutes. The Egyptian now has an incredible nine goals and five assists in just seven league games this season.Andrich made good on his error soon afterwards, combining expertly with Adli and Martin Terrier to flit through the penalty area for a superb one-touch goal in the 25th minute.Boniface would also redeem himself, giving Leverkusen the lead inside the final 20 minutes, heading in a deflected cross from substitute Florian Wirtz to put the hosts on course for victory.Andrich told Sky Germany \"we were focused and played good football -- and there was a nice goal from me.\"The 30-year-old midfielder, who made his Germany debut last season after a career largely spent in the lower divisions, said of his performance: \"I always have fun playing football, but I maybe have to work a bit harder than the rest.\"Days out from their home Champions League clash with Liverpool, Leipzig beat Mainz to go top of the table, at least until Bayern Munich's home match against Stuttgart later on Saturday.At kick-off, the Mainz fans unveiled a series of banners critical of former coach Jurgen Klopp's decision to take over as football boss at Leipzig's parent company Red Bull. The home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and accused Klopp, who coached Mainz to a debut promotion before joining Borussia Dortmund and later Liverpool, of \"forgetting everything we gave you\".Still unbeaten this season in Germany despite two Champions League losses, Leipzig took the lead after 20 minutes thanks to an excellent solo effort from Xavi Simons. Leipzig captain Willi Orban tapped in a rebound from a Lois Openda cross to put his side 2-0 up.Orban told Sky: \"We could have finished things off earlier but we're happy with the win.\"Elsewhere, Freiburg continued their impressive start to the season with a 3-1 home win over Augsburg to go into outright second. Freiburg were three goals up at half-time, with Vincenzo Grifo, Philipp Lienhart and Christian Guenter scoring, before Augsburg's Phillip Tietz pulled one back in the second period.Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Tim Kleindienst scored a double, days after making his Germany debut, in a 3-2 home win over former club Heidenheim.Hoffenheim won their first game since their season opener, with Andrej Kramaric, Marius Buelter and Haris Tabakovic scoring in a 3-1 win over lowly Bochum, who sit last with just one point from seven games.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Samuel Chukwueze's 13th-minute strike looked like being the first of a comfortable win but ended up being the winning goal as Milan held on for the points.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Their task was made difficult by Tijjani Reijnders being sent off in the 29th minute for a clumsy foul on Sandi Lovric who would have been clean through on goal had the Netherlands midfielder not clipped his heels.Tammy Abraham should have sealed the points for Milan with 15 minutes remaining when he somehow managed, moments after replacing Alvaro Morata, to both fluff a golden chance on the rebound and injure his shoulder at the same time.The hosts looked to have been sucker-punched when Christian Kabasele bundled home for Udinese in the fifth minute of stoppage time, but a huge roar rang around the ground when, after a long VAR check, the goal was ruled out for Jurgen Ekkelenkamp's toes straying offside.Milan's win came in front of a flat San Siro following the decision of Milan's hardcore \"ultras\" supporters to stand in silence for most of the match in protest at what they claim is a law enforcement and Italian media campaign against them.Leading ultras from both Milan and local rivals Inter -- at Roma on Sunday night -- were arrested last month and are accused of a variety of crimes raging from criminal conspiracy and extortion to assault.Earlier this week Milan's ultras groups refuted allegations by investigators of any involvement in ticket touting, control of parking and sales from concession stands near the San Siro.In the meantime police banned the ultras' large \"Curva Sud Milano\" from being hung out in that section, leading to supporters around the whole stadium, not just ultras, from leaving their own banners and flags at home.Instead fans in the Curva Sud held a banner in support of their arrested allies which read, loosely translated, \"Stay strong boys\".Later Juventus can move level with Napoli with a win over in-form Lazio, although Thiago Motta's side have been hit by series of injuries.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Hyderabad: In medical advancement, documentation of medical history and heritage plays a very important role. Unknown to many, Hyderabad houses a national institute that documents the history of Indian medical systems. Hidden away in the lanes of Gaddiannaram, Dilsukhnagar, the National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH), is a rich resource for historians and researchers studying traditional Indian medical systems like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and several components of modern medicine. The institute was formerly known as the National Centre of Indian Medical Heritage.The institute came into existence as the upgraded Department of History of Medicine in 1956 under the government of Andhra Pradesh and was handed over to the government of India in 1969. It was earlier housed on the third floor of Osmania Medical College and shifted to its present premises in 2009. Currently functioning under the administrative control of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), ministry of AYUSH, the government of India, it houses a medical history library with over 10,000 books, including rare publications dating back to the 15th century. Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) designated NIIMH as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Fundamental and Literary Research in Traditional Medicine. Shedding light on the rich medical history of Telangana, director of the institute G. P. Prasad said, \"One of the earliest inscriptions, dating back to 400 AD, was found in Phanigiri, Mulugu. It mentions Agrabhisaja, a chief physician, who served under King Devasena. This inscription highlights the reverence for medical practitioners, who were even allowed to erect Dharmachakras (sacred pillars) as a symbol of their importance in society.\" \"Another key piece of medical history is the Sirur inscription from 1,100 AD in Medak. It references Aggalayya, a Jain scholar, Ayurvedic physician and surgeon. Known for his surgical expertise, Aggalayya taught the art of surgery to students from across India and served under four different dynasties. His contributions earned him the title of 'Samanta Raja', a subordinate king, underscoring his stature in society,\" Dr Prasad highlighted. In Yaragudi (currently in Andhra Pradesh), Ashoka inscriptions mention the establishment of both veterinary and human hospitals, along with the importation of medicinal plants from surrounding regions. During the era of the Nizams, we see the rise of Unani medicine alongside Ayurveda. The Nizams supported the development of Unani, and the region became a hub for both systems of medicine. \"Today, more than 200 medical inscriptions have been collected by our institution,\" Dr Prasad informed. Furthermore, the records from Tirumukkuddal in Tamil Nadu even detail the establishment of a 15-bed inpatient department with designated surgeons, physicians, and staff, providing a clear picture of early hospital management, the director explained. Housing two museums dedicated to medical history, the NIIMH showcases some original and thematic art and artifacts. The certificates of the first woman anaestheologist, Lady Rupa Bai Furdoonji; the first batch of students of Hyderabad Medical School; some paintings showing Edward Lawrie's Chloroform Commissions; replicas of surgical instruments mentioned in Susruta Samhita, the first surgeon of India, are some of the exhibits dedicated to Hyderabad. Through initiatives like the AYUSH Manuscripts Advanced Repository (AMAR) portal, the NIIMH has cataloged an impressive 16,000 AYUSH manuscripts, with 4,249 digitised. The Institute\u2019s digital endeavours also include the Showcase of Ayurvedic Historical Imprints (SAHI) portal, which features nearly 800 medico-historical artifacts and the e-books of the AYUSH project, offering digital versions of classical textbooks. The Journal of Indian Medical Heritage run by the NIIMH has published writings that mention how Ayurveda dawned during the reign of Nizams, some manuscripts from the Qutub Shahi period, a history of Anaesthesia and Hyderabad Chloroform Commission, list of Arabic, Persian and Urdu Medical Manuscripts, growth of the hospital system in Hyderabad and many more topics, providing readers with insights into Hyderabad's rich medical heritage.",

        "text": "Survey to Identify High-Risk Areas; Will Run from October 21 to November 21\n\nIn response to the rising incidents of landslides and land subsidence in Himachal Pradesh\u2019s capital, Shimla, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) is set to launch a drone-based LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) survey. This survey, which will run from October 21 to November 21, aims to thoroughly assess the city\u2019s geographical conditions and identify areas most vulnerable to landslides. The initiative comes at the recommendation of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), reflecting growing concern over Shimla\u2019s environmental stability.\n\nTo ensure the smooth operation of the survey, necessary formalities for drone usage in Shimla\u2019s no-fly zones have been completed, and permission has been granted for areas under the army\u2019s control. A consultancy firm has been tasked with carrying out the LIDAR survey and is expected to submit its comprehensive report by November 21.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Anupam Kashyap emphasized the importance of this initiative, noting that the survey\u2019s primary goal is to accurately assess the instability of Shimla\u2019s terrain and prepare for future risks. \u201cThis survey will not only enhance the safety of Shimla\u2019s residents but will also contribute to the city\u2019s infrastructure development,\u201d he added.\n\nHow the Survey Will Work\n\nThe LIDAR technology used in this survey will create a detailed 3D image of Shimla\u2019s geographical features through laser pulses emitted from drones. These pulses reflect off the ground and return to sensors, providing precise data on the depth, height, and surface of the terrain. This information will be critical in identifying areas prone to landslides and will help pinpoint the underlying causes of these dangerous incidents. With this knowledge, the SDMA hopes to implement effective preventive measures to minimize future risks.\n\nLandslides: A Growing Threat in Shimla\n\nShimla has seen a sharp increase in landslides over the past few years, particularly during the monsoon season, when heavy rains destabilize the already fragile terrain. These landslides have led to widespread destruction, including blocked roads, damaged homes, and the displacement of numerous families. Experts attribute the worsening situation to unchecked construction on the hills and environmental imbalances, further straining the city\u2019s stability.\n\nThe implementation of drone-based LIDAR technology is expected to be a game-changer in tackling Shimla\u2019s landslide crisis. By enabling a more accurate understanding of the city\u2019s topography and vulnerabilities, authorities will be better equipped to devise sustainable solutions to mitigate the impact of landslides. With the increasing threat of climate change and urban expansion, such advanced technological interventions are becoming essential in ensuring the safety and long-term sustainability of hill cities like Shimla.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Pakistan\u2019s young fast bowler Ihsanullah sparked debate with his recent statement on the Public Digital News podcast, where he claimed that Naseem Shah is a better bowler than India\u2019s star pacer Jasprit Bumrah. He remarked, \u201cAgar dekha jaaye toh Jasprit Bhumrah se accha bowler Naseem Shah hai (If you look at it, Naseem Shah is a better bowler than Jasprit Bumrah).\u201dWhen the host countered Ihsanullah by pointing out that Bumrah\u2019s performances have been superior on paper, the young bowler remained steadfast. The 22-year-old pacer defended his stance, saying, \u201cNaseem Shah also performed well in the 2022 World Cup. Sometimes players can go through a rough patch for a year, but Naseem is still better.\u201dWatch:\u2014 Varungiri0 (@Varungiri0) This bold statement comes amid comparisons between two of the most talented pacers in world cricket today. Bumrah, known for his pinpoint yorkers and ability to thrive under pressure, has been a vital asset for India across formats. Naseem Shah, on the other hand, has showcased his raw pace and swing, becoming a key figure for Pakistan at a very young age.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyghnymvkF8&pp=ygULSWhzYW4gVWxsYWg%3DInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time Pakistani players have preferred Naseem Shah over Bumrah. In an earlier podcast appearance, former Pakistan captain Babar Azam was asked whom he would trust for the final over in a high-pressure T20 match with 10 runs to defend. Without hesitation, Babar replied, \u201cNaseem Shah.\u201d Bumrah\u2019s track record, however, speaks for itself. In the 2024 T20 World Cup, he finished as the third-highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets and was named Player of the Tournament for title-winning Team India. His brilliant two-wicket haul in the final helped India defeat South Africa, securing their first major ICC trophy in 11 years.",

        "text": "Mumbai City FC grabbed their first victory of the Indian Super League 2024-25 season with a 2-1 win in a closely-fought encounter against FC Goa at the Fatorda Stadium on Saturday. \n\nThe Islanders extended their unbeaten streak to 13 games against the Gaurs to reaffirm their upper hand in the recent history of the fixture. Two strikes in the first half from Nikalos Karelis and Yoell van Niff were sufficient for the Islanders with Armando Sadiku spot-kick ending up as a consolation goal for the home side.\n\nMidfielder Van Nieff was the best player on the pitch as he repeatedly penetrated the hosts\u2019 well-organised defence with his range of passing. Hmingthanmawia Ralte, commonly known as Valpuia, was an energetic presence for Mumbai City FC and it was he who earned a free-kick for them from the right flank in the 21st minute that led to the Karelis' opener.\n\nVan Nieff stepped up on the set-piece and delivered a perfectly dipping curled ball inside the box that met an onrushing Nikolaos Karelis at the centre of the 18-yard area. Karelis thundered the ball into the back of the net through his head, getting the Islanders an important lead in the contest. \n\nSeven minutes later, former Mumbai City FC midfielder Rowllin Borges came close to helping Sadiku secure the equaliser for FC Goa. Now with the Gaurs, Borges squared up a pass to Sadiku from the right flank, and the striker twice attempted to score but to no avail.\n\nVan Nieff ensured to capitalise on a moment in the 40th minute, driving an attack forward with his sheer pace and trickery on the ball. He dazzled ahead from the middle, but instead of taking the passing route, the 31-year-old opted to test his fortunes from distance. The ball landed into the bottom left corner and helped Mumbai City FC head into the half-time break with a comfortable two-goal lead.\n\nIn the second half, Valpuia committed a foul on Sadiku inside the 18-yard box in the 54th minute. He was shown a yellow card for the same and Sadiku made sure that he didn\u2019t fluff this time, hammering the ball into the top right corner a minute later to give FC Goa a sneak back into the proceedings. \n\nMumbai City FC held their nerves impressively thereafter though, as FC Goa could not turn the tides despite coach Manolo Marquez making some inspired substitutions with Dejan Drazic and Nim Dorjee coming on late into the game",

It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. \n\nHowever, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.\n\nDespite the frustration, the Mariners maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.\n\nTheir relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.\n\nThe second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.\n\nLooking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.\n\nThe 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.",

        "text": "Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior's goals earned Real Madrid an entertaining 2-1 win at Celta Vigo on Saturday to pull them level with La Liga leaders Barcelona. France striker Mbappe started and sent the Spanish champions ahead amid reports he is being investigated for an alleged rape during a visit to Sweden. The 25-year-old was criticised in his homeland for not appearing in his country's recent Nations League matches before the Swedish media reports emerged following his trip during the international break, which Mbappe labelled \"fake news\".\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Williot Swedberg levelled for Celta, who might have snatched a draw, but Vinicius tucked home what proved Madrid's winner after 66 minutes.Madrid, unbeaten in 42 La Liga matches, host Barcelona next weekend in the Clasico, after the Catalans welcome Sevilla on Sunday.\"I'm happy because we won after the international break which is not always easy,\" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told Real Madrid TV.\"When they equalised our changes gave new energy to the team and it was a very important win.\"(Mbappe and Vinicius) trained very well in the break, improved their conditions, and they started today's game very well and they have to continue.\"With captain Dani Carvajal sidelined for months to come, Ancelotti replaced the Spanish right-back with Lucas Vazquez.The Italian set up with a three centre-back system, breaking away from his favoured four-man defensive line to accomodate Vazquez as a wing-back.Celta Vigo midfielder Swedberg missed a fine opening in the first half with Thibaut Courtois tipping his effort wide when the Swede ran through on goal.Madrid's new look defence gave Celta plenty of breathing room in attack but the visitors also looked dangerous at the other end, without carving out clear-cut chances.Mbappe slammed Madrid ahead with a long-range effort, which flew into the top corner after Fran Beltran gave the ball away and Eduardo Camavinga laid it off to the striker.It was the forward's first strike from outside the area for Madrid, his sixth league goal and his eighth in 12 appearances across all competitions since joining from Paris Saint-Germain this summer.Celta striker Borja Iglesias rolled home from an offside position as Claudio Giraldez's mid-table side searched for an equaliser.It was a scrappy yet lively clash and Vinicius headed over Fede Valverde's cross and fired a near post effort off-target before the break.Swedberg pulled Celta level with a calm finish in the 51st minute after a fine move from the Galicians, with former Barcelona defender Oscar Mingueza curling in a low cross for the midfielder to stroke home.Vinicius had a goal ruled out for offside against Mbappe in the build-up as the second half continued with the same openness as the first.'A top professional'Javier Manquillo made a brave block to deny Mbappe before Ancelotti sent on veteran midfielder Luka Modric to try and regain control of the match.The 39-year-old Croatian, who became Real Madrid's oldest ever player ahead of 1950s and 1960s Hungarian great Ferenc Puskas, made an instant impact.Less than three minutes after coming on, Modric produced a superb low pass to play in Vinicius, who slid Madrid in front past Vicente Guaita.\"It's a pleasure to coach Modric, to work with him, everything he's been able to achieve and is achieving, he deserves -- he's a top professional and a great guy,\" said Ancelotti.Courtois thwarted Jonathan Bamba after the midfielder darted in behind Antonio Rudiger and tried to prod home.Celta substitute Anastasios Douvikas should have levelled in stoppage time but rolled wide with just Courtois to beat.\"It's bittersweet because we went toe-to-toe with Real Madrid and we were better for much of the game, but we're left with the feeling once more that for our mistakes we let in two goals,\" said Celta midfielder Beltran.\"It would be easy to say 'this is Real Madrid', but (our) team was better... we lost three points, but I think we played a very good game.\"Earlier, Athletic Bilbao moved provisionally fourth by thumping Espanyol 4-1.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "A new champion will emerge in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium, as South Africa and New Zealand face off in the final.Both teams have exceeded expectations to reach this stage, demonstrating resilience, skill, and determination throughout the tournament.South Africa, runners-up in the 2023 edition, are aiming to go one step further and lift the coveted trophy. Meanwhile, New Zealand, who were runners-up in both 2009 and 2010, are equally determined to break their finals curse and claim their first T20 World Cup title.Both sides have been exceptional during the tournament, and the final promises an exciting clash between two teams eager to secure their maiden T20 World Cup crown.If the rest of the tournament is any indication, cricket fans are in for a thrilling conclusion.Full of twists and turns, the tournament\u2019s bragging rights and trophy will once again head south of the equator\u2013this time to either South Africa or New Zealand\u2013after the Proteas\u2019 emphatic win over defending champions Australia.On the other side of the draw, New Zealand made headlines by thrashing India in their opening match and holding their nerve in a semi-final win over the West Indies.New Zealand are looking to claim their second ICC trophy, their first being the ICC Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup in 2000. South Africa, on the other hand, are hoping to break their title drought and secure their first-ever ICC trophy.Reflecting on the potential victory, Chloe Tryon said, as quoted by the ICC, \u201cIt would mean so much. We\u2019ve had incredible support back home, and we really want to unite the country. We wish the whole nation could be here with us, but we\u2019ve got plenty of South Africans cheering us on from the stands. Honestly, I don\u2019t think words can describe how much it would mean to us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re playing for everyone\u2013our families, friends, and all those back home gathering in different places to watch and support us. It would be such a special moment. Hopefully, we can make it happen on Sunday,\u201d she added.Suzie Bates also reflected on the significance of winning, saying, \u201cTo be honest, ever since 2009, as a cricketer, when you play team sports, your ultimate goal is to be a world champion. I think all those tournaments have motivated me, and I know they\u2019ve motivated Sophie as well. Some of the younger girls, fortunately or unfortunately, don\u2019t have that same extra motivation.\u201d\u201cBut yes, it feels like everything has built up to this moment, and we get one more opportunity tomorrow to have a good game. The most overwhelming thing is that it\u2019s felt like a really long journey to get back to this point,\u201d Bates added.Squads:South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe TryonNew Zealand: Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.

        "title": "The storm that wasn\u2019t: how Chennai fared",
        "text": "When this year\u2019s first rain spell of northeast monsoon arrived with a downpour a few days ago, scenes of inundation from previous years were indeed repeated. But many areas of the city recovered within a day, partly because of the concerted efforts and immediate preparation of Tamil Nadu government agencies to face extreme situations and weather warning, and also because the rain stopped earlier than expected.\n\nAlso Read: In Pictures | Aftermath of Tamil Nadu rains\n\nSeeking lessons from last year\u2019s Cyclone Michaung that spelled disaster, the government had prepared for disaster management and planned for flood-relief and rescue operations. About 300 flood-relief centres were opened and food was distributed through 98 community kitchens. The field reviews by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, Ministers and officials helped accelerate flood-management work in different parts of the city.\n\nAlso Read: How Cyclone Michaung formed, intensified, rained, and dissipated | Explained\n\nSanitation workers and Greater Chennai Corporation workers persevered round the clock, bailing out stagnant water with heavy-duty pumps and clearing garbage and sewage. The appointment of nodal officers to coordinate among agencies helped to monitor the work.\n\nAlert downgraded\n\nAlthough Chennai recorded an average rainfall of 13 cm-14 cm on October 15, parts of the city and those on the fringes received more than 20 cm. Cholavaram, with the heaviest rainfall of 30 cm, Red Hills with 28 cm, and Avadi with 25 cm, bore the brunt. In contrast to the extreme weather event predicted for over two days when the Regional Meteorological Centre issued a red alert, rainfall ceased on October 16 as the depression changed its trajectory and weakened. S. Balachandran, Additional Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said, \u201cThere is no perfect forecasting system, and not all systems are fully understood. Each depression behaves differently due to thermodynamical conditions. When the system was in the ocean, there was a risk involved; which is why, we issued the alert. It was to caution people not to panic. Understanding weather systems is a continuous process.\u201d\n\nWeather experts suggested that extension agents be trained in assisting disaster management agencies in translating forecasts into alerts. Raghu Murtugudde, professor at IIT Bombay, said, \u201cThe extension agents will be experts in communicating the alerts in regional languages and guiding people to appropriate actions. There are some systematic biases in extreme rainfall predictions since the tropical systems explode rapidly and are hard to predict.\u201d\n\nThe Chennai Corporation estimated that about 540 localities reported waterlogging, including TNHB Colony at Korattur, Venus Colony at Alwarpet, and G.K.M. Colony at Kolathur. Korattur and Red Hills were among the worst-affected places, where localities were marooned well after the rainfall abated. People had to be rescued in boats at Korattur and drones were deployed to deliver relief materials to residents of Kumaran Colony at Red Hills. Water receded quickly in many inundated areas of south Chennai by the morning of October 16. Geeta Padmanabhan of Thiruvanmiyur said that while a few avenues escaped as drains were desilted, residents had to endure water stagnation for two days in areas like Kamaraj Nagar as the storm-water drain was not desilted.\n\nIn areas around Old Mahabalipuram Road, which get engulfed in water every monsoon, residents like Raj Natarajan of Semmencheri expressed concerns over recurrence of waterlogging in some areas unless Okkiyum Maduvu and the marsh opposite the ELCOT SEZ are cleaned. But it was also true that areas prone to flooding showed visible changes following interventions. The interventions and infrastructure improvements since last year did bring about a change in areas including parts of Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Tansi Nagar, S.V.S. Nagar at Valasaravakkam, Porur junction, Poonamallee High Road near St. Andrew\u2019s Church, and Narayanapuram.\n\nAlso Read: Chennai Rains: Volunteers for the season\n\nExtensive desilting of storm-water drains and construction of a new drain network to a distance of 785 km, out of the planned 1,135 km across the city, have made the difference this time, say Corporation officials. The reconstruction of the Thanikachalam Nagar drain, which was in a shambles for years, seems to have resolved the recurrent issues of flooding at Kolathur and Madhavaram. The storm-water drain built by the Highways Department helped 12 stagnation points on the East Coast Road.\n\nHiccups persist\n\nHowever, there were hiccups in terms of the tardy implementation of the storm-water drain and flood-mitigation projects, missing and incomplete links in the drains, and lack of connectivity between the drains and the water channels. A delay in getting approval from the Highways Department held up the construction of a channel linking the Narayanapuram lake to the Pallikaranai marsh through the 200-Feet Radial Road. The Chennai Corporation has identified nearly 50 locations, including Vembuliamman Koil Street at K.K.Nagar, for gaps in the drain network.\n\nThe Metro Rail construction poses a major challenge this monsoon. It has aggravated the waterlogging in south Chennai where residents say the drains get clogged by debris. Nearly 22 locations in the vicinity of the Metro Rail construction sites in various zones were flooded. For instance, the Corporation installed 19 pumps to bail out water from Millers Road and Purasawalkam High Road, but water drained only after a few days. \u201cWorkers dump debris clogging the drains. They are unaware of the consequences. Excavation at the construction site takes away road space and obstructs the natural flow of water,\u201d says a source at Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). The situation remains grim in some localities of north Chennai that stare at imminent waterlogging owing to incomplete civic projects. Pulianthope, Pattalam, Perambur, Choolai, and Vyasarpadi, which have faced inundation for years, remained flooded even after the rain stopped on October 16.\n\nDevelopment projects executed at Madipakkam, another flood-prone area, had open ends, making the locality vulnerable to inundation. Kuberan Nagar Extension, Ram Nagar South Extension, LIC Nagar, and Govindasamy Nagar were affected, owing to incomplete road projects and storm-water drains and the absence of link to waterways. P. Saravana Kumar, founder of Madipakkam Social Service Trust, points out that rain in the days to come would determine the impact of the storm-water drain. The surplus water channel from the Keelkattalai lake needs to be improved to end flooding at Madipakkam.\n\nHowever, Corporation officials say that compared with last year, water stagnation has come down at Madipakkam after the storm-water drain was built and roads were restored. A few streets suffered from minor issues. Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Works) V. Sivakrishnamurthy says the work to prevent inundation near the Ganesapuram subway in north Chennai will be completed in a few weeks as Southern Railway has agreed to permit line block to build a culvert beneath the tracks.\n\nIn neighbouring Tiruvallur district, which was battered by massive rain, officials of the rank of Deputy Collector supervised the work in taluks and ensured better coordination. \u201cWe have no control over water release as the Araniyar and Kosasthalaiyar originate in Andhra Pradesh. This time, we got live updates from Andhra Pradesh through our engineers,\u201d says Collector T. Prabhushankar.\n\nThe space for buffer storage in major reservoirs saved the city from riverine flooding this time and the rivers\u2019 capacity has been improved by 30%. The projects implemented by the Water Resources Department (WRD) to improve major waterways and surplus courses and the controlled water release from the lakes instilled confidence in officials of managing a rainfall of up to 30 cm-40 cm. The department implemented additional projects costing Rs. 2.30 crore to desilt the major waterways. However, Virugambakkam and Anna Nagar residents point to the insufficient carrying capacity of canals, including Virugambakkam-Arumbakkam canal and Otteri Nullah, and lack of desilting. They flag the risk of floodwater spillover and malfunctioning of the drain network during the rain.\n\nPermanent solution?\n\nThe government had been preparing for three months to tackle the monsoon, said Mr. Stalin. He also said a permanent solution to water stagnation would be found soon. The pending projects, based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee for Mitigation and Management of Flood Risk in the Chennai Metropolitan Area, led by former IAS official V. Thiruppugazh, would be finished soon.\n\nMayor R. Priya said, \u201cWe shortlisted the issues faced last year, constituency-wise, and started sorting them out since July. We had plans for 35 low-level areas and installed 100-HP motors in flood-prone locations. A coordination committee was formed to address issues of waterlogging where the Metro Rail project is in progress.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are working to remove the floating garbage from the canals and clean the silt catch pits. We are planning to resolve issues in areas where we have faced problems so far this year.\u201d\n\nTwo government agencies that managed to function almost seamlessly were Chennai Metrowater and Tangedco. Power shutdown was averted except at a few places like west Velachery and T. Nagar where water stagnation on roads and leakage of underground cables resulted in the outages. The sewers carried nearly 953 million litres of sewage on October 15, as against the daily load of 650 million litres. Additional sewer equipment, replacement of sewers in vulnerable locations, and monitoring of leaks through the GIS command centre helped the water agency.\n\nSources in the WRD note that unless the 29 macro drains, including Otteri Nullah, Veerangal Odai, and Captain Cotton Canal, are made free of encroachments and desilted, the scope of flood control will be limited. A wholistic, long-term flood management plan for the entire Chennai Metropolitan Area, instead of Chennai in isolation, would make the city flood-proof. The government must frame a policy to freeze development near waterbodies and waterways.\n\nExperts say the city is not fully prepared for flood management and mitigation. Chennai is largely involved in firefighting rather than finding comprehensive solutions for urban flood resilience. S. Thirunavukkarasu, former Public Works Department official who specialises in hydraulics and hydrology, says, \u201cWhat we are doing now, including construction of storm-water drains, is crisis management. We need to find the root cause of flooding in each watercourse. A comprehensive policy for restoration of waterbodies, with stringent strategies to increase storage to match their annual run-off, and re-establishing the missing links is needed.\u201d Deepening waterbodies would be one of the strategies to shield Chennai from floods and droughts, he adds.\n\n(With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez, Sunitha Sekar, R.

        "summary": "The first \u2018storm\u2019 this monsoon season, for a variety of reasons, did not drown the city as it was feared. The primary reason was that the actual forecast was off the mark, the low pressurein the Bay of Bengal did two things \u2014 it veered off course and lost power, stopping short of the pounding rain forecast. Further, work in terms of building storm-water networks within the city, the constant presence of Ministers and officials overseeing relief work on the ground, and the partnership with a vast network of civic volunteers, all influenced the outcome positively. However, some areas still struggled with water stagnation for a couple of days at least even after the rain ceased. K. Lakshmi finds out more.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has consistently expressed his deep love for Test cricket, which he views as the pinnacle of the sport. Throughout his career, Kohli has often spoken about the unique challenges that the longest format of the game presents, emphasizing that it tests a player's character, mental strength, and skill across different conditions. What adds to Kohli's superstar aura is his energetic and passionate interaction with crowds during matches. One of his signature gestures on the field is when he turns toward the stands and pumps up the crowd, urging them to cheer louder. This act of rallying the crowd is typical of Kohli's aggressive and enthusiastic approach to the game, whether he's batting, fielding, or captaining. It shows his deep connection with fans and his ability to channel the energy of the crowd into his own performance and that of the team.And when that crowd belongs to his IPL team RCB, then they will surely respond to Virat's calls.With India needing quick wickets in a bid to defend a low score of 107 against New Zealand on Day 5, Virat, standing in the slips urged the crowd to make some more noise.A clip of the moment was shared by the official broadcaster:\u2014 JioCinema (@JioCinema) Kohli often makes this gesture during pivotal moments in matches, especially in high-pressure situations. Whether it's urging support during a crucial partnership, celebrating a key wicket, or raising the energy during tense periods, Kohli's ability to involve the fans plays a significant role in creating an intense atmosphere. His charisma and emotional expressions on the field not only lift the morale of the team but also amplify the excitement in the stadium.This crowd interaction is one of the many reasons Kohli has such a strong bond with Indian cricket fans, who see him as not just a player but a passionate leader who thrives on the collective energy of the team and the spectators.",

        "text": "New Zealand survived a hostile Jasprit Bumrah spell to foil India's attempt to add a final-day twist to an absorbing series-opener, slaying the cricketing giants at home by eight wickets and ending a 36-year long wait to taste Test success in the country, here Sunday This is Kiwis' first Test win on the Indian soil after the John Wright-led outfit towelled India by 136 runs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, way back in 1988. Even hunting a modest 107 on the fifth day against a world-class attack could be nervy, and New Zealand did that after some initial scares. Will Young (48 not out) and Rachin Ravindra (39 not out) fuelled their chase with a 75-run stand for the third wicket, handholding their side a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");However, the Indians will not be an entirely despondent lot despite the defeat as they showed admirable spunk to claw back from the depths of getting bowled out for 46 in the first innings.They will need to build on it and pretty quickly too as the second Test at Pune starts on October 24.The Rohit Sharma-marshalled side will also have to think deeply about retaining Sarfaraz Khan, who made a 150 in the second dig, as Shubman Gill is poised to return after recovering from a stiff neck.The other point they will moot long is whether to go back to the three-pacer strategy or continue three spinners, a move which backfired here spectacularly, in Pune.New Zealand victory did not come without its share of drama once the day's play started at 10.15am, a wet outfield pushing back the proceedings by an hour.Bumrah (2/29), operating from the dressing room end, found appreciable movement and Tom Latham fell in the first over of the day itself for his overnight naught.Latham was behind the ball to cover the in-dipper but it swung back further to thud on to his pads as umpire Michael Gough raised his finger after vociferous appeal from the bowler and the crowd.The New Zealand captain reviewed the decision more in hope than in conviction and the DRS confirmed his worst fears as well, and he had to walk back.India might just have felt the absence of a third pacer as both Bumrah and Siraj found movement and carry to trouble the Kiwi batters under a largely overcast skies.Kuldeep Yadav, who gave away 26 runs in three overs, had replaced Akash Deep in the eleven for this Test after India went with a three-pronged pace attack against Bangladesh recently.Devon Conway, the other overnight batter, was shaky throughout his stay and would consider himself fortunate to have found a last-minute edge on a Bumrah skidder that otherwise would have trapped him plumb in front.But as luck would have it, the ball beat the gully fielder and raced to the fence.However, the left-hander eventually reached the road's end when Bumrah, operating from around the stumps, caught him right in front of the wicket with another one that skidded and swung back into him.The on-field umpire did not relent but the DRS upheld India's appeal to send Conway (17) back.New Zealand were 35 for two at that point, and one would say the match in balance as a couple of more strikes could have left the cat among the pigeons.But Young and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, found some solidity to resist the Indian charge.Once the sun came out for a while, the ball-movement was much more predictable and the Kiwi batters used favourable conditions to rack in a few boundaries to ease the pressure.Ravindra Jadeja, who started with a no-ball, too did not make much of an impression, conceding 14 runs in his first two overs.There was not much on the Chinnaswamy pitch for him to exploit either as the 22-yard track did not disintegrate on the final day, courtesy rain and cooler climes here.With the margin getting reduced alongside each run, the New Zealand batters became more daring and brought out their shots from the shelf, such as a clean hoist over mid-wicket for a six off left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep.The defining moment came when Will Young turned Jadeja for two to collect the winning runs as Kiwis dressing room turned into a hub of celebration.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Under overcast skies, the ball seamed around appreciably, Jasprit Bumrah threatened to pick a wicket every second delivery, and the crowd appealed almost every ball, but New Zealand absorbed it all to ease their way to the target of 107 once things settled down a touch.Will Young was the calming influence after Bumrah got Tom Latham second ball of the day, but Devon Conway did his bit - jumping around, wearing blows on the body, but not playing loose shots. By the time Bumrah finally got Conway for 17 off 39 balls, he was at the fag end of his spell and New Zealand had got 35 on the board already. The fielders did their bit, having saved at least 11 runs by then.Thereupon, though, India's misreading of the pitch came back to hurt them. They didn't have a third seamer to use the conditions, and Young and Rachin Ravindra knocked off the remaining runs with relative ease.While Bumrah bowled, though, you struggled to see where the next run would come from. He drew 22 false shots in eight overs, consistently drawing movement off the surface. Latham might have thought he had the accurate inswinger covered, but the ball pitched and nipped in even further to get him. Conway thought he had the angle covered from around the wicket, but this one swung after pitching, beginning to change its path halfway between pitching and reaching Conway, beating the outside edge and trapping him in front.Bumrah was in his seventh over now, and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, all but sealed the deal when he got two boundaries off the first three balls he faced. He steered the first one behind square, and then got the rare loose ball from Bumrah - a full one on the pads.Young then paddled and punched Ravindra Jadeja for boundaries in his first over to get the package ready. Not trusting the Bengaluru weather to hold up after lunch, the two batters attacked the spinners to put a nice little bow on the top. Young's drop-kicked six off Kuldeep Yadav was even Mark Waugh-like.India made a remarkable comeback from being bowled out for 46 in the first innings, but in the end, New Zealand hung in long enough to seal only their third Test win in India.\r\n\r\nSource link",

We knew what lies ahead, get as many as possible. A couple of guys stood out, was great to watch. When you're 350 behind, you can't think too much.

Both teams have surpassed expectations, displaying resilience, skill, and determination throughout the tournament.Bates, Devine, and Tahuhu collectively boast an impressive 402 Women\u2019s T20I appearances between them.Moments after New Zealand\u2019s stunning win over West Indies in the semi-finals of the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024, there was a heartwarming moment as three of New Zealand\u2019s most experienced players embraced and posed for the cameras.\u201cWe are the grandmas of the team,\u201d Bates remarked a day ahead of the final, referring to herself, Sophie Devine, and Lea Tahuhu, as quoted by the ICC.\u201cWe are still standing, I think.

Bates delivered the final over, with 14 runs to defend, after contributing a crucial knock at the top of the order, while Tahuhu claimed the vital wicket of Hayley Matthews when the match was on a knife-edge.Devine, as captain, has been outstanding and will step down from the role after the tournament, hoping to sign off on Sunday with the trophy in hand.\u201cI think she has been absolutely brilliant in her captaincy,\u201d Bates said.\u201cShe\u2019s been so calm.

It\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s stepping down, but thankfully it\u2019s just as captain,\u201d she added.A title win would not only be a fantastic way for the trio to cap off a successful tournament, but it would also send an inspiring message to women in their 30s, says Bates, who is set to become the most-capped player in women\u2019s international cricket.\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m over 35 and still competing, and that I\u2019ve never given up on my dream, I think, sends a message. As women, there\u2019s often societal pressure to give up on pursuing your dreams,\u201d Bates said.\u201cPeople expect you to do other things at a certain age, and that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about women\u2019s sport\u2013it\u2019s growing every day, breaking down barriers. It\u2019s not just young players; we have players in our team returning after having children,\u201d she concluded.Sunday\u2019s final is scheduled for 18:00 local time at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

        "text": "Fort Lauderdale: Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will feature in next year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced on Saturday. Messi and his team-mates will kick-off the tournament in the opening game at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, on Sunday, June 15, Infantino added. The FIFA president was speaking on the field at Inter's Chase Stadium moments after Messi scored a hat-trick as the team broke the MLS regular season points record with a 6-2 win over the New England Revolution. Miami, who this month won Major League Soccer's Supporters' Shield for the best regular season record, will take the qualification slot designated for the host nation. \"Inter Miami qualifies as the host country representative team on the basis of the club's outstanding and consistent 34-match campaign that saw them secure the shield with two MLS matches to play,\" FIFA said in a statement. The official champions of MLS are determined by the MLS Cup playoffs which begin next week and conclude with the final on December 7. Miami are the favourites to win the playoffs but the FIFA decision to select the regular season winners ensures the involvement of the Argentine superstar. The participation of the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi is a much-needed boost to the profile of the new-look tournament, which FIFA hope will capture the imagination of the global television audience as well as fans in the United States ahead of the World Cup in 2026. The competition could pit Messi against top European club opposition for the first time since he left Paris Saint Germain last year to move to Miami. The 32-team tournament will feature title winning teams from each of FIFA's continental confederations. Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich are among the 12 European teams who have qualified for the tournament while Argentina's River Plate and Boca Juniors and Brazil's Flamengo are among six South American teams. FIFA has yet to announce any broadcast deals or sponsorship contracts for the tournament and the competition has faced some opposition within the game. Players union FIFpro and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar. Opponents of the new tournament have said it adds further congestion to an already crowded schedule and increases the workload of players. The last version of the Club World Cup featured seven teams in a knockout format and was won by Manchester City who beat Brazil's Fluminense in the final in Saudi Arabia. FIFA plan to hold the expanded tournament every four years although no host as yet to be chosen for the 2029 edition.",

With Steve Smith returning to number four after a mixed outing as an opener and all-rounder Cameron Green ruled out of the Test summer due to back issues for which he has opted to undergo a surgery, Australia could see a new opening partner for Usman Khawaja, be it Head or all-rounder Mitchell Marsh from within the team or anyone from trio of Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw, who have been scoring well in domestic cricket. Speaking as quoted by cricket.com.au Head said, \u201cI think it is going to be an old-fashioned bat-off (the BGT series) and I am looking forward to seeing what everyone thinks over the next couple of weeks. From my side of things, I have got no favourite position. I have only got a position that is best for the team and what the team needs from me. I could not care less if I bat (anywhere) from one to seven, if I bat at nine, I do not care. I have said that in the past, I just want to play in the Australian cricket team and any position in the Australian cricket team you take.\u201dHead is one of the contenders to take the opening spot due to the success he has witnessed as one in white-ball cricket. His opening contributions in Tests have been decent, making 223 runs in five Tests and five innings with a fifty to his name. With Head set to miss the upcoming ODI series of three matches against Pakistan starting from November 4 due to paternity leave, Head said that he will make his decisions around his family more and it is his teammates and family who drive him to play. \u201cI am not really interested in the individual stuff or where my career might go to, aspirations from an individual perspective. I want to provide for my family, I want to play with my mates and I want to enjoy what I am doing. I think I have done that really well over the last couple of years,\u201d Head concluded.

        "text": "Hyderabad: Fernandez Hospital Educational and Research Foundation organised a symposium on advanced gynaecological ultrasound titled \u201cUltrasonography of the Adnexa and Endometrium: Optimising Diagnosis in Everyday Practice\u201d on Sunday.The event was facilitated by Dr Mala Sibal, a renowned expert in gynaecological ultrasound, and focused on how modern ultrasound techniques are transforming the diagnosis and treatment of gynaecological conditions. Over 200 practising gynaecologists, radiologists, pathologists, postgraduates in obstetrics and gynaecology, and trainees in gynaecological ultrasound attended the symposium from across India.Ultrasound plays a critical role in identifying and managing a wide range of conditions, including gynaecological cancers. By using high-resolution imaging, doctors can accurately detect abnormalities in the reproductive system, such as ovarian cysts or growths in the uterus, which may indicate early signs of cancer. This early detection is crucial because it allows for timely intervention, significantly improving patient outcomes.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mala Sibal said, \u201cUltrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice in gynaecology, including detecting gynaecological cancers. Despite advances in ultrasound technology, emerging literature in the field, and the tremendous impact of accurate and early diagnosis on appropriate medical management, quality ultrasound services are still scarce in many parts of the world. There is significant potential for its expanded use in improving women's healthcare both nationally and globally\u2014 a goal that can be achieved through dedicated teaching, training, and knowledge sharing, which was the key objectives of today\u2019s symposium.\u201dThe symposium highlighted the importance of using ultrasound to differentiate between benign and malignant growths. Specialists discussed how specific markers, visible on ultrasounds, can indicate whether a mass is likely to be cancerous. This level of detail helps doctors make faster, more accurate diagnoses, reducing the need for more invasive procedures.",

Meanwhile, uncertainty continues to loom over MS Dhoni's involvement in the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL) with the Chennai Super Kings. Concerns over Dhoni's participation remain due to his age, knee injury and being tight-lipped about his possible plans of retirement after CSK suffered an exit in the group stage. There has been no word in the rumour mill about Dhoni still wanting to compete in the top T20 league.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Top former and current stars have shown their class in the T10 format, including former Australia star David Warner.With the likes of former India stars including Robin Uthappa, Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan and many more, taking part in the different T10 leagues, the prospect of seeing Dhoni in the format remains a possibility.\"Absolutely, I think outside of the top level of international cricketers playing, current India internationals are not allowed to play outside of the Indian Premier League. The recently retired players, almost all the big names of India, have come to play T10. So yes, we can expect MS Dhoni to be playing T10 when he makes up his mind,\" Shaji told ANI.The ten franchises, including the two new ones, Bolts Ajman and UP Nawabs, joined the other eight featuring New York Strikers, Deccan Gladiators, Northern Warriors, Morrisville Samp Army, Delhi Bulls, Bangla Tigers, Team Abu Dhabi and Chennai Brave Jaguars - to complete their rosters.A total of 179 international megastars will participate in the 2024 Abu Dhabi T10, making it the biggest season ever.Players from 11 different nations were drafted, showcasing the truly global nature of the Abu Dhabi T10. Leading the selections were 20 players from the West Indies, 17 from the UAE, 15 from Sri Lanka, and 14 from Pakistan. Afghanistan contributed 11, while nine English, five Zimbabwean, three Bangladeshi, three Australian, and two each from New Zealand and South Africa were also picked, highlighting the tournament's international appeal.Matthew Boucher, Abu Dhabi Cricket CEO, believes that the format can take off on a global level and said, \"It seems like T10 is having a fantastic couple of years.

It is apparently a tradition to do a photo ceremony on a newly-weds\u2019 first Karwa Chauth.Karwa Chauth is a Hindu festival celebrated largely by Hindu women coming from the northern and western parts of India. Most women observe a fast without consuming any food and water and the fast is mainly done to seek divine blessings for their husband\u2019s long life and prosperity.However, while the tradition initially involved just women fasting, praying for the long life of their husbands, now even the husbands fast for their wives. A newly-wed couple said, \u201cMy husband has been fasting because he believes both of us should be blessed with good health and long life. Also because he has grown up seeing his mother wait for hours together for the moon to come to break her fast, he feels fasting together will decrease the burden a bit.\u201dA 45-year-old woman put a completely different view forward. She said, \u201cAfter a certain age, ensuring that one has to do a fast despite not being in a position to, is not possible.

        "text": "Following New Zealand\u2019s historic eight-wicket win in the first Test match against India in Bengaluru, Kiwi skipper Tom Latham heaped praise on youngster Rachin Ravindra for his ability to calm the dressing room. During New Zealand\u2019s first inning, Ravindra displayed a stupendous performance. The 24-year-old played a 134-run knock from 157 balls at a strike rate of 85.35. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Latham hailed Ravindra for making a 137-run partnership with a number 9 batter Tim Southee. \u201cThe way he [Ravindra] played the situation of the game was really important for us. A 137-run partnership with a No. 9 batter is awesome. I think the way he played leading up to that [second] new ball was really important. Even this morning, the way he came out with the game in the balance where another couple of wickets there and it could have been a nervy 50-60 runs, but I think the way he calmed the dressing room with his composure out there for a young guy in his ninth or tenth Test to play in that fashion is obviously exciting,\u201d Latham was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying. The Kiwi skipper also praised pacer William O\u2019Rourke for his \u201coutstanding\u201d bowling in the Bengaluru Test.\u201cWe\u2019re blessed with a couple of guys on our side, a couple of young guys that have stepped up in this match. I think the way Will [O\u2019Rourke] bowled was outstanding, but I think I also look at the other two seamers, Tim Southee and Matt Henry, the pressure they were able to apply with that new ball on day one was outstanding. Matt got the rewards and Will got the rewards in that first innings,\u201d he added.He added that the victory over India in Bengaluru was a proud moment for the Kiwi side and they will celebrate it.\u201cIt was a combination of everything. [It is] a really special feeling to be in this position. I think the work we did in the first and second innings with the ball and then obviously with the bat, really set the game up for us. It\u2019s obviously a proud moment for this group and the one we will celebrate,\u201d he further added.Chasing a total of 107 runs, Jasprit Bumrah (2/29) showed some fight for India, but Will Young (48*) and Rachin (39*) helped the Kiwis complete a comprehensive win. Earlier, India had taken a 106-run lead in the second innings, scoring 462/10 in response to New Zealand\u2019s total of 402/10 in the first innings. Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (35 from 52 balls, with six fours) and skipper Rohit Sharma (52 from 63 balls, with eight fours and a six) gave India a solid start with a 72-run opening stand.Sarfaraz then took charge, first forming a 136-run partnership with Virat Kohli (70 from 102 balls, with eight fours and a six) and later a 177-run stand with Pant (99 from 105 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) to put India in the lead. However, the introduction of the new ball saw India lose seven wickets for just 54 runs, with the middle order failing to contribute significantly. William O\u2019Rourke (3/92) and Matt Henry (3/102) took full advantage of the new ball, dismantling the Indian batting line-up just when a massive lead seemed likely. Spinner Ajaz Patel took two wickets, while Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee chipped in with one each. In their first innings, New Zealand posted 402 in response to India\u2019s 356. A magnificent century from Rachin Ravindra (134 from 157 balls, with 13 fours and four sixes) and a quickfire 65 from Southee (73 balls, eight fours, and four sixes) helped lift New Zealand from 233/7 to 402, thanks to a 137-run stand for the eighth wicket. Devon Conway (91 from 105 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes) also made a valuable contribution at the top. Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99) bowled well for India, while Mohammed Siraj picked up two wickets, and Ravichandran Ashwin and Bumrah took one each. Earlier, after electing to bat, India had a nightmare start under overcast, pace-friendly conditions. Henry (5/15) and O\u2019Rourke (4/22) ran through the Indian batting order, bundling them out for just 46 runs in 31.2 overs. Only Jaiswal (13) and Pant (20) managed to reach double figures. (ANI)",

        "text": "Hyderabad: The Jaipur Pink Panthers and the Bengal Warriorz played out a very tightly contested and highly entertaining game at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, Gachibowli, Hyderabad. The Jaipur Pink Panthers had to work hard, and eventually managed to win the contest with a 39-34 scoreline. For the Jaipur Pink Panthers, captain Arjun Deshwal scored 15 points, while Nitin Dhankar registered 13 points of his own for the Bengal Warriorz.Fazel Atrachali and the Bengal Warriorz began the game very well, with the defensive unit working in tandem to foil a flurry of Jaipur Pink Panther attacks in the early exchanges. Both sides were patient in the first phase of play, with the Bengal Warriorz working hard to hold onto a slender lead.But at the midway stage of the first half, the Jaipur Pink Panthers captain Arjun Deshwal wrestled the momentum away from the Bengal Warriorz. Shortly after, a solid tackle by Abhijeet Malik helped inflict an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers storm into the lead. And even though the Bengal Warriorz fought hard after that, it was the Jaipur Pink Panthers who finished the first half with a 3-point lead. At the half-time break, the Jaipur Pink Panthers led 21-18.The two sides began cautiously in the second half as well as they weren\u2019t keen on conceding any ground. While Fazel Atrachali led the Bengal Warriorz defence brilliantly, Arjun Deshwal was his talismanic self for the Jaipur Pink Panthers.With just under 10 minutes left in the contest, Abhijeet Malik inflicted an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers extend the lead to a 4-point one. At this point, the score read 29-25 in favour of the Jaipur Pink Panthers. It was an action-packed final phase of the game as Nitin Dhankar brought Bengal Warriorz right back into the contest. The Jaipur Pink Panthers, who seemed to be one step ahead all through up until then, were suddenly on the backfoot.But it was Abhishek KS\u2019s super tackle that sealed the contest for the Jaipur Pink Panthers, who walked off the mat with a closely contested win.",

        "text": "Following India\u2019s disappointing eight-wicket loss against New Zealand in the first Test match in Bengaluru, former cricketer Madan Lal believes that the hosts will \u201cbounce back\u201d in the three-game long-format series.Chasing a total of 107 runs, Jasprit Bumrah (2/29) showed some fight for India, but Will Young (48*) and Rachin (39*) helped the Kiwis complete a comprehensive win. Speaking to ANI, Madan Lal said that India has a strong side. However, the former cricketer also warner Rohit Sharma and said that the Kiwis are not like other teams and are a good fighter.\u201cI think the Indian Team is very very strong, but you know New Zealand is not like other teams, they are a good fighter, they always come back. They have a good bowling lineup and they have the best fielding side but now the only thing is India has to be very careful how they can manage the game and that is very important,\u201d Madan Lal told ANI.He added that now the pressure will be on the visitors to stop New Zealand from winning the remaining two Test matches of the series.\u201cYou have to go through all these things when you play a sport\u2026 when you\u2019re down by 1-0 that\u2019s the time when you have to show your character that you\u2019re the best team. I believe India will definitely bounce back\u2026 the pressure is not on India but it\u2019s on New Zealand to stop the hosts from winning the next Test match,\u201d he added.Earlier in the Bengaluru Test, India had taken a 106-run lead in the second innings, scoring 462/10 in response to New Zealand\u2019s total of 402/10 in the first innings. Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (35 from 52 balls, with six fours) and skipper Rohit Sharma (52 from 63 balls, with eight fours and a six) gave India a solid start with a 72-run opening stand.Sarfaraz then took charge, first forming a 136-run partnership with Virat Kohli (70 from 102 balls, with eight fours and a six) and later a 177-run stand with Pant (99 from 105 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) to put India in the lead. However, the introduction of the new ball saw India lose seven wickets for just 54 runs, with the middle order failing to contribute significantly. William O\u2019Rourke (3/92) and Matt Henry (3/102) took full advantage of the new ball, dismantling the Indian batting line-up just when a massive lead seemed likely. Spinner Ajaz Patel took two wickets, while Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee chipped in with one each. In their first innings, New Zealand posted 402 in response to India\u2019s 356. A magnificent century from Rachin Ravindra (134 from 157 balls, with 13 fours and four sixes) and a quickfire 65 from Southee (73 balls, eight fours, and four sixes) helped lift New Zealand from 233/7 to 402, thanks to a 137-run stand for the eighth wicket. Devon Conway (91 from 105 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes) also made a valuable contribution at the top. Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99) bowled well for India, while Mohammed Siraj picked up two wickets, and Ravichandran Ashwin and Bumrah took one each. Earlier, after electing to bat, India had a nightmare start under overcast, pace-friendly conditions. Henry (5/15) and O\u2019Rourke (4/22) ran through the Indian batting order, bundling them out for just 46 runs in 31.2 overs. Only Jaiswal (13) and Pant (20) managed to reach double figures. (ANI)",

        "text": "The Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 season will see an intriguing face-off between the in-form Jamshedpur FC (JFC) and a determined Hyderabad FC (HFC) at the JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.With Jamshedpur FC aiming to sustain their impressive start and Hyderabad FC eager to secure their first win of the season, both teams have much at stake in this anticipated clash.Both teams have plenty to fight for, with Jamshedpur FC looking to continue their strong start and Hyderabad FC hoping to turn around their season.Jamshedpur FC have been lethal in front of goal, scoring in each of their last seven ISL matches. Their current form sees them sitting on nine points after four games, their best-ever start to a season.\n\nThe Red Miners (JFC) have had the upper hand in recent meetings, winning their last three encounters against Hyderabad FC. A victory in this match would see them equal their record of four consecutive wins against any team in ISL history, matching their streak against NorthEast United FC.On the other hand, Hyderabad FC secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC, breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on this, aiming for back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023. However, their attack will need to step up as they remain winless this season.Hyderabad FC is in need of consecutive positive results to build momentum this season. After securing a draw against Chennaiyin FC, Thangboi Singto\u2019s side now has the chance to go unbeaten in back-to-back ISL matches for the first time since their four-game streak from December 2022 to February 2023.The two teams have played 10 matches against each other in the ISL. Jamshedpur FC have won five games and Hyderabad FC have emerged victorious once. Four games have resulted in a draw.Jamshedpur FC head coach Khalid Jamil acknowledged the importance of this match and also the improved strength of Hyderabad FC of late. He backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.\u201cIt is a very important game for us. We are playing in front of our home crowd. They\u2019re a good team. They\u2019re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,\u201d Jamil said in the pre-match press conference, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.Hyderabad FC tactician Thangboi Singto mentioned that the team has become better collectively in the last couple of weeks. He is hoping for that to translate into positive results on the field.\u201cThe players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,\u201d Singto said, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.\n\nJamshedpur FC\u2019s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leads the charts for producing most goal-scoring chances (9) amongst Indian players in ISL 2024-25. With all of his opportunities coming from open play, Jamil\u2019s men have never had to deal with a paucity of chances to convert upfront.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s striker Devendra Murgaonkar stands on the brink of a personal milestone as he could complete the feat of 50 ISL appearances in the coming match. His expected goal value of 0.65 is the highest amongst the team\u2019s players this season, reflecting that he\u2019s consistently at the centre of their goal-scoring endeavours.\n\nJamshedpur FC defender Stephen Eze has averaged 7.5 clearances in every appearance in ISL 2024-25. His ability to be vigilant and aware of any offensive moves transpiring in their backline and responding in a timely manner to the same has ensured that the home team has managed to have a disciplined defence.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s Leander D\u2019Cunha has won the possession back 5.5 times on average per match in the defensive third this season. He has single-handedly helped Hyderabad FC break plenty of attacks in the backend, and the Jamshedpur FC attacking unit will have to come up with rather unique, coordinated efforts to get past him.\n\nBoth teams will be eager for three points \u2013 Jamshedpur to solidify their top-tier form, and Hyderabad to break their winless run.",

        "text": "Dubai, Oct 20 (IANS) Clinical bowling by Amelia Kerr and Rosemary Mair helped New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs to lift their maiden title in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Stadium here on Sunday. Kerr and Mair picked three wickets each to restrict the Proteas to 126/9 in the second innings after New Zealand had posted a challenging 158/5 after they were asked to bat first in the final.\n\nNew Zealand women erased the bitter memories of the heartbreaks of their past T20 World Cup finals as they eventually triumphed in their third trip to the finals. The Proteas on the other hand have lost in the final for a second year running after having lost to Australia in the 2023 Women\u2019s T20 WC.\n\nAsked to bat first, Amelia Kerr, Brooke Halliday, and Suzi Bates helped New Zealand post 158/5 in 20 overs. Georgia Plimmer and Bates opened with a strong start, but Plimmer\u2019s attempted six off Marizanne Kapp was caught by Sune Luus. Bates soon followed, bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba. Captain Sophie Devine was removed for six after a successful review by Nadine de Klerk.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s bowlers tightened control, with no boundaries hit between overs 5.4 and 13.5. Halliday (38) broke the shackles, raised a 57-run stand with Kerr before being caught by Anneke Bosch. Kerr hit consecutive boundaries before falling in the penultimate over to Nonkululeko Mlaba, the only bowler with multiple wickets. Maddy Green\u2019s late six helped New Zealand set a 159-run target for SA.\n\nWith a massive target ahead of them and with the pressure at an absolute high, skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33) and Tazmin Brits (17), the two highest scorers of the edition, gave South Africa a great start.\n\nThe team racked up 47 runs in the powerplay and looked to build on the great start until Tazmin was dismissed by Fran Jonas in the very next over. In attempts to help her skipper continue the onslaught, Tazmin attempted to go big but a miscue of her shot saw Green take a simple catch at long on which rejuvenated the New Zealand side.\n\nThe fall of the wicket saw the Kiwis regain control of the game and built heavy pressure on their opponents in the following overs which saw the required run rate climb past nine runs an over. The ninth over saw New Zealand concede only one run and had five dot balls in the row which saw Wolvaardt try and relieve pressure on the first ball of the next over. In her attempts to take on Kerr, the South Africa skipper was caught at extra cover with Suzie taking the simple catch.\n\nThe removal of the skipper sprung life into the New Zealand bowling attack as a mini-collapse followed soon after. Kerr ended up removing Anneke Bosch (9), on the last ball of the same over in which Wolvaardt was dismissed when she missed an attempt to sweep the ball which resulted in a loud appeal that was rejected by the umpire. Upon further review, Bosch had indeed nicked the ball to reduce South Africa to 64/3 at the halfway mark.\n\nWhat followed was a mini collapse as Marizanne Kapp (8), Nadine de Klerk (6) and Sune Luus (8) fell in quick succession.\n\nKerr, who set the record for most wickets in a single edition of the women\u2019s T20 World Cup on the night, returned to take the scalp of Annerie Dercksen to further add to a historic campaign. With the game going out of South Africa\u2019s reach with each passing over, Mair struck twice in the penultimate over before Carson wrapped up the victory for New Zealand.\n\nThe Proteas once again suffered heartbreak and lost by 32 runs.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nNew Zealand 158/5 in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 43, Brooke Halliday 38, Suzie Bates 32; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2-31) beat South Africa 126/9 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 33; Amelia Kerr 3-24, Rosemary Mair 3-25) by 32 runs.",

Victory takes Liverpool one point ahead of City and four clear of Arsenal, who they face at the Emirates next weekend.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Chelsea are now seven points off the top down in sixth, but there was plenty cause for optimism for the Blues from a performance that stretched Liverpool to their limits.Liverpool's only defeat under Slot came to Nottingham Forest following September's international break.The Dutchman responded by this time leaving all of his South American internationals -- Alexis Mac Allister, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez -- on the bench after their exertions in recent days across the Atlantic.The decision to hand Jones just his second league start of the season proved an inspired one as the England international won Liverpool's penalty and scored the decisive goal.Chelsea were fortunate still to have 11 men on the field after just six minutes when Tosin Adarabioyo hauled down Diogo Jota.The Portugal international was still a long way from goal but the incident was almost identical to the one that saw Arsenal defender William Saliba sent-off in a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday.Having survived that scare, Chelsea settled nicely into their rhythm and pushed the home side back by dominating possession.However, Liverpool's pace on the break was a constant threat and Chelsea were caught out when Salah fed Jones, who was chopped down by Levi Colwill.Salah slammed home his 10th goal against his former club from the resulting penalty.Moments later, Cody Gakpo slotted in at the end of a lightning Liverpool counter-attack, but Salah had strayed offside before delivering the assist.At the other end, Jackson smashed off the angle of post and bar in the first sign that Chelsea had some punch to their possession football.Chelsea, though, had another escape just before half-time when referee John Brooks intially pointed to the spot once more when Jones went down under a challenge from Robert Sanchez.VAR intervened, however, as the Spanish goalkeeper got a touch on the ball before making contact with Jones.Within three minutes of the restart for the second half, the Blues were back level as VAR played another helping hand for the visitors.Jackson latched onto Moises Caicedo's through ball and coolly slotted past Caoimhin Kelleher for his fifth goal in eight Premier League games.The Senegalese striker was ruled offside on the field, but was shown to be played on by Ibrahima Konate on replay.Liverpool took just three minutes to restore their lead as Jones timed his run perfectly to control and flick in Salah's cross.Chelsea forced Slot's men to defend their lead for the final 40 minutes but struggled to create clear-cut chances for the equaliser until seven minutes of stoppage time.Renato Vega headed over Cole Palmer's free-kick before Christopher Nkunku failed to get a telling touch to Pedro Neto's teasing cross.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Diego Simeone's team struggled against the minnows from the south of Madrid but after Yvan Neyou blasted the visitors ahead Sorloth levelled with a fine finish and Antoine Griezmann slid home the second.

        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC (KBFC) achieved a remarkable 2-1 victory against Mohammedan SC (MSC) at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday. This win marks the first time in 27 games that Kerala Blasters have triumphed in an away match after conceding the first goal in the Indian Super League (ISL). Two second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition. Mirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory, as per a press release by the ISL. The visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan SC backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match\u2019s tempo.In the 20th minute, Mohammedan SC\u2019s pillar in defense, Joseph Adjei had to be substituted after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian.The next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters FC\u2019s debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan SC. Mirjalol Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.Mikael Stahre\u2019s men didn\u2019t bog down after conceding the goal infact they were more spurred on to equalize. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to do so as Jesus Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan SC defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s long-range effort was denied by the crossbar.The second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield but the game swayed in the favour of KBFC by Kwame Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Noah. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, leaving his marker, Zodingliana Ralte in complete awe before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal.Riding on the positive momentum of scoring an equalizer, the Blasters (KBFC) enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri.Mohammedan SC\u2019s best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala Blasters FC home as they clinched their second win of the season, as per a press release by the ISL.While Kwame Peprah just played 26 minutes, his impact from the bench was such that it helped the team secure a great comeback win. He scored a crucial goal and completed 11 out of his 14 attempted passes. His introduction also allowed Jimenez more space in the box, resulting in the second goal. He was adjudged the Player of the Match.Mohammedan SC will host Hyderabad FC at home on October 26 while Kerala Blasters FC will be in action on October 25 against rivals Bengaluru FC in Kochi.",

Brooke was outstanding against the West Indies. Spoke about backing our strengths, she backed her strengths, found those pockets, and ran hard. Helped us get to a competitive total.\n\n\u201cWe all know she is a once-in-a-generation player. What she was able to do tonight was incredible. Physically to do what she did with the bat, I think she can\u2019t feel her legs. She is not a bad cricketer but the person that she is, the world is her oyster and is great. South Africa were great, and the semifinal against Australia was unbelievable,\u201d said the New Zealand skipper.\n\nShe also highlighted the performance of bowler Lea Tahuhu, who kept things quiet for South Africa in the middle overs.\n\n\u201cI have spoken about her at length. You want a person like her in the team, she will scrape and fight for you. It is not always about the wickets, but it is about the work that goes behind it and working hard for your mates,\u201d Devine said.",

        "text": "Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot. McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth. Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane. Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams. For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006. \"It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race,\" said Leclerc.\"I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better.\"Verstappen said: \"It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer. It was a tough battle and tough to keep him (Norris) behind but it's a great result. \"I have my opinion about his move, but I'll leave it to the stewards. I dont need to say anything here.\" Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. Norris fell to fourth as Sainz also passed him on an eventful opening lap that saw Lewis Hamilton rise from 17th to 12th before he went off at Turn 19 on lap three, prompting an early Safety Car intervention. The Mercedes star had never previously failed to finish in 11 races in Austin. The race resumed on lap five, Leclerc pulling away to build his lead to three seconds by lap 10 with Verstappen resisting Sainz, who reported possible fuel problems and a loss of power. Norris stayed fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Piastri. By lap 20, as first the pit-stops began, Leclerc was 8.3 seconds clear of Verstappen with Sainz third, 1.3 adrift of the Dutchman. Norris was 3.6 adrift In fourth. Sainz came in on lap 21 for hards, rejoining sixth. Verstappen stayed out until lap 26 rejoining fifth, Ferrari having executed their undercut. Leclerc then came in on lap 27 for hards, leaving Norris and Piastri leading the way. He was third. As Norris pulled clear, Piastri frustrated Leclerc until lap 31 when Norris pitted. He rejoined fifth behind Verstappen and ahead of sixth-placed Russell who had not stopped. A lap later, Piastri pitted and order was restored with the Ferraris, led by Leclerc, in control ahead of Verstappen and both McLarens. \"These tyres aren't good, I can't brake or attack,\" reported Verstappen.Russell finally pitted on lap 41, rejoining eighth on mediums for the final stint as Norris closed in on Verstappen and they fought for third and vital points in their title scrap. The duo battled fiercely for a dozen laps, the champion defending adroitly each time Norris attacked until lap 53 when, pushed wide and off-track, the Briton finally made his move stick to take third. \"He needs to give me it back,\" complained Verstappen on team radio as they battled on and the stewards studied the move before hitting Norris with a five-second penalty for gaining an advantage.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Jude Bellingham's first season at Real Madrid started with a glut of goals and ended with a dream double, but his second is yet to take off. The England international faces his former side Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu in a rematch of last season's Champions League final, which Bellingham and Los Blancos triumphed in to win the competition for a record 15th time. The 21-year-old has shown signs of frustration in his sophomore year at Madrid, tasked with more defensive responsibility in midfield than at many times last season following the arrival of French superstar Kylian Mbappe.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti used the hard-working Bellingham on the right of midfield in a 2-1 La Liga win at Celta Vigo on Saturday, another new role for the 103 million euro ($112 million) man.Bellingham started last season as a key figure in the centre of Madrid's attack, scoring 10 goals in his first 10 games across La Liga and the Champions League.Thrust into the position after Karim Benzema departed with Madrid still waiting for then Paris Saint-Germain striker Mbappe to arrive, Bellingham thrived.After nine games this season in all competitions, Bellingham is yet to find the net.During the win over Celta, Bellingham appeared furious with Brazilian team-mate Vinicius Junior after the forward did not pass him the ball when he was well placed to score and instead lashed over.\"I haven't seen that (moment) you're talking about, but if it happened, it means that he has balls, character, and seems good to me,\" said Ancelotti on Saturday, defending Bellingham.\"Honestly, I didn't realise (it had happened), I'll watch it, but if he has reacted... let's be calm, after the game they were talking, laughing -- they have no problems.\"What's to our merit is that we always compete well, until the end.\"Ancelotti looked to shore up Madrid's defence during the second half of last season by getting Bellingham to play a hybrid role which saw him drop to the left of midfield at frequent intervals.The midfielder looked exhausted in the final months of the campaign and struggled with shoulder and ankle issues.Sharp riseBellingham was also below his best for England at Euro 2024 despite the Three Lions reaching the final, with the exception of his stunning bicycle kick goal against Slovakia in the last 16.He has been on a sharp upwards trajectory since breaking into the Birmingham City first team as a teenager, with the club retiring his number 22 shirt after he joined Borussia Dortmund at 17.Bellingham became the club's youngest captain at 19 and led them to the brink of the league title before Bayern Munich claimed victory on the final day of the 2022-23 campaign.He was named player of the season and also shone for England at the 2022 World Cup before elimination by France in the quarter-finals.Madrid fans quickly fell in love with Bellingham as he proved their saviour time and time again, including with a brace in his first Clasico against Barcelona.His goals turned him into the sort of star it might have otherwise taken years at Madrid to become and that has proven a hard bar to consistently live up to.Ancelotti has repeatedly emphasised Bellingham's job has changed and he should be appreciated for what he is still bringing to the team, in a midfield role now similar to what he was accustomed to before joining Los Blancos.With Mbappe, Vinicius and sometimes Rodrygo Goes selected in attack, Ancelotti and Madrid have struggled to find the perfect balance this season.New England coach Thomas Tuchel will also have to decide how best to fit Bellingham in with Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer vying for attacking midfield positions behind Harry Kane.Madrid are still searching for the right formula ahead of a vital week, facing Dortmund and then La Liga leaders Barcelona, and Bellingham will be determined to contribute whether that includes him scoring or not.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "McLaren team chief Andrea Stella blasted as \"inappropriate\" a controversial penalty handed to Lando Norris at the United States Grand Prix which could shatter his world title dream. Race stewards penalised Norris and relegated him to fourth behind three-time world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull after the pair clashed and ran off-track in the closing laps. A five-second penalty given to Norris, who finished third on track at the flag, pushed him back to fourth behind the series leader and dealt a blow in his bid to catch and pass the Dutch driver in this year's title race.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Norris was adjudged to have gained an advantage by running off the track when he swept outside Verstappen on lap 53 or the 56-lap race.The incident cost Norris valuable points and helped lift Verstappen to a 57-point lead in the title race with 354 to Norris's 297 with five races left.\"My view is that the way the stewards interfered with a beautiful piece of motorsport was inappropriate because both cars went off track so both cars gained an advantage,\" said McLaren team chief Andrea Stella.\"It's a shame because it cost us a podium, it cost us a race where we stayed patient after we were pushed off in the first lap, at the first corner. We accepted it.\"Having said very clearly our position, this kind of position by the stewards, this kind of decision cannot be appealed. For us the chapter is now closed and we move on to the next race.\"But both cars went off track so for us there was no doubt that the manoeuvre was correct.\"Norris was philosophical about his plight after a feisty drive, having recovered from a poor first lap when he wasted his fourth pole in five races and fell to fourth.\"Not my best race,\" he said. \"With the loss in turn one and just the racing at the end, it clearly wasn't enough -- so that's life. I didn't do a good enough job, but I gave it a good shot so I'm doing my best.\"My best isn't good enough sometimes. It just wasn't our day today.\"He added that he was considering talking to the stewards about their decision, but felt \"there's plenty of scenarios where people wouldn't get a penalty in cases like what happened.\"He said it was difficult to know if he should have given his place back immediately during the race.\"It's tough to know, but maybe that was my one opportunity that I had. Max was defending well and it wasn't easy to overtake.\"Verstappen said he had endured a difficult race without the pace in his car to attack.\"It was tough, a tough battle and I tried everything to keep him behind me. But it was fun, too,\" he said.'Worked like crazy'\"A podium is a good result. I have my own opinion on the move, but I dont need to say anything. I'll let the stewards do their thing.\"The race was won buy Charles Leclerc who led home Carlos Sainz in a Ferrari one-two. Leclerc's win lifted him to 275 points in third place in the championship.\"We did a great job and the pace of the car was really good and that's thanks to the engineers and the team,\" said Leclerc.\"They've worked like crazy for the upgrades and it is paying off now. We could not have dreamed for anything better.\"It all worked and we are very happy. Now we are targeting the constructors title.\"It was Leclerc's first win in America, his third this year and the eighth of his career as Ferrari revelled in their first US Grand Prix one-two since 2006.Ferrari's success at the Circuit of the Americas lifted them to 496 points in the teams' title race behind McLaren on 544 and Red Bull on 504 with the Mexican and Brazilian Grands Prix to come on the next two successive weekends.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Despite limping due to the effects of cramp, her second over began with the vital wicket of Wolvaardt, caught by Bates at cover for 33, and ended with Bosch caught behind on review.\n\nAnother quickfire double breakthrough then all but decided the outcome as New Zealand turned the screw.\n\nMarizanne Kapp picked out Plimmer at deep square leg off Eden Carson from the final ball of the 12th over and the 13th started with de Klerk swiping Rosemary Mair to Kerr at backward point.\n\nKerr returned to dismiss Annerie Dercksen, taking her tournament tally to 15, and Mair picked up two wickets in the penultimate over to finish with three for 25.\n\nIt was left to Carson to bowl the final over and conclude a historic weekend for cricket in New Zealand, with the men\u2019s team securing a first Test win in India for 36 years earlier in the day.\n\nNew Zealand: 158/5 in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 43, Brooke Halliday 38; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2/31, Nadine de Klerk 1/17)South Africa: 126/9 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 33, Tazmin Brits 17; Amelia Kerr 3/24, Rosemary Mair 3/25)\n\nContent courtesy: ICC Business Corporation FZ LLC 2020 via Online Media Zone.",

When I was at primary school in creative writing, I wrote about winning a World Cup with Sophie and Suzie.\"I don't necessarily believe you deserve things in sport, but if any two people do, it's Sophie and Suzie.\"Devine, 35, and Bates, 37, are two of the elder stateswomen in the side along with 34-year-old Lea Tahuhu.Each of them made their mark on the final. Bates made 32 and took three catches while fast bowler Tahuhu squeezed the South African middle order.Devine only made six but her leadership was outstanding, bringing out the best in the younger players in the team, like Kerr.'Heartbreak and happiness'\"We joke about being grandmas and mums and whatnot but you feel a real sense of pride at seeing them stand up and take opportunities. Melie (Kerr) today was unbelievable,\" said the skipper.\"For us to be able to win it, it's just nice to have that. It's always something that you want to have when you finish your career.\"Devine's first action after winning was to embrace her fellow 'grandma' Bates who has now played 334 white ball internationals since making her debut back in 2006.\"Me and Suze have been through a lot together,\" she said.\"We've been through a lot of hairstyles together, hers a lot worse than mine.\"But to be able to share it, to be fielding close together as well and to share that moment, that embrace, that's 17, 18 years of joy and heartbreak and happiness shared in that moment. It's just been awesome to share that with her.\"With the men's cricket team also completing a spectacular win in Bengaluru earlier in the day, their first Test win in India since 1988, Sunday was arguably New Zealand's finest ever day on the cricket field, although Devine hopes there is more to come.\"I'm really hopeful that tonight's victory can inspire that next generation of not just young girls but young boys as well to pick up a cricket bat, a cricket ball,\" she said.\"It still feels pretty surreal at the moment and hopefully the impact of what we've been able to achieve is going to be long-standing and long-reaching.

        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC pulled off a memorable 2-1 victory over Mohammedan SC at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday, marking the first time in 27 games that they have won an away match after conceding first in the Indian Super League. \n\nTwo second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition.\n\nMirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory.\n\nThe visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match's tempo. \n\nIn the 20th minute, Mohammedan defender Joseph Adjei had to be substituted out after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian. \n\nThe next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan. Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.\n\nThe Blasters weren\u2019t bogged down after conceding the goal. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to level the scores as Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s effort was crashed onto crossbar. \n\nThe second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield. But the game swayed in the favour of the Blasters by Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Sadaoui. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, evading his marker before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal. \n\nThere was controversy in the 70th minute as Mohammedan were denied a penalty after Franca was bundled over from behind by Hormipam Ruivah after being put through on goal. The home crowd was furious with the decision and expressed their displeasure by throwing water bottles on the pitch.\n\nThe Blasters enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri. \n\nMohammedan best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala BlastersFC home as they clinched their second win of the season.",

        "title": "Australian star Perry congratulates NZ\u2019s trio of Suzie, Devine, Tahuhu for T20 WC win",
        "text": "Star Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry congratulated New Zealand\u2019s veteran trio of Suzie Bates, skipper Sophie Devine, and pacer Lea Tahuhu for finally securing the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title, beating South Africa in the final. For three of the most experienced White Ferns stars, it was a Sunday to remember as they ended a 15-year wait for their first-ever ICC Women\u2019s T20 WC title. The hard work, pain, blood, sweat, and tears worth 410 T20Is combined finally proved to be worth it as they made key contributions to this historic title win. Perry took to Instagram and posted in a story that she could not think of a group of players more deserving of success for their country and congratulated them. Notably, Australia\u2019s title defence ended in the semifinals after an eight-wicket loss to South Africa. This marked the first T20 WC after 2009 in which Australia was not in the finals. NZ reached the finals after a thrilling eight-run win over West Indies in the other semifinal. The White Ferns veterans made key contributions throughout the tournament. Bates was the fourth-highest run-getter with 150 runs in six innings at an average of 25.00, with a strike rate of around 93 and best score of 32. Despite not scoring a half-century, she made important contributions up the order in every match. She also took a wicket. Skipper Devine made 114 runs in six innings at an average of 28.50, with a strike rate of 107.54. Her best score of 57* came against India in the opening clash and set the tone for the Kiwis\u2019 brilliant run in the tournament. Tahuhu took five wickets in six games at an average of 22.80, with best bowling figures of 3/15 that came against India. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*. She has also taken 59 wickets with the best figures of 4/26. Devine is the sixth-highest run-getter in women\u2019s T20Is and White Ferns\u2019 second-highest run-maker, scoring 3,391 runs in 143 matches and 139 innings at an average of 28.25, with a strike rate of 120.93. She has scored a century and 21 fifties, with the best score of 105. She has also taken 117 wickets with the best figures of 4/22. Tahuhu is also an established veteran with 96 T20I appearances, in which she has taken 93 wickets at an average of 19.79, with the best figures of 4/6. Coming to the match, SA won the toss and elected to field first. Bates played a crucial knock of 32 in 31 balls, with three fours at the top. After being reduced to 70/3, it was a 57-run stand between Amelia Kerr (43 in 38 balls, with four boundaries) and Brooke Halliday (38 in 28 balls, with three fours) that played a crucial role in NZ reaching 158/5 in their 20 overs. Nonkululeko Mlaba (2/31) was the pick of the bowlers for White Ferns. In the run-chase of 159 runs, despite a brisk start by skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33 in 27 balls, with five fours), SA and a 51-run stand with Tazmin Brits (17 in 18 balls, with one four), SA lost wickets quickly and never found their rhythm following the dismissal of their openers. They were restricted to 126/9 in their 20 overs, with Kerr (3/24) and Rosemary Mair (3/25) shining the most with the ball for NZ. Kerr was given the \u2018Player of the Match\u2019 award for her all-round show. (ANI)",

        "title": "ICC Women\u2019s T20 WC: \u201cThree grandmas\u201d of New Zealand team finally get their crowning moment",
        "text": "New Zealand veteran Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine and Lea Tahuhu, the three \u201cgrandmas\u201d of their team, finally got the crowning moment of their T20I career on Sunday as an all-round White Ferns side defeated South Africa by 32 runs to secure their maiden ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title. NZ captain Devine had described the trio as \u201cthree grandmas\u201d, and it was the veterans who finally got their moment on Sunday.For 37-year-old Bates and 35-year-old skipper Devine, this was the third time lucky, with the long-serving pair both having played in their country\u2019s previous two appearances in Women\u2019s T20 World Cup finals, way back in 2009 and 2010, ending in losses to England and Australia. Those defeats at Lord\u2019s and in Bridgetown threatened to be the closest the pair came to World Cup glory, but Dubai 2024 has proved a fitting finale for two of the game\u2019s greats.Bates, who had bowled the crucial final over against West Indies in the semi-final, was at her belligerent best with the bat in the first innings against South Africa.It was Bates (334 international matches) who got the ball rolling for her team in the final, showing her class on the day when she surpassed Mithali Raj (333 international appearances) as the most-capped player in the history of women\u2019s international cricket.Her 32 from 31 deliveries gave the White Ferns the perfect platform on which to build, which her teammates duly did to reach a winning total of 158/5.\u201cIt is just outstanding, and just speaks to the volume of who Suzie is as a player,\u201d Devine said of her teammate. \u201cShe is now the most capped player in the history of the game on the woman\u2019s side, and it is unbelievable to think that she can go out there and play with such aggression and such fearlessness. I think it set the tone for the rest of the batting lineup. I think everyone knows how special I find Suze and what she has been able to achieve. So, I am just so stoked for her that we are able to lift it for her,\u201d she added, Devine captained her side with aplomb throughout the tournament, even lightening the mood just moments before the final began by telling some jokes to relieve some tension \u2013 jokes that she later said \u201cshe was not sure she could repeat,\u201d. And while her own individual contribution with the bat in the final (6) was not her best, it was her simply brilliant 57* from 36 balls right back at the start of the tournament against India that had got her team off to the perfect start in their winning campaign.\u201cI started to dream last night about what it would feel like to hold the trophy with this team, but I did not want to get to ahead of us,\u201d said Devine after the title win. \u201cThe great thing about this group is we know what we have been trying to achieve in the last 15, 18, 24 months. We kept taking steps in the right direction. You want momentum and we came to the World Cup on the back of 10 successive losses, but everyone starts on zero,\u201d she added. The 34-year-old Tahuhu often flies under the radar compared to her two experienced teammates, but bowled tidily in the final once again, and has now moved up to 93 career wickets in T20 Internationals, second only to Devine for New Zealand and up with some of the legendary names of the sport.\u201cI have spoken about it at length before, Lea\u2019s the sort of person that you want in your team, because you know that she is going to get in the fight, she is going to compete and scrap for you, and I knew if I threw her the ball, that she is going to make something happen. And she did just that,\u201d said Devine. \u201cIt is not always the person that takes the wickets or the catches. It is the work that goes on behind it, the teamwork. It is sort of working hard for your mate out in the middle there. And Leah was fantastic today, and helped change the outcome of the game I thought,\u201d she concluded. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*. She has also taken 59 wickets with the best figures of 4/26. Devine is the sixth-highest run-getter in women\u2019s T20Is and White Ferns\u2019 second-highest run-maker, scoring 3,391 runs in 143 matches and 139 innings at an average of 28.25, with a strike rate of 120.93. She has scored a century and 21 fifties, with the best score of 105. She has also taken 117 wickets with the best figures of 4/22.

My heartfelt condolences to bereaved families. Praying for speedy recovery of the injured. The entire nation stands in solidarity with the families in this hour of grief,\u201d he added.\n\nChief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the incident as dastardly and cowardly on the part of the militants. \u201cThe casualty figure from the Gagangir attack is not final as there are a number of injured labourers, both local and non-local. Praying that the injured make a full recovery as the more seriously injured are being referred to SKIMS, Srinagar.\u201d\n\nImmediately after getting news about the attack, Omar said earlier on Sunday, \u201cVery sad news of a dastardly & cowardly attack on non-local labourers at Gagangir in Sonamarg region. These people were working on a key infrastructure project in the area. 2 have been killed & 2-3 more have been injured in this militant attack.

Barely 48 hours ago, a non-local labourer was killed in Shopian. These despicable attacks appear to be deliberate attempts to disturb peace. Culprits must be brought to book and punished.

This is an insane act of madness. My thoughts with families of these two families.

This module was doing recce of the crime spot for the last one month.

This is a big change in the strategy of this module, which is simultaneously targeting non-local and local on development projects.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) are visiting the terror attack site on Monday to make their own assessment of the attack. Officials said that the death toll in the terrorist attack on a private company's labourers' camp in Gagangir area reached seven after another injured labourer succumbed in hospital.\r\n\r\nThose killed by the terrorists include both locals and non-locals working to build a tunnel between Gagangir and Sonamarg to make Srinagar-Sonamarg an all-weather road.

        "text": "Wellington: Members of the New Zealand White Ferns cricket team which beat South Africa by 32 runs in the final of the women's Twenty20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday will split prize money of around USD 2.3 million.That works out at around USD 155,000 or NZD 256,000 per team member, a life-changing windfall for players who for years have struggled for years to achieve financial parity with their male counterparts.New Zealand's first-ever victory in the World Cup of cricket's shortest format was a massive surprise. The White Ferns had lost 10 consecutive T20 matches before beating South Africa in a warm-up match.That pre-tournament success proved a turning point for New Zealand who beat India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing only to Australia on the way to the semifinals.South Africa ousted six-time champion Australia in a massive upset in the semi in which New Zealand beat the West Indies.New Zealand made 158-5, batting first in the final, helped by Suzy Bates who made 32, Amelia Kerr who made 43 and Brooke Halliday who made 38. Kerr then took 3-24 and Rosemary Mair 3-25 as New Zealand restricted South Africa to 126-9.\"Pretty unbelievable to be honest,\ufffd Mair said. \ufffdComing into the tournament all the odds were against us so for the group to bounce back like they have is unbelievable.\"We just care so much about each other. We've been through a lot of lows in the last 18 months, and we've just stuck by each other and kept working hard for each other.\"Captain Sophie Devine was leading the New Zealand team for the last time. She and Bates have played in all nine T20 World Cups since the first in 2009. New Zealand reached the final of the first two tournaments in 2009 and 2010, losing to Australia on both occasions.\"This means everything to us,\" Bates said. \"When you play team sport, you want to be a world champion.\"We've fought our way back to the top. (Devie) has been so outstanding leading this team... so calm and believing in us. We'll probably have a cuddle for even longer later because there's been some dark times that only the people in the (locker room) understand.\"New Zealand was coached to victory by Australian Ben Sawyer and former Black Caps batters Dean Brownlie and Craig McMillan.The White Ferns' success was praised Monday by New Zealand Sports Minister Chris Bishop. It came at the end of a weekend in which New Zealand also retained sailing's America's Cup and in which the New Zealand men's cricket team beat India in a test in India for the first time in 36 years.\"And then to round out a truly amazing sporting weekend, at 3am Monday morning (NZT) the White Ferns, led by Sophie Devine, stepped up to face South Africa in the women's T20 World Cup final in Dubai and absolutely smashed it, bringing home their first World Cup since the One Day International in 2000,\" Bishop said.\"Amelia Kerr's 43 runs off 38 balls and then taking 3 wickets for 24 set our team up for their magnificent performance.\"",

        "text": "CropLife India, an association of 17 R&D driven member companies in crop protection, has announced the change in leadership in the board of directors. \n\nThe 44th annual general meeting of CropLife India elected Ankur Aggarwal, Managing Director of Crystal Crop Protection Ltd, as the new Chairman of the board recently. Aggarwal succeeds KC Ravi, who served as the Chairman for the past four years. \n\nPivotal leader\n\nAnil Kakkar, Vice President of Sumitomo Chemical India, continues his role as Vice-Chairman for the fourth consecutive year. \n\nMohan Babu, Chief Operating Officer of Bayer CropScience for India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, has been inducted as the second Vice-Chairman of the board. \n\nA media statement said Ankur Aggarwal\u2019s extensive experience positions him as a pivotal leader in the crop protection industry. \n\nHe is committed to advancing innovative technologies that empower farmers to enhance productivity sustainably, all while addressing the crucial environmental challenges the country faces today. \n\nHis leadership will be essential in shaping a more resilient and responsible agricultural future, it said. \n\nQuoting Aggarwal, the statement said, \u201cIndia is confronted with a pressing challenge: decreasing agricultural landholdings alongside a growing population, which is increasing at about 0.8 per cent annually. This scenario heightens the demand for food production, putting pressure on food systems and necessitating innovative solutions for food security. To address this, the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, efficient resource management, and responsible use of crop protection solutions will be essential for maximising productivity on existing farmland. As the Chairman of CropLife India, we remain committed to improving the lives of Indian farmers. We are dedicated to providing them with science-based solutions that ensure effective and sustainable crop protection.\u201d\n\nDurgesh Chandra, Secretary General of CropLife India, said: \u201cIt will be our earnest endeavour in collaborating closely with Mr Ankur Aggarwal and the board of directors, to fulfil our responsibility in delivering the latest and safest innovations.

        "text": "Indian Premier League (IPL) defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are in a precarious position ahead of the upcoming season as they would be without the services of previous season's mentor Gautam Gambhir, assistant coach and academy head Abhishek Nayar and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate. The trio have joined the Indian cricket team as head coach and assistant coaches respectively, and certainly leave a void in the KKR dugout. While Dwayne Bravo has joined the side as mentor, other positions need to be filled.In addition to the backroom staff, early indications are that the captaincy role is not straightforward either. Shreyas Iyer joined KKR when he was bought for Rs 12.25 crore at the 2022 auction and it's understood that the franchise is willing to retain the Mumbai batter but not as their top retention.Ahead of October 31 deadline, Andre Russell is the front runner to be retained with a hefty price tag. The all-rounder was earlier retained for Rs 12 crore by KKR and is very likely to get a substantial raise.If things don't go per Iyer's liking, will he explore different options? In case he looks that way, the right-hander is expected to set the auction on fire because many teams - Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings, Delhi Capitals - are in the need of a captain. And an Indian captain is always sought after.Punjab won't mind loosening their purse strings for the right-hander considering he had a successful partnership with Ricky Ponting, now PBKS head coach, at DC and the two were together when they reached the final in 2020.Equally, don't be surprised if DC explore the Iyer option, too, because he was a proven leader for them and Rishabh Pant has asked to not be considered as skipper.Even last year, when Iyer was returning from injury lay-off, there was a section in the KKR camp which wanted to continue with Nitish Rana, who was standby captain in Iyer's absence, as leader for 2024 season.The franchise, however, \"announced\" Iyer as captain before the tournament got underway. The statement did raise a few eyebrows as Iyer was the original captain and Rana was only doing the job in his absence, and many felt the announcement was absolutely unnecessary.Shah Rukh Khan co-owned KKR are one of the franchises who advocated for a smaller auction, and pushed for more Right to Match (RTM). It's a strategy they are likely to use at the upcoming auction.There are more tempting retention options in Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana (uncapped), Mitchell Starc and Varun Chakravarthy but it will be interesting to see how much the defending champs are willing to spend.They have a problem of plenty on that front but it's their captaincy piece which would be keenly followed by other franchises too.",

Shreyas Iyer's captaincy is uncertain, with all-rounder Andre Russell likely to be retained, as other teams explore the possibility of acquiring the KKR skipper.",

        "title": "EA Sports FC 25 Review: Minor League Upgrades",
        "text": "It's difficult to recognise granular changes in seemingly constant things. You don't really notice a tree growing every year, but when you put those years together, the difference becomes apparent to the naked eye. The erstwhile FIFA series of football sims is somewhat like that. With a new edition released every year, the changes to the long-running and ridiculously popular sports franchise can be imperceptible over a year, or even more. These games only start feeling new after three or four subsequent editions when Electronic Arts is compelled to re-energise the series after a run of games becomes undeniably stale. To me, FIFA has always existed in eras. A spate of games follows the same language with minor improvements and tunings, before EA decides to freshen things up.\n\nThe franchise's latest era began last year when it shed its decades-old FIFA identity and rechristened itself as EA Sports FC. But a new name didn't bring a promised new beginning with FC 24. There was a new coat of paint, but underneath, the game was very much carved out of the same wood that has long been showing cracks. No one expected EA to upend a successful formula and re-imagine the game in a new light, but EA Sports FC 24 was desperately lacking fresh ideas. One year later, EA Sports FC 25, the second entry in EA's new football video game timeline, is still very much a fruit from the same tree. But there are a few new ideas this time around, some of which elevate the game from its swamp of familiarity. On a visual level, there's not much that differentiates FC 25 from its predecessor. You could boot it up and your flatmate might walk in on you playing and think its FC 24. But if they'd pick up the controller and jump in a game, the differences are likely to become a little more apparent.\n\nTo begin with, EA Sports FC 25 is harder, especially for those who are used to running at defences with a pacy winger, cutting through the entire opponent half and scoring a worldie \u2013\u2013 that's harder to pull off here. There's a greater (and much needed) emphasis on defending in FC 25 that hands players a little more power to dictate play when they are off the ball. Defenders and defensive midfielders have more of a commanding presence and are clearly more empowered to disrupt quick offensive moves. At first, this is a bit jarring. When attacking, you tend to lose the ball often and quickly if you're not carefully constructing your passes and relying on a single player to break down the defence. Defenders pick your pocket or win the second ball before you have the time to adjust, turn or take a second touch. This forces you to craft more considered plays and graft for your goals.\n\nDefenders can now also make a tactical foul in a last-ditch attempt to nullify an attack. These are fun to pull off in the game and of course will result in your player being penalised, but the new ability is only useful in certain circumstances and doesn't strengthen defences as a whole. Even with their newfound powers, however, defenders still seem to be playing with their hands tied behind their backs. When facing up to an oncoming attacker, big centre-backs are potent in their tackling. But if a pacy forward slips past them, you could kiss defensive recovery goodbye. There's little that's stopping the forward from scoring at that point as defenders are woefully inept when chasing down attackers and making recoveries. This has long been an issue in EA's football games, and FC 25 doesn't address the glaring defensive weakness either.\n\nDefenders still struggle to make recoveries against pacy forwardsPhoto Credit: EA\n\nEA's football franchise has always favoured an arcade-style recreation of the world's game. It's faster, leaner, and meaner. For a more authentic on-pitch gameplay, purists like me have preferred the more deliberate playstyle and pacing of Pro Evolution Soccer (rest in peace). But EA Sports FC25, to its credit, attempts to bring a bit of realism to its otherwise hyper-kinetic simulacrum of football made for 16-year-olds brought up on TikTok and Twitter (also, RIP). EA has burned in a Simulation Settings master switch in the game this time, that lets you swap out the classic FIFA experience \u2013\u2013 akin to a run-and-gun sort of playstyle \u2013\u2013 for a more grounded simulation of the sport \u2013\u2013 much like a tactical shooter. EA says that the Simulation gameplay type is \u201ccloser to what you'd see in a live football match.\u201d While that's an exaggeration, the option does slow down things on the pitch, underscoring the action with real-time decision making. Once I toggled the Simulation mode on, I never went back.\n\nThis change isn't just apparent on the defensive third of the field; attacking now seems beholden to gravity and you can't simply fly around with the ball glued to your toes. Players are more prone to bad touches, more susceptible to losing one-on-one battles, and more unlikely to knock the ball past the opponent in a sudden burst of pace. Passing, too, is now a little less video gamey. It doesn't seem hard coded to be precise, and I found myself struggling to pass my way out of tight spaces in the midfield early on. With time, however, you grow into the rhythms of the sim and find solutions that help you build up efficient plays. This experience, of course, is subject to user customisation. If you prefer the manic intensity of classic FIFA gameplay, then you can stick to the default simulation setting or fine tune it the way you like by adjusting individual sliders for different gameplay elements.\n\nWith the simulation setting on, the gameplay is more realistic and consideredPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe altered on-pitch experience is underpinned by an overhaul of tactical foundations across FC 25. This applies to how you tactically set up your team, assign player roles, and decide how they will play together on the pitch. When you head to team management in any mode, you're greeted by a revamped and streamlined tactics menu, where you can choose a tactical preset, pick a formation, a build-up style, and a defensive approach. All of this is a neater, but also a leaner experience. Some specific tactical adjustments present in past games have been stripped away, in essence giving you less control over your team's tactical set up. You also can't manually adjust the position of your players on the pitch and create your own formations like you were able to in previous games. These changes make for a less flexible, more guided tactical experience in FC 25.\n\nThe tactical streamlining, however, is counter-balanced by a deeper focus on individual player roles in your starting XI. Each position on the pitch comes with distinct positional role that can be assigned to the player. These player roles govern how individual members of your team will think, act and move on the pitch. For instance, you could set up you right-back as a Falseback; this role will task your right-back to push into the central midfield rather than staying out wide \u2014 Pep Guardiola style. Or you could play them as an Attacking Wingback, prioritising wide attacking output over defensive duties. Each Player Role comes with its unique benefits and drawbacks; you may get an extra pair of legs on the offensive side of the pitch to provide options when attacking, but that player will likely be stranded out of position when you lose the ball, making you susceptible to counters.\n\nPlayer Roles add depth to the tactical set up of your teamPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nEach player on your team also comes with specific level of Role Familiarity, denoted by \u2018plus' signs. A player's familiarity to a position and its corresponding roles and responsibilities guides how good they will be when starting from that position. A single plus sign next to a role indicates the player has mastered the position, while a double plus sign \u2014 only available for certain players \u2014 tells you that they are one of the world's best in that role. These options are quite helpful in guiding player-level behaviour on the pitch and offer you the freedom to tweak around and see what's working for you. The more role-familiar players you have in your starting XI, the more your team is likely to actually play like team.\n\nBeyond menus and inputs, the AI-driven tactical core of EA Sports FC 25, however, remains annoyingly broken. EA says there's a new AI model guiding positional awareness and player behaviour in the game that utilises real-world data. And the new iteration of the Hypermotion technology claims to bring more authentic on-pitch player interactions, animations and visuals. But, when playing a match in FC 25, these changes are frankly imperceptible. There's barely any noticeable shift in visual fidelity from FC 24, and while there are newer animations for player actions in the game, AI player behaviour remains woeful. Despite spending hours setting up your tactics, it is often a struggle to get your team to behave like a real-life football club. You see glaring gaps in the midfield, AI-controlled defenders not rushing to mark attackers in space, and AI players constantly failing to adapt to evolving situations in a match.\n\nFC 25 features Smart Tactics options that can be accessed with the D-padPhoto Credit: EA\n\nAnd it isn't just the on-pitch flaws that are carried over from previous games; general UI clunk, unresponsive inputs in menus, and stuttering transitions between screens are alive and well in FC 25. These recurring frustrations point to a callous approach from EA that mandates rushing out a new edition in time for a new football season over hammering out the dents in the chassis to deliver a polished product. You can also never quite shake the feeling that EA Sports FC 25 is residing under the skin of its predecessor. The main menu here is the clone of the new one seen last year. As is the lazy tradition, this will continue for a few editions before EA knows it's time to switch things up. The familiar DNA pervades every other screen in the game, with only a few strands swapped around to make sure players can see what's changed if they bring a magnifying glass.\n\nLet's talk about the manager mode. The trademark Career mode, where I've sunk most of my time in my decades of playing FIFA, is as usual split between Manager and Player careers \u2014 I'll mostly be talking about the former. In FC 24, the Career mode felt largely ignored, with EA only bringing minor and cosmetic changes to the tired formula. In FC 25, the changes, unfortunately, remain aesthetic and stop way short of overhauling the manager mode experience. The ability to set an overarching tactical vision for your club, introduced last year, has been retained, and there are some tweaks across different aspects of the mode, but little is new in terms of impactful additions. The Career mode homepage now shows a rolling list of your tasks as a manager and a social media feed on the side providing updates on player transfers from football gossip god Fabrizio Romano and club and player news from The Athletic. After the initial novelty of checking every item off your list before you head to matchday, you start to groan at the repetitive tasks and eventually start ignoring them.\n\nThe new manager mode homescreen comes with a task list and a social media feedPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe new tactics system makes its way to the Career mode, changing the way you set up your club to win matches, but the all-important transfer hub remains the same for practical purposes. The way you set up your scouts, find players you need, engage in transfer negotiations is completely unchanged, following the set formats we've seen for years now. And there is still no VAR in EA Sports FC 25. I understand that implementing a video review system in online matches is not feasible, but playing manager mode in 2024 without VAR affecting matches and their outcomes seems outlandish. There is a greater focus on youth development and scouting; manager mode even lets you play bi-monthly five-a-side youth tournaments to accelerate the growth of your youth team. And now there's an option to embark on a manager career for a women's team from some of the top licensed leagues. While these additions are appreciated, EA has frustratingly again overlooked a core overhaul of the manager mode that fans have long demanded.\n\nAs expected, however, the money-spinning Ultimate Team mode gets the spotlight again. EA's biggest addition this time around is a quickfire 5v5 Rush mode, that in essence replaces the Volta street football mode. Rush comes with its own set of rules for offside, player penalties and set pieces, all of which fit naturally within the seven-minute match format. The new feature, available across different game modes, strips away the contrived \u201ccoolness\u201d of Volta with simple, fun five-a-side matches that truly shine in the Ultimate Team mode. With Rush, EA is basically cribbing from Rocket League. In Ultimate Team Rush, you can either team up with friends or play with strangers online \u2014 each user controlling a player \u2014 and take on other teams of five online. As a former Rocket League addict, I can confirm that Rush has the same effect. It's fast, engaging and often frustrating \u2014 but never not fun.\n\nRocket league-style five-a-side Rush mode is fun and addictivePhoto Credit: EA\n\nPlaying with friends online naturally brings more cohesion to your game, but jumping into a match with strangers is as unpredictable as you'd expect it to be. If you're lucky, you'll match with players who want to work as a team, construct selfless plays and win together. Most of the time, however, you'll find yourself playing with pre-pubescent idiots who're in the habit of shouting \u201cSiuuuuu\u201d after eating their morning cereal. Nevertheless, Rush is cool, if derivative addition to EA Sports FC 25, and I found myself playing quickfire games online again and again. In fact, despite getting a good Ultimate Team together on paper, I played more Rush games than the traditional 11v11 matches in Ultimate Team Rivals.\n\nThe familiar stuff from Ultimate Team, like squad-building challenges and online competitions, are all here \u2014 and so is in-your-face case for microtransactions. The new tactical system and player roles make their way into mode, too. In addition to introducing the all-new Rush mode, FC 25 expands the Evolutions feature, which brings cosmetic and stat upgrades to your player cards in Ultimate Team. You can select an eligible player from your team and graft to complete challenges that upgrade your player cards. Or you can give EA more money and spend in-game currency to buy upgrades.\n\nUltimate Team remains the focus for EAPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nAside from Ultimate Team, other familiar modes like online Seasons, Clubs and Co-op Seasons are all here in the same form we've seen for years. As with all EA Sports football games, the comfort of consistency remains key. There are no radical changes, no upending of norms, no risk-taking. But one can hardly begrudge EA to rip apart things that have continued to work for years for reasons as flimsy as creativity and innovation. But it's the minor visual upgrades that leave a bad taste in the mouth. EA Sports FC 25 runs and looks as we've come to expect games in the series to run and look for the past few years.\n\nAs I mentioned, when it comes to the naked eye test, there's little that differentiates the game from its predecessor. Sure, certain player faces are more detailed now, as is the norm with every new edition, and a fresh set of animations try and add a bit more realism to player movement, but these don't amount to a perceptible visual upgrade on the pitch. Annoyingly though, cloth physics gets an upgrade that makes player kits comedically bouncy. Shirts and shorts look like they are going through a panic attack, wiggling as if they have a mind of their own. The ever-present general layer of visual glitches and jank hasn't been ironed out, as well. Whether you're on the pitch or in the menus, EA Sports FC 25 will often refuse to follow your lead.\n\nCertain player faces and animations are improved in FC 25Photo Credit: EA\n\nWhen you put all of its new tricks and familiar frustrations into a bag, EA Sports FC 25 fails to offer an experience that makes you look at the series in a new light. And that seems to be the recurring problem with the franchise as a whole. EA has constantly favoured reiteration over rejuvenation, and sadly that approach has only led to regurgitation. Every new edition of its annual football sim feels like meeting an old friend, asking \u201chow you've been\u201d and getting \u201csame old, same old\u201d in reply. There are some new ideas, most notably the Rocket League-style Rush mode that adds a much needed, well, rush to an otherwise stale table of contents. And while the tactical overhaul brings a new way to engage with team strategy and player instructions, it does so at the cost of mechanical flexibility.\n\nThe on-pitch gameplay takes a few steps forward in the right direction, empowering the defensive side of the game, but FC 25 stops short of taking necessary strides towards meaningful upgrades that could change the game for good. The continued apathy towards career mode, however, remains the biggest complaint. Gaping cracks in the quintessential mode have repeatedly been ignored for surface-level improvements \u2014 as if a new coat of paint would change the fact that the underlying wall is rotting. EA Sports FC 25, disappointingly, opts to do the same, even though a foundational change is long overdue. Over the past few years, EA's long-running football franchise has essentially embraced a live service strategy, with minor seasonal upgrades rolled out annually to an audience hooked to its unethical commercial model. The only difference is that EA asks you to pay full price every year for a \u201cnew\u201d game.\n\n Engaging and addictive Rush mode Deeper tactical control with Player Roles Greater emphasis on defending Focus on realism with Simulation setting Improved animations\n\n Minor changes to career mode UI and gameplay jank Lack of noticeable visual upgrades Rigid new tactics system Frustrating AI player behaviour\n\nRating (out of 10): 6\n\nEA Sports FC 25 released September 27 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X and Nintendo Switch.\n\nPricing starts at Rs. 3,999 for the Standard Edition on Steam and Epic Games Store for PC, and Rs. 4,499 on PlayStation Store for PS5 and PS4, and Microsoft Store for Xbox Series S/X and Xbox One.",
