                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>What is Botulism?

Botulism is a serious health disorder in the form of poisoning.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The cause of this poisoning condition is the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Although this disease is a rare health disorder, the poison it causes is very dangerous and deadly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Bacteria can produce toxins that attack the nervous system.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Starting from the brain nerves, spinal cord, or other nerves that can cause muscle paralysis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This paralysis can occur in the muscles that control breathing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This can cause death if the sufferer does not receive immediate treatment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The bacteria that cause botulism can enter the body through the consumption of certain foods or open wounds on the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In addition, this disease can also.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Symptoms of Botulism

When this disease attacks someone, the sufferer will experience several symptoms.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, the symptoms can be different for each sufferer.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Because the appearance of symptoms and what the symptoms are will depend on the type.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In general, symptoms can appear within hours or days after a person is exposed to toxins from the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

When exposed, some of the early symptoms of this disease can mimic digestive disorders.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Starting from stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Without early treatment, toxins from bacteria that enter the body will disrupt nerve function and cause muscle paralysis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

When muscle paralysis has occurred, the following symptoms may appear:

Double or blurred vision.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Difficulty swallowing or dysphagia and difficulty breathing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Decreased ability to speak, so that sufferers of this condition become stuttering.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

There is weakness in the facial muscles and paralysis or difficulty moving the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Drooping eyelids.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, symptoms of foodborne botulism generally appear 12–36 hours or several days after the toxin enters the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, in cases of wound botulism, symptoms usually only appear 10 days after exposure to the toxin.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In cases of infant botulism, symptoms usually appear 18–36 hours after the body is exposed to the toxin.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The symptoms of infant botulism include:

Constipation or constipation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The baby becomes fussy or cries easily, but the sound of his cry is weak.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Tends to produce a lot of saliva (drool).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Appears sleepy and weak, with movements that appear droopy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The baby has difficulty controlling head movements.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Seems to have difficulty sucking breast milk or chewing food.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Babies can also become paralyzed (not move at all).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Causes of Botulism

The cause of this condition is the bacteria Clostridium botulinum m.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This bacteria can be found in dust, soil, rivers, or the seabed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Actually, this bacteria is not dangerous if it is in normal environmental conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, if it is in an environment lacking oxygen, this bacteria will release its toxins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

For example, if it is in a can, bottle cap, human body, or stationary ground.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Risk Factors Of Botulism

There are at least several factors that can trigger this condition, for example:

Drug abuse, the bacteria that cause it can cause contamination of substances contained in drugs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Frequently consuming low-acid canned foods, especially if the packaging is not good.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Frequent exposure to soil, or having a job that involves soil in the environment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Types of Botulism

This condition has several different types which are divided based on the trigger, namely:

1.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Botulism Food Poisoning

This is a type that appears due to consuming food contaminated with C.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Botulinum bacteria.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Especially canned foods such as canned fish or meat that have not been processed properly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Apart from canned food, there are several types of food that are also susceptible to containing this bacteria, namely:

Fermented, smoked, or salted fish.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Canned low-acid vegetables or fruits.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If a person consumes food that contains the toxin that causes this condition, the toxin will interfere with nerve function, resulting in paralysis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

2.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wound Botulism

Wound botulism is a type that appears due to wounds in sufferers that are infected with bacteria.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

These bacteria will then multiply, then produce toxins that cause this condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

3.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Infant Botulism

Infant botulism or baby botulism is a type that occurs when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum spores.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

These spores are commonly found in soil or honey.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These spores can then multiply and produce toxins, specifically in the digestive tract.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In most cases, this condition generally occurs in babies under one year of age.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

4.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Adult Intestine

This type of botulism is a very rare form of botulism.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This condition can occur when bacterial spores enter the intestines of adults, grow, and produce a toxin similar to the type of infant botulism.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

People with a history of intestinal health problems are at risk of experiencing this type.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Latrogenic

This type occurs when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical purposes (botox).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

For example, Botox injections for wrinkles, or medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Inhalation

This type is very rare.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, this condition can occur when you breathe in air that contains toxins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Diagnosis Of Botulism

If you suspect that you or someone you know has botulism, seek medical help immediately.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This is because early examination and treatment are very important in preventing the risk of complications that can threaten safety.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

To diagnose this disease, the doctor will perform a physical examination, noting signs or symptoms of poisoning.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The doctor will also conduct a medical interview by asking about the food the sufferer has consumed in the last few days.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This is to find out the possible source of the poison, and whether anyone else ate the same food.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Then, the doctor will also ask whether there are any wounds that appear or not.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The doctor may also take blood or stool samples to detect the presence of toxins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, the results of these tests may take days to come back.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Therefore, most doctors rely on clinical observation of symptoms to make a diagnosis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, some symptoms of this condition can mimic other diseases and conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Based on this, your doctor may also order additional tests to rule out other causes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These tests may include:

Electromyography (EMG) to evaluate muscle response.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Imaging scans to detect internal damage to the head or brain.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
A spinal fluid test to determine if infection or injury to the brain or spinal cord is causing symptoms.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Complications of Botulism

If not treated quickly and correctly, sufferers of this condition may be at risk of several complications such as:

Respiratory disorders.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Difficulty speaking.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Difficulty swallowing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Feeling weak all the time.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Breath becomes short.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Botulism Treatment

People with botulism need to be hospitalized.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This treatment aims to neutralize toxins so that body functions can return to normal.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

It should be noted that the treatment carried out by botulism sufferers is not to overcome muscle paralysis and respiratory disorders that have already occurred.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Treatment is done to prevent symptoms from getting worse.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Here are some treatments that doctors generally perform:

Antitoxin administration.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In people with food poisoning botulism or wound botulism, doctors usually inject antitoxin to reduce the risk of complications.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Antitoxin containing botulism immune globulin is usually given to treat infant botulism.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Administration of antibiotics.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This is beneficial for people with wound botulism because antibiotics can speed up the release of toxins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Breathing aids.</p>

Botulism Prevention

In most cases, prevention for the condition is fairly easy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Here are some steps you can take to reduce your risk:

If you want to preserve food, follow the proper techniques when canning food at home.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Make sure you achieve adequate heat and acid levels.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Be careful about consuming fish or other seafood that is preserved through fermentation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Avoid tasting canned food that has been opened for a long time to see if it still tastes good or not.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Be sure not to consume any canned food that is open or bulging.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Throw away any cans that are bulging, leaking, or appear damaged.</p>
