                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Therefore, the skin, hair, and eye color of sufferers of this condition are pale and tend to be white.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> People of African descent who have this condition may have light brown or reddish-brown skin and have freckles.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For some, their skin color can be nearly the same as a parent or sibling without albinism.</p>
