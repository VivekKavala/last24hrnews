        "text": "Nagpur: Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar sparked a row with his 'controversial' remarks against Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' wife Amruta Fadnavis stoking strong condemnation from the Bharatiya Janata Party.Targeting Deputy CM Fadnavis over his \"Dharamyuddh\" remark, Kanhaiya Kumar took a jibe and that the job of saving 'dharma' should be of everyone, and it should not be like people are saving the religion and Deputy CM's wife is \"making reels on Instagram.\"\"Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that this is a 'Dharamyudh'. This is a good thing. It is our Dharam to protect the democracy and the constitution for which I am standing and giving a speech today. Whichever leader talks about saving religion, you have to ask only one thing to that leader who is giving you speech about saving religion that will your son or daughter join us in this fight to save religion?\" Kanhaiya said during a public rally in Nagpur on Wednesday.\"Will this happen that the responsibility of saving the religion will be ours and your children will study in Oxford Cambridge universities. If we want to save religion, let us save it together. It can't be like we save religion and the Deputy Chief Minister's wife makes reels on Instagram. It can't be like that. Everyone will save the religion together,\" he added.Last week, Devendra Fadnavis while campaigning for Mahayuti candidates for the upcoming assembly polls, said that \"Vote-Jihad\" should be countered by \"Dharma-Yuddha\" of the vote.Kanhaiya's remarks drew strong criticism from the BJP. Party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla called Kanhaiya \"Naxali Afzal Guru Samarthak\" and said his remarks are an insult to all the Marathi women.\"Hey you Naxali Afzal Guru supporter Congress' Kanhaiya Kumar. How dare you insult a daughter of Maharashtra. Amruta Fadnavis' insult is an insult of each and every Marathi woman. Those using terms like 'rejected maal', 'imported maal' will be taught a lesson by the people of Maharashtra,\" Poonawalla stated in a post on X.Meanwhile, the campaigning has intensified for the 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra with both the ruling Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) making efforts to woo the electorate.The polls are scheduled for November 20 and counting will be held on November 23. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena secured 56, and Congress 44. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, MVA posed a strong performance winning 30 of 48 seats, while the Mahayuti could only win 17.",

        "text": "New York: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents raided the Manhattan apartment of Shayne Coplan, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Polymarket, a prediction market platform that accurately forecasted Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, New York Post reported on Wednesday citing sources.26-year-old Polymarket CEO Coplan was woken up at 6 am (local time) in his Soho apartment by US law enforcement, who demanded he hand over his phone and other electronic devices, the NY Post reported citing a source close to the matter.Coplan was not provided with a reason for the raid, but the source suspects it was political retribution since Polymarket accurately predicted an easy Trump triumph over Vice President Kamala Harris - as opposed to traditional polls, as per the New York Post.Indian-origin Vivek Ramaswamy, who was appointed to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration, responded to a post on X about the development, writing, \"Are they mad polymarket predicted the race correctly?\"The source also speculated that the US government could try to accuse Polymarket of market manipulation and rigging its polls in favour of Trump against Vice President Kamala Harris. \"This is obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election,\" New York Post reported citing sources.Coplan was not arrested and has not been charged, a Polymarket spokesperson told the New York Post on Wednesday evening. He said, \"Polymarket is a fully transparent prediction market that helps everyday people better understand the events that matter most to them, including elections,\" addding, \"We charge no fees, take no trading positions, and allow observers from around the world to analyze all market data as a public good.\"The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment, as reported by New York Post.Reacting to the raid, Coplan posted on X, saying, \"New phone, who dis?\"The FBI action comes a week after Coplan said that Polymarket plans to return to the US. The platform had predicted a 58.6 per cent chance of a Trump victory on the morning before Election Day, with Vice President Kamala Harris at 41.4 per cent, as reported by New York Post. Polymarket has also been linked to Trump and his allies, with Billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel raising about USD 70 million in funding for the platform, according to a Forbes report earlier this year, New York Post reported.In 2022, Polymarket was forced to pause its trading in the US and pay a USD 1.4 million penalty to settle charges with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for failing to register with the agency.A Polymarket \"whale\" who bet millions on a Trump win had reportedly managed to rake in about USD 85 million in profits. The anonymous bettor, who goes by Theo, was previously believed to operate four separate accounts on Polymarket, the online betting platform that sold Donald Trump and Kamala Harris contracts ahead of the presidential election, as reported by New York Post.According to the report, around USD 3.7 billion were spent on US presidential election betting, with the majority of bets placed on Trump.\"There was USD 3.7 billion spent on placing bets around the US presidential election, the most of which was spent on Trump, rather than Harris, something that had become an election indicator in the last month before the elections,\" as reported by New York Post.\"It's grand political theatre at its worst. They could have asked his lawyer for any of these things. Instead, they staged a so-called raid so they can leak it to the media and use it for obvious political reasons,\" New Post reported citing sources.",

        "text": "Hitting back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his attack on Rahul Gandhi for flaunting a \u2018blank constitution\u2019, the Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition said the Constitution seems blank to the Prime Minister because he has never read it in his life. Addressing a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra today, Rahul said that the Prime Minister says that I show the Constitution in public meetings that is empty. \u201cSanvidhan unke liye khali hai kyuki unhone ise zindagi mein pada nahi hai (The Constitution seems empty to him because he\u2019s never read it in his life),\u201d Rahul Gandhi said in a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra\u2019s Nandurbar. Attacking the Prime Minister further, the Congress leader said that the Constitution is not blank, but carries thoughts and ideas of thousand years.\u201cHe has no idea what\u2019s written inside this book; that\u2019s why he says it\u2019s empty. He says Rahul Gandhi shows a red book. It doesn\u2019t matter to us what colour the book is; what matters is what\u2019s written inside it. We are ready to give our lives for what it represents,\u201d Rahul Gandhi said.\u201cI want to explain to the Prime Minister that this Constitution is not hollow. It is filled with thousands of years of thought. When you call it hollow, you disrespect Birsa Munda, Mahatma Gandhi, Ambedkar, and others. This fight is about protecting it,\u201d he added.Earlier, Prime Minister Modi attacked Rahul Gandhi saying the \u201cLaal Kitab\u201d of the Constitution which the Congress was flaunting contained \u201cnothing\u201d.\u201cIn \u2018farziwada\u2019, Congress has broken its own record. The \u2018Laal Kitab\u2019 of the Constitution which the Congress party was flaunting and distributing contained \u2018nothing\u2019. It was an empty book. This is nothing but a testament to Congress\u2019 disregard and hate for Baba Saheb Ambedkar. The entire country is in shock over this foolish and unfortunate political play of Congress,\u201d PM Modi said.Further in his address, the Lok Sabha LoP slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party over tribal population, and alleged that the Prime Minister and the BJP-RSS call indigenous people \u201cVanvasi\u201d (forest dwellers) and carry out deforestation across the country. \u201cCongress introduced the Land Acquisition Bill to protect your land. The Tribal Rights Act granted you rights to the forest, land, and water. But as soon as the BJP government comes to power, they take your land and hand it over to billionaires. The term \u201cVanvasi\u201d implies that your children should not become doctors or engineers, should not get jobs, and should not do business. \u201cAdivasi,\u201d on the other hand, means that your children can achieve anything. That is the difference between \u201cAdivasi\u201d and \u201cVanvasi,\u201d Rahul said.He further pointed out that in India, the Adivasi population is eight per cent, and their participation should match this percentage. \u201cI investigated the representation of Adivasis in the Indian government. There are 90 officials who run the government. If the government spends 100 rupees, how many Adivasi officials make decisions about it? Adivasi officials make decisions over just 10 paise of that amount. Out of 90, there is only one Adivasi official, who is side-lined. We need to change this, and the way to do it is through a caste census,\u201d the Congress leader said.The Lok Sabha LoP asserted that the Congress party has decided that as much money the Prime Minister waives off for billionaires, they will give to the common people.Highlighting his guarantees, the Congress MP said that under the Mahalaxmi Yojana, on the first day of every month, women will receive Rs 3,000 directly in their accounts. \u201cAfter that, we will provide free bus travel for women. Farmers will have up to three lakh rupees of debt waived. When farmers sell paddy, cotton, or soybeans, our government will provide MSP (Minimum Support Price). We will conduct the caste census,\u201d Rahul Gandhi said.\u201cIn Maharashtra, everyone will be provided with health insurance up to 25 lakh rupees. For any illness, you can go to the hospital and get treatment up to 25 lakh rupees free of charge. Unemployed youth will receive 4,000 rupees per month until they secure employment,\u201d he added.The Congress leader also alleged that the BJP has moved 5 lakh jobs from Maharashtra to other states.\u201cIf we look at employment collectively, BJP has moved 5 lakh jobs from Maharashtra to other states. The INDIA bloc government will not do this. The projects of Maharashtra will remain here. We do not want projects from here to be shifted to other states, forcing Adivasis here to work as labourers there,\u201d Rahul added.The campaigning has intensified for the 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra with both the ruling Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) making efforts to woo the electorate.The polls are scheduled for November 20 and counting will be held on November 23.In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena secured 56, and Congress 44.

        "text": "New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday conducted pan-India searches at multiple locations in West Bengal, Sikkim, and Tamil Nadu in connection with financial fraud of lottery and the corruption case involving money laundering through lottery tickets to certain influential people.The raids have been underway since Thursday morning in at the premises of suspects in West Bengal's Kolkata, Sikkim, and Tamil Nadu's Chennai and Coimbatore.The agency is probing a lottery scam case registered in 2012 against lottery baron Santiago Martin and others, in which the Sikkim government was allegedly cheated. The ED had earlier attached assets worth Rs 277.59 crore in the case. They included a large number of immovable properties in Tamil Nadu.On the basis of the charge sheets filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation, the ED had initiated a money laundering probe against Martin and his company, Future Gaming Solutions (P) Limited (presently Future Gaming and Hotel Services (P) Limited and formerly Martin Lottery Agencies Limited).The agency had then alleged that Martin and others conspired to make wrongful gains.They entered into an agreement with State government officials, in contravention of the Lottery Regulations Act, under which the company could avoid remitting the face value of lottery tickets sold in Kerala to the State exchequer as sale proceeds.An illegal gain of over Rs 910.30 crore was made by inflating the prize winning tickets' claims from April 1, 2009, to August 31, 2010, as alleged.In another case, the Enforcement Directorate in 2022 had also attached properties worth Rs 409.92 crore in the case against Future Gaming and Hotel Services Private Limited and its various sub-distributors and area distributors for West Bengal.The ED probe is based on the cases registered by the Kolkata Police under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Lotteries (Regulation) Act. The attached assets are in the form of bank balance and mutual fund holdings.",

When we achieved independence after decades of struggle and innumerable sacrifices, even then there were people who used to play politics of scaring and misleading the innocent public. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji strongly opposed them and told the common people \u2013 \u201cDo not be afraid!\u201d\u201dShe further wrote that people who spread fear cannot be true representatives of the public.\u201cPublic servants stand in the forefront with their heads held high so that people can live without fear. Pandit Nehru always taught the public to be fearless and serve selflessly, while on the other hand he kept the public supreme at every stage of nation-building. Respectful salute to the creator of modern India,\u201d she added.The Congress candidate for Wayanad Lok Sabha by-elections, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has exuded confidence in winning and expects that the people will give her a chance to be their representative.Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to former PM Jawaharlal Nehru.In a post on X, PM Modi said, \u201cOn the occasion of his birth anniversary, I pay homage to our former Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.\u201dChildren\u2019s Day is celebrated on November 14 every year as a mark of respect to Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India.Fondly called \u2018Chacha Nehru\u2019, he was known for emphasising the importance of giving love and affection to children.After his demise, it was unanimously decided to celebrate his birthday as \u2018Bal Diwas\u2019 or Children\u2019s Day in India.Nehru was born on November 14, 1889, in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Prayagraj.
