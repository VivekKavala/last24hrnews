        "text": "The ruling Congress government in Karnataka has upped the ante on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah\u2019s claims that the BJP offered Rs 50 crores each to 50 Congress MLAs to destabilise the Karnataka government during the alleged \u2018poaching\u2019 attempts, dubbed as \u2018Operation Kamala\u2019.The CM himself reiterated the allegations, \u201cI said what they did previously. I said they tried to destabilise the govt by offering Rs 50 crores, in which they couldn\u2019t succeed.\u201dThe Chief Minister had earlier made the accusation on Wednesday in Mysuru during his address after launching development works worth 470 crores in T. Narasipur. Senior Minister HK Patil said that he backed the CM\u2019s claims as they would have come from credible sources.\u201cOur CM must have got credible information and the way the BJP is functioning and their leaders are talking it shows that they are making that kind of effort. You all know how they operated in Maharashtra. Keeping all this in view, the CM has said so. But there is nothing to worry about, our MLAs and party are strong and our govt is stable,\u201d HK Patil said.Another State Minister Ramalinga Reddy said that the BJP had been trying to destabilise the government over six months but had failed.\u201cThey (BJP) have been trying for last 6 months, but they have failed. No MLA is ready to go with those people. Since they have failed, they are making allegations against the Congress party and Siddaramaiah. They will never succeed. They will be in opposition for the next 3-5 years\u2026They (BJP) are dreaming of becoming ministers,\u201d he said.State Minister Dr M C Sudhakar said that the BJP had been publically saying that the Congress government would not last and thus are trying everything.\u201cSee, poaching MLAs from other parties is not new to BJP. From the day Congress came to power in Karnataka, time and again BJP started saying that this govt was not going to last long. Their great ally HD Kumaraswamy and former PM Deve Gowda is also saying the same. This indicates that they (BJP) are trying all means. They (BJP) would have tried. Without proper information, the CM would not have spoken\u2026\u201dKarnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar said that the Chief Minister has got some credible information on this.DK Shivakumar said, \u201cA lot of information is coming from the BJP side also. We will speak with CM and come back to you (media) on this.\u201dEarlier CM Siddaramaiah had lashed out at the BJP, saying that it won\u2019t succeed in its plans.Speaking to reporters, the Karnataka Chief Minister said not a single MLA from the ruling Congress will switch sides.\u201cIt is true that BJP is trying to destabilise our government, but they will not succeed in their plans. They tried earlier to topple our government and succeeded, but such ploys won\u2019t work this time. It is clear that they can do anything, and go to any lengths to grab power. But now a single MLA from our party will go to the BJP,\u201d Siddaramaiah said.His remark came amid the trading of barbs between the ruling Congress in Karnataka and the BJP over alleged \u2018poaching\u2019 attempts, dubbed as \u2018Operation Kamala\u2019, in the southern state",

        "text": "Star India batter Tilak Verma dedicated his maiden T20I century to skipper Suryakumar Yadav as he promoted him up the order during the third match of the series at the SuperSport Park on Wednesday.Tilak Varma was named the \u2018Player of the Match\u2019 after his staggering performance with the bat. The left-hand batter played an unbeaten knock of 107 runs off just 56 deliveries which was laced with eight boundaries and seven maximums in his innings. The southpaw scored runs at a whopping strike rate of 191.07.\u201cIt was for Suryakumar, our captain. He has given me the opportunity to bat at No.3. Because I love to bat at that spot, and last 2 matches I batted at No.4. But before this match, he came to my room and said that \u2018you\u2019re going to bat at No.3. It\u2019s a good opportunity, so express yourself,\u201d said Tilak in the post-match press conference. Recapping the 3rd T20I of the series, South Africa won the toss and decided to field. Abhishek Sharma (50 runs from 25 balls, 3 fours and 5 sixes) and Tilak Varma (107* runs from 56 balls, 8 fours and 7 sixes) powered India to 219/6 in the first innings. Other batters failed to shine with the bat.Andile Simelane and Keshav Maharaj led the Proteas bowling attack and bagged two wickets each in their respective spell. During the run chase, Heinrich Klaasen (41 runs from 22 balls, 1 four and 4 sixes) and Marco Jansen (54 runs from 17 balls, 4 fours and 5 sixes) kept the Proteas in the game. But with the help of Arshdeep, India prevailed in the end.Arshdeep did the job both with the new ball and in the death overs as he picked up three crucial wickets and gave 37 runs in his four-over spell. Varun Chakaravarthy bagged two wickets in his four-over spell. (ANI)",

        "text": "As Jharkhand braces for the second phase of polling on November 20, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that it has been decided in the first phase of elections that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would form the government in the state and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) would be turfed out. Taking a dig at Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, Union Minister Shah said that Soren\u2019s time was coming to an end now. \u201cThe first phase of elections in Jharkhand has made it clear that JMM will be turfed and BJP will form the government in the state. I want to say to Hemant Soren that his time was coming to an end. Has anyone of you ever seen Rs 350 crores? This amount has been seized from the residence of a Congress leader. Another of Soren\u2019s ministers Alam Gir Alam, his personal assistant (PA) had Rs 35 crores at his residence. Whose money is it? Does it belong to Hemant or Kalpana Soren? It belongs to you,\u201d said Amit Shah while addressing a rally in Gandey assembly constituency. The Union Home Minister further accused Congress of opposing the formation of Jharkhand and Soren for joining hands with them for \u201cgreed of power\u201d.\u201cA lot of people sacrificed their lives and dedicated their whole lives to the state of Jharkhand. Ultimately, Jharkhand was formed under the government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Congress wanted to stop that. Yet, CM Hemant Soren is standing with that same Congress party as he is greedy for power,\u201d Shah said. Amit Shah promised to set up factories in Jharkhand to resolve the issue of unemployment in the state, blaming the Bangladeshi \u201cinfiltrators\u201d for taking away employment opportunities. He said that the BJP government would bring a law against infiltrators. \u201cJharkhand is the most prosperous state in the country. Jharkhand has so much of minerals that make it the most prosperous state of the country. But the youth here go to different places like Delhi and Mumbai for employment. I will set up enough factories here to generate employment opportunities here\u2026Your employment opportunities have been decreased by the infiltrators from Bangladesh\u2026We will bring a law against infiltrators. They will have to return the land they have taken from tribals,\u201d the Union Minister said.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said that the ruling parties in the state including Congress, Rashtriya Janata Party (RJD) and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) were looting and misleading people. He alleged that they were promoting leftists to turn Jharkhand into a den of Naxals.\n\nElections on the remaining 38 seats will be conducted on November 20. The counting of the votes will take place on November 23",

According to Fox Cricket\u2019s recent video on X, Kohli\u2019s training session was eagerly watched by fans, who went to great lengths to catch a glimpse of their hero.\u201cFirst look at Virat Kohli at the Perth nets ahead of the Test series opener,\u201d a Fox News Cricket post stated.\u201cSome fans went the extra mile to catch a glimpse of the King,\u201d it added.\n\nFirst look at Virat Kohli at the Perth nets ahead of the Test series opener \ud83c\udfcf\nSome fans went the extra mile to catch a glimpse of the King \ud83d\udc40#AUSvIND pic.twitter.com/pXDEtDhPeY\n\u2014 Fox Cricket (@FoxCricket) November 14, 2024\n\nVirat Kohli, a player who has always been a crowd-puller in Australia, is once again generating significant buzz. His presence in Australia is synonymous with high viewership and extensive media coverage.However, the upcoming series holds immense significance for Kohli. It is viewed as a make-or-break phase in his illustrious career. The former Indian captain is under pressure to regain his form and secure his spot in the Test team amid a potential transition phase, with younger talents waiting for their chance in the playing eleven.Kohli\u2019s current form is a cause for concern. In 19 international matches this year, the 80-time centurion has managed to score only 488 runs at an average of 20.33, with just two half-centuries in 25 innings and a highest score of 76. His struggles in Test cricket have been particularly troubling, given his past dominance in the format.From 2016 to 2019, Kohli was at the peak of his career, amassing 4,208 runs at an astonishing average of 66.79, including 16 centuries and 10 fifties. He also set a record with seven double centuries, the most by a captain in Tests. However, since 2020, his form has dipped dramatically, scoring 1,838 runs in 34 Tests at an average of 31.68, with only two centuries and nine fifties.The recent home Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand further highlighted his struggles. Kohli scored just 192 runs in 10 innings at an average of 21.33, with only one half-century. This decline in performance saw him slip out of the Top 20 in the ICC Men\u2019s Test batting rankings for the first time in a decade.As Kohli faces criticism and doubts about his place in the team, the series in Australia presents an opportunity for redemption. Historically, Australia has been a stage where Kohli has performed spectacularly, and fans hope he can repeat that success.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series kicks off on November 22 with the first Test in Perth. The second Test, a day-night affair, is scheduled from December 6 to 10 at Adelaide Oval. The third Test will take place at The Gabba in Brisbane from December 14 to 18.The traditional Boxing Day Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground is set for December 26 to 30, followed by the fifth and final Test at Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3 to 7. This series promises a thrilling contest and a potential turning point in Kohli\u2019s career. (ANI)",
