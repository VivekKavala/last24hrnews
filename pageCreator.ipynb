Our government has increased it 5 times to Rs 1.25 lakh crores. Just a few days ago, we have started a special scheme for the development of more than 60,000 tribal villages in the country- Dharti Aaba, Janjatiya Gram, Utkarsh Abhiyan,” said PM Modi.“Under this, about Rs 80,000 crore will be invested in tribal villages. Its purpose is to provide necessary facilities to the tribal society as well as to create training and employment opportunities for the youth,” said the PM.“Last year on this day I was in Ulihatu, the village of Dharti Aba Birsa Munda.Today I have come to that land which has seen the bravery of martyr Tilka Manjhi. But this time the event is even more special since the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Birsa Munda begins across the country today onwards. These programs will continue for the next one year. Today, around 1 crore people from hundreds of districts of the country are connected with our program through technology,” PM Modi added.Highlighting the initiatives for tribal development, PM Modi said, “Today the foundation stone and inauguration of projects worth more than Rs 6 thousand crores have been done. These include approval letters for about 1.5 lakh pucca houses for my tribal brothers and sisters. There are schools and hostels to shape the future of tribal children. There are health facilities for tribal women, hundreds of kilometres of roads connecting tribal areas.”He further said, “The disease of sickle cell anemia has been a big challenge for the tribal society. Our government has launched a national campaign to deal with this, which has been going on for a year now. During this period, about 4.5 crore people have been screened. A large number of Ayushman Arogya Mandirs are being built so that tribal families do not have to travel far for check-ups of other diseases.”PM Modi said that the tribal society has had a huge contribution in the ancient medical system of India and this heritage is also being preserved and new dimensions are being added for future generations.“Earlier governments did not care at all about the extremely backward tribal communities. In order to reduce difficulties in their lives, PM Janman Yojana worth Rs 24 thousand crores was started. This scheme is ensuring development of settlements of the most backward tribes of the country. Today this scheme completes one year,” said the PM.Adding further, PM said, the BJP government has also taken many steps to preserve tribal heritage.“Many people dedicated to tribal art and culture have been honoured with Padma Awards.We started a huge museum in the name of Birsa Munda in Ranchi. Be it culture or social justice, the standard of today’s NDA government is different. I consider it a good fortune not only for the BJP but also for the NDA that we got the opportunity to make Droupadi Murmu the first tribal President of the country,” said PM Modi.Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Bihar’s Jamui on the occasion of ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Divas’ and paid tribute to tribal leader ‘Bhagwan Birsa Munda’, marking the commencement of his 150th birth anniversary celebrations on Friday.PM Modi could be seen donning a white kurta and churidar with an olive green ethnic jacket.

The aircraft is now grounded at the airport until the technical fault is rectified. This unforeseen incident has caused a delay in the Prime Minister's return to the capital. The Prime Minister was in Jharkhand to address two rallies on the occasion of tribal icon Birsa Munda's anniversary, celebrated as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas. This event also coincided with the second round of polling for the Assembly elections in the state, scheduled for November 20. Interestingly, a similar incident occurred barely 80 km away from Deoghar, in Jharkhand's Godda, where Rahul Gandhi's helicopter was grounded for 45 minutes awaiting clearance from the air traffic control. The Congress party claimed that this delay was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the campaign schedule of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. During his rallies, PM Modi criticized the Congress and Rahul Gandhi. He accused Mr. Gandhi of conspiring to scrap reservations for people belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), and other backward classes (OBC) communities to weaken them. He stated, The Congress has dangerous intentions. The Congress' shehzada is conspiring to scrap reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs. The prince's father had declared reservation as slavery, bonded labor but he was later defeated in elections. His father had issued advertisements to remove reservations... We will thwart any such conspiracy. In response, at a rally in Godda district, Rahul Gandhi pushed for a nationwide caste census, claiming it would change the face of India. He stated, Caste census is bound to happen... We will demolish the 50 percent reservation ceiling, PM Modi can do whatever he can. This incident is reminiscent of historical events where political leaders' travel plans were disrupted due to unforeseen circumstances. For instance, in 2019, a technical snag in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's chopper delayed his return to New Delhi. Similarly, in 2020, the helicopter carrying Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde had to return to his native village due to rainy weather. The recent events in Jharkhand have sparked a political debate, with the Congress party suggesting that the PM's rally was being prioritized over Mr. Gandhi's movements. This incident has brought to light the intense political rivalry between the two parties, especially in the context of the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.

In addition, the letter pointed out the role of JKLF in the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus in 1990.\\n\\n“Mr. Zafar Khan is the Chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Diplomatic Bureau. Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which is a designated terrorist organisation. In 1984 an Indian diplomat, Ravindra Mhatre, was kidnapped and murdered in Birmingham. He was abducted whilst on an errand. After a few days of being held in captivity his lifeless body was discovered sprawled on a Birmingham street. This terrorist crime that took place in a major UK city was executed by ‘militants’ linked to the latterly named Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. In January 1990, the largest and latest flight of the minority Kashmiri Hindus from the Indian state of Jammu Kashmir was instigated by JKLF,” the letter states.\\n\\nThe letter further mentions the links of Muzzammil Ayyub with Islamic terror groups and that he has been booked for causing fear among the people and instigating them to carry out violence.\\n\\n“Mr. Muzzammil Ayyub has often engaged in hate speech against Indians and Hindus.

Muzzammil had also threatened a Kashmiri woman named Tasleema for exposing Pakistan’s propaganda at the United Nations. His X (formerly Twitter) account has been withheld in India. In addition, Muzammil had collaborated with the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) on several occasions to disseminate Pakistani narrative on the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir. A detailed OpIndia report on Muzammil Ayyub Thakur’s anti-India antecedents can be read here.\\n\\nThe Indian students further emphasised that Jammu and Kashmir is an undeniably integral part of India which has also been recognised by the UN and the international community since its legal accession to India in 1947. They added that any debate around Jammu and Kashmir’s status as an Indian territory is an “interference” in India’s sovereignty.\\n\\n“Moreover, Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. The United Nations and the international community have also recognised Kashmir’s status that since its legal and constitutional accession to India in 1947, Jammu and Kashmir has been a part of the Indian state.

In a strongly worded response to Oxford Union’s invitation, Kaul said that, despite his worries about the debate, which he considered was political and heavily influenced by the organisers’ biases, he had opted to participate with an open mind and express himself as a Kashmiri. Kaul referred to Muzzammil Ayyub Thakur and Zafar Khan as “India baiters,” adding that “it would be a travesty of freedom and fairness to have a debate or even an interaction with people who work at the behest of the so-called establishment of the Pakistan deep state.”\\n\\nLot of people have asked me why I chose to withdraw my name from Oxford Union Debate on Kashmir where Pakistan’s Defence Minister & UK MP were also invited. @rjraunac also asked me this question.

Back then, the Oxford Union invited “The Kashmir Files” director Vivek Agnihotri to the debate, however, he declined the invitation to the debate calling its theme “anti-India” and “anti-Kashmir”. \\n\\nBy offering a platform to anti-India elements with links to terror outfits, the Oxford Union is not only attempting to undermine India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity but is also normalising the presence of Islamic terrorists in the mainstream.\\n\\nEvidently, the Oxford Union is influenced by the growing lobbying muscle of Islamist groups in the UK, which are working tirelessly to shape public opinion on Kashmir in line with the Pakistani narrative even as the Kashmiri people are moving forward to the path of peace and development. This permits Islamist groups and individuals to influence conversations in elite intellectual circles, which is alarming given their capacity to rationalise terrorism. Instead of constantly bringing up the now non-existent Kashmir issue and allowing persons with terror ties to dominate the discourse, the Oxford Union should debate serious matters closer to home. The UK is grappling with the alarming surge of Jihadi grooming gangs raping and destroying the lives of British women. The union should debate the growing dominance of Islamists in the UK who are no less than a threat to the UK’s ‘secular fabric’ and its people, instead of challenging India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the garb of debates and discussions.', 'summary': 'On Friday, several Indian students and INSIGHT UK, the social movement of British Hindus and Indians in the United Kingdom held a protest against Oxford Union for inviting terror-linked individuals to challenge India’s sovereignty openly in their debate program.', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/indian-students-condemn-oxford-union-over-inviting-kashmiri-separatists-for-debate/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/oxford-kashmir-protests.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 07:02:44', 'author': 'OpIndia Staff', 'authors': ['OpIndia Staff'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.054}, {'id': 264942860, 'title': 'Indian students protest at Oxford Union over Kashmir Independence Debate', 'text': 'New Delhi: Indian students and British Hindus protested outside the Oxford Union in the United Kingdom on Friday, expressing outrage over a debate titled “This House Believes in the Independent State of Kashmir.” The protest was triggered by the selection of panelists who supported the notion of Kashmiri independence, a stance opposed by the Indian government. The debate, hosted by Oxford University’s debating society, featured Dr. Muzzamil Ayyub Thakur, a Kashmiri activist, and Professor Zafar Khan, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Diplomatic Bureau, both advocating for Kashmir’s independence from India. Speakers against the motion included Prem Shankar Jha, a former media advisor to the Indian government, and Yusuf Kundgol, who argued in favor of Kashmir remaining an integral part of India. The Oxford Union’s Instagram post framed the debate as addressing a long-standing conflict, rooted in the region’s quest for self-determination since the partition of British India in 1947. The post noted that the Kashmir issue has led to multiple wars and continues to fuel unrest and human rights concerns. Protesters, mostly from the Indian student community, condemned the debate for giving a platform to voices supporting Kashmiri independence, calling it a “distortion” of the historical and political context of the region.

The Indian Navy deployed its maritime patrol assets to track and interdict the target. With seamless coordination among agencies, the operation culminated in the seizure of the drugs and the arrest of the crew members, all of whom were Iranian nationals.This joint effort highlights Indias robust measures to safeguard its maritime borders against the growing threat of drug trafficking, which often serves as a funding source for organized crime and terrorism.Union Home Ministers ResponseUnion Home Minister Amit Shah lauded the operation as a milestone in Indias fight against narcotics. Pursuing PM Shri commat;narendramodi Jis vision for a drug-free Bharat, our agencies today busted an international drug trafficking cartel and seized over approx. 700 kg of contraband meth in Gujarat, Shah stated on the social media platform X. He commended the synergy between multiple agencies in achieving this significant victory.Operation Sagar Manthan: A Nationwide InitiativeOperation Sagar Manthan is an ongoing initiative launched earlier this year by the NCB, in collaboration with the Indian Navy, Coast Guard, and Gujarat ATS. Its focus is to combat the maritime trafficking of narcotics, which poses a direct threat to national security.Since its inception, the operation has yielded significant results:Total Drugs Seized: Approximately 3,400 kilograms of narcotics.Arrests: 11 Iranian and 14 Pakistani nationals in three separate cases.Status of Detainees: All arrested individuals are currently lodged in jail awaiting trial.The series of operations under Sagar Manthan underscores Indias increasing vigilance in monitoring its coastal regions to curb illicit activities.Ongoing InvestigationThe NCB is now investigating the drug syndicates supply chain to identify its backward and forward linkages. International cooperation with foreign Drug Law Enforcement Agencies (DLEAs) is being sought to dismantle the broader network. This includes tracing the source of the methamphetamine and its intended destination.Global and National ImplicationsThe seizure of 700 kilograms of methamphetamine not only disrupts the operations of an international drug cartel but also delivers a strong message against organized crime. Such operations enhance Indias reputation as a reliable partner in the global war on drugs while reaffirming its commitment to national security and public safety.This successful operation is a stark reminder of the threats posed by drug trafficking and highlights the importance of proactive intelligence, inter-agency coordination, and international cooperation to address these challenges effectively.', 'summary': \"In a significant breakthrough against international drug trafficking, Indian authorities seized 700 kilograms of methamphetamine and detained eight Iranian nationals from a vessel in Indian waters off the Gujarat coast on November 15, 2024.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department, positioning a well-known vaccine skeptic at the top of the nation’s expansive public health system.Kennedy, a prominent member of a storied Democratic family, gained recognition as an environmental attorney, famously taking on major corporations like DuPont and Monsanto. However, over the past two decades, he has become increasingly known for promoting vaccine-related claims that clash with the scientific consensus. If confirmed Kennedy would head a major federal department responsible for critical health policies, including drug, vaccine, and food safety, medical research, and programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Before the election, Trump vowed to give Kennedy significant authority over health policy.Kennedy, the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, comes from one of the most influential political families in American history. He initially challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination before launching an independent campaign. Eventually, Kennedy struck a deal with the Republican Party, endorsing Trump and securing a promise to lead the health portfolio in Trump’s upcoming administration.Kennedy’s alignment with Trump has earned him substantial support from the Republican base, a level of enthusiasm he never enjoyed from his former Democratic peers. His strong stance against vaccines has distanced him from much of his family, but he and Trump have developed a close bond, campaigning together extensively in the closing days of the election. Trump has committed to appointing Kennedy as a key figure in his efforts to \"Make America Healthy Again.\"Despite insisting that he is not anti-vaccine, Kennedy’s public statements and leadership of the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense tell a different story. He has often questioned vaccine safety, once stating on a podcast that “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and encouraging resistance to CDC vaccination guidelines for children.Kennedy has also vowed to overhaul HHS, scrutinizing the staff at agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He has pledged to address what he describes as a “revolving door” between government agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. According to his campaign’s communications manager, Del Bigtree, Kennedy intends to root out conflicts of interest that he believes undermine public trust in health policies.

The RBI\\'s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee is scheduled to meet next month, and with inflation ruling high, it is unlikely that the RBI would cut benchmark interest rates. “Although the central bank shifted its monetary policy stance to neutral while keeping the repo rate steady at 6.5 per cent in October, it will likely retain relatively tight monetary policy settings into next year, given the fairly healthy growth dynamics and inflation risks,” Moody’s added.In its Global Macro Outlook 2025-26, the US-based rating agency said that household consumption is poised to grow, fuelled by increased spending during the ongoing festive season and a sustained pickup in rural demand. “Additionally, rising capacity utilisation, upbeat business sentiment and the government\\'s continued thrust on infrastructure spending should support private investment,” the rating agency said. India\\'s real GDP expanded 6.7 per cent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024, driven by a revival in household consumption, robust investment and strong manufacturing activity. There are indications of a steady economic momentum in the July-September quarter as well. “... From a macroeconomic perspective, the Indian economy is in a sweet spot, with the mix of solid growth and moderating inflation. We forecast 7.2 per cent growth for calendar year 2024, followed by 6.6 per cent in 2025 and 6.5 per cent in 2026,” Moody\\'s said.It also said sound economic fundamentals, including healthy corporate and bank balance sheets, a stronger external position, and ample foreign exchange reserves also bode well for the growth outlook. The global economy has shown remarkable resilience in bouncing back from supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, an energy and food crisis after the Russia-Ukraine war began, high inflation and consequent monetary policy tightening,” the agency said.“Most G-20 economies will experience steady growth and continue to benefit from policy easing and supportive commodity prices. However, post-election changes in US domestic and international policies could potentially accelerate global economic fragmentation, complicating ongoing stabilization,” said Madhavi Bokil, senior vice president at Moody\\'s Ratings and author of the report.Moody’s further said that trade tensions and geopolitical stresses, particularly between the US and China, are primary risks to the global macroeconomic outlook. “Potential long-term geo-economic fragmentation could complicate global trade,\" Moody’s said.\"Increasing trade protectionism, together with a push in several large economies to strengthen their domestic industries, make external demand a less reliable source of growth,” it said, adding economies with robust domestic drivers of growth will experience greater resilience and stability.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/indian-economy-to-grow-72-percent-in-2024-moodys-forecasts-1838536', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/15/1862979-img4478.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 15:18:12', 'author': 'Madhusudan Sahoo', 'authors': ['Madhusudan Sahoo'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.058}, {'id': 265040966, 'title': \"'Indian economy in sweet spot': Moody's projects India's GDP to grow at 7.2% in 2024\", 'text': 'Moody\\'s Ratings in its lates Global Macro Outlook report on Friday projected Indian economy to grow by 7.2% in 2024, driven by gradual recovery in household spending and easing inflation pressures.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid. “For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would “end the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and “Make America Great and Healthy Again!” Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals. As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy\\'s nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials. Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, “I don’t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.” Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process. Kennedy hails from one of the nation’s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration. He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race’s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role. “I’m going to let him go wild on health,” Trump said at a rally last month. During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to “reorganize” agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry. But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines. Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to “resist” CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations. “I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, ‘Better not get them vaccinated,’” Kennedy said. Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year . Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives. Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike. It remains unclear how that will square with Trump’s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example. Kennedy’s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to...', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-chooses-anti-vaccine-activist-robert-f-kennedy-jr-as-health-secretary-1838359', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/15/1862853-untitleddesign11.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 01:49:35', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.112}, {'id': 264906406, 'title': 'Donald Trump Picks Robert F Kennedy Jr. As Health Secretary', 'text': 'US President-elect Donald Trump has announced Robert F.

Kennedy has been critical of the FDA, stating on social media, \"The FDA\\'s war on public health is about to end.\"Who is Robert F Kennedy Jr?Robert F Kennedy Jr, a familiar name due to his famous family, is known for his work as an environmental lawyer and activist. He recently made headlines for his short-lived run for President of the United States in the 2024 election.Kennedy, born in 1954, is the son of Robert F Kennedy, who served as US Attorney General and a US Senator. Growing up in a family deeply involved in politics and public service shaped Kennedy Jr\\'s career path.Kennedy Jr. earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in American history and literature from Harvard University in 1976. He then pursued law, obtaining his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981. His legal education continued at the London School of Economics and culminated in a Master of Laws degree from Pace University School of Law in 1987.This extensive education provided the foundation for his career dedicated to environmental law and activism. He served as an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), where he took part in legal cases concerning natural resources and environmental laws.Apart from this, RFK Jr also is the president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, an organisation that is committed to preserving the world\\'s water bodies. While leading the waterkeeper alliance he has amplified their outreach toward ensuring clean, safe, and accessible water and giving the ability to community members to conserve their space.Why is Robert F Kennedy anti-vaccineRobert F Kennedy Jr became an anti-vaccine activist largely out of concern for vaccine safety and mistrust in regulatory oversight. His journey began with environmental work, where he initially focused on toxins like mercury. Over time, he extended this focus to vaccines, especially after raising alarms about thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative previously used in vaccines, which he alleged could cause neurological damage. Despite thimerosal being phased out from most vaccines, Kennedy maintained his stance, contending that vaccine safety testing is inadequate and expressing skepticism toward the pharmaceutical industry and federal health agencies like the CDC and FDA.In 2011, he founded Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an organisation that campaigns against vaccines and alleges undue influence by pharmaceutical companies over regulatory bodies. Kennedy believes vaccines can harm children and argues that public health authorities prioritize corporate interests over citizens\\' well-being. His views remain controversial, with health officials worldwide debunking his claims and pointing to the strong evidence of vaccine safety and effectiveness.Kennedy\\'s stance gained renewed visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic as he questioned the accelerated vaccine development and distribution. He has voiced concerns about the potential for adverse effects and believes that Americans should have greater choice over vaccinations, a position that resonates with certain social media influencers and wellness advocates.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-donald-trumps-pick-for-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/articleshow/115318603.cms', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115318899/115318899.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 01:23:31', 'author': 'Toi World Desk', 'authors': ['Toi World Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': 0.209}, {'id': 264918984, 'title': 'Vaccine maker stocks fall in US after Trump picks anti-vaccine activist RFK Jr as health secretary', 'text': 'Shares of vaccine makers plunged after President-elect Donald Trump nominated Robert F Kennedy Jr to run the Department of Health and Human Services, a post that would give the longtime vaccine sceptic influence over the nation’s health and medical research agencies.\\n\\nCovid vaccine maker Moderna Inc. dropped 5.6 per cent at the close of regular trading Thursday and lost an additional 1.4 per cent post-market.

He also played a key role in the New York City watershed agreement, now viewed as a global example of sustainable development.Mr Kennedy founded Children\\'s Health Defense to address their health issues and harmful exposures, serving as chairman and lead counsel. While claiming to support vaccine safety, he has also been found spreading false theories, such as vaccines causing autism and COVID-19 being targeted at specific ethnic groups. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Kennedy was already leading campaigns against vaccines and collaborating with anti-vaccine groups. His organisation has also filed lawsuits against news outlets, accusing them of bias against anti-vaccine views. Studies show his Twitter account was a major source of vaccine misinformation. Mr Kennedy has also met with anti-vaccine activists and supported anti-vaccine literature, despite evidence that vaccines are safe and necessary for public health.Some of Mr Kennedy\\'s legal wins include cases against Monsanto in 2018 and DuPont in 2019 for contamination, which inspired the movie Dark Waters. He has also advocated for Indigenous groups in North and South America.Mr Kennedy has authored several books, including bestsellers Crimes Against Nature (2005) and The Real Anthony Fauci (2021). He has also written children\\'s books on American history and Saint Francis of Assisi.Robert F Kennedy Jr is married to actress Cheryl Hines and has seven children from three marriages.', 'summary': 'President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr, an environmental advocate and vaccine sceptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).', 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/people/robert-f-kennedy-jr-anti-vaccine-activist-who-is-now-us-health-secretary-7023554', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/d2ml1er_robert-f-kennedy-jr-afp_625x300_15_November_24.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 04:26:56', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.117}, {'id': 264940666, 'title': \"What to know about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick for health secretary\", 'text': \"President-elect Donald Trump 's plan to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , to lead the Health and Human Services Department will put a prominent vaccine skeptic at the helm of the nation's sprawling public health apparatus. A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations including DuPont and Monsanto. But over the past two decades, he's increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists. Trump would have Kennedy lead a massive Cabinet agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid. He said before the election he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy. Here's a look at Kennedy and the agency he'll be tasked with leading: Kennedy defies scientific consensus on vaccines and other issues He took over the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and built it into a juggernaut during the pandemic. His activism helped him build a loyal following that he's leveraged in his political pursuits. Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated. While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year. He wants to eliminate liability protections for drug companies. Even before Trump was elected, Kennedy said he would recommend water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride strengthens teeth and is viewed as one of the biggest public health successes of the past century. He made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes AIDS and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings. Children’s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit. He wants to overhaul HHS staff Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He is especially focused on putting an end to the “revolving door” of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his campaign communications manager Del Bigtree told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer. He said he wants to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research, and replace them with 600 new employees. Many of the scientists and researchers who work at the NIH are not political appointees, which makes firing them abruptly more difficult. Nevertheless, Kennedy made the promise at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a video first obtained by ABC News. “We need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,” Kennedy said, according to a video of his remarks posted on YouTube. He says the public health establishment is too focused on infectious diseases and wants to redirect resources toward panoply of problems he characterizes as the chronic disease epidemic, including obesity, diabetes, autism and mental illnesses. He blames them on greedy corporations including drug companies that worry healthy Americans would be bad for their bottom line and food producers using harmful pesticides and additives. Kennedy is a scion of a famous dynasty Kennedy's father was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy. Both men were assassinated. Kennedy originally ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before deciding to launch an independent bid. He then suspended that bid earlier this year and endorsed...\", 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/what-to-know-about-robert-f-kennedy-jr-trumps-pick-for-health-secretary-1838424', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/15/1862898-untitleddesign-2024-11-15t123827038.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 07:13:32', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.087}]}, {'news': [{'id': 264977680, 'title': 'Champions Trophy 2025: ICC Asks PCB To Avoid Conducting Trophy Tour In Disputed PoK, Claims Report', 'text': 'HomeSportsChampions Trophy 2025: ICC Asks PCB To Avoid Conducting Trophy Tour In Disputed PoK, Claims Report\\n\\nChampions Trophy 2025: ICC Asks PCB To Avoid Conducting Trophy Tour In Disputed PoK, Claims Report\\n\\nThe Champions Trophy 2025 will tentatively take place in Pakistan in February.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.freepressjournal.in/sports/champions-trophy-2025-icc-asks-pcb-to-avoid-conducting-trophy-tour-in-disputed-pok-claims-report', 'image': 'https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-11-15/ryidxxjp/FotoJet-2024-11-15T155540.697.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 10:28:33', 'author': 'Aayushman Vishwanathan', 'authors': ['Aayushman Vishwanathan'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': -0.69}, {'id': 264985812, 'title': 'ICC asks PCB to cancel Champions Trophy tour in PoK cities', 'text': 'NEW DELHI: In a significant setback to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the International Cricket Council (ICC) has cancelled the Champions Trophy trophy tour in the cities of Skardu, Hunza, and Muzaffarabad, located in the region of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).It has been reliably learnt that the ICC\\'s decision came in the aftermath of BCCI\\'s objection to the PCB\\'s plan. 115265379The PCB announced on Thursday the schedule for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 trophy tour, which was initially set to commence on November 16 in Islamabad.\"Get ready, Pakistan!

Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation on vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States' top health agency. In a post on X, Kennedy vowed to work to end chronic disease, clean up corruption and provide Americans with the data they need to make informed decisions, vowing to Trump he would work to Make America Healthy Again. Kennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump in exchange for a role in the Republican's administration. Kennedy, the son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics, has frequently talked about tackling what he calls the chronic disease epidemic of conditions including obesity, diabetes and autism, and reducing chemicals in food. The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country, Trump said in a post on social media. The Department of Health and Human Services oversees drug regulation, public health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health insurance for more than 140 million people including the poor, those aged 65 and older, and the disabled through Medicare and Medicaid. HHS had a $3.09 trillion budget for fiscal year 2024, representing 22.8% of the U.S. federal budget. Drew Altman, president of health research firm KFF, described the move as historic and said what Kennedy, if confirmed, would ultimately do in the role remains to be seen, given he has not often discussed programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which account for much of the U.S. health budget. Historically, secretaries have been people with real experience and standing in national healthcare and he certainly is not that, and has views from outside the mainstream, and is a renegade appointment, Altman said. The appointment, which had been seen as a possibility for weeks, raised concern among some public health advocates who said Kennedy could have a negative role in Americans' health given his power over these agencies. The Democratic Party decried the decision. Some politicians and business groups supported the nomination, such as the National Community Pharmacists Association, which said it was encouraged by his willingness to take on corporations. HEALTH PRIORITIES Kennedy has been a part of Trump's transition team and has been reviewing candidate resumes for the top jobs at U.S. health agencies. Kennedy has suggested he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration - which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices - and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health. FDA's war on public health is about to end, he wrote on X in late October, adding that includes its aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, sunshine, and other items. If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags, he wrote. In early November, he said he would recommend fluoride be removed from public water supplies, falsely claiming on X that the chemical is associated with bone fractures and cancer. In a New York Times opinion article published in September, Kennedy criticized the popular Novo Nordisk weight loss drug Ozempic, saying, Instead of fixing our food system and addressing the obesity crisis at its root, the author focuses on a drug that may palliate the symptom - and gladden the wallets of distant Big Pharma execs. Dr. Ashish Jha, former White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator and dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said: Most people don't realize this is not about fluoride in water, or even vaccines, as important as they are. The HHS Secretary oversees Medicare. He and his appointees will decide what medicines are available to the American people. James Capretta, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former White House staffer under George W. Bush, said it is not clear what impact Kennedy will have but that it will not be immediate. There's lots of constraints on policy making on the agency level, even at the secretarial level, he said. VACCINESShares of vaccine makers including Pfizer Inc and Moderna fell after news of Kennedy's appointment and were down in after-hours trading by as much as 2%. Kennedy has been criticized for making false medical claims, including that vaccines are linked to autism. He opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus. He disputes the anti-vaccine tag, saying he wants more rigorous testing of vaccines instead. However, he chaired the Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit organization that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging. In an interview in March, when he was still running for president, Kennedy said Americans who want a vaccine for themselves or their children would continue to have access to them if he were to be elected. But he said he doubted the efficacy of measles vaccines. Measles is one of the most contagious human viruses and is almost entirely preventable through vaccination. It requires 95% vaccine coverage to prevent outbreaks among populations. U.S. coverage rates have fallen below that level among young children, the CDC said this month. Vaccines have saved over 154 million lives in the 20th century - the equivalent of six lives every minute of every year for the past 50 years, said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert from the University of Minnesota. Immunization has continued to be the single greatest contributor of any health intervention to ensuring that babies not only see their first birthdays, but they continue leading healthy lives into adulthood, he said.\", 'summary': \"Donald Trump appointed Robert F.

Saeid Iravani held in a secret location in New York and lasted over an hour was described by two Iranian officials as “positive” and focused on reducing tensions between the two countries, the publication noted.Trump who appointed Musk, the owner of Tesla and X as the co-director of a new government efficiency agency during a call last week with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, handed the phone to the tech billionaire, said New York Times. Musk has played a key role in providing communications capability to Ukraine in the war with Russia.During his first term, Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers, calling it “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” and imposed tough economic sanctions on Iranian oil revenues and international banking transactions. He also ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani, in Iraq in 2020.In response, Iran’s supreme leader banned any negotiations with the Trump administration and Iranian officials vowed to avenge. Suleimani’s killing. Federal prosecutors said in a court filing last week that Iran had plotted to assassinate Trump before the election. Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in a meeting with the visiting Director General of the IAEA Rafael Grossi in Tehran on Thursday said that Iran is well-prepared to collaborate with international bodies to address any questions regarding its peaceful nuclear program.A report by Iranian state media Irna reported that Pezeshkian underlined that the reports from the IAEA indicate that Iran has met all its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, but the US unilaterally withdrew from it.The NYT report stated citing an anonymous Iranian official, that in his meeting with Musk, ambassador Iravani told the tech billionaire he should obtain sanctions exemptions from the Treasury and bring some of his businesses to Tehran.Iran’s mission to the United Nations said it would not publicly comment on the meeting, the publication said.', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/elon-musk-meets-irans-un-ambassador-in-new-york-report/', 'image': 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 04:33:55', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.144}, {'id': 264926366, 'title': 'Amid US-Iran Tensions, Elon Musk Meets Iranian Ambassador at Secret Location: Reports', 'text': 'Washington: Amid the ongoing tensions between Iran and the United States, Elon Musk, a close ally of President-elect Donald J. Trump, is learnt to have met Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations on Monday in New York, according to media reports.Media reports citing two Iranian officials said the meeting, that could prove crucial, between Musk and Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani lasted for over an hour and was held at a secret location. Billionaire businessman Musk rose as the most powerful private citizen in the Trump transition. Last week, Musk joined Trump\\'s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky amid Russia\\'s aggression against Kyiv.The meeting between the Iranian Ambassador and Musk triggers a possibility of a change in tone between Tehran and Washington under the Trump 2.0 administration, despite a charged history between the president-elect and Iran.Reports further suggested that it was Musk who had urged for the meeting.During his stint as US President, Trump (78) pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers, describing it as “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,”. He also went on to impose tough economic sanctions on Iranian oil revenues and international banking transactions.US Claims Iran\\'s Involvement in Trump\\'s Assassination Bid, Tehran Rejects AccusationsThe Republican leader had also ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani, in Iraq in 2020.Responding to Trump\\'s move, Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei prohibited any negotiations with the Trump administration and Iranian officials vowed to avenge Suleimani’s killing. Recently, the US claimed Iran\\'s involvement in a plot to assassinate Donald Trump before the US elections. Consequently, the US department of Justice charged an Iranian man, tapped by Iran, to kill Trump.However, Iran denied the allegatIon calling it a \"third-rate comedy.\"Following Trump\\'s victory, Iran has been publicly debating whether it can now reach a new and more lasting deal with the United States. Many members of new President Masoud Pezeshkian’s government have advocated for negotiations, arguing that Trump likes to make deals and that there may be an opportunity to get the sanctions lifted.Refusing the allegations Iran Foreign Minister tweeted ,\" Remember the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran right after our President\\'s inauguration? Everyone knows who did it and why. Now, with another election, a new scenario is fabricated with the same goal: as a killer does not exist in reality, scriptwriters are brought in to manufacture a third-rate comedy. Who can in their right mind believe that a supposed assassin SITS IN IRAN and talks online to the FBI?!\"\"The American people have made their decision. And Iran respects their right to elect the President of their choice. The path forward is also a choice. It begins with respect. Iran is NOT after nuclear weapons, period.

Although the Excise Prohibition law was passed to enhance public health, the court stated that “for several reasons, it finds itself on the wrong side of the history” when latter quashed the directive imposed on the grounds that he had been negligent in enforcing the law.\\n\\nIt also highlighted that the state’s prohibition statute actually contributed to the unauthorized trade in alcohol and other illegal items and that officials from the police, excise, tax, and transportation departments “love” the liquor ban since it “means big money” to them. The court was considering a plea from an Inspector who had been demoted after the excise department carried out a raid near the petitioner’s jurisdictional police station and found Rs 4 lakh worth of “illicit foreign liquor” in a godown. He was accused of violating Rule-3(1) of the Government Official Conduct Rule by failing to uphold the Excise Prohibition Law. The ruling was issued by Justice Purnendu Singh.\\n\\nHe declared, “I find it proper to record here that the Article 47 of the Constitution of India while mandating the duty of the state to raise standards of living and to improve the public health at large and as such state government enacted Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 with the said objective, but for several reasons, it finds itself on the wrong side of the history. The prohibition has, in fact, given rise to unauthorized trade of liquor and other contraband items. The draconian provision have become handy for the police, who are in tandem with the, smugglers. Innovative ideas to hoodwink law enforcing agency have evolved to carry and deliver the contraband. Not only the police official, excise official, but also officers of the state tax department and the transport department love liquor ban, for them it means big money.”\\n\\nThe court mentioned that the “magnitude” of cases filed against the “poor who consume liquor and those poor people and are prey of hooch tragedy” is “much greater” than the “few” complaints filed against the kingpin/syndicate operators. It further underlined that “daily wagers who are only earning member of their family” make up the majority of the state’s impoverished population, who are subject to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act’s fury. \\n\\nIt stated that there are still gaps in the case since the investigating officer “deliberately” failed to provide any legal documentation to support the accusations made in the prosecution’s case. The judge pointed out that this permits the “Mafia scot free in want of evidence by not conducting search, seizure and investigation in accordance with law.” It further underlined, “The severe provisions of the prohibition law have become convenient tools for the police, who often act in collusion with smugglers. New tactics to evade law enforcement have developed, facilitating the transportation and distribution of contraband items in Bihar.”\\n\\nAfter reviewing the pleadings and the material on file, the court stated that the charge memo would demonstrate that it was framed in line with the directive of the Director General of Police, Bihar, who had instructed the Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna, in a letter dated 1st February 2021 to refer to the November 2020 letter. The letter indicated that the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) would be held accountable and that strict action would be necessary against him in the event that illicit liquor was recovered from the territorial jurisdiction of any police station.\\n\\nThe court conveyed, “Following the condition contained in Letter No. 63 dated 24.11.2020, the Director General of Police, had suspended the petitioner vide order contained in Letter No. 21/2021-142 dated 01.02.2021 resulting into passing of the Penalty Order by the Disciplinary Authority.” It added, “I further find that the Post Decisional hearing is one with close mind and it is a fact that it is detrimental in nature and it would be a formality in case it is done with a prejudiced mind with pre-supposed decision of awarding the punishment and hence post-decisional hearing would not be as effective,” while citing supreme court and high court decisions on the matter.\\n\\nIt further emphasized that a “pre-decisional hearing and not post-decisional hearing” is necessary for the fundamental idea of natural justice. According to the court, the supreme court has correctly ruled that the law granting post-decisional hearings is an “empty formality calling for violation of the principle of natural justice” if the authorities have already decided to take action prior to the start of departmental proceedings.\\n\\nThe Director General of Police, based on the court in this case, had a “pre-determined mind” when he insisted that the petitioner needed to face severe disciplinary action in line with the November 2020 letter. As a result, the court observed, the disciplinary authority “with preconceived mind took the decision to impose penalty in compliance of the letter of the Director General of Police” and issued a penalty order against the petitioner. The court concluded that the evidence showed that the witnesses’ statements had not been recorded appropriately either.\\n\\nThe court then overruled the suspension and penalty imposed on the petitioner, saying, “Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and the law laid down by the apex court referred in above paragraphs, I find that even though the petitioner was proceeded as per the provision of C.C.A. Rules, 2005 and opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner, in view of the conditions/directions contained in Letter No. 63 (01 implementation) 2019-20-1296/Excise Prohibition dated 24.11.2020 of the Director General of Police, in my opinion, the authorities had pre-determined to impose penalty on the petitioner and proceeded to hold quasi judicial inquiry giving the post-decisional opportunity of hearing which does not sub serve the rule of natural justice and is contrary to the principle of fair play.”\\n\\nThe court stressed that there is very little likelihood of receiving a “proper consideration” of the representation at such a post-decisional opportunity since the authority that initiates a post-decisional hearing “will naturally proceed with a closed mind.” When the court dismissed the petition, it maintained that the “petitioner is required to be put under suspension to proceed afresh in the light of the law laid down by the apex court” if the disciplinary authority identified that the petitioner should face disciplinary action based on the “recorded evidence.”\\n\\nBackground of the matter\\n\\nMukesh Kumar Paswan who held the position of Inspector of Police at a Patna police station filed a writ petition and the order was granted. The Excise Department carried out a raid in the region that was under the petitioner’s police station’s jurisdiction. The petitioner witnessed the raid that resulted in the “recovery of illicit foreign liquor” of Rs. 4 lakh. The petitioner created a seizure list and filed a formal complaint against the defendants. Since the godown where the raid took place is barely 500 meters from the police station, it is stated that the petitioner’s involvement in the sale of illegal alcohol along with one chowkidaar cannot be denied, in contravention of the instructions in a letter dated November 2020.\\n\\nOn 1st February 2021, the Director General of Police, Bihar, subsequently suspended him. The petitioner received a memo of charge dated February 6, 2021. On February 9, 2021, the petitioner was given a show-cause notice by the Inspector General of Police, Central Range, Patna, asking him to explain why he should not be convicted of violating Rule-3(1) of the Government Official Conduct Rule, 1976 by failing to enforce the Excise Prohibition Law. In March 2021, the petitioner presented a thorough show-cause reply refuting every claim. Following an investigation, the inquiry officer did, however, propose the “major penalty” of dismissing the petitioner.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba extended his condolences on Princess Yuriko\\'s death. \"I cannot help but feel saddened to hear of the loss.

Princess Yuriko, a member of Japan\\'s former nobility, was hospitalised in March after suffering a mild stroke and aspiration pneumonitis. While receiving treatment, medical tests earlier this month revealed a decline in her cardiac and kidney functions. Born in 1923, Princess Yuriko married Prince Mikasa, the youngest brother of Emperor Hirohito (posthumously Emperor Showa), in 1941 at the age of 18, following her graduation from the Gakushuin Women\\'s Academy. Her husband passed away in 2016 at the age of 100 due to heart failure. The couple had five children, three sons and two daughters. Tragically, their sons, Princes Tomohito, Katsura, and Takamado, predeceased her, passing away in 2012, 2014, and 2002, respectively. Princess Yuriko was quite active in public service and served as honorary vice president of the Japanese Red Cross Society. She was also the president of Imperial Gift Foundation Boshi-Aiiku-Kai, an organisation promoting maternal and child health, from 1948 until 2010. Of her grandchildren, three granddaughters remain in the imperial family. However, two others, Princesses Noriko and Ayako, daughters of Prince Takamado, relinquished their imperial titles upon marrying commoners in 2014 and 2018.

Rahul Baba, please praise your friend Uddhav Thackeray’s father, the great Balasaheb Thackeray, for two minutes. Uddhav ji, if you have the courage, get Rahul Baba to speak two good words about Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb,” Shah said while addressing a rally in Hingoli.The Union Home Minister said the assembly polls in Maharashtra would determine whether the state follows the legacy of Shivaji Maharaj or the path of Aurangzeb for the next five years.“The upcoming election will decide whether Maharashtra follows the path of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Veer Savarkar or the path of Aurangzeb. Our Mahayuti alliance has chosen the legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Veer Savarkar without any hesitation, while the Aghadi alliance seems to be an Aurangzeb fan club. Modi ji built the Ram temple and also reconstructed the Kashi Vishwanath corridor, which had been demolished by Aurangzeb,” Shah said.Amit Shah also mocked Rahul Gandhi, likening him to a plane that has repeatedly crashed.“Sonia ji has tried to land the plane named Rahul Baba 20 times, and 20 times it has crashed. Now, another attempt is being made to land it for the 21st time in Maharashtra. Sonia ji, please note that your Rahul aircraft will crash once again in the Maharashtra assembly elections,” he quipped.Referring to the recently concluded Haryana elections, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a third consecutive term, Shah criticised the Congress for its overconfidence in winning Maharashtra.“In the Haryana elections, Rahul Gandhi claimed victory prematurely. Such arrogance, especially in a democracy, is unacceptable. Ultimately, Congress was wiped out, and the BJP formed the government. In Maharashtra too, the Mahayuti will form the government,” Shah asserted.Touching upon the Ram temple issue and the Waqf Board controversy, Shah said, “For 70 years, Congress obstructed the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, but Modi ji made it a reality. In Karnataka, the Waqf Board declared villages, temples, farmers’ lands, and people’s houses as Waqf properties. We have introduced a bill to amend the Waqf Act, but Sharad Pawar and his allies are opposing it.”“You can oppose it as much as you want, but the Modi government will amend the Waqf Act with full force,” he added.Shah also dismissed Congress’s resolution to reinstate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, asserting it would never happen.“Rahul Baba’s Congress party has passed a resolution in Kashmir to bring back Article 370. Rahul Baba, listen carefully–neither you nor your fourth generation will be able to bring back Article 370,” Shah said.Exuding confidence in the NDA’s prospects, Shah said the people of Maharashtra support the alliance.“I have come to tell the people of Maharashtra that the entire country stands with Modiji.

Shah, speaking at Hingoli on Friday, presented a direct challenge to the opposition, questioning their stance on Hindutva icons and national security issues. His comments ranged from veiled attacks on the Congress party’s leadership to sharp criticism of its handling of national security and religious issues.\\n\\nAt the rally, Amit Shah made headlines with a bold challenge to Rahul Gandhi, urging him to praise two of Maharashtra’s most revered political figures — Veer Savarkar and Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. Shah, speaking to the gathering, said, “Uddhav ji, if you have the courage, get Rahul Baba to speak two good words about Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb.” This remark references the ongoing ideological divide within Maharashtra’s political landscape, with BJP strongly aligning with Hindutva leaders like Savarkar and Thackeray, while the opposition remains more secular in its stance.\\n\\nThe challenge highlights the BJP’s strategy of reinforcing its nationalist and Hindutva credentials, positioning itself as the protector of the legacy of these leaders, while accusing the opposition, particularly the Congress, of downplaying their contributions to India’s freedom struggle and cultural identity.\\n\\nAmit Shah’s comments also targeted Rahul Gandhi’s stance on Kashmir and Article 370. Referring to a Congress resolution in Kashmir advocating for the restoration of Article 370 — which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir — Shah emphatically dismissed the possibility of its revival. “Rahul Baba, listen carefully, not only you but even your fourth generation cannot bring back Article 370,” Shah declared, reminding the crowd of the BJP’s historic move to revoke Article 370 in 2019, a move that has remained central to the party’s political identity.\\n\\nMUST READ: PM Modi’s Aircraft Encounters Technical Issue in Jharkhand’s Deoghar\\n\\nShah’s words came as a sharp rebuke to Congress’s Kashmir policies, accusing the party of being out of touch with national sentiment while lauding the Modi government for its decisive actions on national security and territorial integrity.\\n\\nContinuing his tirade, Shah mocked Sonia Gandhi’s persistent efforts to establish her son Rahul Gandhi as the face of Indian politics. He remarked, “Sonia Gandhi tried to launch her son 20 times. Her ‘Rahul plane’ is going to crash for the 21st time in Maharashtra elections.” This statement is a reflection of Shah’s broader criticism of Rahul Gandhi’s leadership capabilities, a sentiment that is widely shared by the BJP and other right-wing factions.\\n\\nShah’s remarks about the “Rahul plane” were particularly aimed at undermining the credibility of Congress in Maharashtra, where the party is part of the opposition alliance, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), alongside Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).\\n\\nIn a highly charged political statement, Amit Shah compared the future of Maharashtra to a historical battle between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Shah asserted that the upcoming elections would decide whether Maharashtra continues on the path laid by the great Maratha warrior Shivaji or veers toward the legacy of Aurangzeb.\\n\\n“The BJP-led Mahayuti has chosen the path of Shivaji Maharaj and Veer Savarkar, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi people are the Aurangzeb fan club,” Shah remarked. This statement aimed at painting the opposition as unpatriotic and ideologically aligned with figures from India’s medieval history who were opposed to Hindu nationalism. Shah’s use of this historical analogy underscored the BJP’s political narrative of promoting Hindu pride and nationalism, which it believes resonates deeply with Maharashtra’s voters.\\n\\nShah also highlighted the BJP government’s success in facilitating the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya after years of legal and political battles. He reminded the audience, “For 70 years, Congress obstructed the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, but Modi ji built it.” This reference is designed to contrast the BJP’s commitment to fulfilling religious promises with the opposition’s alleged apathy toward Hindu concerns.\\n\\nFurther attacking the Congress and its allies, Shah addressed the controversial Waqf Board issue in Karnataka, where land and properties have allegedly been marked as Waqf (endowment) properties, including temples and farmers’ lands. “We have brought a bill to amend the Waqf Act, but Sharad Pawar and Company are opposing this bill,” Shah declared. His comments were aimed at painting the opposition alliance as out of touch with the needs of ordinary Hindus while reaffirming the BJP’s commitment to addressing grievances related to religious and cultural issues.\\n\\nAmit Shah’s remarks underscore the high stakes for the BJP in Maharashtra’s upcoming elections. With the state being a crucial battleground, the BJP is pulling out all stops to consolidate its base among Hindu voters by championing Hindutva, promoting the legacy of figures like Savarkar and Shivaji, and accusing the Congress and MVA of being weak on national security issues.\\n\\nShah’s comments about the future of Maharashtra likening it to a historical confrontation — aim to position the BJP as the true guardian of the state’s cultural and political legacy. Whether this strategy will resonate with voters in Maharashtra remains to be seen, but it is clear that the battle for Maharashtra will be as much about ideology as it will be about electoral arithmetic.\\n\\nALSO READ: Narayana Murthy Was Disappointed With Five Day Work Culture: I Don’t Believe In Work-Life Balance', 'summary': 'Amit Shah challenges Rahul Gandhi, Congress, and Maha Vikas Aghadi in a Maharashtra rally, focusing on Hindutva, Article 370, and the Ram temple issue.\\n\\n\\nThe post Union Home Minister Amit Shah Dares Rahul Gandhi To laud Savarkar, Bal Thackeray appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/union-home-minister-amit-shah-dares-rahul-gandhi-to-laud-savarkar-bal-thackeray/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AMIT-SHAH-2.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 10:58:53', 'author': 'Swati Pandey', 'authors': ['Swati Pandey'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.348}, {'id': 265002116, 'title': 'Maharashtra Polls: Amit Shah Dares Rahul Gandhi to Laud Savarkar, Bal Thackeray', 'text': 'Union minister Amit Shah on Friday dared Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to speak “nicely” about Veer Savarkar and Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray.\\n“Uddhav ji, if you have the courage, get Rahul Baba to speak two good words about Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb,” Shah said, addressing a rally at Hingoli in Maharashtra ahead of the November 20 assembly elections.\\n“Rahul Baba’s Congress party has passed a resolution in Kashmir to bring back Article 370.

This initiative comes shortly after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump appointed the duo to co-lead this ambitious government reform project.\\n\\nA Bold Vision: Reshaping Federal Governance\\n\\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, described by Trump as the “Manhattan Project of our time,” aims to overhaul the $6.5 trillion federal government. In a statement, Trump highlighted the department’s mission to identify inefficiencies and cut costs, promising a significant shake-up in how federal operations are managed.\\n\\nMusk and Ramaswamy, known for their disruptive approaches in their respective fields, have outlined their intent to recruit individuals capable of driving this transformation. The recruitment announcement was made through DOGE’s newly created account on X, a platform owned by Musk.\\n\\nExclusive Application Process on X\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about aspects of the recruitment process is the requirement for candidates to have an X subscription. The premium subscription, which costs $84 annually, allows users to have a verified account necessary for direct messaging DOGE with their resumes.\\n\\nIn its announcement, DOGE emphasized the need for dedicated professionals, “We are very grateful to the thousands of Americans who have expressed interest in helping us at DOGE. We don’t need more part-time idea generators,” the department stated.\\n\\n“If that’s you, DM this account with your CV. Elon & Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants.”\\n\\nWhat DOGE is Looking For\\n\\nThe department is not seeking just any applicant. According to the recruitment message, candidates should possess a “super high-IQ” and a passion for small-government reform. DOGE clarified its preference for individuals willing to work “80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting” tasks.\\n\\nThe department’s compensation policy adds another layer of challenge. Musk himself posted on X, “It will be tedious work, make lots of enemies, & compensation is zero. What a great deal.”\\n\\nUnclear Job Details and Structure\\n\\nWhile the mission of DOGE has been clearly defined, several details remain ambiguous. It is unclear whether specific skills or prior experience are required for the positions. Additionally, the department has not disclosed its funding sources or the long-term scope of its initiatives.\\n\\nPublic Reaction and Controversy\\n\\nThe unconventional hiring process has sparked mixed reactions. Critics have questioned the decision to require a paid subscription for job applications, viewing it as a potential barrier to entry. Supporters, however, see this as a bold move to attract only the most committed applicants who share the department’s vision.\\n\\nDOGE’s recruitment drive aligns with Musk and Ramaswamy’s track records of advocating for efficiency, innovation, and accountability. As the department gears up to tackle what they call “unglamorous cost-cutting,” all eyes will be on how this ambitious project unfolds.', 'summary': 'Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X, and Indian-American biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have launched the recruitment process.\\n\\n\\nThe post Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy Begin Recruitment for Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/world/elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-begin-recruitment-for-department-of-government-efficiency-doge/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Elon-Musk-6.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 10:38:21', 'author': 'Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.267}, {'id': 265038554, 'title': 'Welcome to the US Dept of Government Efficiency', 'text': 'The Ministry of Magic can be found in the fictional universe of Harry Potter. Nonetheless, a nation may occasionally build intriguing ministries. For example, Japan created a Minister of Loneliness in 2021 to alleviate social isolation, while Venezuela introduced a new Ministry of Supreme Social Happiness in 2013.\\n\\nMaybe it’s America’s turn now. For the Trump 2.0 administration, a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been created with the goal of cutting federal bureaucracy by around one-third. A “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms” is what Trump stated the agency will be doing.\\r\\n\\nA department to cut red tape may seem fantastic, but it’s really more about cutting government budget, one perceives. In actuality, Trump has chosen Elon Musk, the richest man in the world who has thrown his weight behind Trump in his reelection, and Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy American biotech entrepreneur who competed in the 2024 Republican primary but abandoned his campaign in January 2024 and endorsed Trump, to head the department. Trump had to give these two some sort of award, of course.\\r\\n\\nCrony capitalism\\n\\nHowever, how would that benefit America? Although neither John Rockefeller nor Bill Gates accepted such a direct government assignment, some are questioning if this is the beginning of a new kind of crony capitalism.\\r\\n\\nIt’s, however, remarkable how many billionaires themselves run for and occupy official political positions, even though they also indirectly influence politics “behind the scenes” through media manipulation, campaign contributions, and social connections with politicians. According to a 2023 study by Northwestern University academics, the rate of political entry for American billionaires is 3.7 per cent, whereas it’s 11 per cent for billionaires worldwide.\\r\\n\\nIn fact, Trump stated during a campaign event in August 2024 that he would be open to offering Musk an advisory position if elected. Musk responded by posting on X, “I am willing to serve,” with an AI-generated picture of him facing a lectern that read “Department of Government Efficiency.” Now, Trump has created exactly that – what he has called “the perfect gift to America.”\\r\\n\\nAccording to Musk, a commission of this kind could cut the US federal budget by $2 trillion, or around 30 per cent. And the concept has received backing from the likes of Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase.\\r\\n\\nMusk’s Twitter experience\\n\\nTo be fair, Musk has demonstrated this level of efficiency when he laid off 6,000 employees at Twitter following his 2022 acquisition of the company, a move that some estimates reduced Twitter’s value by 80 per cent.\\r\\n\\nFollowing his takeover of Twitter, Musk sent a series of sobering warnings to his employees: Workers need to prepare for 80-hour work weeks; free meals and office perks will be reduced. Additionally, he eliminated the flexibility of working from home. But even in a capitalist economy, is such a strategy appropriate for the public sector? The department’s name is a backronym that alludes to the online meme Doge as well as Dogecoin, a crypto asset that bears the meme’s name and is publicly supported by Musk. And is there any conflict of interest?\\r\\n\\nThe New York Times, for instance, questioned whether Musk’s anticipated employment at DOGE would be in conflict with his companies’ status as federal government contractors. And Vox said that the organisation is “unlikely to have any regulatory teeth on its own, but there’s little doubt that it can have influence on the incoming administration and how it will determine its budgets.” But Musk wrote in X: “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!”\\r\\n\\nDonald Trump asserted that this effort would upend long-standing government structures by introducing an “entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before.” Ramaswamy may have been referring to the last lines of the 1996 action film Independence Day when he tweeted, “We will not go gently,” in response to Trump’s statement.\\r\\n\\nWe’ll see if such a ministry eventually becomes the ministry of magic and a new norm in other countries too.\\r\\n\\nThe writer is Professor of Statistics, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata', 'summary': 'The Ministry’s lofty objective is to cut down red tape and save government money.

Burgum, 68, has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. He ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a loyal Trump supporter, appearing at fundraisers and advocating for Trump on television. At the gala, which featured tech billionaire Elon Musk, actor Sylvester Stallone and members of his incoming administration, Trump praised his latest cabinet picks and made some of his longest remarks since his presidential election victory speech. Nobody knew we were going to win it the way we won it, Trump said. He teased Musk about his ongoing post-election stay at Mar-a-Lago. Musk is involved in some of Trump's meetings at the oceanfront property. I can't get him out of here. He just loves this place. And I like having him here, said Trump. At the end of the event, Musk mounted the stage. The public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear. The people have spoken, the people want change, he said. Since his victory, Trump has chosen several loyalists with little experience for key cabinet positions, stunning some allies and making clear that he is serious about reshaping - and in some cases testing - America's institutions. MORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION The Interior Secretary will oversee policies guiding the use of 500 million acres (202.3 million hectares) of federal and tribal land, a fifth of the nation's surface area. Biden made the agency central to his climate change agenda by boosting the permitting of offshore wind and solar energy projects and creating a program to lease lands for conservation in the same way they are for development. Burgum is expected to be tasked with increasing oil, gas and mineral production on federal lands and waters. That job would likely involve ratcheting up new leasing in the Gulf of Mexico and on federal lands in oil-producing states like Wyoming and New Mexico. Biden had pledged to stop new federal leasing for oil extraction but was prevented by the courts from doing so. Interior leadership under Trump could scrap Biden's five-year offshore drilling plan, which had a historically low number of auctions scheduled, and step up acreage offered at Congressionally-mandated onshore sales. Drilling activity on federal lands and waters accounts for about a quarter of U.S. oil production and 12% of gas production. The number of drilling permits approved on federal lands fell 16% between fiscal 2020, the last year of Trump's first administration, and fiscal 2023, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Acreage in new onshore leases slid 95%.\", 'summary': \"At a Mar-a-Lago gala, President-elect Donald Trump announced North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as his pick for Interior Secretary.

Actually, he’s going to head the Department of Interior, and it’s going to be fantastic.”Burgum, who challenged Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, will inherit the Department from Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve in a Cabinet position. The Department oversees the nation’s public lands, natural resources, and Indian affairs.Burgum’s appointment is a significant step as the former Microsoft executive transitions from being a two-term governor to a key player in the incoming administration. While he had previously expressed reluctance to join Trump’s Cabinet, telling CNN last August that he would not consider serving as a vice presidential candidate or a member of Trump’s future Cabinet, Burgum now finds himself in a pivotal role, reported CNN.“Happy to do lots of other things. I had a fabulous 30 years in the private sector. A lot of opportunities there,” Burgum had said when he ruled out serving in Trump’s Cabinet. However, following the suspension of his presidential campaign in December, discussions shifted, and Burgum emerged as a potential candidate for several roles, including that of an “energy czar.” This position, which would have allowed Burgum to work on advancing Trump’s energy agenda while avoiding lengthy Senate confirmation hearings, was a departure from his initial reluctance to serve under the president-elect.As Secretary of the Interior, Burgum will be expected to oversee the stewardship of federal lands and resources, a role that requires navigating the complex balance between conservation, industry, and indigenous affairs. The Department of the Interior’s reach includes managing public lands, as well as critical issues like water rights and national parks, CNN reported.Burgum is the latest in a series of controversial picks by Trump, who has named over 20 individuals for high-level positions in his administration. Among these appointments are Fox News host Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defence, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Florida Republican Rep.

The haka soon spread to the opposition benches, prompting the chamber to be cleared and Maipi-Clarke to be suspended.What's the Māori march?A nine-day hikoi (march), making its way to New Zealand's capital, is expected to arrive by Tuesday. Around 10,000 protesters marched through Rotorua, about 450 km north of the capital, with some wearing traditional attire. They were met by crowds waving the Māori flag and chanting in support.Thousands of people participated in the hikoi moving towards Wellington on Friday to protest against a controversial bill that seeks to reinterpret the country's 184-year-old founding document. The bill, which passed its first reading in parliament, has sparked widespread opposition, with rallies against the Treaty Principles Bill taking place across the country.Despite the controversy, the bill passed its first reading and will now proceed to a public submission process before the next vote. Its author, David Seymour, leader of the ACT party, argues that the proposal seeks to provide clarity on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.What all of these principles have in common is that they afford Māori different rights from other New Zealanders,” Seymour said.Meanwhile, though Prime Minister Christopher Luxon opposed to the bill, he allowed his party to vote in favour of it as part of a political agreement with Seymour's ACT party - a move that sparked outrage among opposition members.“Shame!

Their culture reflects a deep connection to the land and ancestral spirits.\\nThe Māori language, known as Te Reo Maori, is an important part of their identity and is still spoken by many Maori people today.\\nThe Māori have a deep spiritual connection with nature and the land. They call themselves ‘kaitiaki’ (guardians) of the natural resources. They believe in the concept of ‘whakapapa’, which means everything in the world is interconnected and has a genealogical link. Ancestors play a significant role in Māori culture, and their stories and traditions are passed down through generations.\\nMāori make up roughly 20% of New Zealand’s 5.3 million people.

The haka is performed with powerful synchronised movements, vocal chants, and intense facial expressions, and it is used to express emotions, convey messages, and welcome visitors, according to tribes.world.\\nThe dance is a symbol of unity, strength, and resilience for the Maori tribe.\\nDespite facing challenges throughout history including colonization and cultural assimilation, the Maori are an integral part of New Zealand’s society.\\nWhat Is Treaty Of Waitangi That Maori Are Fighting For?\\nThe treaty was signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Māori chiefs, and is considered the founding document of New Zealand. It set out the terms of governance between the two parties. Its clauses continue to influence New Zealand’s laws and policies today.\\nThe bill, introduced last week by a political party known as ‘Act’, a junior partner in the centre-right coalition government, said it wanted equal rights for all, thus, undermining the Treaty’s principles.

Former New York congressman Lee Zeldin has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency; former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe has been chosen as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director; and New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a staunch ally of Trump, is set to be nominated as the US Ambassador to the United Nations.

Bihar’s top leaders and officials, including Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, Vijay Kumar Sinha, Giriraj Singh, Jitan Ram Manjhi and other Union Ministers, MPs, and MLAs, joined the Prime Minister on stage for this significant event.\\n\\nIn his speech, PM Modi honoured Birsa Munda, also known as Dharti Aaba (Father of the Earth), and extended warm wishes to the tribal communities of India. He recalled his visit to Ulihatu, Munda’s birthplace, during last year’s National Tribal Pride Day, highlighting the deep respect and recognition for the contributions of tribal heroes in India’s history. \\nPM Modi also paid tribute to Tilka Manjhi, another revered tribal leader from the region, acknowledging Jamui’s historic legacy in India’s freedom struggle and the valour of its indigenous people. \\nDuring the inauguration ceremony in Jamui, PM Modi emphasised the nationwide celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda, which will continue for a year, highlighting the importance of tribal history and contributions to India’s cultural and historical heritage. Approximately one crore people from hundreds of districts across India joined the event virtually. \\nThe PM elaborated on the significance of the ₹6,640 crore worth of projects inaugurated and their focus on improving the lives of tribal communities. “We have provided acceptance letters for 1.5 lakh concrete houses for tribal families under various housing schemes, schools and hostels to ensure quality education and a bright future for tribal children, healthcare facilities tailored for tribal women’s needs, road infrastructure spanning hundreds of kilometers to enhance connectivity in tribal regions,” PM Modi said. \\nIn his speech, PM Modi celebrated the cultural and historical contributions of the tribal community, stating, “Tribal society is the one that made Prince Ram into Lord Ram,” thereby acknowledging the key role of tribal communities in Indian traditions and struggles. He pointed out that tribal leaders like Bhagwan Birsa Munda and movements like the Ulgulan, Santhal, and Kol revolutions played pivotal roles in India’s fight for freedom and the protection of its culture. The Prime Minister also criticised post-Independence politics, which he alleged often sidelined the contributions of tribal communities. \\n“Why were movements led by tribal leaders such as Birsa Munda and others necessary if a single party or family had been solely responsible for India’s Independence? \\n“In the decades after Independence, attempts were made to erase the invaluable contribution of tribal history. There was selfish politics behind this too. The policy was that only one party should be given credit for India’s Independence. But if only one party, only one family has brought Independence, then why did Lord Birsa Munda’s Ulgulan movement take place, what was the Santhal revolution, what was the Kol revolution?” PM Modi said. \\nHe highlighted the transformative initiatives undertaken by the NDA government to uplift and empower tribal communities, marking a significant departure from the approach of previous administrations. He underlined the government’s commitment to social justice, cultural preservation, and addressing long-standing challenges faced by India’s tribal population. He emphasised the pride of having Droupadi Murmu, a tribal, as the President, calling it a momentous achievement for the NDA government. He credited her leadership with advancing initiatives under schemes like the PM Janman Yojana. \\n“With a budget of ₹24,000 crore, the PM Janman Yojana aims to improve living conditions in extremely backward tribal settlements. Over the past year, the scheme has provided thousands of concrete houses to the most disadvantaged tribes and built hundreds of kilometers of roads to improve connectivity in remote tribal regions,” he said. \\nThe government established a museum dedicated to Bhagwan Birsa Munda in Ranchi, a monumental step in commemorating tribal history. “Such initiatives have been launched to preserve tribal contributions to India’s ancient medical systems, enriching future generations and a national campaign to combat sickle cell anemia, a disease prevalent in tribal populations, was launched a year ago. So far, 4.5 crore people have been screened under the program,” he said. \\nPM Modi contrasted the NDA government’s efforts with those of previous administrations, asserting that past governments neglected the needs of tribal communities. He affirmed that the NDA government’s focus on inclusive development — through infrastructure, healthcare, and cultural preservation — has significantly improved the lives of tribal citizens. \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSource link', 'summary': 'Home News National Tribal Pride Day: PM Modi inaugurates projects worth Rs 6,000 crore in Bihar’s Jamui In his speech, PM Modi honoured Birsa Munda, also known as Dharti Aaba (Father of the Earth), and extended warm wishes to the tribal communities of India.

While government-owned liquor outlets will remain open, all privately owned liquor stores are set to shut down. The Federation’s grievances center on alleged corruption and harassment by the state’s excise officials, claiming these issues have reached new heights, particularly around the bribery of excise officials for transfers and promotions.The Association accuses excise officials of accepting bribes in “lakhs and crores” and manipulating the Karnataka Excise Act to benefit their own interests. The Federation also claims that the enforcement arm of the excise department has failed in its mandate, focusing instead on intimidating merchants.The Federation’s demands revolve around an amendment to Section 29 of the Karnataka Excise Act. This section grants officials the authority to cancel or suspend excise licenses or permits, which the Association argues is often exploited to target merchants, forcing them into compliance through intimidation or bribery. They argue that these practices are not only unethical but have also reduced excise revenue in the state, as businesses are discouraged and the funds are diverted into corrupt practices rather than official revenue channels.Additionally, the Association has called for the excise department to be merged with the finance ministry to curb corruption. According to the Federation, this integration could streamline the oversight of the department and allow better financial and ethical regulation of the excise sector. They assert that the finance ministry would have a greater capacity to monitor and curtail malpractices within the department, thus reducing bribery and increasing transparency.The Federation has also voiced frustration over what they see as a lack of access to high-ranking government officials, including Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who they believe has not adequately addressed these pressing concerns. Thousands of merchants joined the Federation’s protest on October 25, demonstrating widespread dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in the excise sector. The opposition BJP has seized upon the Federation’s claims to criticise the ruling Congress party, particularly over alleged links between excise corruption and certain Congress officials. In a recent incident, the BJP claimed to have uncovered whiskey worth over Rs 50 lakh at the residence of Avinash Malli Shetty, a Congress leader in Udupi and director of the Bola Cooperative Society.The BJP has branded this as part of an ongoing “wine scam,” alleging that the Congress-led administration is ignoring corruption in the excise department as it benefits influential individuals within the party. The BJP also suggested that the funds involved in such schemes are being misused to fuel the party’s electoral campaigns; the government has, however, denied these accusations. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a Maharashtra campaign, said that excise revenue from Karnataka is being redirected for electoral use outside the state. He implied that funds may be used to support bypoll campaigns in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, heightening BJP’s claims that Karnataka’s Congress leaders are misappropriating funds for political gain.Following this, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had said that he would quit politics if Prime Minister Narendra Modi proved his allegation that the Congress collected Rs 700 crore from liquor shop owners in the state to fund the party’s poll campaign in Maharashtra.Siddaramaiah dismissed the accusations as politically motivated and also called on the Prime Minister to step down from politics if the claims were proved false. The Chief Minister said PM Modi's comments were an attempt to distract voters from real issues and the failures of the BJP. He accused the ruling party of resorting to personal attacks in an attempt to regain influence in Karnataka.

The mention of such matters in elections in Maharashtra and by-elections is disheartening, as our organisation is politically neutral,” it said.\\n\\nThe association’s President S.

The issue had reached a point where it has become intolerable for licence holders, leading to its public exposure, it said.\\n\\n“In 2018, when we raised concerns about bribes in a meeting with the previous excise minister, there was no resolution. Protests were quelled after a superficial meeting. The reduction of our profit margin from 20 per cent to 10 per cent during the tenure of then-Minister Katta Subramanya Naidu remains unexplained. Our industry is struggling with various issues, and we have appealed to the government. If we were involved in election funding, would we still be protesting? The proposed bandh is directly related to our demands,” said representatives of the Wine Merchants’ Association. \\n\\nThe association has requested a meeting with the Chief Minister to address their demands and issues and has urged the government to take action against corruption within the excise department.

Our craft and artistry caught up in the loudness war… who is to blame?! The sound guy?! Or the innumerable fixes come at the last moment to satiate all insecurities,” he wrote.\\n“High time our fraternity to put your foot down and say things loud and clear. No film will have a repeat value if the audience walks out with a headache!” he added.\\nTake a look at the post here:\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\nA post shared by Resul Pookutty (@resulpookutty)\\n\\nPookutty is known for being open and candid on social media. In 2022, he criticised Alia Bhatt’s role in RRR. He called her character more of a prop in the story overshadowed by the performances of Ram Charan and Jr NTR.\\nDirected by Siva, Kanguva stars Suriya in the lead role, marking his return to the big screen after nearly two years. The film also features Bollywood stars Bobby Deol and Disha Patani, along with popular Tamil actors like Natarajan Subramaniam, Jagapathi Babu, Yogi Babu, Redin Kingsley, Kovai Sarala, and Ananda. Kanguva has been released in five languages: Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, and Malayalam.\\nDespite facing tough competition from Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 starring Karthik Aaryan and Singham Again with Ajay Devgn, Kanguva had a solid start on its opening day.

In addition, a ban on non-essential diesel vehicle traffic has been enforced, while construction and demolition activities have been halted to lower dust levels in the air, which have been identified as a significant contributor to pollution levels.\\n\\nDelhi’s pollution crisis has escalated due to a mix of local and regional factors, including industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, construction dust, and seasonal agricultural burning from neighboring states. Weather patterns, particularly stagnant air over the region, have exacerbated the effects, trapping pollutants close to the ground.

As a result, hospitals in the capital are witnessing a significant increase in patients suffering from respiratory ailments, prompting the Health Ministry to prepare emergency response plans to address the potential surge in respiratory and cardiac cases.\\n\\nIn a bid to tackle the crisis, the Delhi government has deployed thousands of anti-smog guns and mist sprinklers to reduce dust levels. The administration has also intensified road sprinkling operations and ordered factories producing high emissions to curtail their activities. Despite these efforts, pollution levels remain high, forcing officials to consider extending restrictions if air quality fails to improve. Authorities are also mulling long-term measures, including expanded air-purifying infrastructure and stricter enforcement of emission standards for vehicles and industries in the national capital region.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in an effort to hold neighboring states accountable, Delhi’s Environment Ministry has urged Punjab and Haryana to adopt sustainable alternatives to crop stubble burning, a significant contributor to air pollution in northern India. Both states have rolled out some measures to limit stubble burning, but challenges persist due to the cost and accessibility of alternatives, such as bio-decomposers.

Our government has increased it 5 times to Rs 1.25 lakh crores. Just a few days ago, we have started a special scheme for the development of more than 60,000 tribal villages in the country- Dharti Aaba, Janjatiya Gram, Utkarsh Abhiyan,” said PM Modi.“Under this, about Rs 80,000 crore will be invested in tribal villages. Its purpose is to provide necessary facilities to the tribal society as well as to create training and employment opportunities for the youth,” said the PM.“Last year on this day I was in Ulihatu, the village of Dharti Aba Birsa Munda.Today I have come to that land which has seen the bravery of martyr Tilka Manjhi. But this time the event is even more special since the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Birsa Munda begins across the country today onwards. These programs will continue for the next one year. Today, around 1 crore people from hundreds of districts of the country are connected with our program through technology,” PM Modi added.Highlighting the initiatives for tribal development, PM Modi said, “Today the foundation stone and inauguration of projects worth more than Rs 6 thousand crores have been done. These include approval letters for about 1.5 lakh pucca houses for my tribal brothers and sisters. There are schools and hostels to shape the future of tribal children. There are health facilities for tribal women, hundreds of kilometres of roads connecting tribal areas.”He further said, “The disease of sickle cell anemia has been a big challenge for the tribal society. Our government has launched a national campaign to deal with this, which has been going on for a year now. During this period, about 4.5 crore people have been screened. A large number of Ayushman Arogya Mandirs are being built so that tribal families do not have to travel far for check-ups of other diseases.”PM Modi said that the tribal society has had a huge contribution in the ancient medical system of India and this heritage is also being preserved and new dimensions are being added for future generations.“Earlier governments did not care at all about the extremely backward tribal communities. In order to reduce difficulties in their lives, PM Janman Yojana worth Rs 24 thousand crores was started. This scheme is ensuring development of settlements of the most backward tribes of the country. Today this scheme completes one year,” said the PM.Adding further, PM said, the BJP government has also taken many steps to preserve tribal heritage.“Many people dedicated to tribal art and culture have been honoured with Padma Awards.We started a huge museum in the name of Birsa Munda in Ranchi. Be it culture or social justice, the standard of today’s NDA government is different. I consider it a good fortune not only for the BJP but also for the NDA that we got the opportunity to make Droupadi Murmu the first tribal President of the country,” said PM Modi.Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Bihar’s Jamui on the occasion of ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Divas’ and paid tribute to tribal leader ‘Bhagwan Birsa Munda’, marking the commencement of his 150th birth anniversary celebrations on Friday.PM Modi could be seen donning a white kurta and churidar with an olive green ethnic jacket.

The aircraft is now grounded at the airport until the technical fault is rectified. This unforeseen incident has caused a delay in the Prime Minister's return to the capital. The Prime Minister was in Jharkhand to address two rallies on the occasion of tribal icon Birsa Munda's anniversary, celebrated as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas. This event also coincided with the second round of polling for the Assembly elections in the state, scheduled for November 20. Interestingly, a similar incident occurred barely 80 km away from Deoghar, in Jharkhand's Godda, where Rahul Gandhi's helicopter was grounded for 45 minutes awaiting clearance from the air traffic control. The Congress party claimed that this delay was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the campaign schedule of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. During his rallies, PM Modi criticized the Congress and Rahul Gandhi. He accused Mr. Gandhi of conspiring to scrap reservations for people belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), and other backward classes (OBC) communities to weaken them. He stated, The Congress has dangerous intentions. The Congress' shehzada is conspiring to scrap reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs. The prince's father had declared reservation as slavery, bonded labor but he was later defeated in elections. His father had issued advertisements to remove reservations... We will thwart any such conspiracy. In response, at a rally in Godda district, Rahul Gandhi pushed for a nationwide caste census, claiming it would change the face of India. He stated, Caste census is bound to happen... We will demolish the 50 percent reservation ceiling, PM Modi can do whatever he can. This incident is reminiscent of historical events where political leaders' travel plans were disrupted due to unforeseen circumstances. For instance, in 2019, a technical snag in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's chopper delayed his return to New Delhi. Similarly, in 2020, the helicopter carrying Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde had to return to his native village due to rainy weather. The recent events in Jharkhand have sparked a political debate, with the Congress party suggesting that the PM's rally was being prioritized over Mr. Gandhi's movements. This incident has brought to light the intense political rivalry between the two parties, especially in the context of the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.

The Oxford Union released its term card in the beginning of the term, where a debate was scheduled for 14 November 2024 with Ms. Naz Shah, MP, Mr. Khwaja Asif and Mr. Muzzamil Ayyub Thakur as speakers from the proposition side. On 11th November 2024, the Oxford Union released a post notifying Mr. Zafar Khan of ‘Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front’ and Mr. Muzzamil Ayyub Thakur as speakers for this debate,” the letter reads.\\n\\nDetailing the criminal activities of JKLF, the Indian students in Oxford highlighted the 1984 Ravindra Mhatre kidnapping and murder case wherein the Indian diplomat was abducted and murdered in Birmingham by terrorists linked to JKLF. In addition, the letter pointed out the role of JKLF in the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus in 1990.\\n\\n“Mr. Zafar Khan is the Chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Diplomatic Bureau. Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which is a designated terrorist organisation. In 1984 an Indian diplomat, Ravindra Mhatre, was kidnapped and murdered in Birmingham. He was abducted whilst on an errand. After a few days of being held in captivity his lifeless body was discovered sprawled on a Birmingham street. This terrorist crime that took place in a major UK city was executed by ‘militants’ linked to the latterly named Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. In January 1990, the largest and latest flight of the minority Kashmiri Hindus from the Indian state of Jammu Kashmir was instigated by JKLF,” the letter states.\\n\\nThe letter further mentions the links of Muzzammil Ayyub with Islamic terror groups and that he has been booked for causing fear among the people and instigating them to carry out violence.\\n\\n“Mr. Muzzammil Ayyub has often engaged in hate speech against Indians and Hindus. A case has been registered against him for creating fear and alarm among the masses using social media and inciting them to commit offences likely to disturb public order.

Muzzammil had also threatened a Kashmiri woman named Tasleema for exposing Pakistan’s propaganda at the United Nations. His X (formerly Twitter) account has been withheld in India. In addition, Muzammil had collaborated with the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) on several occasions to disseminate Pakistani narrative on the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir. A detailed OpIndia report on Muzammil Ayyub Thakur’s anti-India antecedents can be read here.\\n\\nThe Indian students further emphasised that Jammu and Kashmir is an undeniably integral part of India which has also been recognised by the UN and the international community since its legal accession to India in 1947. They added that any debate around Jammu and Kashmir’s status as an Indian territory is an “interference” in India’s sovereignty.\\n\\n“Moreover, Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. The United Nations and the international community have also recognised Kashmir’s status that since its legal and constitutional accession to India in 1947, Jammu and Kashmir has been a part of the Indian state.

We as Indian students in Oxford are distressed and threatened that persons with terror links are invited to speak at Oxford Union, and that Oxford Union is interfering with the sovereignty of India,” the letter reads adding that while academic institutions should be neutral and offer platform to diverse perspectives, they should not be misused for the propagation of terrorist ideologies and challenging the sovereignty of any nation.\\n\\nIndian students protest against Oxford Union over inviting anti-India elements to debate over Jammu and Kashmir’s ‘independence’\\n\\nOn Friday, several Indian students and INSIGHT UK, the social movement of British Hindus and Indians in the United Kingdom held a protest against Oxford Union for inviting terror-linked individuals to challenge India’s sovereignty openly.

Both entities have reportedly been investigated by the UK’s Scotland Yard, the Charity Commission, and the FBI for their suspected connections to terrorist activities. “Muzzammil Ayyub has often engaged in hate speech.

In a strongly worded response to Oxford Union’s invitation, Kaul said that, despite his worries about the debate, which he considered was political and heavily influenced by the organisers’ biases, he had opted to participate with an open mind and express himself as a Kashmiri. Kaul referred to Muzzammil Ayyub Thakur and Zafar Khan as “India baiters,” adding that “it would be a travesty of freedom and fairness to have a debate or even an interaction with people who work at the behest of the so-called establishment of the Pakistan deep state.”\\n\\nLot of people have asked me why I chose to withdraw my name from Oxford Union Debate on Kashmir where Pakistan’s Defence Minister & UK MP were also invited. @rjraunac also asked me this question.

Back then, the Oxford Union invited “The Kashmir Files” director Vivek Agnihotri to the debate, however, he declined the invitation to the debate calling its theme “anti-India” and “anti-Kashmir”. \\n\\nBy offering a platform to anti-India elements with links to terror outfits, the Oxford Union is not only attempting to undermine India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity but is also normalising the presence of Islamic terrorists in the mainstream.\\n\\nEvidently, the Oxford Union is influenced by the growing lobbying muscle of Islamist groups in the UK, which are working tirelessly to shape public opinion on Kashmir in line with the Pakistani narrative even as the Kashmiri people are moving forward to the path of peace and development. This permits Islamist groups and individuals to influence conversations in elite intellectual circles, which is alarming given their capacity to rationalise terrorism. Instead of constantly bringing up the now non-existent Kashmir issue and allowing persons with terror ties to dominate the discourse, the Oxford Union should debate serious matters closer to home. The UK is grappling with the alarming surge of Jihadi grooming gangs raping and destroying the lives of British women. The union should debate the growing dominance of Islamists in the UK who are no less than a threat to the UK’s ‘secular fabric’ and its people, instead of challenging India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the garb of debates and discussions.', 'summary': 'On Friday, several Indian students and INSIGHT UK, the social movement of British Hindus and Indians in the United Kingdom held a protest against Oxford Union for inviting terror-linked individuals to challenge India’s sovereignty openly in their debate program.', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/indian-students-condemn-oxford-union-over-inviting-kashmiri-separatists-for-debate/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/oxford-kashmir-protests.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 07:02:44', 'author': 'OpIndia Staff', 'authors': ['OpIndia Staff'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.054}, {'id': 264942860, 'title': 'Indian students protest at Oxford Union over Kashmir Independence Debate', 'text': 'New Delhi: Indian students and British Hindus protested outside the Oxford Union in the United Kingdom on Friday, expressing outrage over a debate titled “This House Believes in the Independent State of Kashmir.” The protest was triggered by the selection of panelists who supported the notion of Kashmiri independence, a stance opposed by the Indian government. The debate, hosted by Oxford University’s debating society, featured Dr. Muzzamil Ayyub Thakur, a Kashmiri activist, and Professor Zafar Khan, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Diplomatic Bureau, both advocating for Kashmir’s independence from India. Speakers against the motion included Prem Shankar Jha, a former media advisor to the Indian government, and Yusuf Kundgol, who argued in favor of Kashmir remaining an integral part of India. The Oxford Union’s Instagram post framed the debate as addressing a long-standing conflict, rooted in the region’s quest for self-determination since the partition of British India in 1947. The post noted that the Kashmir issue has led to multiple wars and continues to fuel unrest and human rights concerns. Protesters, mostly from the Indian student community, condemned the debate for giving a platform to voices supporting Kashmiri independence, calling it a “distortion” of the historical and political context of the region.

They anticipate the party will surpass 150 seats, securing an absolute majority in the 225-member assembly.As the island nation awaits the final results for the elections held on November 14, Dissanayake's NPP, founded in 2019, is vying to secure a majority to implement key anti-poverty reforms and tackle economic challenges following Sri Lanka’s severe financial crisis. This crisis led to the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 and prompted a $2.9 billion IMF bailout. Dissanayake, who won the presidency in September, faces opposition from Sajith Premadasa's United People's Power and conservative factions. A win for the NPP would mark the first time a leftist coalition controls both the presidency and parliament, potentially shifting Sri Lanka’s policies toward a socialist approach and redefining its international relations, particularly with China and India.\", 'summary': \"Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP) party, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, is poised to win a majority in the recent parliamentary elections. With over 62% of the vote, the NPP has secured 52 seats so far, significantly outperforming opposition parties.

Thousands of people over the last three days were killed. Thousands and thousands of people were killed. They happened to be soldiers, but whether they're soldiers or they're people sitting in towns, we're going to work it, he said. The President-elect has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem what he characterises as a drain on US resources, in the form of military aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Lisa Curtis, who served as deputy assistant to Trump in his previous term and National Security Council senior director for South and Central Asia from 2017 to 2021, said the war in Ukraine needs to end in a way that does not encourage other nations to invade their neighbours illegally. President (elect) Trump has in the past talked more favourably about (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin than most US presidents. He has also talked about trying to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. We haven't seen yet how he's going to do that,” Curtis said. “I would just simply say that it needs to be done in a way that Russia faces some consequences for its actions, Curtis told PTI in an interview. It needs to be done in a way that Russia doesn't try to do the same thing two or three years down the line, she said. “It needs to be done in a way that doesn't encourage other US adversaries to try to illegally invade their neighbour's territory,” said Curtis, who is currently a Senior Fellow and Director of the Indo-Pacific Security Programme at Center for a New American Security think-tank. Some of Trump's top advisors were present at the Mar-a-Lago event. He praised Tesla owner Elon Musk and Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who are tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in his second term. Trump also praised Hindu-American Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for Director of National Intelligence.\", 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-vows-to-end-russia-ukraine-war-1838504', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/06/1859967-donaldtrump.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 12:12:47', 'author': 'PTI', 'authors': ['PTI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.12}, {'id': 264913616, 'title': 'Who is Robert F Kennedy Jr, Vaccine Skeptic Picked by Trump to Head US Health Department?', 'text': 'Washington: President-elect Donald Trump plans to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department, positioning a well-known vaccine skeptic at the top of the nation’s expansive public health system.Kennedy, a prominent member of a storied Democratic family, gained recognition as an environmental attorney, famously taking on major corporations like DuPont and Monsanto. However, over the past two decades, he has become increasingly known for promoting vaccine-related claims that clash with the scientific consensus. If confirmed Kennedy would head a major federal department responsible for critical health policies, including drug, vaccine, and food safety, medical research, and programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Before the election, Trump vowed to give Kennedy significant authority over health policy.Kennedy, the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, comes from one of the most influential political families in American history. He initially challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination before launching an independent campaign. Eventually, Kennedy struck a deal with the Republican Party, endorsing Trump and securing a promise to lead the health portfolio in Trump’s upcoming administration.Kennedy’s alignment with Trump has earned him substantial support from the Republican base, a level of enthusiasm he never enjoyed from his former Democratic peers. His strong stance against vaccines has distanced him from much of his family, but he and Trump have developed a close bond, campaigning together extensively in the closing days of the election. Trump has committed to appointing Kennedy as a key figure in his efforts to \"Make America Healthy Again.\"Despite insisting that he is not anti-vaccine, Kennedy’s public statements and leadership of the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense tell a different story. He has often questioned vaccine safety, once stating on a podcast that “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and encouraging resistance to CDC vaccination guidelines for children.Kennedy has also vowed to overhaul HHS, scrutinizing the staff at agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He has pledged to address what he describes as a “revolving door” between government agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. According to his campaign’s communications manager, Del Bigtree, Kennedy intends to root out conflicts of interest that he believes undermine public trust in health policies.

On India, Moody's said the real GDP expanded 6.7 per cent year-over-year in the second quarter (April-June) of 2024, driven by a revival in household consumption, robust investment and strong manufacturing activity. High-frequency indicators including expanding manufacturing and services PMIs, robust credit growth and consumer optimism - signal steady economic momentum in Q3. “Indeed, from a macroeconomic perspective, the Indian economy is in a sweet spot, with the mix of solid growth and moderating inflation. We forecast 7.2 per cent growth for calendar year 2024, followed by 6.6 per cent in 2025 and 6.5 per cent in 2026,” it said. Moody's said household consumption in India is poised to grow, fuelled by increased spending during the ongoing festive season and a sustained pickup in rural demand on the back of an improved agricultural outlook. Additionally, rising capacity utilisation, upbeat business sentiment and the government's continued thrust on infrastructure spending should support private investment. “Sound economic fundamentals, including healthy corporate and bank balance sheets, a stronger external position, and ample foreign exchange reserves also bode well for the growth outlook,” it added. Sporadic food price pressures continue to inject volatility in the disinflation trajectory. Headline inflation breached the upper end of the RBI's 4 per cent (+/-2 per cent) tolerance band for the first time in more than a year in October, accelerating to 6.2 per cent amid a sharp jump in vegetable prices. “Despite the near-term uptick, inflation should moderate toward the RBI's target in the coming months as food prices ease amid higher sowing and adequate food grain buffer stocks,” the agency said. Even so, potential risks to inflation from heightened geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events underscore the RBI's cautious approach to policy easing.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid. “For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would “end the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and “Make America Great and Healthy Again!” Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals. As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy\\'s nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials. Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, “I don’t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.” Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process. Kennedy hails from one of the nation’s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration. He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race’s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role. “I’m going to let him go wild on health,” Trump said at a rally last month. During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to “reorganize” agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry. But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines. Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to “resist” CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations. “I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, ‘Better not get them vaccinated,’” Kennedy said. Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year . Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives. Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike. It remains unclear how that will square with Trump’s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example. Kennedy’s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to...', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-chooses-anti-vaccine-activist-robert-f-kennedy-jr-as-health-secretary-1838359', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/15/1862853-untitleddesign11.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 01:49:35', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.112}, {'id': 264906406, 'title': 'Donald Trump Picks Robert F Kennedy Jr. As Health Secretary', 'text': 'US President-elect Donald Trump has announced Robert F.

He recently made headlines for his short-lived run for President of the United States in the 2024 election.Kennedy, born in 1954, is the son of Robert F Kennedy, who served as US Attorney General and a US Senator. Growing up in a family deeply involved in politics and public service shaped Kennedy Jr\\'s career path.Kennedy Jr. earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in American history and literature from Harvard University in 1976. He then pursued law, obtaining his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981. His legal education continued at the London School of Economics and culminated in a Master of Laws degree from Pace University School of Law in 1987.This extensive education provided the foundation for his career dedicated to environmental law and activism. He served as an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), where he took part in legal cases concerning natural resources and environmental laws.Apart from this, RFK Jr also is the president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, an organisation that is committed to preserving the world\\'s water bodies. While leading the waterkeeper alliance he has amplified their outreach toward ensuring clean, safe, and accessible water and giving the ability to community members to conserve their space.Why is Robert F Kennedy anti-vaccineRobert F Kennedy Jr became an anti-vaccine activist largely out of concern for vaccine safety and mistrust in regulatory oversight. His journey began with environmental work, where he initially focused on toxins like mercury. Over time, he extended this focus to vaccines, especially after raising alarms about thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative previously used in vaccines, which he alleged could cause neurological damage. Despite thimerosal being phased out from most vaccines, Kennedy maintained his stance, contending that vaccine safety testing is inadequate and expressing skepticism toward the pharmaceutical industry and federal health agencies like the CDC and FDA.In 2011, he founded Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an organisation that campaigns against vaccines and alleges undue influence by pharmaceutical companies over regulatory bodies. Kennedy believes vaccines can harm children and argues that public health authorities prioritize corporate interests over citizens\\' well-being. His views remain controversial, with health officials worldwide debunking his claims and pointing to the strong evidence of vaccine safety and effectiveness.Kennedy\\'s stance gained renewed visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic as he questioned the accelerated vaccine development and distribution. He has voiced concerns about the potential for adverse effects and believes that Americans should have greater choice over vaccinations, a position that resonates with certain social media influencers and wellness advocates.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-donald-trumps-pick-for-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/articleshow/115318603.cms', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115318899/115318899.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 01:23:31', 'author': 'Toi World Desk', 'authors': ['Toi World Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': 0.209}, {'id': 264918984, 'title': 'Vaccine maker stocks fall in US after Trump picks anti-vaccine activist RFK Jr as health secretary', 'text': 'Shares of vaccine makers plunged after President-elect Donald Trump nominated Robert F Kennedy Jr to run the Department of Health and Human Services, a post that would give the longtime vaccine sceptic influence over the nation’s health and medical research agencies.\\n\\nCovid vaccine maker Moderna Inc. dropped 5.6 per cent at the close of regular trading Thursday and lost an additional 1.4 per cent post-market.

He is the third of eleven children of former US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy.

Later, he completed a Master\\'s Degree in Environmental Law from Pace University School of Law, where he co-founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic and served on the faculty for over 30 years.In the 1980s, Mr Kennedy founded the Waterkeeper Alliance, an organisation focused on clean water advocacy, where he worked as chairman and attorney. His work to restore New York\\'s Hudson River earned him the title \"Hero for the Planet\" from TIME Magazine and helped create over 300 similar Waterkeeper groups worldwide. He also played a key role in the New York City watershed agreement, now viewed as a global example of sustainable development.Mr Kennedy founded Children\\'s Health Defense to address their health issues and harmful exposures, serving as chairman and lead counsel. While claiming to support vaccine safety, he has also been found spreading false theories, such as vaccines causing autism and COVID-19 being targeted at specific ethnic groups. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Kennedy was already leading campaigns against vaccines and collaborating with anti-vaccine groups. His organisation has also filed lawsuits against news outlets, accusing them of bias against anti-vaccine views. Studies show his Twitter account was a major source of vaccine misinformation. Mr Kennedy has also met with anti-vaccine activists and supported anti-vaccine literature, despite evidence that vaccines are safe and necessary for public health.Some of Mr Kennedy\\'s legal wins include cases against Monsanto in 2018 and DuPont in 2019 for contamination, which inspired the movie Dark Waters. He has also advocated for Indigenous groups in North and South America.Mr Kennedy has authored several books, including bestsellers Crimes Against Nature (2005) and The Real Anthony Fauci (2021).

Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick for health secretary\", 'text': \"President-elect Donald Trump 's plan to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , to lead the Health and Human Services Department will put a prominent vaccine skeptic at the helm of the nation's sprawling public health apparatus. A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations including DuPont and Monsanto. But over the past two decades, he's increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists. Trump would have Kennedy lead a massive Cabinet agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid. He said before the election he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy. Here's a look at Kennedy and the agency he'll be tasked with leading: Kennedy defies scientific consensus on vaccines and other issues He took over the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and built it into a juggernaut during the pandemic. His activism helped him build a loyal following that he's leveraged in his political pursuits. Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated. While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year. He wants to eliminate liability protections for drug companies. Even before Trump was elected, Kennedy said he would recommend water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride strengthens teeth and is viewed as one of the biggest public health successes of the past century. He made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes AIDS and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings. Children’s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit. He wants to overhaul HHS staff Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He is especially focused on putting an end to the “revolving door” of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his campaign communications manager Del Bigtree told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer. He said he wants to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research, and replace them with 600 new employees. Many of the scientists and researchers who work at the NIH are not political appointees, which makes firing them abruptly more difficult. Nevertheless, Kennedy made the promise at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a video first obtained by ABC News. “We need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,” Kennedy said, according to a video of his remarks posted on YouTube. He says the public health establishment is too focused on infectious diseases and wants to redirect resources toward panoply of problems he characterizes as the chronic disease epidemic, including obesity, diabetes, autism and mental illnesses. He blames them on greedy corporations including drug companies that worry healthy Americans would be bad for their bottom line and food producers using harmful pesticides and additives. Kennedy is a scion of a famous dynasty Kennedy's father was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy. Both men were assassinated. Kennedy originally ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before deciding to launch an independent bid.

Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation on vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States' top health agency. In a post on X, Kennedy vowed to work to end chronic disease, clean up corruption and provide Americans with the data they need to make informed decisions, vowing to Trump he would work to Make America Healthy Again. Kennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump in exchange for a role in the Republican's administration. Kennedy, the son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics, has frequently talked about tackling what he calls the chronic disease epidemic of conditions including obesity, diabetes and autism, and reducing chemicals in food. The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country, Trump said in a post on social media. The Department of Health and Human Services oversees drug regulation, public health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health insurance for more than 140 million people including the poor, those aged 65 and older, and the disabled through Medicare and Medicaid. HHS had a $3.09 trillion budget for fiscal year 2024, representing 22.8% of the U.S. federal budget. Drew Altman, president of health research firm KFF, described the move as historic and said what Kennedy, if confirmed, would ultimately do in the role remains to be seen, given he has not often discussed programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which account for much of the U.S. health budget. Historically, secretaries have been people with real experience and standing in national healthcare and he certainly is not that, and has views from outside the mainstream, and is a renegade appointment, Altman said. The appointment, which had been seen as a possibility for weeks, raised concern among some public health advocates who said Kennedy could have a negative role in Americans' health given his power over these agencies. The Democratic Party decried the decision. Some politicians and business groups supported the nomination, such as the National Community Pharmacists Association, which said it was encouraged by his willingness to take on corporations. HEALTH PRIORITIES Kennedy has been a part of Trump's transition team and has been reviewing candidate resumes for the top jobs at U.S. health agencies. Kennedy has suggested he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration - which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices - and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health. FDA's war on public health is about to end, he wrote on X in late October, adding that includes its aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, sunshine, and other items. If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags, he wrote. In early November, he said he would recommend fluoride be removed from public water supplies, falsely claiming on X that the chemical is associated with bone fractures and cancer. In a New York Times opinion article published in September, Kennedy criticized the popular Novo Nordisk weight loss drug Ozempic, saying, Instead of fixing our food system and addressing the obesity crisis at its root, the author focuses on a drug that may palliate the symptom - and gladden the wallets of distant Big Pharma execs. Dr. Ashish Jha, former White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator and dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said: Most people don't realize this is not about fluoride in water, or even vaccines, as important as they are. The HHS Secretary oversees Medicare. He and his appointees will decide what medicines are available to the American people. James Capretta, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former White House staffer under George W. Bush, said it is not clear what impact Kennedy will have but that it will not be immediate. There's lots of constraints on policy making on the agency level, even at the secretarial level, he said. VACCINESShares of vaccine makers including Pfizer Inc and Moderna fell after news of Kennedy's appointment and were down in after-hours trading by as much as 2%. Kennedy has been criticized for making false medical claims, including that vaccines are linked to autism. He opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus. He disputes the anti-vaccine tag, saying he wants more rigorous testing of vaccines instead. However, he chaired the Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit organization that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging. In an interview in March, when he was still running for president, Kennedy said Americans who want a vaccine for themselves or their children would continue to have access to them if he were to be elected. But he said he doubted the efficacy of measles vaccines. Measles is one of the most contagious human viruses and is almost entirely preventable through vaccination. It requires 95% vaccine coverage to prevent outbreaks among populations. U.S. coverage rates have fallen below that level among young children, the CDC said this month. Vaccines have saved over 154 million lives in the 20th century - the equivalent of six lives every minute of every year for the past 50 years, said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert from the University of Minnesota. Immunization has continued to be the single greatest contributor of any health intervention to ensuring that babies not only see their first birthdays, but they continue leading healthy lives into adulthood, he said.\", 'summary': \"Donald Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, an environmental activist, pledged to prioritize Americans' health. His appointment sparked concerns due to his stance on vaccines and health policies. Some experts expressed worry about his potential impact on public health. Vaccine manufacturers experienced stock declines following the announcement.\", 'url':

Trump, is learnt to have met Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations on Monday in New York, according to media reports.Media reports citing two Iranian officials said the meeting, that could prove crucial, between Musk and Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani lasted for over an hour and was held at a secret location. Billionaire businessman Musk rose as the most powerful private citizen in the Trump transition. Last week, Musk joined Trump\\'s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky amid Russia\\'s aggression against Kyiv.The meeting between the Iranian Ambassador and Musk triggers a possibility of a change in tone between Tehran and Washington under the Trump 2.0 administration, despite a charged history between the president-elect and Iran.Reports further suggested that it was Musk who had urged for the meeting.During his stint as US President, Trump (78) pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers, describing it as “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,”. He also went on to impose tough economic sanctions on Iranian oil revenues and international banking transactions.US Claims Iran\\'s Involvement in Trump\\'s Assassination Bid, Tehran Rejects AccusationsThe Republican leader had also ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani, in Iraq in 2020.Responding to Trump\\'s move, Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei prohibited any negotiations with the Trump administration and Iranian officials vowed to avenge Suleimani’s killing. Recently, the US claimed Iran\\'s involvement in a plot to assassinate Donald Trump before the US elections. Consequently, the US department of Justice charged an Iranian man, tapped by Iran, to kill Trump.However, Iran denied the allegatIon calling it a \"third-rate comedy.\"Following Trump\\'s victory, Iran has been publicly debating whether it can now reach a new and more lasting deal with the United States. Many members of new President Masoud Pezeshkian’s government have advocated for negotiations, arguing that Trump likes to make deals and that there may be an opportunity to get the sanctions lifted.Refusing the allegations Iran Foreign Minister tweeted ,\" Remember the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran right after our President\\'s inauguration? Everyone knows who did it and why. Now, with another election, a new scenario is fabricated with the same goal: as a killer does not exist in reality, scriptwriters are brought in to manufacture a third-rate comedy.

This is a policy based on Islamic teachings and our security calculations. Confidence-building is needed from both sides. It is not a one-way street,\" he added.Reports, citing Iranian officials, further claimed that the meeting with Musk provided a workaround for Iran, without requiring it to sit directly with an American official. However, Musk will, soon have an official role as he has been named as the co-director of a newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The top court directed the Centre to consider the issue and file an affidavit regarding it. Human and sex trafficking are crimes that dehumanises the victim and violates the victim's right to life, freedom and personal security. Vulnerable sections of society, especially women and children, are disproportionately affected in such crimes, said a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Pankaj Mithal. The apex court said the victims of such crimes are often mistreated by their traffickers and have to endure physical and mental forms of violence that are inflicted upon them. They stand at a greater risk of sustaining several life-threatening injuries and contracting infections and illnesses, including sexually transmitted diseases. Additionally, the mental health consequences can range from anxiety disorders, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and substance abuse as well, the bench said. A majority of such victims may require continuous access to doctors and other mental health professionals who can tend to their specific needs, it added. Alienation and ostracism by the larger society is also inherently associated with such crimes. Individuals who are trafficked are often abruptly alienated from their immediate family and other social groups due to the attribution of sentiments like guilt and shame on the victims, the bench said.

Victims might also need support to get job opportunities and secure their means of livelihood,” said the bench in its order of November 12.While the prevention of trafficking of persons, along with the prosecution and punishment of the offenders who commit such heinous crimes are important, it is equally important that legislative mechanisms focus on providing care, protection and rehabilitation to the victims of trafficking, it said. This must be done by creating a larger legal, economic and social environment that secures the well-being of the victims, said the apex court, adding that it is the need of the hour to adopt a human rights and rehabilitative approach to such crimes.The apex court was hearing an application seeking compliance with a 2015 order of the court which had noted the Union government’s stand on the formation of the Organised Crime Investigating Agency (OCIA) and strengthening of the Victim Protection Protocol for victims of sex trafficking. It had also asked the Centre to consider enacting a comprehensive framework for the rehabilitation of such victims.However, later the Centre informed the top court that instead of the formation of OCIA, amendments have been made to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 to deal with the issue.It has now granted three weeks to Centre to file a fresh affidavit highlighting the steps the Union intends to take. It asked the Centre to look into the aspect and suggest what steps can be taken with regard to a phenomenal increase in cyber-enabled sex trafficking and posted the matter for hearing on December 10', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/sc-expresses-concern-over-sex-trafficking-asks-centre-to-establish-comprehensive-rehabilitation-framework-for-victims/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sc-expresses-concern-over-sex-trafficking-asks-centre-to-establish-comprehensive-rehabilitation-framework-for-victims.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 14:09:34', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.364}, {'id': 264926958, 'title': 'KL Rahul suffers blow on elbow ahead of 1st Test against Australia', 'text': 'Perth: KL Rahul on Friday copped a blow on his right elbow and left the field for scans during India\\'s match simulation at the WACA ground, raising concern ahead of the first Test against Australia here from November 22.Rahul made 29 before pacer Prasidh Krishna pinged on his elbow with a climbing delivery, and the batter had to walk off after consulting with team physio.The 32-year-old is in line to open the innings if skipper Rohit Sharma does not play in the first Test of the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.\"About Rahul\\' it\\'s just happened so will take some time to assess (his elbow),\" BCCI sources told PTI.Rahul is looking for a Test comeback as he was not picked in the starting XI after the Bengaluru match against New Zealand last month.The Bengaluru man\\'s last Test hundred was against South Africa at Centurion in December 2023 and since then made just two fifties in nine innings.Scans for KohliMeanwhile the Sydney Morning Herald reported that star batter Virat Kohli underwent scans on Thursday for an unspecified injury.However, that did not prevent Kohli from playing in the match simulation and he made 15 before getting out.\"There\\'re no concerns as of now with Virat Kohli,\" the BCCI source informed PTI.Kohli is struggling for big runs of late and his last Test century was against the West Indies at Port of Spain in July 2023.Since then, the 36-year-old has made just two fifties in 14 Test innings.Across the last 60 innings, Kohli has averaged a modest 31.68 with just two hundreds.

Although the Excise Prohibition law was passed to enhance public health, the court stated that “for several reasons, it finds itself on the wrong side of the history” when latter quashed the directive imposed on the grounds that he had been negligent in enforcing the law.\\n\\nIt also highlighted that the state’s prohibition statute actually contributed to the unauthorized trade in alcohol and other illegal items and that officials from the police, excise, tax, and transportation departments “love” the liquor ban since it “means big money” to them. The court was considering a plea from an Inspector who had been demoted after the excise department carried out a raid near the petitioner’s jurisdictional police station and found Rs 4 lakh worth of “illicit foreign liquor” in a godown. He was accused of violating Rule-3(1) of the Government Official Conduct Rule by failing to uphold the Excise Prohibition Law. The ruling was issued by Justice Purnendu Singh.\\n\\nHe declared, “I find it proper to record here that the Article 47 of the Constitution of India while mandating the duty of the state to raise standards of living and to improve the public health at large and as such state government enacted Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 with the said objective, but for several reasons, it finds itself on the wrong side of the history. The prohibition has, in fact, given rise to unauthorized trade of liquor and other contraband items. The draconian provision have become handy for the police, who are in tandem with the, smugglers. Innovative ideas to hoodwink law enforcing agency have evolved to carry and deliver the contraband. Not only the police official, excise official, but also officers of the state tax department and the transport department love liquor ban, for them it means big money.”\\n\\nThe court mentioned that the “magnitude” of cases filed against the “poor who consume liquor and those poor people and are prey of hooch tragedy” is “much greater” than the “few” complaints filed against the kingpin/syndicate operators. It further underlined that “daily wagers who are only earning member of their family” make up the majority of the state’s impoverished population, who are subject to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act’s fury. \\n\\nIt stated that there are still gaps in the case since the investigating officer “deliberately” failed to provide any legal documentation to support the accusations made in the prosecution’s case. The judge pointed out that this permits the “Mafia scot free in want of evidence by not conducting search, seizure and investigation in accordance with law.” It further underlined, “The severe provisions of the prohibition law have become convenient tools for the police, who often act in collusion with smugglers. New tactics to evade law enforcement have developed, facilitating the transportation and distribution of contraband items in Bihar.”\\n\\nAfter reviewing the pleadings and the material on file, the court stated that the charge memo would demonstrate that it was framed in line with the directive of the Director General of Police, Bihar, who had instructed the Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna, in a letter dated 1st February 2021 to refer to the November 2020 letter. The letter indicated that the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) would be held accountable and that strict action would be necessary against him in the event that illicit liquor was recovered from the territorial jurisdiction of any police station.\\n\\nThe court conveyed, “Following the condition contained in Letter No. 63 dated 24.11.2020, the Director General of Police, had suspended the petitioner vide order contained in Letter No. 21/2021-142 dated 01.02.2021 resulting into passing of the Penalty Order by the Disciplinary Authority.” It added, “I further find that the Post Decisional hearing is one with close mind and it is a fact that it is detrimental in nature and it would be a formality in case it is done with a prejudiced mind with pre-supposed decision of awarding the punishment and hence post-decisional hearing would not be as effective,” while citing supreme court and high court decisions on the matter.\\n\\nIt further emphasized that a “pre-decisional hearing and not post-decisional hearing” is necessary for the fundamental idea of natural justice. According to the court, the supreme court has correctly ruled that the law granting post-decisional hearings is an “empty formality calling for violation of the principle of natural justice” if the authorities have already decided to take action prior to the start of departmental proceedings.\\n\\nThe Director General of Police, based on the court in this case, had a “pre-determined mind” when he insisted that the petitioner needed to face severe disciplinary action in line with the November 2020 letter. As a result, the court observed, the disciplinary authority “with preconceived mind took the decision to impose penalty in compliance of the letter of the Director General of Police” and issued a penalty order against the petitioner. The court concluded that the evidence showed that the witnesses’ statements had not been recorded appropriately either.\\n\\nThe court then overruled the suspension and penalty imposed on the petitioner, saying, “Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and the law laid down by the apex court referred in above paragraphs, I find that even though the petitioner was proceeded as per the provision of C.C.A. Rules, 2005 and opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner, in view of the conditions/directions contained in Letter No. 63 (01 implementation) 2019-20-1296/Excise Prohibition dated 24.11.2020 of the Director General of Police, in my opinion, the authorities had pre-determined to impose penalty on the petitioner and proceeded to hold quasi judicial inquiry giving the post-decisional opportunity of hearing which does not sub serve the rule of natural justice and is contrary to the principle of fair play.”\\n\\nThe court stressed that there is very little likelihood of receiving a “proper consideration” of the representation at such a post-decisional opportunity since the authority that initiates a post-decisional hearing “will naturally proceed with a closed mind.” When the court dismissed the petition, it maintained that the “petitioner is required to be put under suspension to proceed afresh in the light of the law laid down by the apex court” if the disciplinary authority identified that the petitioner should face disciplinary action based on the “recorded evidence.”\\n\\nBackground of the matter\\n\\nMukesh Kumar Paswan who held the position of Inspector of Police at a Patna police station filed a writ petition and the order was granted. The Excise Department carried out a raid in the region that was under the petitioner’s police station’s jurisdiction. The petitioner witnessed the raid that resulted in the “recovery of illicit foreign liquor” of Rs. 4 lakh. The petitioner created a seizure list and filed a formal complaint against the defendants. Since the godown where the raid took place is barely 500 meters from the police station, it is stated that the petitioner’s involvement in the sale of illegal alcohol along with one chowkidaar cannot be denied, in contravention of the instructions in a letter dated November 2020.\\n\\nOn 1st February 2021, the Director General of Police, Bihar, subsequently suspended him. The petitioner received a memo of charge dated February 6, 2021. On February 9, 2021, the petitioner was given a show-cause notice by the Inspector General of Police, Central Range, Patna, asking him to explain why he should not be convicted of violating Rule-3(1) of the Government Official Conduct Rule, 1976 by failing to enforce the Excise Prohibition Law. In March 2021, the petitioner presented a thorough show-cause reply refuting every claim. Following an investigation, the inquiry officer did, however, propose the “major penalty” of dismissing the petitioner. The petitioner then filed a high court appeal after the Disciplinary Authority found him guilty of the allegations and issued a penalty order on 13th April 2022, demoting him to a basic pay tier of Police Sub Inspector for five years.\\n\\nThe court was examining whether the November 2020 letter and DGP’s Suspension Order, which raises a presumption of guilt even before framing charges and providing an opportunity for a post-decisional hearing, might have influenced the Disciplinary Authority, which must make a decision in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Bihar Government Servants (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules 2005.

Princess Yuriko was quite active in public service and served as honorary vice president of the Japanese Red Cross Society. She was also the president of Imperial Gift Foundation Boshi-Aiiku-Kai, an organisation promoting maternal and child health, from 1948 until 2010. Of her grandchildren, three granddaughters remain in the imperial family. However, two others, Princesses Noriko and Ayako, daughters of Prince Takamado, relinquished their imperial titles upon marrying commoners in 2014 and 2018.

Rahul Baba, please praise your friend Uddhav Thackeray’s father, the great Balasaheb Thackeray, for two minutes. Uddhav ji, if you have the courage, get Rahul Baba to speak two good words about Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb,” Shah said while addressing a rally in Hingoli.The Union Home Minister said the assembly polls in Maharashtra would determine whether the state follows the legacy of Shivaji Maharaj or the path of Aurangzeb for the next five years.“The upcoming election will decide whether Maharashtra follows the path of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Veer Savarkar or the path of Aurangzeb. Our Mahayuti alliance has chosen the legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Veer Savarkar without any hesitation, while the Aghadi alliance seems to be an Aurangzeb fan club. Modi ji built the Ram temple and also reconstructed the Kashi Vishwanath corridor, which had been demolished by Aurangzeb,” Shah said.Amit Shah also mocked Rahul Gandhi, likening him to a plane that has repeatedly crashed.“Sonia ji has tried to land the plane named Rahul Baba 20 times, and 20 times it has crashed. Now, another attempt is being made to land it for the 21st time in Maharashtra. Sonia ji, please note that your Rahul aircraft will crash once again in the Maharashtra assembly elections,” he quipped.Referring to the recently concluded Haryana elections, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a third consecutive term, Shah criticised the Congress for its overconfidence in winning Maharashtra.“In the Haryana elections, Rahul Gandhi claimed victory prematurely. Such arrogance, especially in a democracy, is unacceptable. Ultimately, Congress was wiped out, and the BJP formed the government. In Maharashtra too, the Mahayuti will form the government,” Shah asserted.Touching upon the Ram temple issue and the Waqf Board controversy, Shah said, “For 70 years, Congress obstructed the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, but Modi ji made it a reality. In Karnataka, the Waqf Board declared villages, temples, farmers’ lands, and people’s houses as Waqf properties. We have introduced a bill to amend the Waqf Act, but Sharad Pawar and his allies are opposing it.”“You can oppose it as much as you want, but the Modi government will amend the Waqf Act with full force,” he added.Shah also dismissed Congress’s resolution to reinstate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, asserting it would never happen.“Rahul Baba’s Congress party has passed a resolution in Kashmir to bring back Article 370. Rahul Baba, listen carefully–neither you nor your fourth generation will be able to bring back Article 370,” Shah said.Exuding confidence in the NDA’s prospects, Shah said the people of Maharashtra support the alliance.“I have come to tell the people of Maharashtra that the entire country stands with Modiji. Every sister in Maharashtra is with Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, and every underprivileged citizen supports the NDA. In the coming days, a Mahayuti government will be formed in Maharashtra. This government, led by Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, is dedicated to serving the poor,” Shah said.Maharashtra will go to the polls on November 20, with the votes to be counted on November 23', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/praise-veer-savarkar-bal-thackeray-amit-shah-dares-lop-rahul-gandhi-in-poll-bound-maharashtra/', 'image': 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 10:48:35', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.175}, {'id': 264983730, 'title': 'Union Home Minister Amit Shah Dares Rahul Gandhi To laud Savarkar, Bal Thackeray', 'text': 'In a fiery rally ahead of the upcoming Maharashtra state elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah launched a scathing attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Congress’s stand on Article 370, and the Maharashtra opposition alliance — Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). Shah, speaking at Hingoli on Friday, presented a direct challenge to the opposition, questioning their stance on Hindutva icons and national security issues. His comments ranged from veiled attacks on the Congress party’s leadership to sharp criticism of its handling of national security and religious issues.\\n\\nAt the rally, Amit Shah made headlines with a bold challenge to Rahul Gandhi, urging him to praise two of Maharashtra’s most revered political figures — Veer Savarkar and Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. Shah, speaking to the gathering, said, “Uddhav ji, if you have the courage, get Rahul Baba to speak two good words about Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb.” This remark references the ongoing ideological divide within Maharashtra’s political landscape, with BJP strongly aligning with Hindutva leaders like Savarkar and Thackeray, while the opposition remains more secular in its stance.\\n\\nThe challenge highlights the BJP’s strategy of reinforcing its nationalist and Hindutva credentials, positioning itself as the protector of the legacy of these leaders, while accusing the opposition, particularly the Congress, of downplaying their contributions to India’s freedom struggle and cultural identity.\\n\\nAmit Shah’s comments also targeted Rahul Gandhi’s stance on Kashmir and Article 370. Referring to a Congress resolution in Kashmir advocating for the restoration of Article 370 — which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir — Shah emphatically dismissed the possibility of its revival. “Rahul Baba, listen carefully, not only you but even your fourth generation cannot bring back Article 370,” Shah declared, reminding the crowd of the BJP’s historic move to revoke Article 370 in 2019, a move that has remained central to the party’s political identity.\\n\\nMUST READ: PM Modi’s Aircraft Encounters Technical Issue in Jharkhand’s Deoghar\\n\\nShah’s words came as a sharp rebuke to Congress’s Kashmir policies, accusing the party of being out of touch with national sentiment while lauding the Modi government for its decisive actions on national security and territorial integrity.\\n\\nContinuing his tirade, Shah mocked Sonia Gandhi’s persistent efforts to establish her son Rahul Gandhi as the face of Indian politics. He remarked, “Sonia Gandhi tried to launch her son 20 times. Her ‘Rahul plane’ is going to crash for the 21st time in Maharashtra elections.” This statement is a reflection of Shah’s broader criticism of Rahul Gandhi’s leadership capabilities, a sentiment that is widely shared by the BJP and other right-wing factions.\\n\\nShah’s remarks about the “Rahul plane” were particularly aimed at undermining the credibility of Congress in Maharashtra, where the party is part of the opposition alliance, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), alongside Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).\\n\\nIn a highly charged political statement, Amit Shah compared the future of Maharashtra to a historical battle between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Shah asserted that the upcoming elections would decide whether Maharashtra continues on the path laid by the great Maratha warrior Shivaji or veers toward the legacy of Aurangzeb.\\n\\n“The BJP-led Mahayuti has chosen the path of Shivaji Maharaj and Veer Savarkar, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi people are the Aurangzeb fan club,” Shah remarked. This statement aimed at painting the opposition as unpatriotic and ideologically aligned with figures from India’s medieval history who were opposed to Hindu nationalism. Shah’s use of this historical analogy underscored the BJP’s political narrative of promoting Hindu pride and nationalism, which it believes resonates deeply with Maharashtra’s voters.\\n\\nShah also highlighted the BJP government’s success in facilitating the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya after years of legal and political battles. He reminded the audience, “For 70 years, Congress obstructed the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, but Modi ji built it.” This reference is designed to contrast the BJP’s commitment to fulfilling religious promises with the opposition’s alleged apathy toward Hindu concerns.\\n\\nFurther attacking the Congress and its allies, Shah addressed the controversial Waqf Board issue in Karnataka, where land and properties have allegedly been marked as Waqf (endowment) properties, including temples and farmers’ lands. “We have brought a bill to amend the Waqf Act, but Sharad Pawar and Company are opposing this bill,” Shah declared. His comments were aimed at painting the opposition alliance as out of touch with the needs of ordinary Hindus while reaffirming the BJP’s commitment to addressing grievances related to religious and cultural issues.\\n\\nAmit Shah’s remarks underscore the high stakes for the BJP in Maharashtra’s upcoming elections. With the state being a crucial battleground, the BJP is pulling out all stops to consolidate its base among Hindu voters by championing Hindutva, promoting the legacy of figures like Savarkar and Shivaji, and accusing the Congress and MVA of being weak on national security issues.\\n\\nShah’s comments about the future of Maharashtra likening it to a historical confrontation — aim to position the BJP as the true guardian of the state’s cultural and political legacy. Whether this strategy will resonate with voters in Maharashtra remains to be seen, but it is clear that the battle for Maharashtra will be as much about ideology as it will be about electoral arithmetic.\\n\\nALSO READ: Narayana Murthy Was Disappointed With Five Day Work Culture: I Don’t Believe In Work-Life Balance', 'summary': 'Amit Shah challenges Rahul Gandhi, Congress, and Maha Vikas Aghadi in a Maharashtra rally, focusing on Hindutva, Article 370, and the Ram temple issue.\\n\\n\\nThe post Union Home Minister Amit Shah Dares Rahul Gandhi To laud Savarkar, Bal Thackeray appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/union-home-minister-amit-shah-dares-rahul-gandhi-to-laud-savarkar-bal-thackeray/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AMIT-SHAH-2.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 10:58:53', 'author': 'Swati Pandey', 'authors': ['Swati Pandey'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.348}, {'id': 265002116, 'title': 'Maharashtra Polls: Amit Shah Dares Rahul Gandhi to Laud Savarkar, Bal Thackeray', 'text': 'Union minister Amit Shah on Friday dared Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to speak “nicely” about Veer Savarkar and Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray.\\n“Uddhav ji, if you have the courage, get Rahul Baba to speak two good words about Veer Savarkar and Balasaheb,” Shah said, addressing a rally at Hingoli in Maharashtra ahead of the November 20 assembly elections.\\n“Rahul Baba’s Congress party has passed a resolution in Kashmir to bring back Article 370.

This initiative comes shortly after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump appointed the duo to co-lead this ambitious government reform project.\\n\\nA Bold Vision: Reshaping Federal Governance\\n\\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, described by Trump as the “Manhattan Project of our time,” aims to overhaul the $6.5 trillion federal government. In a statement, Trump highlighted the department’s mission to identify inefficiencies and cut costs, promising a significant shake-up in how federal operations are managed.\\n\\nMusk and Ramaswamy, known for their disruptive approaches in their respective fields, have outlined their intent to recruit individuals capable of driving this transformation. The recruitment announcement was made through DOGE’s newly created account on X, a platform owned by Musk.\\n\\nExclusive Application Process on X\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about aspects of the recruitment process is the requirement for candidates to have an X subscription. The premium subscription, which costs $84 annually, allows users to have a verified account necessary for direct messaging DOGE with their resumes.\\n\\nIn its announcement, DOGE emphasized the need for dedicated professionals, “We are very grateful to the thousands of Americans who have expressed interest in helping us at DOGE. We don’t need more part-time idea generators,” the department stated.\\n\\n“If that’s you, DM this account with your CV. Elon & Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants.”\\n\\nWhat DOGE is Looking For\\n\\nThe department is not seeking just any applicant. According to the recruitment message, candidates should possess a “super high-IQ” and a passion for small-government reform. DOGE clarified its preference for individuals willing to work “80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting” tasks.\\n\\nThe department’s compensation policy adds another layer of challenge. Musk himself posted on X, “It will be tedious work, make lots of enemies, & compensation is zero. What a great deal.”\\n\\nUnclear Job Details and Structure\\n\\nWhile the mission of DOGE has been clearly defined, several details remain ambiguous. It is unclear whether specific skills or prior experience are required for the positions. Additionally, the department has not disclosed its funding sources or the long-term scope of its initiatives.\\n\\nPublic Reaction and Controversy\\n\\nThe unconventional hiring process has sparked mixed reactions. Critics have questioned the decision to require a paid subscription for job applications, viewing it as a potential barrier to entry. Supporters, however, see this as a bold move to attract only the most committed applicants who share the department’s vision.\\n\\nDOGE’s recruitment drive aligns with Musk and Ramaswamy’s track records of advocating for efficiency, innovation, and accountability. As the department gears up to tackle what they call “unglamorous cost-cutting,” all eyes will be on how this ambitious project unfolds.', 'summary': 'Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X, and Indian-American biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have launched the recruitment process.\\n\\n\\nThe post Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy Begin Recruitment for Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/world/elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-begin-recruitment-for-department-of-government-efficiency-doge/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Elon-Musk-6.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 10:38:21', 'author': 'Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.267}, {'id': 265038554, 'title': 'Welcome to the US Dept of Government Efficiency', 'text': 'The Ministry of Magic can be found in the fictional universe of Harry Potter. Nonetheless, a nation may occasionally build intriguing ministries. For example, Japan created a Minister of Loneliness in 2021 to alleviate social isolation, while Venezuela introduced a new Ministry of Supreme Social Happiness in 2013.\\n\\nMaybe it’s America’s turn now. For the Trump 2.0 administration, a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been created with the goal of cutting federal bureaucracy by around one-third. A “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms” is what Trump stated the agency will be doing.\\r\\n\\nA department to cut red tape may seem fantastic, but it’s really more about cutting government budget, one perceives. In actuality, Trump has chosen Elon Musk, the richest man in the world who has thrown his weight behind Trump in his reelection, and Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy American biotech entrepreneur who competed in the 2024 Republican primary but abandoned his campaign in January 2024 and endorsed Trump, to head the department. Trump had to give these two some sort of award, of course.\\r\\n\\nCrony capitalism\\n\\nHowever, how would that benefit America? Although neither John Rockefeller nor Bill Gates accepted such a direct government assignment, some are questioning if this is the beginning of a new kind of crony capitalism.\\r\\n\\nIt’s, however, remarkable how many billionaires themselves run for and occupy official political positions, even though they also indirectly influence politics “behind the scenes” through media manipulation, campaign contributions, and social connections with politicians. According to a 2023 study by Northwestern University academics, the rate of political entry for American billionaires is 3.7 per cent, whereas it’s 11 per cent for billionaires worldwide.\\r\\n\\nIn fact, Trump stated during a campaign event in August 2024 that he would be open to offering Musk an advisory position if elected. Musk responded by posting on X, “I am willing to serve,” with an AI-generated picture of him facing a lectern that read “Department of Government Efficiency.” Now, Trump has created exactly that – what he has called “the perfect gift to America.”\\r\\n\\nAccording to Musk, a commission of this kind could cut the US federal budget by $2 trillion, or around 30 per cent. And the concept has received backing from the likes of Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase.\\r\\n\\nMusk’s Twitter experience\\n\\nTo be fair, Musk has demonstrated this level of efficiency when he laid off 6,000 employees at Twitter following his 2022 acquisition of the company, a move that some estimates reduced Twitter’s value by 80 per cent.\\r\\n\\nFollowing his takeover of Twitter, Musk sent a series of sobering warnings to his employees: Workers need to prepare for 80-hour work weeks; free meals and office perks will be reduced. Additionally, he eliminated the flexibility of working from home. But even in a capitalist economy, is such a strategy appropriate for the public sector? The department’s name is a backronym that alludes to the online meme Doge as well as Dogecoin, a crypto asset that bears the meme’s name and is publicly supported by Musk. And is there any conflict of interest?\\r\\n\\nThe New York Times, for instance, questioned whether Musk’s anticipated employment at DOGE would be in conflict with his companies’ status as federal government contractors. And Vox said that the organisation is “unlikely to have any regulatory teeth on its own, but there’s little doubt that it can have influence on the incoming administration and how it will determine its budgets.” But Musk wrote in X: “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!”\\r\\n\\nDonald Trump asserted that this effort would upend long-standing government structures by introducing an “entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before.” Ramaswamy may have been referring to the last lines of the 1996 action film Independence Day when he tweeted, “We will not go gently,” in response to Trump’s statement.\\r\\n\\nWe’ll see if such a ministry eventually becomes the ministry of magic and a new norm in other countries too.\\r\\n\\nThe writer is Professor of Statistics, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata', 'summary': 'The Ministry’s lofty objective is to cut down red tape and save government money.

He's going to head the Department of Interior, and it's going to be fantastic, a tuxedo-wearing Trump said at a gala at his Mar-a-Lago Florida retreat, adding that he would make an official announcement on Friday. Burgum, 68, has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. He ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a loyal Trump supporter, appearing at fundraisers and advocating for Trump on television. At the gala, which featured tech billionaire Elon Musk, actor Sylvester Stallone and members of his incoming administration, Trump praised his latest cabinet picks and made some of his longest remarks since his presidential election victory speech. Nobody knew we were going to win it the way we won it, Trump said. He teased Musk about his ongoing post-election stay at Mar-a-Lago. Musk is involved in some of Trump's meetings at the oceanfront property. I can't get him out of here. He just loves this place. And I like having him here, said Trump. At the end of the event, Musk mounted the stage. The public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear. The people have spoken, the people want change, he said. Since his victory, Trump has chosen several loyalists with little experience for key cabinet positions, stunning some allies and making clear that he is serious about reshaping - and in some cases testing - America's institutions. MORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION The Interior Secretary will oversee policies guiding the use of 500 million acres (202.3 million hectares) of federal and tribal land, a fifth of the nation's surface area. Biden made the agency central to his climate change agenda by boosting the permitting of offshore wind and solar energy projects and creating a program to lease lands for conservation in the same way they are for development. Burgum is expected to be tasked with increasing oil, gas and mineral production on federal lands and waters. That job would likely involve ratcheting up new leasing in the Gulf of Mexico and on federal lands in oil-producing states like Wyoming and New Mexico. Biden had pledged to stop new federal leasing for oil extraction but was prevented by the courts from doing so. Interior leadership under Trump could scrap Biden's five-year offshore drilling plan, which had a historically low number of auctions scheduled, and step up acreage offered at Congressionally-mandated onshore sales. Drilling activity on federal lands and waters accounts for about a quarter of U.S. oil production and 12% of gas production. The number of drilling permits approved on federal lands fell 16% between fiscal 2020, the last year of Trump's first administration, and fiscal 2023, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Acreage in new onshore leases slid 95%.\", 'summary': \"At a Mar-a-Lago gala, President-elect Donald Trump announced North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as his pick for Interior Secretary.

The announcement, made at the America First Policy Institute Gala at Mar-a-Lago, came with a note of excitement, CNN stated.Trump stated, “I look forward to doing the formal announcement, although this is a pretty big announcement right now. Actually, he’s going to head the Department of Interior, and it’s going to be fantastic.”Burgum, who challenged Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, will inherit the Department from Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve in a Cabinet position. The Department oversees the nation’s public lands, natural resources, and Indian affairs.Burgum’s appointment is a significant step as the former Microsoft executive transitions from being a two-term governor to a key player in the incoming administration. While he had previously expressed reluctance to join Trump’s Cabinet, telling CNN last August that he would not consider serving as a vice presidential candidate or a member of Trump’s future Cabinet, Burgum now finds himself in a pivotal role, reported CNN.“Happy to do lots of other things. I had a fabulous 30 years in the private sector. A lot of opportunities there,” Burgum had said when he ruled out serving in Trump’s Cabinet. However, following the suspension of his presidential campaign in December, discussions shifted, and Burgum emerged as a potential candidate for several roles, including that of an “energy czar.” This position, which would have allowed Burgum to work on advancing Trump’s energy agenda while avoiding lengthy Senate confirmation hearings, was a departure from his initial reluctance to serve under the president-elect.As Secretary of the Interior, Burgum will be expected to oversee the stewardship of federal lands and resources, a role that requires navigating the complex balance between conservation, industry, and indigenous affairs. The Department of the Interior’s reach includes managing public lands, as well as critical issues like water rights and national parks, CNN reported.Burgum is the latest in a series of controversial picks by Trump, who has named over 20 individuals for high-level positions in his administration. Among these appointments are Fox News host Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defence, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz as Attorney General.Burgum’s confirmation will need to be approved by the Senate before he officially assumes office.', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/trump-picks-doug-burgum-as-interior-secretary/', 'image': 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 09:34:48', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.103}, {'id': 265034496, 'title': \"Doug Burgum to be secretary of Interior, Trump picks 'oil mogul friendly' North Dakota Governor\", 'text': \"President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday (November 14) that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a wealthy former software company executive, will be his pick for interior secretary.

The haka soon spread to the opposition benches, prompting the chamber to be cleared and Maipi-Clarke to be suspended.What's the Māori march?A nine-day hikoi (march), making its way to New Zealand's capital, is expected to arrive by Tuesday. Around 10,000 protesters marched through Rotorua, about 450 km north of the capital, with some wearing traditional attire. They were met by crowds waving the Māori flag and chanting in support.Thousands of people participated in the hikoi moving towards Wellington on Friday to protest against a controversial bill that seeks to reinterpret the country's 184-year-old founding document.

Their culture reflects a deep connection to the land and ancestral spirits.\\nThe Māori language, known as Te Reo Maori, is an important part of their identity and is still spoken by many Maori people today.\\nThe Māori have a deep spiritual connection with nature and the land. They call themselves ‘kaitiaki’ (guardians) of the natural resources. They believe in the concept of ‘whakapapa’, which means everything in the world is interconnected and has a genealogical link. Ancestors play a significant role in Māori culture, and their stories and traditions are passed down through generations.\\nMāori make up roughly 20% of New Zealand’s 5.3 million people.

Collins is also a veteran of the Iraq War. My great service – Veterans Affairs? Perfect choice – Senator Susan Collins of Maine.”.\\n\\n“Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,” Trump wrote. “We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need.”\\n\\nMr. Trump also thanked Collins for agreeing to serve in this important position, speaking about the need to support the ones who served.\\n\\nCollins Response: Commitment to Streamline and Transform the VA\\n\\nJust a few days after his nomination, Doug Collins also took to the other platform X, thanking the nomination and vowing to stay committed to the role. “I am honored to be nominated, and I remain committed to working every day to improve the VA,” he added.\\n\\n“Our heroes deserve the best care and support,” Collins wrote. “We’ll fight tirelessly to streamline and cut regulations in the VA, root out corruption, and ensure every veteran receives the benefits they’ve earned.”\\n\\nHe continued pointing to the areas of action needed to make the VA efficient and effective: “Together, we’ll make the VA work for those who fought for us,” he added. “Time to deliver for our veterans and give them the world-class care they deserve.”\\n\\nBackground and Politics of Doug Collins\\n\\nA former U.S. Representative from Georgia, Doug Collins has represented Congress since 2013, until his retirement in 2021.

Collins, an Air Force Reserve chaplain and military veteran, served in the US House from 2013 to 2021 and was a leading Republican voice on the House Judiciary Committee, fiercely defending Trump during his first impeachment proceedings in 2019, Xinhua news agency reported. Trump's new Cabinet selections include several prominent Republicans who defended him during the impeachment proceedings. Former New York congressman Lee Zeldin has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency; former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe has been chosen as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director; and New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a staunch ally of Trump, is set to be nominated as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. After his November 6 election win, Trump has been swiftly rolling out Cabinet nominations. On Thursday, he selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump after running as an independent in 2024, to lead the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department. Earlier in the week, Trump announced congressman Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Fox News host and veteran Pete Hegseth as Defence Secretary, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as Secretary of Homeland Security. With a Republican majority in the Senate, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes for confirmation, Trump faces fewer obstacles in advancing his Cabinet choices. However, some of his nominations have sparked concerns, leaving it unclear whether they will receive full Republican backing.

However, the festival does result in some public holiday closures, mainly for banks in many Indian states.\\n\\nBank Operations On Guru Nanak Jayanti\\n\\nBeing a Guru Nanak Jayanti day, the observance of public holiday in some states will lead to the shut down of banks.

In this regard, customers are urged to check with the state-wise holiday schedule prior to visiting local bank branches to avoid being inconvenienced.\\n\\nOthers will remain shut in Mizoram, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Hyderabad of Telangana, Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu, Uttar Pradesh, Nagaland, Bengal, New Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Srinagar. With the bank closures in these states, customers should make specific arrangements for their financial dealings in these states.\\n\\nSpiritual Significance Of Guru Nanak Jayanti\\n\\nGuru Nanak Jayanti is not just a religious festival but a time for deep reflection on the very highly spiritual messages delivered by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. His teachings, that hint at equality and selfless service with justice for all, function across cultures and communities. Being the founder of Sikhism, his contribution certainly transcends religious mandates; one can touch, directly access the very values of peace, unity, and love for all.\\n\\nOn this day, Akhand Path (the continuous reading of the Guru Granth Sahib), Nagar Kirtans (processions), and Langar (community feasts) are mainstream practices in Sikh communities.

While government-owned liquor outlets will remain open, all privately owned liquor stores are set to shut down. The Federation’s grievances center on alleged corruption and harassment by the state’s excise officials, claiming these issues have reached new heights, particularly around the bribery of excise officials for transfers and promotions.The Association accuses excise officials of accepting bribes in “lakhs and crores” and manipulating the Karnataka Excise Act to benefit their own interests. The Federation also claims that the enforcement arm of the excise department has failed in its mandate, focusing instead on intimidating merchants.The Federation’s demands revolve around an amendment to Section 29 of the Karnataka Excise Act. This section grants officials the authority to cancel or suspend excise licenses or permits, which the Association argues is often exploited to target merchants, forcing them into compliance through intimidation or bribery. They argue that these practices are not only unethical but have also reduced excise revenue in the state, as businesses are discouraged and the funds are diverted into corrupt practices rather than official revenue channels.Additionally, the Association has called for the excise department to be merged with the finance ministry to curb corruption. According to the Federation, this integration could streamline the oversight of the department and allow better financial and ethical regulation of the excise sector. They assert that the finance ministry would have a greater capacity to monitor and curtail malpractices within the department, thus reducing bribery and increasing transparency.The Federation has also voiced frustration over what they see as a lack of access to high-ranking government officials, including Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who they believe has not adequately addressed these pressing concerns. Thousands of merchants joined the Federation’s protest on October 25, demonstrating widespread dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in the excise sector. The opposition BJP has seized upon the Federation’s claims to criticise the ruling Congress party, particularly over alleged links between excise corruption and certain Congress officials. In a recent incident, the BJP claimed to have uncovered whiskey worth over Rs 50 lakh at the residence of Avinash Malli Shetty, a Congress leader in Udupi and director of the Bola Cooperative Society.The BJP has branded this as part of an ongoing “wine scam,” alleging that the Congress-led administration is ignoring corruption in the excise department as it benefits influential individuals within the party. The BJP also suggested that the funds involved in such schemes are being misused to fuel the party’s electoral campaigns; the government has, however, denied these accusations. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a Maharashtra campaign, said that excise revenue from Karnataka is being redirected for electoral use outside the state. He implied that funds may be used to support bypoll campaigns in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, heightening BJP’s claims that Karnataka’s Congress leaders are misappropriating funds for political gain.Following this, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had said that he would quit politics if Prime Minister Narendra Modi proved his allegation that the Congress collected Rs 700 crore from liquor shop owners in the state to fund the party’s poll campaign in Maharashtra.Siddaramaiah dismissed the accusations as politically motivated and also called on the Prime Minister to step down from politics if the claims were proved false. The Chief Minister said PM Modi's comments were an attempt to distract voters from real issues and the failures of the BJP. He accused the ruling party of resorting to personal attacks in an attempt to regain influence in Karnataka.

Protests were quelled after a superficial meeting. The reduction of our profit margin from 20 per cent to 10 per cent during the tenure of then-Minister Katta Subramanya Naidu remains unexplained.

The movie has received a mixed reaction from both fans and critics. While some were impressed, others expressed concerns about the film’s sound design. Many found the background score too overwhelming, describing it as excessively loud, with some even complaining that it left them with headaches. In response to the criticism, sound designer Resul Pookutty, who has won an Oscar and a BAFTA for sound mixing, spoke out on Instagram.\\nHe shared a screenshot of a review from India Today, which labelled Kanguva as “one of the loudest films currently in theatres.” Along with the post, Pookutty expressed his disappointment over how sound in popular films is often criticised. He pointed out that sound mixing is caught in the “loudness war.”\\n“A friend of mine, a re-recording mixer sent me this clip… It is disheartening to see a review about sound in our popular films like this. Our craft and artistry caught up in the loudness war… who is to blame?! The sound guy?!

Opposition MPs from the Māori indigenous community performed a traditional war dance to demonstrate their anger and fear over a bill that will redefine their rights.\\nWhen the speaker asked Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, how her party would vote on the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill, the 22-year-old MP stood up, tore the copy of the bill and started performing the traditional Haka dance in Parliament.\\nShe was joined in the Haka by other opposition leaders on the floor. Speaker Gerry Brownlee temporarily stopped the session. Maipi-Clarke, who was elected last year, was suspended for her protest, which Brownlee described as disrespectful.\\nWho Are The Māori In New Zealand?\\nThe Māori belong to the indigenous tribe of New Zealand for centuries. The Māori arrived on large ocean-faring canoes and settled throughout Polynesia and New Zealand. Their culture reflects a deep connection to the land and ancestral spirits.\\nThe Māori language, known as Te Reo Maori, is an important part of their identity and is still spoken by many Maori people today.\\nThe Māori have a deep spiritual connection with nature and the land. They call themselves ‘kaitiaki’ (guardians) of the natural resources. They believe in the concept of ‘whakapapa’, which means everything in the world is interconnected and has a genealogical link. Ancestors play a significant role in Māori culture, and their stories and traditions are passed down through generations.\\nMāori make up roughly 20% of New Zealand’s 5.3 million people. They experience material hardship, have worse health indicators and are incarcerated at much higher rates than the population at large.\\nThere are six major ethnic groups in New Zealand: European, Māori, Pacific peoples, Asian, MELAA (Middle Eastern / Latin American / African), and ‘Other ethnicity’, according to a 2018 census.\\nWhat Is The Iconic Haka Dance?\\nThe war dance holds immense cultural significance. The haka is performed with powerful synchronised movements, vocal chants, and intense facial expressions, and it is used to express emotions, convey messages, and welcome visitors, according to tribes.world.\\nThe dance is a symbol of unity, strength, and resilience for the Maori tribe.\\nDespite facing challenges throughout history including colonization and cultural assimilation, the Maori are an integral part of New Zealand’s society.\\nWhat Is Treaty Of Waitangi That Maori Are Fighting For?\\nThe treaty was signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Māori chiefs, and is considered the founding document of New Zealand. It set out the terms of governance between the two parties. Its clauses continue to influence New Zealand’s laws and policies today.\\nThe bill, introduced last week by a political party known as ‘Act’, a junior partner in the centre-right coalition government, said it wanted equal rights for all, thus, undermining the Treaty’s principles. The party argues that non-Māori citizens are being disadvantaged by policies designed to promote Māori rights and governance. This has already stoked racial tension in the country.\\nAlthough the bill passed its first reading with support from the National Party and New Zealand First, both coalition partners have said they will not back it in subsequent readings, making it unlikely to become law.\\nProtests Over The Bill\\nAround 10,000 protesters marched through Rotorua, about 450 km north of the capital, with some wearing traditional attire as part of a nine-day hikoi (march). They were met by crowds waving the Māori flag and chanting in support.\\nThousands of people participated in the hikoi moving towards Wellington this week to protest against a controversial bill that seeks to reinterpret the country’s 184-year-old founding document.\\nThe Treaty Principles Bill, which passed its first reading in parliament, will now proceed to a public submission process before the next vote. Its author, David Seymour, leader of the ACT party, argues that the proposal seeks to provide clarity on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.\\nWho is Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke?\\nMaipi-Clarke sees herself as the protector of the Maori people and represents the voice of younger generation of voters in New Zealand.\\nShe first gained attention after her election in 2023, where she performed the traditional Haka dance during her maiden parliamentary speech.\\nBoth Maipi-Clarke and her father were considered candidates to represent Te Pati Maori in the elections. Eventually, she was chosen for her “youthful perspective.”\\nNotably, Maipi-Clarke has been quite vocal in her criticism of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and his conservative government, which has faced allegations of ripping apart Maori rights.\\nMaipi-Clarke also supports incorporating Indigenous knowledge and practices in tackling climate change. Her activism is inspired by her grandfather, Taitimu Maipi, a member of the Maori activist group Nga Tamatoa.\\nMaipi-Clarke is from Huntly, a small town located between Auckland and Hamilton.', 'summary': 'Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, 22, performed Māori tribe’s traditional war dance called Haka in the New Zealand Parliament over a controversial bill that seeks to redefine their rights', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/explainers/why-new-zealands-youngest-mp-other-maori-leaders-protested-in-parliament-with-a-war-dance-9121676.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/fotojet-2024-11-14t231005.576-2024-11-2afb00d84035168231c1d5fd605d30de-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 11:39:57', 'author': 'News18', 'authors': ['News18'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.599}, {'id': 264970984, 'title': 'Youngest New Zealand MP Performs Haka Dance In Parliament, Tears Bill', 'text': 'Maheep Kapoor\\n\\nSafest Banks\\n\\nChampions Trophy\\n\\nNavjot Singh Sidhu\\n\\nAmitabh Bachchan\\n\\nRupali Ganguly\\n\\nNews / Videos /Youngest New Zealand MP Performs Haka Dance In Parliament, Tears Bill\\n\\nYoungest New Zealand MP Performs Haka Dance In Parliament, Tears Bill\\n\\nLast Updated: November 15, 2024, 15:27 IST\\n\\nBreaking News\\n\\nNew Zealands youngest MP leads traditional Maori Haka dance in protest over the controversial Indigenous Treaty Bill in parliament, rips apart copy of the legislation', 'summary': 'New Zealands youngest MP leads traditional Maori Haka dance in protest over the controversial Indigenous Treaty Bill in parliament, rips apart copy of the legislation', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/videos/breaking-news/new-zealand-mp-leads-traditional-haka-dance-in-parliament-9121565.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/nz-2024-11-48a0b9c3847798fa01d952b1a055cc1a.webp?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 09:57:28', 'author': 'News18', 'authors': ['News18'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.76}, {'id': 264963180, 'title': 'Mumbai: Fire Breaks Out Near BKC Metro Station, Passenger Services Suspended', 'text': 'The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) on Friday temporarily suspended the passenger services at Kotak Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) Metro Station after fire broke out outside the entry gate, which caused smoke to enter the station.\\nAccording to Mumbai Metro, after the incident was reported, fire brigade was alerted and was rushed to the spot.

a bid to defuse tensions between Tehran and Washington, The New York Times reported Thursday.\\nThe newspaper quoted anonymous Iranian sources as describing the meeting between the world’s richest person and Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani as “positive.”\\nThe two met for more than an hour at a secret location on Monday, the newspaper said.\\nNeither the Trump transition team nor Iran’s mission to the United Nations immediately confirmed the encounter, with the Iranian mission saying it had no comment.\\nThe meeting, if confirmed, could offer an early indication that Trump is serious about diplomacy with Iran and not choosing the more hawkish approach favored by many conservatives in his Republican Party as well as Israel.\\nIt would also show again the extraordinary influence of Musk, the owner of Tesla and X who has been a near constant presence at Trump’s side, reportedly joining him on telephone calls with world leaders.\\nTrump in his last term in office tore up a deal on Iran’s nuclear program negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, instead pursuing a policy of “maximum pressure” that included working to force other nations not to buy Iran’s oil.\\nBut Trump has cast himself as a great dealmaker and during his latest campaign has voiced an openness to diplomacy, despite his avowed support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has ordered military strikes on Iran in tandem with Israel’s war on Hamas.\\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, considered a moderate within the clerical state, on Thursday told the visiting head of the UN nuclear watchdog that Tehran wanted to clear up doubts about the country’s “peaceful” nuclear program.\\nIran’s ambassador also urged Musk in their meeting to seek US sanctions exemptions and conduct business in Tehran, the Times said, citing an Iranian Foreign Ministry official.\\nAlong with foreign policy, Trump has put Musk and another wealthy entrepreneur, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, in charge of a new “Department of Government Efficiency” tasked with overhauling the federal bureaucracy.\\nThe new initiative has raised questions about conflicts of interest given the extensive interactions between Musk’s businesses and the government.\\nAn account for the program has been created on X, formerly Twitter, where it asked applicants to apply through a direct message.\\n“We need super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting,” said a post on X, adding that “Elon & Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants.”', 'summary': \"Neither the Trump transition team nor Iran's mission to the United Nations immediately confirmed the encounter\", 'url':

The proposed cap is expected to inflict additional damage.\\n\\nA recent analysis of visa trends shows that while the number of Indian students applying to study in Australia steadily rose from 2020 to 2023, visa rejections surged at an even faster pace.\\n\\nStricter visa rules implemented in 2023 disproportionately affected Indian students, leading to growing concerns about accessibility to international education.\\n\\nThis underscores both Australia’s effort to regulate migration amid rising demand\\u200b and the challenge Indian students may face in securing visas despite meeting academic requirements.\\n\\nOne way out would be for Indian students to plan in advance and send out applications early and seek admission in public universities where competition will be intense even as the outcome, for them, would be “balanced and sustainable”.\\n\\nWhere to from here?\\n\\nThe tightening of visa regulations in Australia, the United States and Canada reflects broader domestic and economic concerns that have changed over time.\\n\\nThe process of obtaining a visa has grown increasingly difficult and selective, even though these countries still draw students from all over the world, especially India.\\n\\nTo navigate the changing environment of international education and maintain a balance between national interests and international intellectual interaction, it is imperative that policymakers across and within countries understand and address the fundamental forces driving these changes.\\n\\nRestrictive immigration and related policies in the three countries will ease in a few years. Sooner rather than later, policymakers in these countries will feel the need to return to pre-2024 positions as their domestic economic conditions ease.\\n\\nUntil such time this happens, Indian government officials will have to work towards liberalising the options for students to seek education in other countries.\\n\\nProspective students in India are relying on them to do so.\\n\\nDeepanshu Mohan is the Dean of IDEAS Office of Interdisciplinary Studies at OP Jindal Global University. \\n\\nAnkur Singh and Aryan Govindakrishnan are research analysts in the Centre for New Economic Studies at OP Jindal Global University.\\n\\nOriginally published under Creative Commons by 360info.', 'summary': 'The restrictions mirror the stringent visa curbs being implemented by the US and Canada following domestic and economic considerations.', 'url': 'https://scroll.in/article/1075554/australia-cap-on-foreign-student-intake-hit-will-indians-hard', 'image': 'https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/204086-aixwhnnndo-1729781222.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 14:00:00', 'author': 'Deepanshu Mohan', 'authors': ['Deepanshu Mohan'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': 0.24}, {'id': 265034540, 'title': 'IDBI Executive recruitment 2024: Application window for 1000 ESO posts ends tomorrow', 'text': 'The IDBI Bank will soon end the online applications from eligible candidates for the recruitment of Executive - Sales and Operations (ESO) 2025-26.

These videos purporting to show Lopez's hurried departure from the nation went viral without any supporting documentation. The claim was untrue and false.Also Read: Black Friday 2024: From cosmetics to appliances, here are the top deals and discountsAfter Diddy was arrested in New York City on September 16 on suspicion of racketeering conspiracy, human trafficking, and transportation to engage in sexual activity, the videos started to gain popularity.The false rumour stemmed from purported celebrity gossip YouTube channels, including Pop Cult, Celeb Lounge, Just In, and Uncover Discovery, who posted videos along with variations of the caption, FBI reveals Jennifer Lopez escapes the country after Diddy's threat, and a thumbnail allegedly showing a split screen of current FBI Director Christopher Wray and Lopez boarding what looked like a private jet.Several of these YouTube videos claimed Lopez's apparent retreat overseas was tied to an alleged FBI report that's been circling on the internet but did not provide evidence of the FBI's involvement, only speculation. One video shared on Nov. 6 claimed that Lopez had vanished without warning and had left the country, slipping away quietly with very little information about her destination. Another video posted the same day suggested she may be tucked away in a luxurious European villa, possibly hidden along the scenic coastlines of Italy or France. The clip also claimed she had not been posting on social media or making public appearances.Posts on social media sites such as Facebook and TikTok also spread the rumour by linking to such videos.

Senior officials along with the Kolkata police held a meeting to discuss measures, including a fixed salary for bus drivers, to arrest such accidents in the future. \\n\\nAn 11-year-old child died in the Salt Lake area on Tuesday, after a scooter was hit by a speeding bus. Police said that the child on the scooter was declared dead after reaching the nearest hospital. A mother and another child riding the scooter were injured in the accident as well. The mother complained that the police posted in the area did not help them. This triggered large scale protests in the city. \\n\\nThis incident brought to light the poor road safety in Kolkata and raised questions about the condition of public transport which led to many of these accidents. In the aftermath of the incident, citizens highlighted several deaths in similar accidents that occurred in recent times. Government officials along with the Kolkata police responded to this and held an official meeting to sort the issues surrounding this tragedy. \\n\\nAfter the meeting, West Bengal Transport Minister Snehasis Chakraborty said that road rage and rash driving will no longer be permitted on the streets of Kolkata. He added that if anyone is killed in such an incident, a case of murder would be filed against the driver. “The commission system in buses leads to underpaid staff driving rashly in crowded streets to eke out a little extra cash and win in the competition with other buses. We have asked for a change in this system and ordered a salary system for drivers,” Mr. Charkaborty added.\\n\\nOfficials said new measures would take seven days to finalise but verbal orders have been issued. \\n\\nCommenting on the issue, former State Transport Minister and Kolkata Municipal Corporation Mayor Firhad Hakim commented said, “I asked them to start a Standard Operating System. Anyone who does not follow said procedure should have their licence cancelled. GPS systems will also be installed to track bus movements as an additional safety feature.” \\n\\nPast deaths \\n\\nSevere violence had erupted in south Kolkata’s Behala area in August 2023, after a class two student was killed after being hit by a lorry. This led to violent protests in the area where locals set fire to a police van and government buses. \\n\\nAnother similar tragedy unfolded in February 2024, when a class seven girl was killed on VIP Road after being hit by a truck while riding on her mother’s scooter. \\n\\nIn another such incident, a 17-year-old boy fell off a speeding bus and was run over. The boy’s parents alleged that they were assaulted by the police when they tried to seek justice for their deceased son. \\n\\nRoad accidents \\n\\nAccording to the Government of India data, West Bengal stands 11th with regards to road accident fatalities. Data from 2022 says that 2,938 pedestrians were killed while 863 two-wheeler riders died. \\n\\nThe government of West Bengal had also launched a ‘Safe Drive. Save Life’ campaign in 2016 in which Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had raised concerns about the increasing number of road traffic accidents. Ms. Banerjee advised traffic officers for strict enforcement with sensitive handling of defaulters. \\n\\nBut the implementation of this scheme has been difficult, especially when it comes to public transport.

The marchers were welcomed by crowds waving the Māori flag as they proceeded southward to Wellington, located about 450 kilometers (280 miles) away.\\n\\nThe march, referred to as a hikoi in Māori, is expected to conclude in Wellington on Tuesday. Along the way, participants plan to hold rallies in towns and cities across the country. This mobilization follows the bill’s passage through its first parliamentary reading on Thursday.\\n\\nRevision of the Treaty of Waitangi\\n\\nThe proposed legislation represents a significant revision of the Treaty of Waitangi, an agreement signed 184 years ago that granted Māori tribes extensive rights to preserve their lands and safeguard their interests in exchange for ceding governance to the British. The Treaty continues to influence legislation and policy in contemporary New Zealand.\\n\\nThe bill was introduced by the ACT New Zealand party, a junior partner in the governing center-right coalition, which had pledged its introduction during the previous year’s election campaign. Proponents argue that the rights outlined in the Treaty should extend to all citizens, not just Indigenous populations.\\n\\nWhat is Treaty of Waitangi?\\n\\nThe Treaty of Waitangi, considered New Zealand’s founding document, takes its name from the Bay of Islands location where it was first signed on February 6, 1840. This date is now commemorated as a public holiday in New Zealand. The Treaty, written in both Māori and English, was an agreement between the British Crown and approximately 540 Māori chiefs (rangatira).\\n\\nBy the late 1830s, increasing numbers of British settlers, large-scale land purchases involving Māori, and concerns over lawlessness and potential French annexation had prompted the British government to secure sovereignty over New Zealand. Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson, supported by figures like James Busby, was tasked with achieving this goal. The Treaty, drafted within a few days, was translated into Māori overnight by missionary Henry Williams and his son, Edward.\\n\\nPrimary agreements under the treaty\\n\\nOn February 6, 1840, around 500 Māori debated the Treaty for an entire day and night before it was signed by approximately 40 chiefs, starting with Hōne Heke. Over the following months, additional signatures were collected, bringing the total to about 540. Some chiefs signed reluctantly or did not fully understand its implications, while others refused or lacked the opportunity to sign. Almost all signed the Māori version of the Treaty, which differed in key respects from the English version.\\n\\nThe English version of the Treaty outlined three primary agreements: Māori would cede sovereignty to Britain, the Crown would have exclusive rights to purchase Māori lands offered for sale, and Māori would retain ownership of their lands, forests, fisheries, and other possessions while receiving the rights of British subjects.\\n\\nMāori version of treaty varies from the english version\\n\\nHowever, the Māori version used terms that implied different understandings. For instance, “sovereignty” was translated as kāwanatanga (governance), and “undisturbed possession” was translated as tino rangatiratanga (absolute authority) over taonga (treasures, which could include intangible items).\\n\\nThese differing interpretations have fueled long-standing debates. From the 1970s onward, Māori advocacy for the Treaty’s terms to be honored gained momentum, often manifesting in protests, marches on Parliament, and land occupations. The Treaty of Waitangi is not automatically part of New Zealand law unless its principles are incorporated into specific Acts of Parliament. The Waitangi Tribunal, established in 1975, investigates claims of breaches by the Crown and interprets the Treaty’s meaning. Over 2,000 claims have been filed, leading to several significant settlements.\\n\\nRead More: What Is The Haka Dance?

So, why would any politician care to come to us to ask for votes? What difference do three votes make to them? Politics of people like me does not matter to any party,\" said Shameebha Patil, as she was walking through the fifth village of her constituency amid her ongoing campaign for the upcoming Assembly elections in Maharashtra.Donning a cotton saree and bindi, it was the fifth village in Jalgaon\\'s Raver she was canvassing since the evening, and had another \\'nukkad sabha\\' to address in the next one. A mob of 400-500 people usually follows her to every village that she goes to. Maharashtra\\'s first transgender candidate to be fielded in an Assembly election by any mainstream political party — the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi — Patil has been taking the two key opponents of hers from Raver, both men, head on over alleged failures to address the issues of Raver\\'s voters.\"Where I am contesting from, there is the Congress claiming secular politics on one side, and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is claiming \\'sabka saath, sabka vikas\\' on the other. Those candidates have lots of money and muscle power. A transgender candidate like me will never meet those credentials,\" Patil said. \"But what stands by me is the work I have done for the people in various sectors for the past 15 years,\" she said.As Maharashtra is set to vote on 20 November, stakes are high for the ruling Mahayuti alliance and the Opposition\\'s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). But while both alliances and their parties have spoken about the need for more initiatives to bring the transgender community into the mainstream, neither have fielded a candidate from the community this election.But not just the transgenders, the queer community as a whole is lacking political representation and support despite Section 377 being decriminalised in India six years ago, says Patil.Labour, Child Marriages: What Befalls Children of Maharashtra\\'s Farmer SuicidesA post-graduate in Marathi literature and a visiting faculty at Mumbai\\'s Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Patil has been an active social worker since 2007 when she was in college. \"I have been working for the people since the time I identified as a man,\" she said.Over the years, Patil has worked with several organisations like the Sarva Seva Sangh and the Lok Sangarsh Morcha, and belongs to the Leva community.For the Patil campaign, however, the issues go way beyond her own community and her identity as a transgender.\"Why is it called the third gender? I have an objection to that. Who decided what gender comes first, second, or third? The patriarchy did,\" she said.Asked about the reception from voters, Patil said that the positivity that the people have towards her is because of her work.\"Given my work of the past 15 years, I was the same person for the people then and I am the same now. The people that stood by me then are also standing by me now. The section of the society that stands with me today is vanchit (deprived). They are farmers, Adivasis, SCs, Muslims, micro-OBCs. These are the people who have only been seen as vote banks in this constituency till date,\" she said.For Patil, issues of banana farmers, bogus admissions of Adivasis in government jobs, irrigation facilities for all farmers, Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, due compensation against crop damage, better schools for children, and creation of jobs for Raver\\'s youth are the key issues.\"First, I am an Ambedkarite. Second, I have always been on the ground. I talk for all communities. All these factors have given me the appreciation that I have today. I have not paid people to come for my rallies. There are so many aspects of my campaign that are crowd funded. Such initiatives by people make me proud of what I have achieved so far,\" she said.But speaking in the \\'larger scheme of things\\' about her candidature as a transgender, Patil has several grievances with political parties across the spectrum, \"especially from the ones that made lots of tall promises.\"\\'Only an Election Issue\\': Dharavi Reporters Tell Facts of Redevelopment PoliticsAhead of the upcoming elections, a few promises have been made by several parties.In its common election manifesto released by the MVA , comprising of the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar (NCPSP), and Shiv Sena (UBT) this week, there are several significant promises for the queer community with the aim to make them \"a part of the mainstream.\"Some of the key promises include:Reservation for LGBTQIA+ individuals in government jobs and implement a special scholarship scheme for their education. Form a new advisory committee under the Law Commission to address the specific needs of the LGBTQIA+ community and take steps to amend and reform relevant laws. Establish dedicated health and counselling centres to address the mental and health challenges faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. Set up special facilities for skill training to create livelihood opportunities for LGBTQIA+ individuals.Formulate an inclusive policy for employment to ensure opportunities for differently-abled and LGBTQIA+ individuals across all sectorsThe VBA, meanwhile, has similar promises in its manifesto. 1 percent reservation for the transgender community in education and jobs.Scholarships and seats in universities for government education.Free sex change surgeries in government hospitals.Free housing under government\\'s housing schemes.Monthly allowance for transgender persons aged 40 and aboveFree skill development initiatives, financial support to start small businesses.Free medium to higher education for transgenders and queer community, with assistance to move abroad.The BJP manifesto, meanwhile, also has one line on \"streamlining efforts to bring the transgender community to the mainstream.\"Patil, however, said that she does not expect any party other than Vanchit to stand true to their promises.\"Devendra Fadnavis announced the formation of a transgender welfare board. The government that formed in 2019 activated it. But that committee has no initiatives other than registration of Aadhaar cards, election cards, and ration cards,\" Patil said.\"Even under the central government\\'s policies, transgenders get national identity documents on the National Transgender Portal. But on that portal, there is nothing beyond giving identity documents. There are no schemes or welfare ideas to bring us into the mainstream,\" Patil said.Speaking about the Opposition parties, she said: \"So many of these parties have LGBTQIA+ cells. Beyond votes and having us around for sentimental values, these parties don\\'t do anything.\"\"It is all about playing with emotions. They act as mere sympathisers and we don\\'t want sympathisers. I don\\'t want sympathy and donations, I want empathy and dignity, I want rights and respect,\" she said.Speaking to The Quint, India\\'s first gay national spokesperson of a mainstream political party and NCPSP national spokesperson Anish Gawande lauded Patil\\'s candidature. Gawande was a part of the team that formulated promises for the queer community in the MVA manifesto.Asked why the party or any of the MVA partners had not fielded any queer candidate, Gawande said: \"I think representation is only one part of the solution. There needs to be consultation alongside representation. The manifesto preparation committee of the MVA included stakeholder discussions with every single sector of society from specially abled folks, LGBTQIA+ community, senior citizens, Dalits, Muslims, and Adivasi communities. So, in a very direct way, this manifesto is a result of a much longer consultative process which has included a lot more queer voices than a single seat or a candidate could represent.\"\"That being said, the VBA has consistently demonstrated the representation of LGBTQIA+ rights not only by fielding candidates, but also by giving opportunities to prominent leaders like Disha Pinki Sheikh and they have to be duly commended for those efforts,\" Gawande added.While stressing on the need of laws for the queer community and recognition of union between two queer individuals, Gawande said: \"Reservation in jobs has been a long-standing demand of the transgender community. This has also been granted not by a political discourse but by the Nalsa verdict of the Supreme Court of India. This is an obligation on the state and the central government to ensure that reservation is granted to a broad umbrella of transgender persons.\"In Raver, Shameebha Patil is up against two political heavyweights — Amol Jawale of the BJP, son of former MLA Amol Jawale, and Dhananjay Chaudhari of the Congress, son of sitting MLA Shirish Chaudhari.While Patil believes she is giving a very tough fight to both, is India ready to elect a queer representative beyond the urban-elite settings?Both Patil and Gawande believe it is.\"It is a 100% ready,\" stressed Gawande.\"Shameeba Patil is not fighting from a uber-urban setting but from a largely rural setting. I have been doing rallies not just in the most urban elite constituencies of the state but across the length and breadth of the state from Vidarbha to Western Maharashtra to the outskirts of Mumbai. So, not only are people ready for queer candidates, but I don\\'t think there is any concern around the electability or winnability of queer candidates either. And the quicker the political parties realise this, the better it will be for their own political prospects,\" he said.Patil, meanwhile, firmly believes that her work goes way beyond her gender identity.\"Forget transgenders, in a patriarchal society like ours, how much of women\\'s representation do you have?

Keep reading to get the release date, expected plot, and more details.\\nKagurabachi Chapter 58: Release date and where to read\\n\\nKagurabachi Chapter 58 is set to debut on Monday, November 18, 2024, at 12 am JST in Weekly Shonen Jump Issue 51. For readers outside Japan, the chapter will be available on Sunday, November 17, though the exact release time may vary depending on individual locations and time zones.\\n\\nFans worldwide can access Kagurabachi Chapter 58 digitally through Shueisha’s MANGAPlus website and app, the Shonen Jump+ app, as well as through Viz Media’s official site. While the first and latest three chapters are freely accessible on most platforms, a subscription is required for full access to the series.\\nExpected plot in Kagurabachi Chapter 58\\n\\nKagurabachi Chapter 58 will likely shift to addressing the fate of Uruha, especially given the dramatic conclusion of the previous chapter. If Hiruhiko has indeed activated the Kumeyuri blade, it raises the disturbing possibility that Uruha might have been killed.\\n\\nThis speculation stems from Hiruhiko’s sudden shift from using his original origami-based sorcery to wielding the Kumeyuri blade. Moreover, the chapter may explore the reasons behind Samura’s betrayal of the contracted sword bearers.\\n\\nThis betrayal hinted at during Hiruhiko’s confrontation with Chihiro, suggests that Samura’s pact with Yura is far more complicated than initially believed. Additionally, the appearance of Storehouse bubbles around Chihiro at the end of the last chapter hints at Hakuri potentially transporting him to a safer location in Kagurabachi Chapter 58, possibly back to the temple.\\nKagurabachi Chapter 57 recap\\n\\nKagurabachi Chapter 57, titled ‘Collapse,’ begins with Samura wielding the Tobimune Enchanted Blade to annihilate the Hishaku assassins. His allies are astonished by the blade’s immense power. Meanwhile, the main Hishaku sorcerer observes from afar, curious about the capabilities of a master wielding an Enchanted Blade, before deciding to retreat.\\n\\nHakuri, despite being severely weakened, expresses a desire to retrieve the Kumeyuri Enchanted Blade for Uruha. However, a Makizumi member advises against it, urging him to rest due to his critical blood loss. Uruha reassures everyone that they will eventually recover all the lost Enchanted Blades.\\n\\nSamura checks on his team’s condition and is distraught upon learning that Ryo Fuura, a young monk, sacrificed his life to protect him. A Makizumi girl comforts Samura in Kagurabachi Chapter 57, affirming that Fuura’s death served a greater purpose in safeguarding the sword bearers.\\nhttps://twitter.com/hacksawmanuel/status/1857021646005010804She sees it as a pivotal moment, but Samura remains somber, insisting this is only the beginning of their battles. Meanwhile, Hiruhiko reflects on his failure to secure the Tobimune blade but remains determined, believing the Hishaku’s primary objective of slaying the Sword Saint and having Yura wield the Shinuchi blade remains unchanged.\\n\\nDuring a heated exchange with Chihiro, Hiruhiko challenges the notion of the Sword Saint being a hero, hinting at dark secrets behind the Enchanted Blades. Chihiro, recalling his battle against Kyora, starts doubting the traditional view that the wielders of these blades are heroes in Kagurabachi Chapter 57.\\n\\nHiruhiko then reveals a shocking truth: three years ago, Samura made a pact with Yura, believing that the sword bearers were not heroes. The chapter then sees Hiruhiko acquiring the Kumeyuri blade by severing his connection with his original sorcery.\\nhttps://twitter.com/pondoffrogs/status/1856870432302834018He activates the blade, summoning two Geisha figures, leaving Chihiro stunned and fearful for Uruha’s fate.

Will Donald Trump’s return to the White House lead to a re-orientation in the bilateral relations between the two on the energy front.\\n\\nNot really, if one goes by what policymakers in New Delhi have to say. “A lot has happened between Trump’s first stint and now,” said an official here.\\r\\n\\nAccording to Western media reports, Trump’s energy agenda may emphasise energy independence, economic growth, and expanded production of fossil fuels.\\r\\n\\nThe US-India energy cooperation is technical, economic, and bilateral. The US is among the top five fossil fuel suppliers to India, a reason why New Delhi cannot be ignored by the Trump regime.\\r\\n\\nAccording to data available, hydrocarbon trade between the two countries has nearly doubled from 2018-19, touching $13.6 billion during 2023-24. For the first two months of FY25 hydrocarbon trade is valued at $2.43 billion.\\r\\n\\nIn November 2009, the two countries launched the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy, to accelerate inclusive, low carbon growth by supporting research and deployment of clean energy technologies.\\r\\n\\nGreen initiatives\\n\\nIn 2021 the two revamped the US-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) to advance the climate and clean energy goals of both countries following the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership announced by President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which recognised the importance of accelerating climate action in the decisive decade ahead.\\r\\n\\nUnder the SCEP, the two countries agreed to collaborate across five pillars: Power and Energy Efficiency; Renewable Energy; Responsible Oil and Gas; Sustainable Growth; Emerging Fuels.\\r\\n\\nIn addition, the two were to continue to push innovation in civil nuclear power as a net-zero solution through different collaborative programmes including the long-standing Civil Nuclear Energy Working Group (CNEWG).\\r\\n\\nThe two countries were also to engage the private sector and other stakeholders across the technical areas to help deploy clean technologies to accelerate a clean energy transition.\\r\\n\\nAccording to Peter J. Jarka-Sellers, Expert in US-India Energy Policy, “There is every indication that Trump’s fundamental orientation on energy and climate will be the same as during his first-term. He will seek to boost fossil fuel production, remove measures to decrease consumption, and completely reject climate mitigation as a policy imperative. He campaigned vocally on this and his campaign was backed by the fossil fuel industry.\\r\\n\\n“He will almost certainly move to undo all Biden-era regulations such as setting emissions limits on coal and gas power plants, fuel efficiency standards for cars (including promoting EVs), and regulations supporting clean energy industries like offshore wind where the federal government plays an especially important role,” he said adding “These are some of the most high-profile examples.”\\r\\n\\n“Connected to boosting production and of greater relevance to other countries like India, he will look for new and expanded export markets for fossil fuels, such as LNG. The result will be that the energy transition slows and that shifts away from fossil fuels will be driven by market forces and state/local policy rather than national policy,” he said.\\r\\n\\nBut, a lot has changed since 2016-2020, he agrees. “The clean energy industry for one is larger/more mature, clean technologies are being deployed faster and at higher volumes, and that industry is by extension more politically and economically influential,” he said.\\r\\n\\nWhile it was easier for Trump to undo Obama’s executive actions, it may not be easy to undo Biden’s actions which were through legislations. Therefore, Trump may tread in a more structured manner.\\r\\n\\nThe Russia angle\\n\\nAnother aspect that one needs to watch out for is Trump’s stance on Russian oil. India’s stance on Russian oil has been clear. For India what mattered was commerce — availability of cheap oil.\\r\\n\\nAccording to Jarka-Sellers, “The future of sanctions on Russian oil is unclear though changes to the Biden-era policy seem likely at some point. It’s hard to say when, if, and how US sanction policy vis-a-vis Russia will change and I think the future of sanctions on Russian oil is likely dependent on how Trump approaches the US-Russia relationship and the war in Ukraine more broadly.”\\r\\n\\nTrump does seem, however, to be less firmly committed to Ukraine’s war effort and the cause of its territorial integrity, he said adding “Trump has suggested that he would make a deal with Russia to end the war at Ukraine’s expense and given the toll of sanctions on Russia, lifting those sanctions would be a very logical and, by extension likely, part of such a deal. Russia would likely make it a condition for a deal and if Trump goes ahead with such a deal, he would likely have to accept that condition.”\\r\\n\\nWhile Trump is clear on his stance towards clean energy projects, it is also evident that the American business works purely on commerce. But, an aspect which also has emerged between Trump’s first stint and now is that India cannot be ignored as it is a stable market for the fossil fuel industry.\\r\\n\\nIndia will need to sharpen its bargaining skills when doing business with the US.', 'summary': 'The Trump administration will view India as a stable and important market for fossil fuel and LNG exports', 'url': 'https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/the-trump-factor-in-indo-us-energy-ties/article68872979.ece', 'image': 'https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3pavtk/article68872988.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/BL16_Think_Fuel_vs_renewable.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 14:50:00', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.228}, {'id': 265035730, 'title': \"Akshay Kumar Did It Before Tom Cruise, Netizens Say Plane Stunt In Mission Impossible 8 Is 'Copied'\", 'text': 'The trailer of possibly the last Mission Impossible film, MI: Dead Reckoning Part 2 has been released and soon trended on social media.

Today's final agreement with TSMC -- the world's leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors -- will spur $65 billion dollars of private investment to build three state-of-the-art facilities in Arizona, said President Joe Biden in a statement.The Biden administration's announcement comes shortly before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has recently criticized the CHIPS Act, a major law passed during Biden's tenure aimed at strengthening the US semiconductor industry.While the US government has unveiled over $36 billion in grants through this act, including the award to TSMC, much of the funds remain in the due diligence phase and have not been disbursed.But once a deal is finalised, funds can start flowing to companies that have hit certain milestones.

These are the chips that are in sophisticated military equipment, Raimondo added.Making these chips in the United States, she noted, helps address a national security liability.The first of TSMC's three facilities is set to fully open by early-2025, Biden noted.At full capacity, the three facilities in Arizona are expected to manufacture tens of millions of leading-edge logic chips that will power products like 5G/6G smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and high-performance computing and AI applications, said the Commerce Department.It added that early production yields at the first TSMC plant in Arizona are on par with similar factories in Taiwan.

The property\\'s performance during this high-demand period was nothing short of a disappointment. Dynamic pricing or price gouging? With the surge in demand for rooms due to the Diljit\\'s Dil-Luminati concert, Novotel Hyderabad Airport adopted an aggressive dynamic pricing strategy, pushing room rates up to 3X their usual price. This steep increase not only targeted concert-goers but also affected other travelers visiting Hyderabad for business, medical appointments, or family emergencies. The lack of regulation on such pricing practices leaves regular patrons at the mercy of these hotels, with many expressing frustration over being exploited during peak times. India, as of now, offers remedies for such cases under consumer laws. When biryani becomes an abomination Hyderabad, known globally for its iconic biryani, offers visitors a taste of its rich culinary heritage. Yet, at Novotel Hyderabad Airport, guest D Bhat, encountered an unpalatable shock. A mutton biryani served to guests was found to contain frozen pieces of meat and was utterly tasteless—a culinary sin in the city that prides itself on its legendary dish. Despite immediate complaints from multiple patrons, the hotel staff neither offered an apology nor any form of service recovery, charging the full amount for a dish that failed basic quality standards. Putting this property at a much lower service quality than an average road side food joint. The drinks orders first taken were later deemed unavailable in one such case. One guest described the experience as \"a culinary abomination,\" reflecting the broader sentiment of dissatisfaction with the hotel\\'s food and beverage offerings. Non-smoking floor or smoking haven? Adding to the growing list of grievances, guests were dismayed to find the designated non-smoking floor (4th floor) filled with patrons openly smoking, with no intervention from the management. This blatant disregard for the non-smoking policy compromised the comfort and health of non-smoking guests. Despite repeated complaints, the hotel staff failed to address the issue, showcasing a complete lack of control over guest behavior and a disregard for enforcing basic standards. Management Indifference: A dismissive response from leadership In an attempt to escalate the concerns, senior management at the property, including Mayank Uniyal, Director of Sales and Marketing (DoSM), was approached with feedback. However, his response was both alarming and dismissive, suggesting Accor APAC\\'s management has little influence over the property\\'s operations. A patron also suggested that when a callback after repeated attempts to reach him were sought; Mayank took hours to return the call, only to offer misleading information and refuse to offer a solution to a patron\\'s team. This raises serious concerns about accountability and the efficacy of brand oversight in maintaining service standards, especially for a property that carries the reputable Accor name. Expert Opinion: \"Novotel Hyderabad Airport Falls Short of Expectations\" D. Bhat, Senior International Editor, shared his unfiltered assessment of the property: \"From the top leadership to the execution staff, Novotel Hyderabad Airport is an utter mess. Given its proximity to the airport, at best, it functions as an upgraded airport lodge, but it offers little more than that. For luxury travelers, it\\'s best to temper your expectations. This property is far from delivering the service you\\'d expect from a premium hotel. The less you expect, the less likely you are to be unpleasantly surprised.\" Is it time for accountability and regulation in the hospitality industry? The situation at Novotel Hyderabad Airport highlights broader issues within the hospitality sector in India, including unchecked dynamic pricing, poor service quality, and a lack of responsiveness from management. This experience has left many wondering if it\\'s time for regulatory intervention to protect consumers from exploitative practices and to hold hotels accountable for the quality of service they promise but fail to deliver.

Tourism experts suggest that while supply and demand dynamics are natural, such exorbitant hikes can turn away potential guests and create an unpleasant experience for travelers.\\n\\nAhmedabad’s hospitality sector, while benefiting from the influx of concertgoers, also faces challenges in managing this sudden and significant increase in demand. Local businesses are optimistic about the revenue but are wary of the long-term effects of alienating customers with prices that many deem excessive.\\n\\nFor those who were hoping to attend Coldplay’s concert in Ahmedabad, the cost of accommodation has become a serious barrier. The huge gap between the initial booking price and the skyrocketing rates has left many fans questioning the fairness of these practices. For others, the sudden price jump has forced them to cancel or reconsider their trip.\\n\\nIn addition to the room rates, fans are also expressing concern over booking cancellations, which are becoming more frequent as the hotel industry adapts to the changing demands.

But now, that land of tribal martyrs is in danger because of illegal infiltrators who were grabbing land and playing with the honour of tribal women,” he said.\\nThe BJP leader said adivasis became minorities in several villages in the Santhal Pargana region, including that of martyrs Sidho and Kanhu in Dumka’s Bhognadih. “It is a now or never situation. So, it is not an ordinary election, not to elect a new government, but an election for Mati, Beti and Roti which are at stake due to illegal infiltration,” he said.\\nHe said at the age of 15, Birsa Munda had sought the blessings of his mother to fight the forces engaged in grabbing tribal land, plights and atrocities committed on the community. Born in 1875 in present-day Jharkhand, Munda had challenged British rule and is credited with mobilising tribals against the empire. He died in British custody at the age of 25 years.\\nReferring to Mir’s promise to give LPG cylinders at Rs 450 to even “infiltrators”, Chouhan stressed that it indicated the ruling coalition’s admission about the presence of infiltrators in the state and they were being patronised by the Congress and JMM.\\n“They have been blaming BJP for playing divisive politics but the fact was admitted by none other than Congress’ in charge of Jharkhand,” he said.\\nHe said he regretted that Mir’s statement — made on Thursday (November 14) — was not yet condemned or denied by Congress leaders such as Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and its president Mallikarjun Kharge. No action was taken against infiltrators though the Special Branch had issued a circular cautioning the police about their activities, he alleged.\\nThe Union minister alleged that leaders of the ruling coalition help the infiltrators from Bangladesh get government documents such as Aadhaar and voter cards as they use the foreigners as their vote bank, he claimed.\\n“Are they not traitors? Is patronising and providing facilities to infiltrators a Congress agenda? Do they have rights to our mineral reserves? Did the Congress and JMM strike a deal with infiltrators to grab tribal land and play with the honour of tribal women?” he asked, adding that they should make their stand clear.\\nHe expressed concerns over the “fast-changing” demography and “depleting” tribal population as part of the BJP’s major poll plank infiltration in Santhal Pargana region. He alleged that the population of adivasis in Santhal Pargana has dwindled to 28 per cent as per government record from 44 per cent, while the situation was nothing different in Pakur and Sahibganj districts, where infiltrators became majority in dozens of villages.\\n“If we do not stand by adivasis and moolvasis (non-tribal natives) today, the situation will turn grave. The situation is like ‘Abhi nahin, toh kabhi nahin’ (It is now or never),” he said.\\nDozens of villages in Santhal Pargana is now known as “jamai tola” as the infiltrators marry tribal women, encourage them to contest panchayat polls and grab panchayat bodies once these women win, he said. “We will enact a law and take back Adivasi land grabbed by the infiltrators,” he said.\\n(With PTI inputs)', 'summary': 'Like PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, Union minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also said Bangladeshi \"infiltrators\" were the vote bank of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha coalition', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/elections/jharkhand-polls-maati-beti-roti-bangladeshi-infiltrators-illegal-immigration-shivraj-singh-chouhan-jmm-congress-9121932.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/10/several-senior-doctors-who-have-been-at-the-protest-site-since-saturday-night-are-also-planning-to-join-their-junior-counterparts-in-the-hunger-strike.-7-2024-10-9e9d8f603b7bb6e831ff704da718430b-16x9.jpg?i', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 14:48:25', 'author': 'News18,Oindrila Mukherjee', 'authors': ['News18', 'Oindrila Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.391}, {'id': 265032722, 'title': 'My Story: ‘How My Parents Helped Me Overcome Drug Abuse’', 'text': 'When I was just nine years old, my world began to unravel. My parents, once a solid foundation in my life, started drifting apart. In an attempt to shield me from the tension, they sent me to live with my grandparents. It was a difficult time, and I found solace in my studies at Poddar for two years before being moved to a boarding school at the age of eleven. I hated it there. I was a closed-off child, struggling to fit in, and the loneliness was suffocating. The only thing that brought me joy was music. Yet, after a painful audition at school where I faced rejection, I buried that passion deep within me, vowing never to try again.\\n\\nEventually, I returned to Bombay and enrolled in a small school with just six students in my class. It felt like a fresh start, but one fateful day changed everything. During a school event, I stole some money from a drawer and crossed the road to buy my first beer. That moment marked the beginning of a downward spiral. I began stealing from home as well, and soon it escalated. When I reached college, the newfound freedom overwhelmed me. My friends and I would spend our days drinking at a pub across from Nationals. To fund my drinking habit, I resorted to stealing larger amounts from my mother.\\n\\nI got caught multiple times and was sent to see a therapist. For a while, I managed to stay clean, but it didn’t last long. I found myself drinking alone and stealing more frequently. When my father remarried, I stole my stepmother’s jewellery and sold it for next to nothing—only to be caught again. My parents tried to regain control of my life by removing me from college, but by then it felt too late; I had already begun experimenting with drugs.\\n\\nAs time passed, my drug use escalated from smoking weed with older college students to taking anti-epileptic tablets. What started as half a pill turned into an insatiable need for 30 pills a day. Eventually, I turned to cough syrup containing opium—and that’s when I truly became hooked.\\n\\nDuring this chaotic period, my mother stopped giving me extra money. Desperate for cash, I dropped out of college at eighteen and found a job. I had a girlfriend who cared deeply for me and tried tirelessly to pull me away from this dark path, but her efforts were futile. Music was still in my life; I was part of a band until drugs forced me out of it too. My mother remarried and moved to Dubai while I remained in Bombay as a paying guest. My addiction led to being thrown out of three different PGs due to stealing and drug abuse.\\n\\nAt twenty-one, I hit rock bottom. My mother flew down from Dubai one day and pleaded with me to check into a rehabilitation centre. Reluctantly, I agreed and enrolled in a facility just outside Bombay—a decision that would change everything for me. For fifteen months, I was given the freedom to write and explore my passions again. It was there that songwriting became my lifeline.\\n\\nReturning to Bombay after rehab was daunting; fear loomed over me like a dark cloud. For the first year back, I poured all my energy into work. I earned a diploma in Sound Engineering and worked with Channel V and Web 18 while nurturing my music career on the side.\\n\\nAfter years of hard work and sending out demos relentlessly, I finally had my breakthrough—I got the chance to sing two songs for a movie! Since then, there’s been no looking back.\\n\\nNow, after 13 and a half years of sobriety, I can say it has transformed my life completely. Sobriety is the reason for my happiness today; it fills me with gratitude for the family who stood by me through thick and thin—especially when loving me was incredibly difficult.\\n\\nToday, I’m living my dream as a musician and am engaged to the woman of my dreams—someone who embraces my past without judgment but instead offers unconditional love.\\n\\nMy message? Drugs are not cool; dependency can destroy your life. It’s never too late to turn things around—don’t worry about what others think because those who truly love you will be there no matter what. That love is all you really need on your journey back to yourself.\\n\\nIf you, too, have an inspiring story to tell the world, send us your story at mystory@5w1h.media', 'summary': \"My journey from addiction to recovery was shaped by my parents' unwavering support and love.\", 'url': 'https://thelogicalindian.com/my-story/my-story-how-my-parents-helped-me-overcome-drug-abuse/', 'image': 'https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Social-Thumbnail-Template_20241115_194925_0000.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 14:21:04', 'author': 'News Desk', 'authors': ['News Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.474}, {'id': 265023544, 'title': 'Al-Ghassani: Postponing the eighth round of the league championship is in the national team’s interest', 'text': 'The national football team player, Yahya Al-Ghassani, praised the great solidarity that “Al-Abyad” found in the past days before the match with Kyrgyzstan, explaining that its result was the postponement of the matches of the eighth round of the ADNOC Professional League Championship, which was in the national team’s interest by giving coach Paulo Pinto a longer opportunity to compete.

The new genus was described by V.K. Anoop and Rajeev Raghavan, of Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean studies (Kufos), and Neelesh Dahanukar, of Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi.\\r\\n\\nThe research published in the leading international taxonomy journal Zootaxa points out that the Western Ghats’ endemic loach diversity remains largely unexplored and a taxonomic investigation using integrated approaches could uncover new species and genera within this biogeographic region.\\r\\n\\nThe family Nemacheilidae includes a diverse group of freshwater fish found mostly in tropical Asia and Europe and many species are valued both as a food source for local communities and as popular ornamental fish. According to the researchers, “understanding ‘species boundaries’ in closely related Nemacheilid species has been a long-term challenge, given their small size, complex ontogenic colour variations, and morphological plasticity.” They say Koima is distinguished from all other genera of family Nemacheilidae by its “unique colour pattern comprising a yellowish-brown ground colour, single row of black spots on lateral line, all fins hyaline, and absence of a uniform banding pattern on dorsal side.” \\r\\n\\nThe study employed an integrative approach to re-evaluate the taxonomic status of two enigmatic nemacheilid loaches of the Southern Western Ghats: Mesonoemacheilus remadevii and Nemacheilus monilis.

Those in urban areas are drawn to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s influence and development agenda, while rural communities wrestle with the harsh realities of rising costs, inadequate minimum standard prices for farm produce, and divisive rhetoric. \\n\\nAlso Read: Why is there widespread discontent in Maharashtra?\\n\\nThe differences between rural and urban priorities underscores a central tension in the State’s political arena, forcing the ruling Mahayuti and the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi alliances to tackle contrasting demands. How they straddle the divide may prove decisive in shaping the election’s outcome. \\n\\nThere are the six core issues dominating voters’ minds in the countdown to polling on November 20: Mr. Modi’s popularity, Hindutva, hate speech, inflation, unemployment, and the farmers’ crisis. The ruling Mahayuti’s flagship scheme providing fiscal assistance for women, the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, has also become the focus of debate. Many voters are questioning the timing of the scheme, which was introduced just ahead of the election, while others simply appreciate the financial aid. \\n\\nPM’s charisma\\n\\nPolitical observers believe that Mr. Modi’s charisma continues to play a role in swaying urban voters who view him as a transformative leader. His image resonates strongly in the major cities, especially in Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur, as well as in towns where infrastructure projects and economic reforms are seen as symbols of stability. “For many in the cities, PM Modi represents progress. They’re talking about infrastructure projects, especially Atal Setu, Coastal Road in Mumbai, among other development projects,” says Mumbai-based senior journalist and political observer, Abhay Deshpande, says.\\n\\nThis appeal intertwines with the ideology of Hindutva, which has significant traction among urban voters who see it as a unifying identity, although it often diverts focus from economic realities, he said.\\n\\nMiddle-class and upper-middle-class voters in urban centres are focusing on Modi’s persona rather than on inflation and other pressing issues due to “aggressive campaigning” by the ruling Mahayuti, says political critic Prof. Surendra Jondhale. “There’s a dichotomy of perception among rural and urban voters in receiving the aggressive electioneering propaganda from the MahaYuti leaders. Urban voters are drawn to Modi and in some areas Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s image, while rural voters are dealing with very different issues,” he said.\\n\\nIn regions such as Marathwada, Konkan, and parts of north Maharashtra, Mr. Shinde’s popularity is also proving influential, particularly in areas where the BJP struggles to gain traction due to issues like Maratha reservation. \\n\\nUnsustainable farming\\n\\nIn contrast, rural voters, especially farmers and agricultural labourers, have more pressing economic concerns. Inflation is driving up the costs of essentials, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) imposed on fertilisers is stretching farmers’ already thin margins. Many voters in the rural heartland are vocal about the need for better MSPs and relief from rising input costs. “Modi’s government talks about development, but we’re just seeing higher prices and less support,” says Karunakar Lihitka, a cotton and soybean farmer from Bhambora in Yavatmal district. “Farming is becoming unsustainable. To break even, we need ₹10,000 per quintal for cotton, compared to the current ₹6,700, and ₹7,000 for soybean against the current price of around ₹3,600,” he said.\\n\\nOpposition parties have seized on these issues, attacking the BJP for its “anti-farmer” policies. “For rural voters, it’s all about survival. Farmers deserve fair prices, relief from GST, and policies that support rural livelihoods, not empty promises. The rising inflation is a burden,” said Congress MLA Vijay Wadettiwar, the Leader of the Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. Critics believe that inflation will play a pivotal role in the voting choice of rural communities. \\n\\nJob scarcity\\n\\nUnemployment is a major concern in both rural and urban areas, albeit with different impacts. In the cities, a lack of job opportunities has frustrated many young people. “The government promised growth and jobs, but we’re not seeing it. I applied to over a dozen jobs, but most companies say the market is tight,” said Aditya Dabadgoankar, a recent graduate from Beed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, rural unemployment pushes many to migrate to urban areas, where job markets are crowded and living costs high. “Our farms can’t support us, so we have to leave, but city life offers little stability,” said Lakhan Jadav from Tiwasala in Yavatmal, a BA graduate working in a private company. His friend, Dhanraj Jadav, echoed the sentiment, stating that he had abandoned his job search for farming, which also yields minimal profits.\\n\\nAccording to Prof. Jondhale, the lack of jobs and internal migration within Maharashtra are fuelling the Maratha agitation. “Job scarcity is a primary reason for the unrest. Migration within the State is increasingly visible,” he observed. \\n\\nIdeology vs economy\\n\\nHate speech and the Hindutva narrative is a particularly contentious issue, with voters expressing concerns over its divisive effects. In rural areas, the fear is that such rhetoric threatens the harmony within diverse communities. “We’ve always lived together peacefully, but now this hate is tearing us apart. Though we often tell people not to take the statements of politicians seriously, as such speeches are delivered only during the election season,” said Kasiram Kanake from Chandrapur. \\n\\nPolitical observers see this election as a test of whether ideological loyalty and leaders’ images can outweigh economic realities. “The verdict will reveal which issues resonate most with voters,” said Mr. Deshpande. “It’s shaping up to be an interesting and unpredictable election.”', 'summary': 'Political observers see this election as a test of whether ideological loyalty and leaders’ images can outweigh economic realities; both urban and rural voters worried about the impact of unemployment', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/elections/maharashtra-assembly/high-prices-farm-distress-are-top-issues-for-maharashtras-rural-voters-but-city-dwellers-impressed-by-pms-agenda/article68867214.ece', 'image': 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ja1q29/article68872709.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/11908_14_11_2024_21_8_14_1_DSC_8082.JPEG', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 14:11:06', 'author': 'Abhinay Deshpande', 'authors': ['Abhinay Deshpande'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.489}, {'id': 265025786, 'title': 'Chief Minister Omar Abdullah Calls On FM Nirmala Sitharaman', 'text': 'New Delhi, Nov 15: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Friday called on Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman.\\n“Called on Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt.

This requires you to consider several factors before you initiate a trade. This week, we discuss the factor that should kick-start your trading decision: which underlying to trade?\\n\\nRelative signals\\n\\nThere are several ways to determine which underlying you should trade. Suppose you decide to initiate a long position. Of the ones you shortlist, you can choose the underlying that shows the best breakout. This could be a decisive candle: a green colour candle that has a decent size body with a close at or near the day’s high. To further determine the relative strength of the underlying’s breakout, you can observe how strong the bulls are at the breakout point. One way to determine this is to look at how bulls fared on the way to the breakout price. The lesser number of consecutive green candles on the last leg before the breakout price, the better; for this indicates that the bulls are conserving their capital to drive the price after the breakout.\\n\\nAlternatively, you could use the Relative Rotation Graph® (RRG). The RRG was created by Julius de Kempenaer to determine the trend and momentum in various sectors. Kempenaer divided the graph into four quadrants: leading, weakening, lagging and improving. Note that leading occupies top right quadrant and lagging, the bottom left quadrant. Through extensive research and analysis, Kempenaer found that sectors rotate continually between these quadrants. Suffice it to understand that you want to initiate a long position in a sector that is moving into the leading quadrant. To do this, you should observe the squiggly line graphs that point upwards and move into the leading quadrant (moving Northeast). Note that the sectors are benchmarked to the index to which they belong.\\n\\nAt this point, you have two choices. You could take sector bets if futures are available on these indices. Otherwise, you must switch to the granular level: look at constituent stocks in the sector. The rules that we discussed above for the sector applies to individual stocks too. So, you should select a stock that is moving into the leading quadrant. You can then initiate a long futures position on this stock. \\n\\nOptional Reading\\n\\nThe decisive breakout candle rule will allow you to initiate a trade as a reaction to the break-out. The RRG will offer entry into a trade at an early stage of the momentum. Both have their associated risks. You may have to enter a break-out trade at a price well above the break-out level. This could expose your capital to high risk, as the stop-loss is likely to be below the break-out price. Also, there is a possibility of a false breakout. Likewise, the RRG may take a sharp turn and head downwards into the weakening or lagging quadrant after you initiate a long position.

This initiative is couched in terms of increasing insecurity for women in many places, including fitness facilities and salons. According to Himani Agarwal a member of the Commission, this proposal is a result of preventing ‘bad touch’ plus any form of uncomfortable conduct emanating from male employees in these lines of work. Even if the purpose is to protect, it opens up very important questions of gender bias and the economic consequences.\\n\\nAs much as this proposal seems to have been designed to offer a protective impulse, it has monumental questions that surround it. Its advocates suggest that such measures reveal an orthodox thinking that does not eradicate harassment permanently; rather, it changes the focus from men, the offenders to women, the victims by legally confining and regulating their freedom. Such a practice is dangerous as it displaces gender segregation in the workplace instead of fighting it as necessary for safety in other fields of work.\\n\\nEconomic implications for male tailors \\n\\nThe business consequences of this proposal cannot be emphasised on enough. In Uttar Pradesh, where men are so dominant in the profession of tailoring this decision may actually put in danger the jobs of so many men who are into this profession. Most tailors depend on their trade to earn a living for their families, and denying them a good percentage of their likely customers frost the family’s sustenance. \\n\\nBesides, this suggestion here can be viewed as a thrust towards the reduction in the quality of women’s clothes in the market. Due to the scarcity of female tailors as compared to male tailors, ladies may afford to be serviced by male operators in a customised manner. It can also denote a possibility of a decrease in competition and therefore the prices for the said services may increase making women’s choice and autonomy even more limited.\\n\\nSewing is not simply work; it is work that has been inherited through generations for many people. This change in policy may well undermine these traditional practices and lead to many tailors either being unworked or under-worked. Also, it leads to questions to how such policy will be implemented or if the policy will ensure that the affected will be given other sources of employment.\\n\\nGender stereotypes in professional proposals\\n\\nWomen have over the years demanded and struggled to be given equal opportunities as men in different capacities in society. The proposal also raises another discursive question concerning the gender issues in the Indian society. This promotes the perception that men are inherently predatory to women — a mindset that as a society will only reinforce instead of eradicating misogyny. Strict gender segregation at the workplace should not be a priority because what is required is training on respect and consent between the genders.\\n\\nMoreover, such measures might stimulate the creation of the climate by which men would feel uncomfortable or unwanted in the occupations that have been considered feminine. That means, for example, there is a clear threat that these industries will lose a number of talented queer individuals. \\n\\nHowever, there is fear that such policies extend creation of a gender divide where people work, not with the purpose of merging outputs or coming up with common goals of a team, but with the desire of fighting for a cause of their gender. Policies that are intended to increase women’s protective factors, should, in a perfect world, contain strategies that involve men as supporters and not as hazards.\\n\\nThe role of education, awareness and gender sensitisation\\n\\nIn order to tackle matters of harassment meaningfully education and awareness is crucial. These programmes may reach out to women as well as men in order to help them define and appreciate the degree of professionalism in workplaces. In place of restricting the gender in the enclosed professions such as tailoring or beauty services, appropriate measures could be taken through sensitisation programmes through training of service providers on appropriate conduct with clients.\\n\\nMoreover, when the commission recommends installing CCTV cameras in salons or tailoring shops, it will discourage inappropriate touch and can be a good method to avoid improper conduct without closing the shops of men. These measures would enable women to feel safe and at the same time have equal access to professional services regardless the gender of the service providers.\\n\\nNavigating safety and autonomy\\n\\nThis case put forward by the Uttar Pradesh State Women’s Commission is interestingly on the cross section of safety and economy. Although used with the purpose of preventing women from being harassed it at the same time poses a threat to their self-organisation and threatens job positions in the sphere of tailoring. \\n\\nThus, it should be significant for policymakers to take into consideration, not only the most exemplary actions for women’s safety at the moment but also the long-sighted measures for women’s protection without limiting their possibilities and putting pressure on male employees. Talking to and including all the participants, women who need given services, male tailors, community representatives, etc., will become crucial in shaping policies that would indeed make services safer without violating individuals’ rights.\\n\\nLast of all, any effort being made to increase safety of women should combine protective mechanisms with regard to agency and rationality, coupled with economic outcomes. Thus, the security concerns as well as pragmatic approaches should be implemented for the creation of circumstances that can treat all women and men equally and without limitations.\\n\\nThis is especially important to highlight the fact that these issues are best handled through multiple layered and nuanced approaches rather than through simplistic hasty approaches that may harm women but also seek to deny them their right to choose whom to interact with within a professional context.', 'summary': \"The recent suggestion in Uttar Pradesh that male tailors should not be allowed to stitch a woman's dress has spurred a great uproar.\\n\\n\\nThe post Uttar Pradesh&#8217;s Proposal To Restrict Male Tailors: A Threat To Livelihoods And Gender Equality appeared first on Feminism in India.\", 'url': 'https://feminisminindia.com/2024/11/15/uttar-pradeshs-proposal-to-restrict-male-tailors-a-threat-to-livelihoods-and-gender-equality/', 'image': 'https://feminisminindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/october-2024-11-08T132028.207.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 00:35:00', 'author': 'Ainee Ilyas', 'authors': ['Ainee Ilyas'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.162}, {'id': 265022434, 'title': 'India’s Highest Airfield at Mudh-Nyoma Nears Completion Under Indian Army’s Project Himank', 'text': 'Ladakh, India — The Indian Army’s Project Himank has reached a significant milestone with the near-completion of India’s highest airfield at Mudh-Nyoma in Ladakh, close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. Brigadier Vishal Srivastava, Chief Engineer of Project Himank, announced that the airfield is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year, underscoring India’s commitment to bolstering its strategic infrastructure in the region.At an altitude of 13,700 feet, the Mudh-Nyoma airfield has been developed to handle heavy military aircraft, including fighter jets, transport planes, and rotary-wing helicopters, making it one of the most formidable aviation hubs in high-altitude warfare. Brigadier Srivastava noted, \"As far as the runway is concerned, it is almost complete. Final touches are being applied, and a joint inspection with the Indian Air Force is scheduled soon. We are optimistic about conducting trial landings by year-end.” Boosting Strategic and Socio-Economic Potential The construction of this high-altitude airfield is a critical development for India’s military readiness and socio-economic landscape in the remote region. The advanced facility, designed to support India’s heaviest military aircraft, will provide enhanced logistical and rapid response capabilities along the LAC, bolstering national security in an area known for its rugged terrain and strategic sensitivity.Brigadier Srivastava emphasized the local impact, explaining, “This runway will significantly aid not only in terms of military operations but also in boosting the socio-economic conditions of nearby regions, including Hanley, Loma, and Nyoma.” He highlighted that the airfield’s construction aligns with Project Himank’s broader goal of supporting communities through improved infrastructure. Record-Breaking Construction The airfield’s completion underlines the use of state-of-the-art technology and innovative construction practices adapted to the harsh high-altitude conditions of Ladakh. Temperatures in the region drop to as low as -35 degrees Celsius in winter, limiting the working season to a brief period between May and November. Despite this constraint, the airfield was completed at a record pace, with modern machinery, specialized cold-setting compounds, and quality-control additives ensuring that the construction adhered to stringent standards.“The foundation stone for this runway was laid by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on August 23, and within a remarkably short timeframe, we are ready for trial operations,” Brigadier Srivastava noted. “This is the highest runway in India, built with the latest construction technologies to withstand the extreme weather, with no compromise on quality or speed.” Enhancing Military Capabilities Against China The new airfield’s operational readiness will further strengthen India’s defence posture in Ladakh, an area marked by strategic importance and a history of tensions with China. Recently, India and China reached a disengagement agreement in Eastern Ladakh’s Depsang and Demchok sectors following extensive discussions across military and diplomatic channels. The completion of the Mudh-Nyoma airfield marks India’s proactive approach to maintaining readiness and strengthening infrastructure along its contested borders. This airfield will join the network of strategically placed airfields, roads, and installations in the northern frontier, offering both defensive and operational advantages. The Mudh-Nyoma facility is anticipated to support swift troop and equipment movement, aiding in rapid response and reconnaissance capabilities.', 'summary': 'India’s Highest Airfield at Mudh-Nyoma Nears Completion Under Indian Army’s Project Himank', 'url': 'https://www.republicworld.com/defence/indian-armed-forces/indias-highest-airfield-at-mudh-nyoma-nears-completion-under-indian-armys-project-himank', 'image': 'https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/mudh-nyoma-airfield-1731659123881-9_16.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-15 08:25:29', 'author': 'Yuvraj Tyagi', 'authors': ['Yuvraj Tyagi'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.271}, {'id': 265022436, 'title': 'Indian and Australian Armies Enter 48-Hour Validation Exercise to Cap Off AUSTRAHIND 2024 in Pune', 'text': \"TCF vendors\\n\\nExponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: Device identifiers, Probabilistic identifiers, Non-precise location data, IP addresses, Users’ profiles, Privacy choices, Browsing and interaction datamoreCookie duration resets each session.

Founded in 2001, the Horizon Group has a proven track record in post-conflict environment management, having cleared over 125 million square meters of land contaminated by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) in countries such as Sri Lanka, Jordan, Azerbaijan, and Kuwait. To date, the group has safely disposed of more than 150,000 hazardous devices. These efforts underscore India’s commitment to fostering global peace, safety, and stability. India’s involvement in mine action began with operations in Sri Lanka in 2003 and continues today through significant contributions to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Horizon’s extensive work in various regions highlights the nation’s global humanitarian outlook and its commitment to creating a world free from the remnants of war. Key Highlights of the Symposium The symposium, supported by think tanks India Council of World Affairs (ICWA) and Center for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), featured insightful panel discussions, expert addresses, and a showcase of cutting-edge demining technologies.

Keynote Address by Col. Navneet M.P. Mittal: The Chairman and Co-founder of the Horizon Group, and a pioneer in humanitarian demining in India, shared insights on the evolution of mine action, global trends, and future strategies. Panel Discussions: Experts engaged in two panels: one on the global scenario in mine action, and the other on India’s roadmap for advancing mine action initiatives. Technological Showcase: The exhibition demonstrated advanced tools and technologies in demining, offering a glimpse into India’s innovative approach to post-conflict recovery. Humanitarian and Socioeconomic Impact The symposium underscored the humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges of mine action, including: Assisting victims and rehabilitating affected communities. Addressing environmental risks and ensuring infrastructure development. Strengthening international collaborations to bolster humanitarian efforts. Experts highlighted the critical need for public awareness, investment in research and development, and international cooperation to achieve long-term stability in conflict-affected regions. India’s Role and Future InitiativesIndia’s contributions to mine action through UN peacekeeping operations, combined with Horizon’s initiatives, reflect the nation’s commitment to global safety and sustainable development. The symposium provided a platform to advance India’s leadership role in humanitarian demining, laying the groundwork for future global collaborations.Founded in 2001 by senior retired Indian Army officers, the Horizon Group is committed to post-conflict environment management and humanitarian mine action.
