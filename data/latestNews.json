There\u2019s no reason to celebrate it; it\u2019s a day for officials and bureaucracy. From this day, the destruction of Jammu and Kashmir began.

In the country\u2019s southeast, April-October rainfall has decreased by nine per cent since 1994.\n\n\u201cThe lower rainfall in the cooler months is leading to lower average streamflow in those regions, which can impact soil moisture and water storage levels and increase the risk of drought. Droughts this century have been significantly hotter than those in the past,\u201d Braganza said.\n\n\u201cHowever, when heavy rainfall events occur, they are becoming more intense, with an increase of around 10 per cent or more in some regions,\u201d Braganza said.\n\nThe highest rate of ocean warming in Australia has occurred in the Coral Sea, home to the iconic Great Barrier Reef, and off the coasts of the southeast Australian mainland and the southern island state of Tasmania.",

One thing that was always common was he wanted people to be happy after watching his movies and that\u2019s why he chose Diwali or may be Diwali chose him when all his films came out.\u201d It goes without saying that success of Yash Chopra\u2019s films during this period paved the way for other filmmakers to view Diwali as an ideal window for releasing their projects.\r\n\r\nThis year, Rohit Shetty\u2019s highly-awaited cop drama \u201cSingham Again\u201d and T-Series\u2019 horror-comedy \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d will clash at the box-office on Diwali. \u201cSingham Again\u201d stars Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Arjun Kapoor, Tiger Shroff, and Jackie Shroff. On the other hand, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d, co-written and directed by Anees Bazmee, stars Kartik Aaryan, Vidya Balan, Triptii Dimri, Madhuri Dixit, Vijay Raaz, Rajpal Yadav, and Sanjay Mishra. Both movies will lock horns on November 1.",

        "text": "Andhra Pradesh Congress chief YS Sharmila Reddy on Friday travelled on Road Transport Bus and took a dig at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, saying \u201cwomen across the state are asking when the free bus travel will be implemented\u201d.The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Jana Sena Party in their manifesto for Andhra Pradesh elections earlier this year had promised free bus travel for women. YS Sharmila Reddy took a ticket and travelled on a \u2018Pallevelugu\u2019 RTC bus from Vijayawada Bus Stand to Tenali on Friday as part of her outreach efforts.This initiative aims to connect with the public and engage directly with constituents in the region.She has written a postcard to Chandrababu Naidu, demanding the immediate implementation of the poll promise of TDP. The state Congress chief said Chandrababu Naidu has been in power for four months, yet no decision has been made on free bus travel for women.\u201cWomen across the state are asking when the free bus travel will be implemented. In Telangana, the scheme was implemented within a week. Why is the delay in Andhra Pradesh? Is it because the government fears they\u2019ll need to fund RTC (Road Transport Corporation)?\u201dShe said that around two million women travel daily in the state.\u201cThe RTC earns Rs 7 crore daily through these women. Are you afraid of compensating RTC with these Rs 300 crore if free travel is granted? You took votes from women and promised this benefit. Now, can\u2019t you spend Rs 300 crore for them? Four out of your six key promises were for women, and free bus travel is the least expensive among them. If such a low-cost scheme cannot be implemented, how will larger promises be fulfilled? Will you delay for the next five years?\u201d she asked.The Congress leader said that free bus travel ensures the safety of women, and many women would depend on buses if this scheme is implemented. \u201cThis is a very beneficial scheme, and we are demanding that Chandrababu Naidu immediately implement it. Similarly, other schemes promised to women must also be implemented without delay. Provide free gas cylinders to women as promised. Prices of essential commodities have already increased, adding to the burden on women. Women need support and assurance and steps must be taken to improve their safety,\u201d she said.\u201cThe government has reduced alcohol prices which could lead to an increase in crimes against women. We are sending a letter to the Chief Minister, demanding free bus travel for women. In the coming days, we will send thousands of postcards. We hope this will prompt Chandrababu Naidu to immediately implement free bus travel for women,\u201d she added",

        "title": "Takes away their choice of partner; violates their rights: SC urges Parliament to outlaw child betrothals",
        "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday, while stating that marriages fixed in the minority of a child have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, said that Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006.A bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said child betrothal takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency.\u201cWe note that while the PCMA seeks to prohibit child marriages, it does not stipulate on betrothals. Marriages fixed in the minority of a child also have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood. It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under the PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the Juvenile Justice Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,\u201d the apex court said.Delivering a judgement on a PIL alleging a rise in child marriages in the country, the apex court issued a slew of guidelines for achieving the elimination of child marriage while bearing in mind the delicate socio-economic interplay.The judgement came on a PIL by the Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action, saying that despite the enactment of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, the rate of child marriages in India is alarming and highlighted the failure of authorities to prevent child marriages.The top court in its verdict emphasised the need for more comprehensive approaches and community-driven strategies to ensure the complete eradication of child marriages.The PCMA as social legislation will only succeed through the collective efforts of all stakeholders to address the issue within a broader social framework that emphasises the need for multi-sectoral coordination, the verdict stated.\u201cThis necessitates the enhancement of reporting mechanisms, expansion of public awareness campaigns, and investment in the training and capacity-building of law enforcement officers and related actors. It is also crucial to regularly monitor the implementation of the Act, conduct evaluations to identify gaps, and establish feedback mechanisms to continually refine and improve responses to child marriage,\u201d it added.The apex court said that it framed the guidelines for the effective and useful implementation of the PCMA and the orientation of these guidelines is to prioritise prevention before protection and protection before penalisation.It said the focus of penalisation reflects on a harm-based approach, which has been proven ineffective and the guidelines issued by the top court are on awareness campaigns, funding campaigns, community involvement, education, social support, etc.\u201cWe are cognizant of the impact that criminalisation has on families and communities. To ensure effective use of penal provisions in the PCMA, there must be widespread awareness and education about child marriage and the legal consequences of its commission. We must not be understood to discourage prosecution of those who commit illegal acts. However, the aim of the law enforcement machinery must not be solely focused on increasing prosecutions without making the best efforts to prevent and prohibit child marriage. The focus on penalisation reflects a harm-based approach that waits for harm to occur before taking any steps. This approach has proven to be ineffective at bringing about social change,\u201d it added.The 141-page judgement said that addressing child marriage requires an intersectional approach that acknowledges the overlapping vulnerabilities experienced by children, especially girls from marginalised communities.\u201cIntersectionality involves considering factors like gender, caste, socioeconomic status, and geography, which often increase the risks of early marriage. Preventive strategies should therefore be tailored to the unique needs of various communities and focus on addressing the root causes of child marriage, such as poverty, gender inequality, lack of education, and entrenched cultural practices,\u201d it stated.It further said that state governments also must monitor and enforce compliance with these laws and work closely with civil society organisations to implement effective interventions.The top court further said that the state\u2019s role is not limited to merely punishing offenders but extends to creating an enabling environment where children can exercise their rights freely.\u201cThis includes the responsibility to not only to legislate against child marriage but also to address the underlying socio-economic factors\u2013poverty, lack of education, and gender discrimination\u2013that perpetuate this practice,\u201d added the verdict.It further stressed that the right to childhood belongs to all sexes. \u201cEducation\u2013primary, sexual and life-enhancing\u2013is integral to the right to childhood. Realisation of this right is crucial in dealing with the evils of child marriage,\u201d stated the judgement",

        "text": "The government in Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan (PoGB) has consistently overlooked the pressing issues and concerns of its residents, as reported by Pamir Times. Currently, the population is grappling with alarming problems, including dire health and sanitation conditions. As a result, many lives have been lost to diseases like rabies and dengue, highlighting the ineffectiveness of the administration, according to Pamir Times.The healthcare situation in PoGB is increasingly concerning, characterized by inadequate infrastructure, a shortage of medical staff, and severe water scarcity. Despite repeated calls for improvements, the Pakistani government has continually ignored these problems, leaving people to suffer or, in the worst cases, die, Pamir Times reported.The recent spike in cases of rabies and deliberate dog attacks on locals have further underscored the incompetence of the Pakistani administration, resulting in tragic losses of life.In response to these concerns, a Medical Superintendent told Pamir Times, \u201cThe cases of dog bites are on the rise in PoGB, and several deaths have already been reported. Rabies infection, if untreated, can also be fatal. I urge pet owners to vaccinate their animals and keep them from roaming freely. Additionally, I request parents to keep their children at home, as there is a risk of attacks if they go outside, which could potentially lead to rabies.\u201dThe rising cases of rabies and dengue fever in PoGB present a significant challenge. The deprivation of basic necessities such as clean drinking water and proper sanitation, coupled with poor healthcare services, a lack of essential supplies, and the absence of modern medical equipment, has not only led to inadequate treatment but has also worsened the situation for the local population without substantial improvements in healthcare and environmental management, the ongoing health crisis in PoGB is likely to escalate further.Imtiaz Ahmed, a doctor in Chilas, told Pamir Times, \u201cI have been working in the hospital for the past four years. There has been an outbreak of dengue, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, with cases increasing rapidly. In our hospital alone, more than a hundred cases have been reported in just the span of two to three weeks.\u201dThe local administration\u2019s failure to address rising health concerns and provide basic necessities in PoGB exposes both corruption and ineptitude. Their inaction on critical issues such as healthcare, clean water, and sanitation has left the population vulnerable to serious diseases like rabies and dengue.",

        "text": "England captain Ben Stokes expressed his thoughts on the team\u2019s approach and the missed opportunities in their loss to Pakistan by 152 runs in the second Test in Multan. Speaking after the match, Stokes defended his team\u2019s strategy and highlighted the challenges posed in the game.When asked if England could have changed their approach slightly, Stokes responded firmly, \u201cNo, not at all. If you look throughout the Test match, the guys who had success from our side and Pakistan\u2019s side were the ones who put the spin bowlers under pressure. Ben Duckett\u2019s first innings hundred showed us the way. The sweep shots made it very difficult to control the run-rate and set fields to. When you get extreme conditions like that, you got to find a way to negate that spin which we managed to do in some good parts, but we\u2019d have liked to go on, especially myself and a couple of guys who got starts.\u201dReflecting on the missed chances, particularly dropping Agha Salman twice, Stokes emphasized the importance of taking opportunities, \u201cI don\u2019t like to live by hindsight. It just proves how important taking the chances are out here. You don\u2019t get them very often behind the wickets. You take those chances, the game might look a little different.\u201dStokes also praised the efforts of his seamers, Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse, who toiled tirelessly in tough conditions, \u201cIn conditions like these, spinners will get spoken about a lot. Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse kept charging in spell after spell, ball after ball and created so much atmosphere when the spinners needed a break. That\u2019s what you want. There\u2019s a lot that we look in terms of attitude, they both certainly showed that. They constantly felt that they were a big threat which massively helps.\u201dAcknowledging the physical demands of the match, Stokes noted, \u201cGood to get through this game, worked hard to get fit for this game. Nothing can prepare you for standing in the field for as long as we did and in this heat. Looking forward to the next week now. It\u2019s been a great series so far.\u201dComing to the match, Pakistan kept a tight leash on the match after staging a comeback as they brought about a mid-order collapse for the visitors in the first innings.The resounding victory came after Pakistan lost the first Test match by an innings.England faltered in their final innings, managing only 144 runs chasing a target of 297.England resumed Day 4 with a score of 36/2, but their innings quickly unravelled. Sajid Khan struck early, dismissing Ollie Pope for 22, setting the tone for the day. The in-form Joe Root soon followed, falling to Noman Ali for 18, leaving England struggling at 55/4.Harry Brook, who previously scored a triple century on this ground in the first Test, could only muster 16 runs before being dismissed by Noman Ali. Jamie Smith was trapped for 6, marking Noman\u2019s fourth wicket of the innings.Captain Ben Stokes attempted a counter-attack, scoring a resilient 37, but his departure at 125/7 marked the beginning of the end for England. Brydon Carse (27), Jack Leach (1), and Shoaib Bashir (0) were quickly sent back to the pavilion, all falling to Noman Ali\u2019s masterful bowling.Noman Ali delivered a career-best performance in the Multan Cricket Stadium, claiming 8/46 in the second innings. His remarkable effort brought his match total to 11 wickets for 147 runs, showcasing his dominance.Sajid Khan, who took 7 wickets in England\u2019s first innings, added 2 more in the second. His pivotal role in dismantling the English batting lineup earned him the Player of the Match award.This is Pakistan\u2019s first victory at home since February 2021.The team last won a test match at home in Rawalpindi as they defeated South Africa. Pakistan have played 11 Tests on their home soil since February 2021 and four of them have resulted in a draw while they have lost eight matches.Pakistan and England will clash in the third and final Test at Rawalpindi from October 24.

This is not only an anti-Dalit decision but also a blatant anti-reservation decision,\u201d Mayawati posted on X. She further said that central BJP leadership\u2019s failure to intervene against this decision demonstrates that \u201clike the Congress\u201d, they are engaged in a conspiracy to render reservations \u201cThe fact that the central leadership of BJP did not come forward to stop the Haryana government from doing this proves that like the Congress, the BJP is also engaged in a conspiracy to first make the reservation inactive and ineffective and ultimately abolish it, which is completely unfair and the BSP is strongly opposed to it,\u201d she added. The BSP chief further underlined the BSP\u2019s commitment to combating the \u201cdivide and rule\u201d tactics employed by \u201ccasteist parties\u201d. \u201cIn reality, BSP is the name of the struggle against the divide and rule policy of casteist parties in SC-ST and OBC society and their anti-reservation conspiracy etc. Our struggle to organize and unite these classes and make them the ruling class will continue,\u201d she said. This comes after Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said the state will also implement the Supreme Court\u2019s decision empowering states to make sub-classifications within the Scheduled Castes for granting reservation \u201ctoday itself\u201d",
