        "text": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe will execute its last gravity assist with Venus, skimming just 233 miles (376 km) above the planet's surface, on November 06, 2024. This close encounter will redirect Parker onto its final trajectory, positioning it to travel within a record-breaking 3.86 million miles of the sun's surface on December 24. This approach marks the closest any human-made spacecraft has come to the sun, a landmark in space exploration.\r\n\r\nA Chance Discovery Unveils Venus's Surface\r\n\r\nAs per a recent report by NASA, Parker's earlier Venus flybys yielded unexpected discoveries about the planet. Using the Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR), scientists initially intended to observe changes in the planet's thick cloud cover. However, during the third flyby on 11 July 2020, WISPR detected near-infrared light emanating from Venus's surface, revealing details beyond the clouds. According to Noam Izenberg, a space scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, the intense surface heat\u2014around 869\u00b0F (465\u00b0C)\u2014allowed WISPR's cameras to capture Venus's hot surface below the thick cloud layers.\r\n\r\nThese new images of Venus align with radar data from NASA's earlier Magellan mission, which mapped Venus's topography between 1990 and 1994. The resemblance in patterns suggests similar landforms, yet WISPR's images showed unexpected brightness in some areas, raising questions about possible surface differences. This latest flyby is expected to provide additional insights, helping scientists determine if WISPR can identify chemical or physical variations on Venus.Shenzhou 18 Astronauts Return to Earth Post Six-Month Space Mission\r\n\r\nApproaching the Sun's Inner Mysteries\r\n\r\nFollowing the November flyby, Parker Solar Probe will head toward the sun to achieve its mission's main objective: to observe the solar atmosphere up close. As Parker closes in on the sun's surface, it will pass through regions filled with solar plasma and potentially within solar eruptions. Adam Szabo, Parker's project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, highlights this as a significant feat of engineering, as the spacecraft must endure immense heat and radiation.\r\n\r\nParker will reach its perihelion, or closest solar pass, on 24 December. The team at NASA will receive a status signal on 27 December, confirming the probe's condition post-mission. Parker's journey will continue, completing two more perihelion passes, but its Dec. 24 orbit will set an unmatched record in proximity to the sun, providing unparalleled data on our star's inner workings.\r\n\r\n\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe will make a close approach to Venus on Wednesday, marking the spacecraft's seventh and final flyby of the planet. This manoeuvre will set the probe on a course for its historic plunge toward the sun, bringing it within 3.8 million miles of our star's surface \u2014 closer than any human-made object has ventured. Nour Raouafi, Project Scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, described this approach as \u201calmost landing on a star,\u201d likening it to the significance of the 1969 moon landing.\r\n\r\nVenus Flybys as Critical Milestones\r\n\r\nThe Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, relies on gravitational assists from Venus to gradually reduce its distance from the sun, using the planet's gravitational pull to adjust its orbit. Yanping Guo, Mission Design and Navigation Manager at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, emphasised that this final Venus flyby is crucial in positioning the probe for its upcoming close encounter with the sun.\r\n\r\nWhile designed for solar exploration, the probe's instruments have provided valuable data on Venus. During previous flybys, Parker's Wide-Field Imager (WISPR) managed to capture images through Venus's thick atmosphere, revealing surface details like continents and plateaus. The probe also recorded emissions from Venus's nightside, providing insights into its surface composition and temperature, which is around 860 degrees Fahrenheit (460 Celsius).India\u2019s first Astronaut Mission Oostponed to 2026 for Safety Checks\r\n\r\nA Closer Look at Venusian Surface\r\n\r\nThis week's flyby will allow scientists to point WISPR toward Venus once more to capture new surface images, including areas with varied landforms. Noam Izenberg, a planetary geologist at APL, noted that this close approach offers a unique chance to study differences in Venus's surface features, potentially uncovering information about its geology and thermal properties.\r\n\r\nApproaching the Sun's Frontier\r\n\r\nOn December 24, the Parker Solar Probe will skim the sun's outer layer at speeds of up to 430,000 miles per hour (692,010 km/h). Although mission control will lose contact during this close pass, engineers hope to receive a signal on December 27 confirming the probe's success. This achievement could unlock significant insights into the sun's outer atmosphere, its intense heat, and its magnetic dynamics, further advancing our understanding of solar phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "title": "Lost for 47 years, Nasa reconnects with Voyager 1 spacecraft 15 billion miles away",
        "text": "Sharing a ground breaking development, Nasa recently announced re-connecting with the 47 year old long lost spacecraft Voyager 1, following years of radio silence. The spacecraft recently turned off one of its two radio transmitters and experts are currently working to uncover the cause.According to the space agency, non-essential systems on the spacecraft are switched off if it draws too much power. However, it may take the team several days or even weeks to identify the root cause that triggered the fault protection system.When NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory flight team in Southern California sends instructions to the spacecraft through the agency's Deep Space Network, Voyager 1 sends back engineering data. The team then analyzes this information to assess how the spacecraft responded to the commands.The two lone spacecraft, Voyagers 1 and 2, have been wandering in interstellar space for 47 years and are the sole two spacecraft there.The Mirror Us reported that scientists believe the transmitter shut-off was initiated by the spacecraft's fault protection system, which autonomously responds to onboard problems, however, the advanced age of these spacecraft has resulted in a rise in technical issues and new challenges for the mission engineering team. It could take days or weeks for the team to pinpoint the root cause that activated the fault protection system. When the flight team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California sends instructions to the spacecraft via the agency's Deep Space Network, Voyager 1 returns engineering data that the team evaluates to see how the spacecraft responded to the command.It takes approximately 23 hours for the command to travel more than 15 billion miles from Earth to the spacecraft, followed by another 23 hours for the data to return, according to reports from the Manchester Evening News.The flight team had issued a command to activate one of Voyager 1's heaters on October 16. Despite having sufficient power for the heater, the command activated the fault protection system on the spacecraft.The whole issue came to light when the Deep Space Network was unable to detect Voyager 1's signal on October 18. The spacecraft communicates with Earth through an X-band radio transmitter, named after its specific frequency. The flight team concluded that the protection system had reduced the transmitter's rate of sending back data as this mode uses less power from the spacecraft. However, it also changes the X-band signal that the Deep Space Network needs to detect. The signal was recorded later that day by engineers and the Voyager was reported to be stable.However, on October 19, the communication ceased completely.The flight team theorized that Voyager 1's fault protection system had been triggered twice more, turning off the X-band transmitter and switching to a second radio transmitter known as the S-band. Although the S-band uses less power, Voyager 1 hasn't used it to communicate with Earth since 1981.The flight team speculated that Voyager 1\u2019s fault protection system has activated on two additional occasions, leading to the shutdown of the X-band transmitter and a switch to the less commonly used S-band transmitter. While this alternative consumes less power, Voyager 1 has not utilized it for communication with Earth since 1981. Its signal is significantly weaker and operates on a different frequency than the X-band transmitters.Because of the spacecraft's immense distance, the flight team was uncertain if the S-band signal could be detected from Earth; however, engineers at the Deep Space Network successfully managed to locate it.Rather than reactivating the X-band transmitter before determining what triggered the fault protection system, the team sent a command on October 22 to test the functionality of the S-band transmitter. At present, data to assist with further understanding of the situation and work toward restoring Voyager 1 to its normal operations is being gathered.",
        "summary": "NASA has re-established contact with 47-year-old Voyager 1 after years of silence. The spacecraft's fault protection system shut down its radio transmitter, sparking investigations into the cause. Commands and data exchanges between the spacecraft and NASA take nearly two days, with engineers working to restore normal operations.",

        "text": "Researchers in Japan have officially recognised a new amphipod species, Melita panda, which features black-and-white coloring resembling a panda. Discovered in Japan's coastal waters, the species has now been classified through detailed morphological and genetic research by Hiroshima University's team, as published in ZooKeys. The identification of Melita panda underlines the need for continued taxonomic studies to support biodiversity conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nNew Discovery in Coastal Biodiversity\r\n\r\nOriginally found in Wakayama Prefecture during the 1990s, Melita panda was re-evaluated as part of a broader study on amphipods, a group of small, shrimp-like crustaceans found worldwide. Professor Ko Tomikawa and colleagues from Hiroshima University note that many marine species in Japan remain unclassified, hindering conservation efforts. Their study highlighted that species diversity in Japan's coastal areas requires continued investigation to understand the full spectrum of local biodiversity.\r\n\r\nIdentifying Melita panda: Genetic and Morphological Analysis\r\n\r\nUsing DNA sequencing and morphological analysis, researchers identified Melita panda's distinct black-and-white pattern along with unique physical traits. These include forward-positioned gnathopods (claws) and distinct bristle-like setae, which distinguish it from its closest relatives, Melita nagatai and Melita koreana. These amphipods together form a monophyletic group, meaning they share a common evolutionary ancestor, Melita hoshinoi.Spacex Launches 23 More Starlink Satellites to Boost Broadband Network\r\n\r\nImplications for Conservation and Future Study\r\n\r\nThe recognition of Melita panda emphasises the importance of taxonomy in conservation. Professor Tomikawa noted that the discovery could increase interest in studying coastal species and contribute to more informed conservation planning. He suggests that further taxonomic studies in uncharted marine regions may yield additional species, potentially enhancing our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and supporting conservation initiatives across Japan's coastlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

The floods have also submerged 766,586 acres of crops and killed 129,150 animals, it added. The widespread flooding in the Asian country was caused by heavy rains triggered by Typhoon Yagi and a deep depression in the Bay of Bengal. Local authorities, rescue organisations, and residents are working together to clean flood-affected areas, provide healthcare, and distribute food and other essential items for the flood victims.",

        "text": "Mysuru: With a week left for this year\u2019s Dasara, the festive fever has already gripped the youth of Mysuru who gathered in large numbers for the inauguration of \u2018Yuva Sambhrama \u2013 2024\u2019 at the Open Air Theatre in Manasagangothri here last evening. The event, which provides students from across the State to showcase their talent, is held every year prior to the commencement of the Dasara festival. The presence of Kannada actors Srimurali and Rukmini Vasanth added more glitter to the inaugural event. While Srimurali was addressing the gathering, youth demanded him to sing for which the actor obliged with the song \u2018Hudugir Kannu Loaded Gannu\u2026\u2019 from his movie \u2018Rathavara\u2019 which set the tone for the celebrations. Srimurali, who said that \u2018Our Nada Habba is Our Pride,\u2019 added that it was only in Mysuru that a grandeur Dasara could be witnessed and no other place in the country. Later, the actor, promoting his upcoming movie \u2018Bhageera,\u2019 urged the youth to watch the film in theatres. Earlier, inaugurating the event, District Minister Dr. H.C. Mahadevappa said that among the 470 colleges which had applied to take part in the Yuva Sambhrama, 150 colleges were selected and another 120 colleges out of those not selected would be given an opportunity to showcase their talent by extending the event by a day. Tribute to \u2018Appu\u2019 Yesterday\u2019s inaugural event also witnessed the organisers paying tributes to late actor Puneeth Rajkumar, fondly called \u2018Appu.\u2019 Dr. Madhusudan and troupe rendered the song \u2018Bombe Heluthaithe\u2026\u2019 from the Kannada movie \u2018Rajakumara\u2019 joined the audience who also sang along by waving their mobile phones turning on the torch. A delayed inauguration The students and audience present at the Open Air Theatre, who had arrived much earlier to scheduled time of inauguration (5 pm as per the banners at the venue; 6 pm as per the invitation) waited for more than two hours for the guests to arrive. Finally, the event was inaugurated at 8.20 pm which caused a great inconvenience to the students who had to wait for long wearing their costumes. On day-1, Holenarasipur Govt. FGC for Women, Hassan presented a dance programme portraying the folk and desi culture; Hunsur\u2019s Sri Mahaveer College of Education showcased Dasara heritage through dance. It was followed by performances of 18 other colleges. MLC C.N. Manjegowda, Karnataka Exhibition Authority Chairman Ayub Khan, Karnataka State Guarantee Schemes Implementation Authority Vice-Chairperson Dr. Pushpa Amarnath, DC G. Lakshmikanth Reddy, ZP CEO K.M. Gayathri, SP N. Vishnuvardhana & DCP M. Muthuraj were present. \u2018Yuva Sambhrama\u2019 programmes will be held from 6 pm onwards till Sept. 30.",

        "title": "Scientists Reveal It Wasn't Just One Asteroid That Wiped Out Dinosaurs",
        "text": "The massive asteroid that ended the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was not an isolated event, new research has revealed. The study, published in Nature, detailed scans of an underwater crater off the coast of Guinea. It revealed that another large asteroid struck Earth around the same time, potentially contributing to the cataclysmic conditions that led to the dinosaurs' extinction. Scientists recently mapped the Nadir crater, spanning over 8 km in diameter, and revealed that it was created by an asteroid measuring 400 metres wide. This asteroid struck the planet at nearly 72,000 kmph between 65 million and 67 million years ago. While it was smaller than the asteroid linked to the mass extinction, it was still powerful enough to leave a significant mark on Earth. \u201cThe new images paint a picture of the catastrophic event,\u201d said Dr Uisdean Nicholson, a marine geologist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He discovered the Nadir crater in 2022, but the impact details were unclear until now. Using advanced 3D seismic imaging, researchers managed to explore the crater's rim and the geological features lying 300 metres beneath the ocean floor. Dr Nicholson called it \u201cexquisite,\u201d saying, \u201cThere are around 20 confirmed marine craters worldwide, and none of them has been captured in anything close to this level of detail.\u201d The findings suggest the impact triggered intense tremors that liquefied sediments beneath the sea bed, resulting in faults and landslides that left traces of damage visible for thousands of square miles beyond the crater's edge. Furthermore, the collision unleashed a massive tsunami, estimated to have exceeded 800 metres in height, which would have surged across the Atlantic Ocean. Although the exact timing of this asteroid's impact remains uncertain, its discovery raises intriguing possibilities about a cluster of impacts occurring at the end of the Cretaceous period \u2013 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs created a much larger crater \u2013 160 km wide \u2013 at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Dr Nicholson said the \u201cclosest humans have come to seeing something like this is the 1908 Tunguska event\u201d, when a 50-metre asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded in the skies above Siberia. He pointed out that the new 3D seismic data across the Nadir crater provides an unrivalled opportunity to test impact crater hypotheses and develop new models of crater formation in marine environments.",

        "text": "The forecourt of the iconic Mysuru palace looked colourful with various designs showcasing the talent of over 100 women who drew attractive rangolis as part of the Dasara Rangoli competition organised on Friday. A variety of colourful and attractive rangolis were drawn, enlivening the festive mood as women, not just from Mysuru, but also from other districts as well, thronged the venue to showcase their talent and creativity. Many attractive designs of rangolis were drawn on the forecourt of the palace. People also visited the palace to watch the colourful rangolis. The event was inaugurated by MLA T.S. Srivatsa. Speaking on the occasion, the MLA said rangoli symbolised our culture and tradition. More than 100 women participated in the competition to showcase their talents oblivious about the prizes. Their participation is appreciating, he added. The MLA recalled how women in villages draw rangolis, and the preparations they make before the rangolis are drawn in front of their houses. Rangoli is an art and a tradition that has continued since ages, with women in the cities also practicing the tradition, drawing attractive rangolis daily in front of their house. Rangolis in the design of elephant carrying Ambari, Mahisha rangoli, and many other impressive rangolis had been drawn in the competition. Women whose rangoli designs were judged the best will get prizes which will be presented on October 8. Three prizes and three consolation prizes will be presented.",
