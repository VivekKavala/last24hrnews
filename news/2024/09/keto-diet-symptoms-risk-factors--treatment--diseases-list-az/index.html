                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The mechanism is not fully understood, but this low-carb, high-fat diet is said to change activity in the brain.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Pay attention to your intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> First, you have to limit your carbohydrate intake, consume moderate amounts of protein, and consume high amounts of fat per day.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This makes the body burn fat as its main fuel source and break it down into ‘ketones’ in a process called ketosis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A person on a keto diet should consume 20 grams to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day, or less.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates is equivalent to 2 slices of bread and a banana.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The reason is that carbohydrates make up about a tenth of the daily kilojoule intake on the keto diet.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This way, the body remains in a constant state of ketosis.</p>
