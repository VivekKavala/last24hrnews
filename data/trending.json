The Mumbai traffic police on Saturday received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number threatening that if Adityanath did not resign as Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 10 days, he would be killed like NCP leader Baba Siddique, who was gunned down last month.During the probe, it was found that Khan had sent the message, and she was apprehended from Ulhasnagar in a joint operation by the ATS and police. The police are on alert as Adityanath is expected to visit Maharashtra to campaign for the November 20 assembly elections.",

        "text": "Ottawa: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday condemned the attack on a Hindu temple in Brampton by alleged Khalistani extremists and said that every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely.On Sunday, Peel Regional Police said that a protest occurred at a Hindu temple in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding banners in support of Khalistan, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.The videos appear to show fist fights and people striking each other with poles on what appears to be the grounds surrounding the Hindu Sabha Mandir temple, the report added.Taking to X, Trudeau thanked the local authorities for the swift response to protect the community and probe this incident.\"The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Thank you to the Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident,\" Trudeau said in a post on X on Monday.Peel Regional Police said on X Sunday afternoon that they were aware of the protest taking place at the Hindu Sabha Mandir, and had increased its presence at the temple to maintain public order and safety.\"We respect the right to protest in a peaceful and safe manner but will not tolerate violence and criminal acts,\" Chief Nishan Duraiappah posted on X Sunday after the videos began circulating.\"Those that do participate in this activity will be pursued, arrested and charged.\"Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown condemned the violence in a post on X Sunday afternoon, saying those responsible should be punished to the greatest extent of the law.\"I am disappointed to hear about acts of violence outside of the Hindu Sabha,\" he said. \"Religious freedom is a foundational value in Canada. Everyone should feel safe in their place of worship.\"The recent attack on the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton witnessed widespread condemnation by Canadian politicians, including opposition leader Pierre Poilievre.\"Completely unacceptable to see violence targeting worshippers at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today. All Canadians should be free to practice their faith in peace. Conservatives condemn this violence unequivocally. I will unite our people and end the chaos,\" Poilievre said on X.Meanwhile, the High Commission of India in Ottawa also issued a strong statement on Monday condemning the recent attack on Brampton's Hindu Sabha temple by \"anti-India\" elements.This incident disrupted a consular event co-organised by the Hindu Sabha Mandir and the Indian consulate.In its statement, the High Commission remarked, \"We have seen violent disruption today (November 3), orchestrated by anti-India elements outside the consular camp co-organised with the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton, near Toronto.\"The statement further added, \"We also remain very concerned for the safety of applicants, including Indian nationals, on whose demand such events are organised in the first place. Despite these efforts by anti-India elements, our Consulate was able to issue more than 1000 life certificates to the Indian and Canadian applicants...\"The relations between India and Canada came under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\".India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.",

        "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday relaxed the bail condition imposed on Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan of reporting to a Uttar Pradesh police station every week in a UAPA case against him.\r\n\r\nA bench of Justices P S Narasimhan and Sandeep Mehta relaxed the condition imposed by the top court on Kappan at the time of his bail in September, 2022.\r\n\r\n\"The order dated September 9, 2022, is modified and it shall not be necessary for the petitioner to report to the local police station. The other prayers made in the present application can be agitated independently,\" said the bench.\r\n\r\nKappan was arrested in October, 2020 while on his way to UP's Hathras, where a Dalit woman had died after allegedly being sexually assaulted by a group of men.\r\n\r\nWhile granting bail to Kappan, the court had directed him to report to the police station concerned every week.\r\n\r\nThe top court had on September 17 asked the state government to file its reply on Kappan's plea. The top court granted him bail after he had spent almost two years in prison and observed every person had the right to free expression.\r\n\r\nKappan was then saddled with several bail conditions, including the one directing him to remain in Delhi for the following six weeks after his release from prison and reporting to the Nizamuddin police station every Monday.\r\n\r\n\"The appellant shall be taken to the trial court within three days and shall be released on bail on conditions as deemed fit by the trial court,\" the bench had said.\r\n\r\nThe court had, however, allowed him to travel to Malappuram in Kerala, his home state, after six months maintaining that he would have to report to the local police station and mark his presence there every Monday.\r\n\r\nKappan was directed not to leave Delhi's jurisdiction without the permission of the court besides being ordered to attend the trial court every day either personally or through his lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"The appellant shall deposit his passport with the investigative machinery,\" added the top court.\r\n\r\nThe case was registered against Kappan and three others under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly having links with the Popular Front of India (PFI). The PFI had been accused in the past of funding protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act across the country and the police claimed that the accused persons had attempted to vitiate the law and order situation in Hathras. The woman in question had died at a Delhi hospital a fortnight after her alleged rape by four men from her village on September 14, 2020.\r\n\r\nShe was cremated in the middle of the night at her village but the family claimed that her last rites were performed without their consent and they were not allowed to being her mortal remains home one last time.",

Saha was a part of India's red-ball set-up for a long time before he was informed by then head coach Rahul Dravid that the selectors and the team management were looking beyond him.\r\n\r\nHe was released from BCCI's central contracts' list last year. One of his most memorable knocks for India came during New Zealand's 2016 tour where he scored unbeaten fifties on a seaming track against a quality bowling attack comprising the likes of Trent Boult, Matt Henry, Neil Wagner and Mitchell Santner at the Eden Gardens.\r\n\r\nHe was adjudged player of the match for his exploits in that Test. A middle-order floater in the national line-up, his overall Test career yielded 1353 runs, including three hundreds. A stalwart of domestic cricket, he made his First Class debut for Bengal way back in 2007, amassing 7013 runs in 138 games.\r\n\r\nHe briefly served as Tripura's player-cum-mentor after a rift with some Cricket Association of Bengal officials in 2022. However, following a meeting with former India captain Sourav Ganguly, Saha returned to Bengal this season.\r\n\r\nHe also played 170 Indian Premier League matches, representing various teams including Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Gujarat Titans. His lone hundred in the tournament came in the 2014 final for Punjab Kings against KKR.",
