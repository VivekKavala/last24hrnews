                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>The response that Tamil film actor Vijay received for his speech at the inaugural State-level conference of his party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), in Vikravandi on October 27 was mostly on expected lines.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Mr.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Vijay’s indirect attack on the ruling DMK government in Tamil Nadu and the BJP-led Central government and his statement on power sharing have become talking points among the political parties of the State.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> While the DMK, a couple of its allies, and the BJP did not take his speech kindly, the AIADMK, the principal Opposition party, viewed it favourably in view of the perception that Mr.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Vijay did not target it.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If reactions on social media are any indication, the TVK leader’s words created an impact on the people.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Some admired the speech, while others criticised him for being vague on many serious issues.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

As he laid down the broad contours of his party’s policies and action plans in the already cluttered political landscape of Tamil Nadu, it became clear that Mr.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Vijay was adopting the general line of thinking seen in his films.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> By and large, his films belong to the ‘masala movie’ genre.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They offer nothing different either in terms of plot or narration from other movies in the same genre.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In many of his films, the protagonist, played by Mr.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Vijay, represents subaltern communities or identifies with them.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The manner in which he spoke at Vikravandi, the contents of his speech, and the way the conference was organised indicated that the actor may want to follow a similar formula in politics too: nothing radically new; and in support of social justice.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

He did differ from other politicians in some aspects, however.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He spoke simple and direct Tamil and liberally used English words and punchlines.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He did not wear a crisp, white dhoti, the uniform of politicians in the State, but instead chose trousers and a shirt.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The conference began with some of the State’s traditional dance forms — Paraiyattam, Mayilattam, Devarattam, and Vallikummi.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He also announced that he would be open not only to forming an alliance with other parties, but also giving a share in power in the event of victory in the 2026 Assembly polls.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Even though the film star-turned-politician did not name the DMK and the BJP in his attack, the leaders of the two parties were quick to find fault with him.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Alluding to Mr.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Regupathy, labelled the latest entrant the “C team” of the BJP, while Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting and former State president of the BJP, L.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Murugan, contended that Mr.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Vijay’s speech lacked clarity.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> To substantiate his point, he referred to the TVK leader calling Dravidam and Tamil nationalism as “two eyes” and said the two concepts were contradictory to each other.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The DMK’s allies were not attracted by Mr.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Vijay’s offer of power sharing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The principal secretary of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Durai Vaiko, said it would create confusion.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The leader of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, Thol Thirumavalavan, who defended the demand for a share in power not too long ago, said Mr.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Vijay’s “offer” was an attempt to pre-empt the AIADMK.</p>
