        "text": "The man found dead in an ambulance at Kaippamangalam in Thrissur district was murdered, according to the police. The deceased has been identified as Arun, 40, a resident of Mettupalayam in Coimbatore. However, his identity remains to be verified. The incident was reported near the Kaippamangalam fisheries school on Monday around 11.30 p.m. It has since emerged that a four-member gang in a car had summoned the ambulance to take the deceased to a nearby hospital under the pretext that he was injured in an accident. The gang then allegedly fled after having promised the ambulance driver that they would follow the ambulance. The victim was dead by the time the ambulance reached the hospital. Following this, the ambulance driver alerted the Kaippamangalam police. In the ensuing investigation it emerged that the victim was assaulted to death in connection with a money transaction, reportedly to the tune of \u20b910 lakh, for a rice puller. One of the accused had reportedly invested the money with Arun who failed to deliver on the promise. According to the police, the victim who was asked to come near the Paliyekkara toll was abducted by the gang and then beaten up at a secret location. He was being taken around in a car when the gang allegedly summoned the ambulance at Kaippamangalam. As per preliminary information, all the accused were residents of Kannur. The Kaippamangalam police have intensified the probe for tracking down the accused.",

        "text": "Visakhapatnam: Alluri Sitarama Raju district is home to many beautiful waterfalls that attract tourists, especially youngsters from across the state. Unfortunately, many tourists have lost their lives in waterfall-related accidents in the district due to a lack of awareness about the risks. This is because often the youth try to perform adventurous tasks for selfies and short videos. On this problem, ASR district collector A.S. Dinesh Kumar held a meeting with tourism officials. When Deccan Chronicle contacted, Srinivasa Phani, the regional director of the AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC), said, \u201cIn last week's meeting, we discussed that the APTDC has received Rs 30 crore funds under the Swadeshi Darshan 2.0 scheme from the central government. We have proposed that some of this fund be used to develop infrastructure that prevents accidents at these waterfalls.\u201d The Anantagiri Saria Falls gained recognition as a tourist destination since 2015, attracting many visitors from the North Andhra districts. However, several tragic incidents took place at this spot. According to CPI (M) ASR district secretary D. Venkanna, more than 40 reported fatalities occurred at the falls between 2015 and 2024. Worried about these events, the district authorities enhanced safety measures. Notably, at the first step of Saria Falls, where many accidents had occurred, fencing and warning boards were erected. These measures have prevented accidents in the past two years.Unfortunately, a recent incident at Bahubali Waterfalls, the second step of the falls, resulted in the loss of two lives. The recovery of the bodies was quite a challenge for the officials. Pittalaborra Waterfalls at Ginnelakota village in Pedabayalu mandal has been identified as hazardous due to its history of accidents. A tragic incident occurred three months ago when a young man from the Araku area lost his life after slipping into a waterfall while taking a selfie. His body was recovered two days later.Similarly, Duduma waterfalls, situated at a height of 2,600 feet on the border of Andhra and Odisha, has witnessed multiple fatalities, with six reported deaths in 2024. In response, the Odisha government has implemented preventive measures, resulting in fewer accidents at the site. The Gadigummi Falls in Koyyuru mandal is deemed extremely dangerous, with no documented cases of individuals surviving falls. Local reports suggest that approximately 40 fatalities have occurred at this location. On a different note, the Polluru Waterfall at Mothugudem is renowned for its popularity as a filming location. It has also seen several fatal incidents, with around 35 recorded deaths attributed to quicksand in the boulder area near the waterfall.The Chaparai Waterfall in Dumbriguda is a captivating attraction for tourists, including foreigners. Adjacent to the waterfall, there is a hazardous area known as the Hanuma Stone, which had several accidents due to its beautiful nature, uninformed tourists often meet with accidents here. Local guides have reported approximately 30 fatalities in the past decade. However, two years ago, the authorities took protective measures at the waterfalls area. They have demolished the hazardous Hanuma Stone, installed a fence and taken additional protective measures. As a result, the number of accidents at Chaparai Waterfalls has decreased over the past two years.",
