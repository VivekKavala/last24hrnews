Srikanth laid a wreath at Vijay Smarak in Fort William to pay tribute to bravehearts, who made the supreme sacrifice in the service to the nation, in the morning. Several events were organised during the day, including interactions between officers and troops.\n\nAccording to an official, the Eastern Command was raised in Lucknow on November 1, 1920. It then had territorial jurisdiction over Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and Assam. Thereafter, the Command headquarters moved to Barrackpore, Ranchi and back to Lucknow. After the India-China War of 1962, the Command settled down permanently at Fort William in Kolkata.\n\n\u201cEastern Command continues to remain the Army\u2019s largest operational command with its jurisdiction covering eight states. It monitors 8,350 km of land borders with five neighbouring countries. The Eastern Command has actively participated in all wars fought by India but the crowning glory was the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War that led to the Liberation of Bangladesh. The \u2018Warriors of the East\u2019 have also conducted successful counter-insurgency operations in the northeastern states whenever required,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe command is also entrusted with managing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the states of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. The official said that personnel from the command cover terrain ranging from high-altitude peaks in the Himalayas with sub-zero temperatures to steaming rain forests with fast-flowing rivers.\n\n\u201cThe Command has also brought significant changes in the lives of citizens, particularly in the northeastern states, through initiatives like Operation Sadbhavana and Operation Samaritan. Officers and troops not only provide relief during disasters and help to restore law and order, they also interact with the local population on a regular basis through medical camps. Training is also provided to local youth to join the armed forces or take up professional courses like engineering and medicine,\u201d the official added.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 1 (IANS) After a two-year-long stint as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud is due to retire on November 10 on attaining the age of 65 years. During the period, he pronounced several notable judgements. \n\nHere are the 10 key judgments authored by him when he was in the highest judicial office of the country after taking over as the CJI on November 9, 2022.\n\n1. Revocation of Article 370\n\nA 5-judge Constitution Bench, headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, had upheld the revocation of Article 370. It had ordered the Election Commission of India to take steps to conduct elections to the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Constitution Bench, also comprising Justices S.K. Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, had left open the question of whether Parliament can extinguish the character of statehood by converting a state into one or more union territories, relying on the statement made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that statehood would be restored to Jammu and Kashmir, but, it had said that \u201crestoration of statehood shall take place at the earliest and as soon as possible\u201d.\n\nThe Supreme Court had upheld the status of Ladakh as a union territory under Article 3(a) read with Explanation I of the Constitution, which permits the formation of a union territory by separating a territory from any state.\n\nIn May this year, the apex court refused to review the Constitution Bench verdict and dismissed a batch of review pleas filed against the decision upholding the revocation of Article 370 as valid.\n\n2. Same-sex marriage\n\nA 5-judge bench headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud had declined to strike down or read into gender-neutral \u201cperson\u201d in place of \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d existing under the Special Marriage Act. All five judges of the Constitution Bench had unanimously agreed that there exists no unqualified right to marriage and accepted the Centre\u2019s proposal that a committee to be headed by the Cabinet Secretary be set up to examine what administrative steps could be taken to address basic social benefit concerns relating to same-sex couples.\n\nThe Constitution Bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Hima Kohli, B.V. Nagarathna and P.S. Narasimha, had left it to the legislature to take a call on enacting the marriage equality law. It had asked the Union and state governments to ensure that the LGBTQ+ community is not discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation and queer individuals are not refused access to any goods or services.\n\n3. Electoral bonds\n\nA five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, had struck down the electoral bonds scheme, saying that denying voters the right to know the details of funding of political parties would lead to a dichotomous situation and the funding of political parties cannot be treated differently from that of the candidates who contest elections.\n\nIn a unanimous verdict, the Bench, also comprising Justices B.R. Gavai, Sajiv Khanna, J.B. Padriwala and Manoj Misra, had directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to forthwith stop the issuance of electoral bonds and ordered the Election Commission of India (ECI) to publish on its official website the details of the political parties which have received contributions through electoral bonds since April 2019.\n\nSubsequently, a bench headed by CJI Chandrachud declined to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a Special Investigative Team (SIT) probe under the supervision of a retired apex court judge into an alleged scam in poll financing using electoral bonds.\n\nThe top court said that an SIT cannot be formed to probe \u201cquid pro quo\u201d unless there is an FIR already registered on the issue espoused in the PIL, adding that the ordinary course of law may remedy the allegations raised in the plea.\n\n4. Caste-based division of labour in prisons\n\nA bench headed by CJI DY Chandrachud held it unconstitutional the practice of employing \u201clower caste\u201d jail inmates in cleaning and manual scavenging work in prisons. The Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, directed that the \u201ccaste\u201d column and any references to caste in prisoners\u2019 registers inside the prisons be deleted.\n\nIn its October 2024 verdict, the Supreme Court asked all states and union territories to revise their prison rules providing caste-based division of labour in jails within three months. It also asked the Union government to make changes in the Model Prison Manual 2016 and the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act 2023 within three months.\n\n5. Effective implementation of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006\n\nA bench headed by CJI Chandrachud issued a slew of directions for the effective implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, ordered the state governments and union territories to appoint officers solely responsible for discharging the functions of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers (CMPOs) at the district level.\n\nIt said that child marriage deprives children of their agency, autonomy and right to fully develop and enjoy their childhood. \u201cBoth sexes are adversely affected by forced and early marriage. Marrying in childhood has the effect of objectifying the child. The practice of child marriage imposes mature burdens on children who are not physically or mentally prepared to comprehend the significance of marriage,\u201d ordered SC.\n\n6. Section 6A of Citizenship Act\n\nA Constitution Bench, headed by CJI Chandrachud, upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which was inserted to give effect to the Assam Accord and formed the basis of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam in 2019.\n\nThe 5-judge Bench was dealing with a clutch of petitions challenging Section 6A of the Citizenship Act 1955, on the ground that it violates Articles 6,7,14, 29 and 355 of the Constitution.\n\nIn his opinion, CJI Chandrachud held that Section 6A of the Citizenship Act does not have the effect of amending Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution, which prescribe a cut-off date for conferring citizenship for migrants from East and West Pakistan at the \u201ccommencement of the Constitution\u201d (i.e., on January 26, 1950).\n\n7. NEET-UG 2024\n\nRefusing to order a fresh exam, a bench headed by CJI Chandrachud observed there was no systematic leak of the question paper of the NEET-UG 2024 examination.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said there was no sufficient material available on the record to order a re-test but clarified that its judgment won\u2019t prevent authorities from taking action against candidates who had secured admission using malpractices.\n\n8. Adani-Hindenburg controversy\n\nA bench presided over by CJI Chandrachud refused to form any SIT or group of experts to conduct the investigation in the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and said the facts of the case did not warrant a transfer of investigation from SEBI.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said that reports prepared by third-party organisations such as the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Hindenburg Research cannot be regarded as \u201cconclusive proof\u201d.\n\n9. Manipur violence\n\nA bench headed by CJI Chandrachud took suo moto cognizance of the disturbing viral videos where two tribal women were paraded naked and sexually assaulted in Manipur.\n\nThe Supreme Court had set up a committee comprising three woman judges tasked with collecting information related to violence against women in Manipur as well as monitoring the conditions at relief camps and deciding on compensation to victims.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, had also appointed former Maharashtra DGP Dattatray Padsalgikar to investigate the allegations that certain police officers colluded with perpetrators of violence, including sexual violence, during the conflict in Manipur.\n\n10. Cases against MPs/MLAs\n\nA bench headed by CJI Chandrachud directed Chief Justices of all High Courts across the country to register suo moto cases to monitor the expeditious disposal of criminal cases pending against MPs and MLAs.\n\nThe Supreme Court said that the special bench to be formed in every High Court will issue continuing directions to curb the criminalisation of politics and may seek assistance from the Advocate General and other officers of the state government.\n\nFurther, it said that the High Court may also call for status reports on the issue from all District and Session Courts under their jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Chandrachud was first appointed as judge of the Bombay High Court on March 29, 2000, and served as Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court since October 31, 2013, until his elevation as an apex court judge on May 13, 2016.\n\nCJI Chandrachud passed BA with honours in economics from St Stephen\u2019s College, New Delhi and completed LLB from Campus Law Centre, Delhi University. He also served as Additional Solicitor General of India from 1998 till 2000. In June 1998, he was designated as a senior advocate by the Bombay High Court.\n\nAfter CJI Chandrachud recommended the name of Justice Sanjiv Khanna as his successor last month, the Centre has cleared the appointment of Justice Khanna as the 51st CJI with effect from November 11.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 1 (IANS) Congress leader Rashid Alvi on Friday extended support to the Samajwadi Party (SP) over its \u2018judenge to jeetenge\u2019 posters, claiming that it was an effort to unite the people unlike the \u2018divisive\u2019 rhetoric of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nA poster war has broken out in Uttar Pradesh ahead of by-elections, with BJP sharpening its \u2018batenge ko katenge\u2019 pitch while opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) looking to counter it with slogans like \u2018judenge toh jeetenge\u2019 and others. \n\nCongress spokesperson, talking to IANS, also trained guns at Uttar Pradesh chief minister and asked the latter to point out \u2013 to whom his comments were directed at.\n\n\u201cWhen Yogi Adityanath talks about Batenge toh Katenge, it is natural to react. I want to ask the Chief Minister, you say \u2018Batenge toh Katenge\u2019 but whom do you wish to divide, and who is supposed to attack? Is it Pakistan? No, they lack the courage. Or China, with whom your government has signed agreements.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an internal threat, then say so directly. If you have the courage, define who you\u2019re referring to.

        "text": "Bengaluru, Nov 1 (IANS) Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar said on Friday that the guarantee schemes implemented in Karnataka have become a model for other states in the country.\n\nHe was reacting to queries from the media near Kanteerava stadium in Bengaluru.\n\nShivakumar\u2019s statement on the review of Shakthi\u2019s free travel scheme for women across the state stirred a major controversy in the state.\n\nAsked about the implementation of Karnataka\u2019s model guarantee schemes in Maharashtra, he said, \u201cThe guarantee schemes implemented in Karnataka have become a model for other states in the country. Even states governed by the BJP and other parties are emulating our schemes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a matter of pride and honour for us,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe opposition parties were unable to implement the people-oriented guarantee schemes that we have brought forward. They create discord among siblings, parents, and children, manipulating emotions \u2014 that\u2019s their agenda. In this way, they have broken many homes,\u201d said Shivakumar.\n\n\u201cI only mentioned the feedback of about 5-10 per cent of women on the Shakti scheme. We will not stop the guarantee schemes under any circumstances. Some women said they would buy tickets, but conductors are hesitant to collect money. I only suggested that this needs to be considered,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked about Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge\u2019s message of unity, Shivakumar said, \u201cHe conveyed a message to the workers in light of various circumstances. Since I became the state party president and Deputy Chief Minister, has there been any untoward incident within the party or the government? We are running both the government and the party smoothly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMallikarjun Kharge is a senior party leader. If he offers wise advice, we must listen. I ask everyone to revisit my remarks on the Shakti scheme,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe Opposition has nothing to discuss other than politics. They said guarantee schemes would ruin households. But that didn\u2019t happen, as they claimed. Seeing our efforts, they are burning with envy,\u201d Shivakumar said.\n\nAsked about several Congress leaders visiting New Delhi, the Deputy Chief Minister said, \u201cNo one has gone to Delhi. Mallikarjun Kharge has not intervened in any matter. So far, no such incident has occurred. As a senior leader, he has offered advice of unity.\u201d\n\n\u201cKharge spoke with a national political perspective in mind and said that different states have adopted different policies on reservations. Kharge subtly indicated that each state should frame its policies locally, and he will not interfere in that,\u201d Shivakumar added.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating the 69th anniversary of Karnataka\u2019s unification and 50 years since it was renamed Karnataka. More than a thousand school children have given international-level dance performances and participated in other programmes. I have instructed the ministers and officials to issue certificates to all these children. These school children have worked hard to take part in programmes for Karnataka,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis time, all private institutions and educational institutions were instructed to hold Rajyotsava celebrations. Around 70 per cent of institutions conducted the event. In the first phase, we issued this directive from the government. We encouraged everyone to preserve their language and culture voluntarily. We instructed that no legal action be taken against private institutions,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked about the demand for a law to take action against those who insult Kannada, Shivakumar said, \u201cPeople from other states and countries come and live in our state. Private educational institutions, particularly Christian educational institutions, have celebrated Rajyotsava with great dedication.\u201d",

No action has been taken and CM Siddaramaiah has not bothered to answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Waqf Adalats\u2019 being conducted by Minister Zameer should be stopped immediately.

        "text": "Jammu, Oct 31 (IANS) As the newly-elected Omar Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) government in Jammu and Kashmir promised to boycott the Union Territory (UT) Foundation Day on Thursday, senior party leader Sheikh Bashir Ahmad called it a day of \u201chumiliation\u201d for people of J&K.\n\nAt the same time, Bashir Ahmad also extended Diwali greetings to fellow countrymen and hoped that better days would prevail in the Union territory in 2025.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, the NC leader said: \u201cFirst of all, I want to extend my greetings to all the people across the country on the pious occasion of Diwali, and I pray that this festival of happiness brings good times in the coming year. The Union Territory Foundation Day is actually a day of humiliation for the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about NC boycotting the UT Foundation Day, Bashir Ahmad added: \u201cOn this day, the people of Jammu and Kashmir were humiliated. There\u2019s no reason to celebrate it; it\u2019s a day for officials and bureaucracy. From this day, the destruction of Jammu and Kashmir began. This day holds no relevance for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a democracy, everybody has a right to express their views. The day when J&K became a UT, will be etched in history.\u201d\n\nThe NC leader further said: \u201cThe people have given a mandate to a democratically-elected government, and they should let go of this day. Whether in the opposition or ruling party, everyone should come together to solve the people\u2019s issues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union Home Minister Amit Shah have also spoken about statehood, using the term \u2018appropriate\u2019 time, which could mean any moment they deem fit. However, the mandate of the people of Jammu and Kashmir must be respected, and statehood should be restored as soon as possible so that the elected government can function.\u201d\n\nThe first Assembly session is set to be held on November 4, which will be the first session for the UT, and traditionally, it has been said that this will be a session that will last four to five days with question-answer rounds involving the Assembly members, he added.\n\n\u201cIt will be a kind of inaugural function held and no business will take place inside the Assembly. The debate will only be held over the Budget session over which question-answer rounds will be held,\u201d the NC leader said.",
