        "title": "Lost for 47 years, Nasa reconnects with Voyager 1 spacecraft 15 billion miles away",
        "text": "Sharing a ground breaking development, Nasa recently announced re-connecting with the 47 year old long lost spacecraft Voyager 1, following years of radio silence. The spacecraft recently turned off one of its two radio transmitters and experts are currently working to uncover the cause.According to the space agency, non-essential systems on the spacecraft are switched off if it draws too much power. However, it may take the team several days or even weeks to identify the root cause that triggered the fault protection system.When NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory flight team in Southern California sends instructions to the spacecraft through the agency's Deep Space Network, Voyager 1 sends back engineering data. The team then analyzes this information to assess how the spacecraft responded to the commands.The two lone spacecraft, Voyagers 1 and 2, have been wandering in interstellar space for 47 years and are the sole two spacecraft there.The Mirror Us reported that scientists believe the transmitter shut-off was initiated by the spacecraft's fault protection system, which autonomously responds to onboard problems, however, the advanced age of these spacecraft has resulted in a rise in technical issues and new challenges for the mission engineering team. It could take days or weeks for the team to pinpoint the root cause that activated the fault protection system. When the flight team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California sends instructions to the spacecraft via the agency's Deep Space Network, Voyager 1 returns engineering data that the team evaluates to see how the spacecraft responded to the command.It takes approximately 23 hours for the command to travel more than 15 billion miles from Earth to the spacecraft, followed by another 23 hours for the data to return, according to reports from the Manchester Evening News.The flight team had issued a command to activate one of Voyager 1's heaters on October 16. Despite having sufficient power for the heater, the command activated the fault protection system on the spacecraft.The whole issue came to light when the Deep Space Network was unable to detect Voyager 1's signal on October 18. The spacecraft communicates with Earth through an X-band radio transmitter, named after its specific frequency. The flight team concluded that the protection system had reduced the transmitter's rate of sending back data as this mode uses less power from the spacecraft. However, it also changes the X-band signal that the Deep Space Network needs to detect. The signal was recorded later that day by engineers and the Voyager was reported to be stable.However, on October 19, the communication ceased completely.The flight team theorized that Voyager 1's fault protection system had been triggered twice more, turning off the X-band transmitter and switching to a second radio transmitter known as the S-band. Although the S-band uses less power, Voyager 1 hasn't used it to communicate with Earth since 1981.The flight team speculated that Voyager 1\u2019s fault protection system has activated on two additional occasions, leading to the shutdown of the X-band transmitter and a switch to the less commonly used S-band transmitter. While this alternative consumes less power, Voyager 1 has not utilized it for communication with Earth since 1981. Its signal is significantly weaker and operates on a different frequency than the X-band transmitters.Because of the spacecraft's immense distance, the flight team was uncertain if the S-band signal could be detected from Earth; however, engineers at the Deep Space Network successfully managed to locate it.Rather than reactivating the X-band transmitter before determining what triggered the fault protection system, the team sent a command on October 22 to test the functionality of the S-band transmitter. At present, data to assist with further understanding of the situation and work toward restoring Voyager 1 to its normal operations is being gathered.",
        "summary": "NASA has re-established contact with 47-year-old Voyager 1 after years of silence. The spacecraft's fault protection system shut down its radio transmitter, sparking investigations into the cause. Commands and data exchanges between the spacecraft and NASA take nearly two days, with engineers working to restore normal operations.",

        "text": "Researchers in Japan have officially recognised a new amphipod species, Melita panda, which features black-and-white coloring resembling a panda. Discovered in Japan's coastal waters, the species has now been classified through detailed morphological and genetic research by Hiroshima University's team, as published in ZooKeys. The identification of Melita panda underlines the need for continued taxonomic studies to support biodiversity conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nNew Discovery in Coastal Biodiversity\r\n\r\nOriginally found in Wakayama Prefecture during the 1990s, Melita panda was re-evaluated as part of a broader study on amphipods, a group of small, shrimp-like crustaceans found worldwide. Professor Ko Tomikawa and colleagues from Hiroshima University note that many marine species in Japan remain unclassified, hindering conservation efforts. Their study highlighted that species diversity in Japan's coastal areas requires continued investigation to understand the full spectrum of local biodiversity.\r\n\r\nIdentifying Melita panda: Genetic and Morphological Analysis\r\n\r\nUsing DNA sequencing and morphological analysis, researchers identified Melita panda's distinct black-and-white pattern along with unique physical traits. These include forward-positioned gnathopods (claws) and distinct bristle-like setae, which distinguish it from its closest relatives, Melita nagatai and Melita koreana. These amphipods together form a monophyletic group, meaning they share a common evolutionary ancestor, Melita hoshinoi.Spacex Launches 23 More Starlink Satellites to Boost Broadband Network\r\n\r\nImplications for Conservation and Future Study\r\n\r\nThe recognition of Melita panda emphasises the importance of taxonomy in conservation. Professor Tomikawa noted that the discovery could increase interest in studying coastal species and contribute to more informed conservation planning. He suggests that further taxonomic studies in uncharted marine regions may yield additional species, potentially enhancing our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and supporting conservation initiatives across Japan's coastlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

The event, which provides students from across the State to showcase their talent, is held every year prior to the commencement of the Dasara festival. The presence of Kannada actors Srimurali and Rukmini Vasanth added more glitter to the inaugural event. While Srimurali was addressing the gathering, youth demanded him to sing for which the actor obliged with the song \u2018Hudugir Kannu Loaded Gannu\u2026\u2019 from his movie \u2018Rathavara\u2019 which set the tone for the celebrations. Srimurali, who said that \u2018Our Nada Habba is Our Pride,\u2019 added that it was only in Mysuru that a grandeur Dasara could be witnessed and no other place in the country. Later, the actor, promoting his upcoming movie \u2018Bhageera,\u2019 urged the youth to watch the film in theatres. Earlier, inaugurating the event, District Minister Dr. H.C. Mahadevappa said that among the 470 colleges which had applied to take part in the Yuva Sambhrama, 150 colleges were selected and another 120 colleges out of those not selected would be given an opportunity to showcase their talent by extending the event by a day. Tribute to \u2018Appu\u2019 Yesterday\u2019s inaugural event also witnessed the organisers paying tributes to late actor Puneeth Rajkumar, fondly called \u2018Appu.\u2019 Dr. Madhusudan and troupe rendered the song \u2018Bombe Heluthaithe\u2026\u2019 from the Kannada movie \u2018Rajakumara\u2019 joined the audience who also sang along by waving their mobile phones turning on the torch. A delayed inauguration The students and audience present at the Open Air Theatre, who had arrived much earlier to scheduled time of inauguration (5 pm as per the banners at the venue; 6 pm as per the invitation) waited for more than two hours for the guests to arrive. Finally, the event was inaugurated at 8.20 pm which caused a great inconvenience to the students who had to wait for long wearing their costumes. On day-1, Holenarasipur Govt. FGC for Women, Hassan presented a dance programme portraying the folk and desi culture; Hunsur\u2019s Sri Mahaveer College of Education showcased Dasara heritage through dance. It was followed by performances of 18 other colleges. MLC C.N.

        "text": "The massive asteroid that ended the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was not an isolated event, new research has revealed. The study, published in Nature, detailed scans of an underwater crater off the coast of Guinea. It revealed that another large asteroid struck Earth around the same time, potentially contributing to the cataclysmic conditions that led to the dinosaurs' extinction. Scientists recently mapped the Nadir crater, spanning over 8 km in diameter, and revealed that it was created by an asteroid measuring 400 metres wide. This asteroid struck the planet at nearly 72,000 kmph between 65 million and 67 million years ago. While it was smaller than the asteroid linked to the mass extinction, it was still powerful enough to leave a significant mark on Earth. \u201cThe new images paint a picture of the catastrophic event,\u201d said Dr Uisdean Nicholson, a marine geologist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He discovered the Nadir crater in 2022, but the impact details were unclear until now. Using advanced 3D seismic imaging, researchers managed to explore the crater's rim and the geological features lying 300 metres beneath the ocean floor. Dr Nicholson called it \u201cexquisite,\u201d saying, \u201cThere are around 20 confirmed marine craters worldwide, and none of them has been captured in anything close to this level of detail.\u201d The findings suggest the impact triggered intense tremors that liquefied sediments beneath the sea bed, resulting in faults and landslides that left traces of damage visible for thousands of square miles beyond the crater's edge. Furthermore, the collision unleashed a massive tsunami, estimated to have exceeded 800 metres in height, which would have surged across the Atlantic Ocean. Although the exact timing of this asteroid's impact remains uncertain, its discovery raises intriguing possibilities about a cluster of impacts occurring at the end of the Cretaceous period \u2013 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs created a much larger crater \u2013 160 km wide \u2013 at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Dr Nicholson said the \u201cclosest humans have come to seeing something like this is the 1908 Tunguska event\u201d, when a 50-metre asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded in the skies above Siberia. He pointed out that the new 3D seismic data across the Nadir crater provides an unrivalled opportunity to test impact crater hypotheses and develop new models of crater formation in marine environments.",
