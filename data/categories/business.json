        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world\u2019s leading generative AI technology.The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment.The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry\u2019s belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement.Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter.Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank\u2019s investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated.In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \u201cAI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \u201cAnd this is just the start.\u201dThe huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \u201cPeople are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\u201d said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year \u2013 adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn\u2019t exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round.Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \u201cthe most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\u201dApple Inc. didn\u2019t participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs.The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company\u2019s board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure \u2014 an unusual organization that has frustrated investors \u2014 to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company\u2019s backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company \u2014 a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI\u2019s board said it hasn\u2019t discussed specific numbers.OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported.A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees \u2014 such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also...",

        "text": "Shares of Marico hit a record high of Rs 719.80, gaining 4 per cent on the BSE in Thursday\u2019s intra-day trade in an otherwise weak market on stable volume growth in July to September quarter (Q2FY25). The stock surpassed its previous high of Rs 713.60 touched on September 27, 2024.At 02:18 pm; Marico had erased its intra-day gain and was trading 0.5 per cent higher at Rs 696.50 on the BSE. In comparison, the BSE Sensex tanked 2.1 per cent or 1,781 points at 82,485. In the last six months, the stock has outperformed the market by surging 41 per cent, as against a near 12 per cent rise in the benchmark index.Marico in its Q2 quarterly update said that consolidated revenue growth remained in high single digits, as higher realisations in the domestic business was offset by incremental currency headwinds in some overseas markets. The company expects consolidated revenue growth to move into double digits in the second half of the year and expects to deliver double-digit revenue growth in this year.The sector witnessed stable demand trends with rural outperforming urban on a year-on-year basis for the third quarter in a row. In the given context, the domestic business posted mid-single digit volume growth, exhibiting improvement on a sequential basis, Marico said.The management said the International business delivered robust low teen constant currency (CC) growth with each of the markets contributing positively. Bangladesh posted high-single digit growth, demonstrating the strong resilience of the company\u2019s business model amidst a challenging operating environment which has now largely stabilized. Vietnam also grew in high single digits, while MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and South Africa maintained their robust double digit growth trajectory.However, Marico expects gross margin to moderate on a year-on-year basis owing to partial absorption of higher input costs, as the Company prioritized expanding its consumer franchise in the current demand environment. Consequently, the company expects a moderate lag in operating profit growth vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.Among key inputs, copra prices rose ahead of internal forecasts and the recent import duty hike led to vegetable oil prices moving higher towards the end of the quarter. Crude oil derivatives, however, remained rangebound.On outlook, Marico said the company remains focused on achieving double-digit revenue growth while managing margin pressures from commodity inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.After a weak update from Dabur, Marico\u2019s update reassured investors. The numbers are largely in line with our estimates, said analysts at Nuvama Wealth Management. Value Added Hair Oils (VAHO) and Saffola Oils remain muted.The brokerage firm said Marico\u2019s consolidated revenue growth is likely to be 8 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Domestic business shall clock 5 per cent volume growth YoY. The International business shall deliver 13 per cent CC growth. Bangladesh shall post high-single digit growth amid a turbulent operating environment. Copra experienced inflation higher than expectations. Parachute shall see mid-single digit volume and double-digit revenue growth. Foods and Digital-first brands performed better than estimates; analysts said in company update and retain \u2018BUY\u2019 rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 780 per share..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Stock market crash today: In the aftermath of the bloodbath at the Dalal-street on Thursday, investors lost a total of Rs 9.7 trillion in market capitalisation on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At Tuesday's close, the total market capitalisation of companies listed on the BSE stood at around Rs 474 trillion - this was pulled down to Rs 465 trillion on Thursday. However, in intraday deals, investors losses mounted to Rs 10.56 trillion with the total market capitalisation of the BSE slipping to Rs 464 trillion. The market breath also favoured the declines as around 2,875 stocks traded losses versus advances by 985 stocks, with 109 remaining unchanged. In terms of contribution to the 30-blue chip stock index, BSE Sensex\u2019s decline, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank led the way, pulling Sensex down in its sharpest decline since August 05. The BSE Sensex plunged 1,832 points or 2.17 per cent to 82,434 level in intraday deals. Meanwhile, Nifty50 slipped to an intraday low of 566 points, down 2.19 per cent to 25,230.30 level in intraday trade. That apart, the country's volatility indicator, India VIX jumped to 11.72 per cent. Among sectors, Nifty Realty was clear loser ending the day 4.36 per cent lower and was followed by Nifty Auto slipping 2.88 per cent, Nifty Private Bank declining 2.61 per cent and Nifty Financial Services sliding 2.59 per cent. According to analysts, today\u2019s sharp decline was driven by several negative factors, including escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by Sebi and strength in the Chinese market, following the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) stimulus package. \u201cSpeculation is growing that Israel may retaliate by targeting major oil fields in Iran, which could further fuel the rise in oil prices. Additionally, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by SEBI are expected to impact trading volumes, as retail participation may decline due to the increased contract size and limits on weekly expiries,\u201d said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP, research & advisory at Master Capital Services.Analysts also concurred that the foreign money is being diverted from India to China as the country became attractive to investors following its government\u2019s stimulus package. \u201cThere has been a notable outflow of Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) money from India to China over the past few days, exerting pressure on large-cap stocks. Lastly, profit booking ahead of state elections and concerns over elevated valuations have added to the downward pressure,\u201d stated Santosh Meena, head of research, Swastika Investmart. .storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "The Airports Authority of India\u2019s Madurai Airport commenced 24-hour operations with effect from October 1, 2024. This milestone marks a significant step towards enhancing connectivity, providing a seamless travel experience and supporting the growth of regional as well as national Air traffic. This will provide flexibility to Airlines, Non-Scheduled operators, Medical flights and General Aviation for efficient planning of Aircraft operations. Airlines can also plan bases at Madurai Airport. This will also enable effective use of Airport Infrastructure and resources, read an official statement.At an event organised at Madurai Airport to formally start the 24-hour operations, M. Suresh, Chairman, AAI underscored the organisation\u2019s strategic approach towards this transformative upgrade. He also emphasised the widespread benefits of the commencement of round-the-clock operations from the Airport. The event also saw the esteemed presence of MP, Manickam Tagore, MP, S. Venkatesan, MLA, V. V. Rajan Chellappa, MLA, A.M.S.G. Ashokan and senior officials from the District Administration.At present Madurai has 248 scheduled movements in a week and is connected to cities like Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Singapore, Dubai and Colombo. Additionally, there is a demand for flight connectivity to other cities of India like Pune, Goa, Kolkata, Cochin, Bhubaneshwar, Varanasi, Guwahati, etc. With round-the-clock operations, the weekly scheduled movements in the winter season of 2024 are expected to be around 344 movements for Madurai Airport.Extending operational hours will allow more flights to land and take off, thereby improving connectivity, especially for flights of long-haul routes. This will attract more airlines and routes, making Madurai Airport a more prominent hub.Travellers will have more flexible flight options, making travel easier and more convenient. This will enhance passenger satisfaction and attract more travellers to Madurai.With more flights and passengers, local businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation services will likely see increased demand. This will lead to job creation and stimulate the local economy. Madurai has a rich cultural and religious heritage. Round-the-clock operations will make this city more accessible to tourists, especially those from different time zones, contributing to the growth of the tourism sector. 24-hour operations will also facilitate better cargo handling, allowing for more efficient logistics operations. This will attract businesses that rely on air freight, further boosting the local economy. It will also enable the locals to have better access to enhanced medical facilities.With the starting of 24-hour operations, a Night parking facility will be available at Madurai Airport as well. This will help the Airport to facilitate connections not only within India but also to international destinations. Since most international operators prefer to operate during night time from India, 24-hour operations will encourage airlines to consider international operations from Madurai Airport. It will also allow airlines to plan night parking at the Airport and plan base flights. Transitioning Madurai Airport to 24-hour operations presents a compelling opportunity to enhance Passenger service, drive economic growth, and improve overall operational efficiency. By embracing this change, the Airport can position itself as the leading airport in the country, catering to the diverse needs of passengers and contributing to the region\u2019s overall development. Implementing these extended hours will not only meet the demands of a growing travel market but also support Madurai\u2019s aspirations as a vital transportation hub in the region",

        "text": "The rupee depreciated 14 paise to settle at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as the volatile geopolitical situation triggered a surge in crude oil prices, weighed down by a steep fall of over two per cent in domestic equity markets. According to forex traders, a strong American currency and unabated outflow of foreign funds fuelled by the bullish Chinese markets also accelerated the rupee's slide. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.91 and touched a low of 83.97 against the greenback during intra-day trading. The unit ended the session at 83.96 (provisional) against the American currency, registering a steep loss of 14 paise from its previous closing level. On Tuesday, the rupee settled 3 paise lower at 83.82 against the American currency. Forex markets were closed on Wednesday on account of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. According to Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the rupee declined on weak domestic markets and a strong dollar, while a surge in crude oil prices also weighed on the domestic unit. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a slight negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"Traders may take cues from ISM services PMI, weekly unemployment claims and factory orders data from the US. Investors may watch out for a non-farm payrolls report from the US on Friday. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.66 per cent to $75.13 in futures trade. Experts attributed the spike in crude prices to the fear of Israel's retaliatory attacks on Iran's oil installations amid escalating tension in West Asia. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex crashed 1,769.19 points, or 2.10 per cent, to settle at 82,497.10, while the Nifty tanked 546.80 points, or 2.12 per cent to close the session at 25,250.10.

FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b915,000 crore since Monday. Analysts said foreign investors rushed to sell Indian equities as Chinese stocks turned bullish after the country announced a slew of stimulus measures to revive the economy. On the domestic macroeconomic front, a monthly survey released on Tuesday showed India's manufacturing sector growth fell to an eight-month low in September amid a softer increase in factory production, sales and new export orders. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from 57.5 in August to 56.5 in September, registering the weakest pace of growth since January.",

Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank's investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated. In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\" OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \"And this is just the start.\" The huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \"People are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\" said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year - adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn't exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round. Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \"the most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\" Apple Inc. didn't participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI's board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs. The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company's board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure - an unusual organization that has frustrated investors - to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company's backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company - a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI's board said it hasn't discussed specific numbers. OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported. A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees - such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also developing their own AI models. In this funding round, OpenAI discouraged investors from backing rival companies, such as Anthropic or Musk's AI startup xAI, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg earlier reported that leading venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which backed Safe Superintelligence, would not participate in the newest fundraising.

        "text": "Interest rates are expected to decline soon after remaining elevated for an extended period. After the US Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 50-basis-point (bps) cut, other central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will likely follow suit.\u201cThis is a good time to take fixed-income exposure at elevated rates before the softening starts,\u201d says Amol Joshi, founder, PlanRupee Investment Managers.Rate cuts on the horizonThe RBI has projected inflation at 4.5 per cent for financial year 2025 (FY25), close to its 4 per cent target. With the current repo rate at 6.5 per cent, experts anticipate a 50 basis point cut soon. \u201cI see a repo rate cut of 50 bps to 6 per cent,\u201d says Joydeep Sen, author and corporate trainer (debt).\u201cRBI may cut rates by 50 bps over the next six months, starting with a 25 bps cut in December,\u201d says Pankaj Mathpal, managing director, Optima Money Managers. Current rates are attractiveFixed-income instruments such as bank fixed deposits (FDs), corporate FDs, and small savings schemes (SSS) are currently offering attractive returns. For example, bank FDs of two to three years\u2019 duration are yielding 7 per cent, while the government has kept SSS rates unchanged as of September 30, 2024. \u201cIf you want to invest in FDs or the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme (SCSS), now is the right time. Investors can also consider long-term debt funds,\u201d says Mathpal.Sen notes that any reduction in bank FD rates will lag behind the RBI\u2019s actions. \u201cBank deposit rates will ease but may not align directly with RBI rate cuts, as credit demand remains strong, and banks need deposits,\u201d he explains.Which instruments look good?Several fixed-income products currently offer attractive rates. The SCSS, with an 8.2 per cent interest rate that can be locked in for five years, remains one of the most attractive. The scheme\u2019s investment limit has been enhanced to Rs 30 lakh.The Mahila Samman Certificate offers 7.5 per cent interest for two years on deposits up to Rs 2 lakh. Select corporate FDs offering around 9 per cent are worth considering. Banks are offering attractive rates for 12-15 month FDs. Investors with a longer time frame will, however, be better off investing in longer-tenured FDs.\u201cSenior citizens should capitalise on high SCSS rates and lock in investments now. For short-term needs, FDs are a good option. NBFC FDs offer slightly higher rates than bank FDs,\u201d says Mathpal. As a rule, match your investment timeframe with the product\u2019s tenure, as premature withdrawals lead to penalties.Avoid floating rate instruments With interest rates set to fall, floating-rate instruments like RBI Floating Rate Savings Bonds may not be ideal. They currently offer 8.05 per cent (35 bps higher than the 7.7 per cent offered by the National Savings Certificate). \u201cFloating-rate instruments will adjust downwards as rates drop, so they are not suitable in a declining interest-rate environment,\u201d says Joshi.Focus on goals and allocationInvest according to your horizon. \u201cYoung investors should focus more on equity, while retired senior citizens should prioritise fixed income. Mid-career investors should aim for a balanced allocation,\u201d says Sen.Fixed income allocation should also depend on investment horizon and risk appetite. \u201cInvestors with lower risk tolerance and short-term goals should focus on debt instruments,\u201d says Mathpal..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Leading artificial intelligence research company OpenAI announced this week that it has closed an enormous funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion. This massive injection of capital positions OpenAI as one of the highest valued private companies in the world. The round was led by previous investor Thrive Capital, with Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, Khosla Ventures and others also participating. This brings OpenAI's total funding to nearly $18 billion since its founding in 2015. OpenAI says the new funds will allow it to expand its AI research, build new tools, and grow its infrastructure to handle increasing demands on its systems. OpenAI has become the worldwide leader in generative AI models like ChatGPT, which has over 250 million users. The company is also known for developing powerful transformer models for natural language processing, computer vision and other domains. However, continued progress requires vast computing resources and talent \u2013 two things that do not come cheaply. OpenAI reportedly spends billions each year on research costs like training new models as well as hiring top AI scientists and engineers. Sustaining this level of spending is likely why OpenAI sought such a gargantuan funding round. The company faces intensifying competition from DeepMind, Anthropic, xAi and others working in similar areas. Microsoft has also become a close partner, building products using OpenAI technology. To maintain its advantages, OpenAI needs ample funds to recruit top people, invest in the latest hardware and pursue ambitious long-term research goals. With over $17 billion in capital raised to date, OpenAI is now in an elite class of private unicorns. How the company utilizes these massive new resources, and whether it can fulfill its lofty visions, will be exciting to watch unfold in the coming years. For now, OpenAI's dominant position in critical AI domains seems set to continue fueling innovative advances that impact technology worldwide.",

The Series B funding round was led by investing powerhouse Bain Capital Ventures, and also included participation from major tech players like eBay and Nvidia. With this new capital injection, Poolside has now raised a total of over $626 million. According to reports, the infusion values the startup at around $3 billion. Founded last year, Poolside develops artificial intelligence models aimed at assisting developers with coding tasks. Some examples include autocompleting code sections and recommending code snippets that could be relevant for a given project. While still relatively new, the startup has seen strong interest from many large corporations and government entities. Poolside's founders include CEO Jason Warner, the former CTO of Github, and Eiso Kant, a serial tech entrepreneur. Their vision is to build an AI-powered toolkit that can powerfully aid the software development process. This massive Series B round will allow important developments at Poolside. The funds will deploy thousands of GPUs to expand their AI model training. Resources will also fuel further R&D and commercialization efforts. The developer tools space is rapidly growing, as AI promises to automate and augment human coding abilities. Vendors like Magic and Codeium have also raised huge rounds recently. GitHub's own AI coding assist, Copilot, has over 1.8 million paid users. Going forward, analyst firm Polaris forecasts the entire AI coding aids market potential to reach $27 billion by 2032.

        "text": "Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, plunged in trade on Thursday, mirroring global cues on the back of increased Middle East tensions and rising crude prices. BSE Sensex closed the day, down 2.10% at 82,497.10, and Nifty50 closed the day at 25,250.10, down 2.12%.The bloodbath on Dalal Street left equity investors poorer by Rs 9.78 lakh crore. The market capitalization of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) plummeted by Rs 9,78,778.57 crore, bringing the total value down to Rs 4,65,07,685.08 crore ($ 5.54 trillion) in just one trading session. In the last few days, BSE Sensex has corrected around 4% from the near 86,000 high it hit last week. The risk of a broader regional conflict has increased following Iran's missile strike on Israel. While Iran insisted it has \"no interest in a broader war\" after the attacks, Israel has vowed to strike back. Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory firm, noted in a client note that \"Iran's decision to respond to devastating attacks from Israel against its proxy Hezbollah, including a new ground offensive, with a ballistic missile strike against Israel, raises the risk of a wider regional conflict that could draw in the US and disrupt oil markets. However, according to an ET report, market analysts suggest that the potential downsides in stock markets could be contained.Stock market outlook: Where are Sensex & Nifty headed?According to Sandeep Raina, Executive Vice President-Research, Nuvama Professional, the market correction is temporary in nature. \u201cThe changes in derivative regulations and the expiry scheduled for today has led to the corrections in the market,\u201d Raina told TOI. \u201cHowever, this is a temporary reaction and we don't expect any major corrections. The markets should stabilize and return to normal levels in the coming days,\u201d he said.Escalating tensions in the Middle East have led to a surge in oil prices, with concerns that supplies from major producers could be disrupted. For countries that heavily rely on oil imports, such as India, the increase in crude prices is a significant concern, as it can have a substantial impact on their import bill and overall economy.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, warned, \"The situation will change if Israel attacks any oil installations in Iran which will trigger a huge spike in crude. If it happens, it can turn out to be more damaging for oil importers like India. Therefore, investors should watch the emerging situation very closely.\" Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers predicts heightened volatility in Indian stock markets in the coming weeks.\u201cThe current geopolitical induced risks and ongoing US election cycle may continue to impact global markets including India in the short term. Also, we are entering the results season starting next week and that is also going to add to the moves depending on the quality of results,\u201d Solanki told TOI.\u201cHence, I see near term 2-3 weeks of heightened news based volatility in the markets. Investors may book some profits in stocks which have run up way ahead of fundamentals and could look for new ideas and add in a staggered manner,\u201d he said.Chinese dragon roars: India\u2019s biggest worryFor investors in India, the resurgence of Chinese stocks, which have underperformed in recent years, could be a more significant concern, feel analysts. The Chinese government recently announced a series of economic stimulus measures, which has led to predictions by analysts that the rebound in Chinese stocks could be sustained. As a result, there is a possibility that some funds may be redirected from India to China, as global investors have been favoring India over China in recent times.The recent stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government is being hailed as a game-changer for the nation's economy and stock markets. Victoria Mio, head of Greater China equities and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, believes that this shift in focus from debt control to growth support could be the key to restoring investor confidence and unlocking value in China's markets.\"As global investors seek stability amidst uncertainty, the Chinese government's decisive pivot from debt control to growth support could be the catalyst needed to restore confidence and unlock value in China's markets.\"The impact of this stimulus package is already being felt in the Chinese stock market, with the SSE Composite index gaining over 15% in the past week, including an impressive 8% rise on Tuesday. Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, attributes this surge to a combination of short covering and a growing belief in the effectiveness of the government's policies. He also suggests that some of the capital outflows from India may have been redirected to China to capitalize on the sharp rally.Looking ahead, Holland believes that global interest rate cuts will benefit all emerging markets. For India specifically, investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming results season to gauge the health of the economy and individual companies.",

        "text": "Amid long-standing calls by private port players to bring parity between recent winners of public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports and players with older contracts, the Centre has released draft guidelines for tariff migration, allowing concessionaires to switch to a market-based tariff regime.\u201cIn the past, tariffs were regulated due to a limited competitive landscape, but the evolving market and competitive landscape necessitates deregulation. The original objective of introducing the tariff regulations in 2005 included safeguarding the interest of users, while ensuring fair returns to the port and encouraging competition and efficiency. The long-term objective outlined in the Tariff Guidelines 2005 was competitive pricing. The market and competitive landscape in the Indian port sector have since witnessed a significant shift,\u201d the shipping ministry said in the draft guidelines.Currently, tariffs for private operators at central government ports are regulated under three separate regimes \u2014 Tariff Guidelines 2005 (superseded by Tariff Guidelines 2019), Tariff Guidelines 2008, and those of 2013.The draft guidelines will allow PPP players to fix their own scale of rates (SOR) and will require them to sign a supplementary agreement.Previously, the major port authorities were both service providers to end users and the concessioning authority. Thus, the tariff regulations played an important role in safeguarding the interests of both port users and PPP operators.According to the Centre, with the transition to the landlord port model and increased private sector participation, the utility of tariff regulations (and fixation) in this context has diminished.Several PPP operators had also raised concerns with the ministry in the past, stating they were at a disadvantage compared to fully private ports, as there was no parity in tariff fixation, making PPP projects less desirable.While the new regulations allow pricing freedom, they will not hinder government revenues earned from these PPP projects, as there will be no change in royalty.\u201cAs an additional measure, the royalty as revenue share of the major port should/would not go below what it would have got under the regime when the tariff was fixed/determined as per the Tariff Guidelines. This would be done by converting the revenue share to royalty based on the annual revenue requirement of the project as determined earlier,\u201d the draft guidelines said.The government has invited stakeholders to send their inputs by 25 October..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "In a boost to commercial real estate and infrastructure projects, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that if the building is constructed for supplying services such as renting or leasing out, it can be regarded as a plant and input tax credit (ITC) under GST will be eligible. However, it rejected constitutional validity challenge to blocked credit provisions in the GST law. \u201cIf the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, the building could be held to be a plant,\u201d a division bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol said. ITC norms With this the apex court upheld Odisha High Court\u2019s ruling in the matter of Safari Retreats. The issue here revolved around section 17(5) of the CGST Act. This particular section prohibits ITC for works contract services when supplied for construction of an immovable property. However, this will exclude plant and machinery. The big question concerned what will be included in the definition of \u2018plant and machinery\u2019? The High Court had held that if the assessee is required to pay GST on the rental income from the mall, it is entitled to ITC on the GST paid on the construction of the mall. Aggrieved by this, the Tax Department moved the Apex Court. After going through all the submissions, the top Court while saying the shopping mall is a \u2018plant\u2019, held that functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant. Expert terms this ruling as a boon for the industry. \u201cThe outcome of the ruling that \u2018functionality test\u2019 should be applied on buildings to determine whether the same qualify as plant is very positive for the industry. With this ruling, by applying the functionality test, if one is able to prove the nexus/ role a particular product with the business of a taxpayer, credit should ideally be admissible\u201d said Harpreet Singh, Partner at Deloitte. \u201cThe eligibility of input tax credit (ITC) will be determined based on the functionality and essentiality tests,\u201d explained Abhishek A. Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who represented multiple petitioners in the case before the Supreme Court. \u201cIn essence, the Court has effectively read down the provisions of Section 17(5)(c) and (d) of the GST Act. ITC can only be denied in situations where the nature of the taxpayer\u2019s business and the claimed credits fail to satisfy these two critical tests. Post this ruling, there will be no requirement to amend the law. According to Rohit Jain, Deputy Managing Partner at Economic Laws Practice, the top Court has upheld the existing provisions and interpreted that building for leasing qualifies as a \u201cplant\u201d and no restriction of ITC is applicable. \u201cThere is no need to make any changes in the law,\u201d he said. Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co felt by reiterating this broader principle in the context of GST, the Supreme Court has given a lot of hope to taxpayers across the country, especially those whose input costs include substantial construction expenses. \u201cCompanies in the commercial real estate as well as infrastructure sectors will do well to review their input credit positions in the light of this judgment,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "SC permits input tax credits on construction expenses for leased buildings",
        "text": "In a development that may encourage increased investment in commercial real estate, the Supreme Court granted the industry relief on Thursday by permitting the application of input tax credits (ITC) on construction expenses for commercial buildings meant for leasing.\"If the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, which are covered by clauses (2) and (5) of Schedule II of the CGST Act, the building could be held to be a plant,\" said Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol.This ruling is anticipated to ease the financial strain of rent on tenants occupying commercial spaces. Real estate companies stand to gain, as buildings can now be categorised as plant and machinery. Additionally, this advantage is not limited to commercial real estate; various industries will also be able to claim ITC on rentals for commercial properties. The ruling suggests that the ITC benefit will be available retroactively.\u201cThis is an important decision that could have wide ramifications for industries, particularly hotels, infrastructure, and logistics, including warehousing. While the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of restrictions relating to input credit on construction-related procurements, it has been held that whether a building constitutes 'plant or machinery' needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis,\u201d said Pratik Jain, Partner, PwC India.\u201cIt means that where it falls under this category, credit would be allowed. It will be interesting to see if the government considers amending the GST laws after this decision,\u201d added Jain.Experts believe that although the constitutional challenge was dismissed, the acceptance of the taxpayer\u2019s submission under Section 17(5)(d) is a positive outcome, potentially lowering the financial burden on developers and fostering greater investment in commercial real estate.\u201cThe real estate industry should carefully evaluate the implications of this ruling on ITC eligibility for outward supplies related to rental income. Given the Supreme Court's decision, it would be prudent for the GST Council to issue clarifications allowing real estate players to claim ITC on rental income,\u201d said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY India.Tax experts also pointed out that the question now arises whether this ruling would also apply to factory buildings, jetties, storage tanks, etc.\u201cThe applicability will depend on the specifics of each case. In the Safari Retreats case, the petitioner retained the property and leased it out rather than using it for personal purposes. In contrast, factory buildings, storage tanks, etc. are typically used by the registered person for their own operations. Therefore, once the detailed ruling is available, it will be crucial to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether ITC related to factory buildings, storage tanks, etc., will be allowed. If ITC is permitted, it will be important to understand the circumstances under which it can be claimed,\u201d said Agarwal.Tax experts also believe that GST laws generally do not allow the benefit of input credit/set-off of GST costs incurred on the input side for the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, with very few exceptions. This often results in additional GST costs for service providers whose primary input-side investment is in immoveable property, such as malls/commercial real estate players, port or airport service providers, and LNG terminal operators.Background of the caseIn the case of Safari Retreats, a mall owner approached the Orissa High Court, arguing that when a mall is being built for providing commercial rental services for the shop spaces therein, there should be no restriction on availing input credit/set-off for the GST cost incurred on the said construction. The Orissa High Court upheld this argument, and the GST authorities subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court. Several similar matters eventually reached the Supreme Court, leading to the formation of a large batch of matters on this legal point. Some of these newer matters also challenged the constitutional validity of such a restriction on input GST credit. Today, the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment\u2014while it has rejected the constitutional validity of the restriction, it upheld the conclusions of the Orissa High Court and, among other things, held that input credit will be allowed if the construction activity is for \u2018plant\u2019 or \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201cThis is a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court. While determining whether a mall, hotel, jetty, breakwater, or warehouse qualifies as \u2018plant or machinery\u2019 will remain a factual question (potentially leading to a second round of litigation), the greatest positive is that the Court has categorically held that there is no blanket restriction against input credit/set-off of the GST cost incurred on the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, especially when the said structure itself is integral to providing the output services in question,\u201d said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Signs of financial sector froth",
        "text": "The Indian equity market is on a high: again. On August 1, Nifty 50, the benchmark index for the Indian equity market, hit the \u201825000\u2019 mark. The jump from 24000 to 25000 took just 24 trading sessions. By September 24, it soared past \u201826000\u2019. This unbridled bull run has, in fact, characterised the Indian equity markets since the March 2020. However, now the bullish frenzy has regulators concerned. On March 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch, underlined the \u2018stretched valuations\u2019 of small and mid-cap stocks, iterating there are \u201cpockets of froth\u201d in the market. On July 22, she shared her concerns about speculative trading in F&O segment and losses made by retail traders in this segment. Latest reports suggest, SEBI is all set to tighten regulation to curb retail frenzy in equity options. Are the concerns of the regulator regarding a \u2018froth\u2019 in the market valid? Chart 1 shows the six global markets: Nifty 50, India (NSEI), Dow Jones, United States (DJI), German Index (GDAXI), Bovespa Index, Brazil (BVSP), and SSE Composite Index, China (000001.SS) from 2015 to 2024. For every market, we can see a sharp rally post the pandemic, an uncertain correction in 2022 and a sharper rally from late 2022 onwards. However, for both DJI and Nifty 50 (top two panels), the bullish spree in the last two years is extraordinarily strong. The market capitalisation (mcap) as percentage of GDP (Buffet indicator) suggests the Indian markets are overvalued. The Buffet indicator for India increased substantially from 2019 to 2022, a pattern which matches the US\u2019 (Table 1). India\u2019s mcap-to-GDP ratio reached a 15-year high of 140.2 per cent in May 2024. Values of the Buffet indicator above 100 is, by itself, an indicator of overvaluation but with values skirting 150 per cent, the financial sector has, it seems, decided to grow on its own. The concerns of the regulator about \u2018froth\u2019 in the market are evidently not unfounded. What is leading to the continued bullish frenzy? For one, the retail market participants have entered the stock markets in a big way post Covid, especially in India. Moreover, there are concerns that credit growth in the real sector could be finding a route to the equity market. Table 2 presents the growth in the US and Indian equity markets during different monetary policy phases of the US Federal Reserve, broadly matched by central banks of major markets. Expansionary phase The sharp rally in both the markets post Covid coincides with the expansionary phase. From May 2022, Federal Reserve increased interest rates responding to inflationary pressures, leading to some correction: for both DJI and Nifty 50, we see markets returns fall during contractionary phase. However, with the rate hike paused from September 2023, the markets rallied sharply again. With the Fed\u2019s decision to slash interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, we are looking at another expansionary phase, which may stretch valuations on the upside. How will the financialisation impact the real economy? The symptoms of overvaluation bring forth concerns about financialisation: proliferation of financial assets and financial market growth unrelated to the real sector growth. First, financialisation makes companies more concerned about \u2018share-holder value creation\u2019 than real capital accumulation. Financialisation can lead to \u2018distribute and disinvest\u2019 rather than \u2018retain and reinvest\u2019 for firms, which will jeopardize the real capital accumulation and employment generation. Speculative surge Second, the retail participation in the F&O segment and growth in intra-day trading shows the inclination to use the equity market for speculative gains rather than for long-term investment. This can be detrimental to retail participants\u2019 long-term saving behaviour, and adversely impact saving rates in the economy. Furthermore, if the participation in the stock market is leveraged, a market crash can lead to substantial erosion of wealth for retail investors. The Union Budget in 2024, increased short-term capital gains tax (STCG) and introduced a flat long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) across asset classes, discouraging short-term churning of portfolios. But have the market participants, especially the younger retail traders, taken the cue? Going ahead, regulatory measures should not only discourage leveraged trading, but also create awareness on appropriate risk management strategies for intra-day trading and the pitfalls of shorter-term churning for long term financial goals. \u2018Nudges\u2019 may be more effective than overt paternalism in guiding younger retail participants.

        "text": "Swift, the global financial messaging provider, announced on Thursday that it will begin trialing transactions involving digital currencies and assets on its secure network starting in 2025. This marks a notable step toward the gradual integration of digital assets into the broader financial system.Headquartered in Belgium, Swift is a member-owned cooperative that connects over 11,500 banks, securities organisations, and corporations across more than 200 countries, enabling the secure exchange of standardised financial messages. Although Swift does not hold or manage funds, its network allows financial institutions to communicate, facilitating global and local financial transactions. This initiative aims to demonstrate how Swift can support the movement of diverse types of value \u2014 whether digital or traditional \u2014 across over four billion accounts in 200 countries and territories.Bridging digital and traditional currenciesThe pilot programme will involve central and commercial banks, exploring how Swift\u2019s existing infrastructure can facilitate transactions of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets alongside traditional money. Initial use cases will include payments, foreign exchange (FX), securities, and trade-related transactions. A particular focus will be on enabling Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) and Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) transactions across different digital ledgers.In the release, Tom Zschach, Swift\u2019s chief innovation officer, emphasised the need for digital assets and currencies to coexist with traditional money. \u201cWith Swift\u2019s vast global reach, we are uniquely positioned to bridge both emerging and established forms of value,\u201d Zschach stated. \u201cAs new forms of value emerge, our intention is to continue offering our community the ability to seamlessly make and track transactions of all kinds of assets.\u201dRole of CBDCs in tokenised assetsTokenisation, the process of converting traditional assets such as bonds into digital units or blockchain-based tokens, has been explored by banks and asset managers for several years. The hope is that tokenised assets will make trading more efficient, reducing costs and removing intermediaries. Despite these ambitions, tokenisation has yet to gain significant traction in mainstream markets. The tokenised asset market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, the company said.CBDCs, digital versions of a country\u2019s official fiat currency, are also being trialled worldwide. According to recent data, around 90 per cent of the world\u2019s central banks are currently experimenting with CBDCs. These digital currencies aim to support the trading of tokenised assets and are a response to technological advances that have led to the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.SWIFT, a key player in the global financial system, has been actively involved in trials of both CBDCs and tokenised assets. In March, it announced plans to launch a platform that would connect developing CBDCs to the traditional financial system, ensuring a seamless transition between digital and traditional forms of money..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

The benchmark Sensex surged 729.46 points or 0.88 per cent to 83,226.56 at 12.31 PM, while the Nifty climbed 191.80 points or 0.76 per cent to 25,441.90. This upward momentum comes after a weak start, with markets opening lower for the fifth consecutive session due to geopolitical tensions and foreign institutional investor (FII) selling. The Sensex had opened at 82,244.25, down from its previous close of 82,497.10. The market breadth remained positive, with 2,284 stocks advancing against 1,529 declines on the BSE. 174 stocks hit 52-week highs, while 50 touched 52-week lows. 292 stocks reached the upper circuit limit, and 222 hit the lower circuit.

On the flip side, Cipla (-1.42 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (-1.33 per cent), Shriram Finance (-1.13 per cent), BPCL (-1.10 per cent), and Apollo Hospitals (-0.86 per cent) were the top losers. Sectoral indices also showed strength, with the Nifty Bank up 453.30 points or 0.87 per cent at 52,298.50, and Nifty Financial Services gaining 135.35 points or 0.57 per cent to 24,016.90. The Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap Select indices rose 0.31 per cent and 0.26 per cent respectively. The market\u2019s reversal comes despite ongoing concerns about the Iran-Israel conflict and its potential impact on crude oil prices, which could affect inflation and India\u2019s fiscal deficit. Earlier in the day, experts had pointed to global factors, including FII withdrawals to cheaper markets like Hong Kong, as reasons for the initial weakness. Investors are now closely watching US job data and further geopolitical developments for cues on market direction. The sharp intraday turnaround suggests a possible change in sentiment, although it remains to be seen if this momentum will sustain until market close at 3.30 PM. As trading continues, market participants will be keenly observing whether key support levels can be maintained and if the recovery can offset the losses from previous sessions.",

        "text": "Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, the latest entrant in the Gemini family of artificial intelligence (AI) models, is now generally available for production use. On Thursday, Google announced the general availability of the model, highlighting that it was a smaller and faster version of the Gemini 1.5 Flash which was introduced at Google I/O. Due to being fast, it has a low latency inference and more efficient output generation. More importantly, the tech giant stated that the Flash-8B AI model is the \u201clowest cost per intelligence of any Gemini model\u201d. Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B Now Generally Available In a developer blog post, the Mountain View-based tech giant detailed the new AI model. The Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B was distilled from the Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model, which was focused on faster processing and more efficient output generation. The company now claims that Google DeepMind developed this even smaller and faster version of the AI model in the last few months. Despite being a smaller model, the tech giant claims that it \u201cnearly matches\u201d the performance of the 1.5 Flash model across multiple benchmarks. Some of these include chat, transcription, and long context language translation.You Might Soon Be Able to Share Images Directly With Google's Gemini App One major benefit of the AI model is its price effectiveness. Google said that the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B will offer the lowest token pricing in the Gemini family. Developers will have to pay $0.15 (roughly Rs. 12.5) per one million output tokens, $0.0375 (roughly Rs. 3) per one million input tokens, and $0.01 (roughly Rs. 0.8) per one million tokens on cached prompts. Additionally, Google is doubling the rate limits of the 1.5 Flash-8B AI model. Now, developers can send up to 4,000 requests per minute (RPM) while using this model. Explaining the decision, the tech giant stated that the model is suited for simple, high-volume tasks. Developers who wish to try out the model can do so via Google AI Studio and the Gemini API free of charge. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "The rupee traded on a flat note and settled at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday as surging crude oil prices amid volatile geopolitics weighed on the local unit, while the Reserve Bank intervened to prevent the domestic currency from touching its lowest level. Forex traders said a weak American currency against major Asian rivals as well as the RBI's move to sell dollars supported the local unit. However, it was weighed down by weak domestic equity markets and unabated outflow of foreign funds. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.96 and moved between a narrow range of 83.93 and 83.97 against the greenback. The unit failed to recover from its deep plunge witnessed in previous sessions, and ended flat at 83.96 (provisional) against the dollar. On Thursday, the rupee slid 14 paise to settle at 83.96 against the American currency. The unit had touched its all-time low of 84.09 on August 5. Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said the rupee traded nearly flat amid reports of the Reserve Bank of India selling dollars in the short-term offshore markets, which prevented the Indian currency from hitting a new record low. However, weak domestic markets, a strong dollar and a surge in crude oil prices weighed on the rupee. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"FII outflows and elevated crude oil prices may further pressurise the rupee. Traders may take cues from non-farm payrolls report from the US. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.11 per cent to 101.87. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.12 per cent to $78.49 in futures trade. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex extended its sharp loss from the previous session and crashed another 808.65 points, or 0.98 per cent, to settle at 81,688.45. The Nifty also tanked 200.25 points, or 0.79 per cent to close the session at 25,049.85. Both the indices had tumbled over 2 per cent on Thursday. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Thursday, offloading shares worth \u20b915,243.27 crore on a net basis in the cash segment, according to exchange data. FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b930,000 crore since Monday as they turned bullish towards the Chinese market, betting on various economic stimulus measures announced by the country. Meanwhile, a monthly survey released on Friday showed India's services sector activity fell to a 10-month low in September as new business, international sales and output growth moderated. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services Business Activity Index fell from 60.9 in August to 57.7 in September, indicating that the output registered an increase, but at the slowest rate since November 2023.",

        "text": "By delivering a political speech at the inaugural ceremony of Dasara, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and chief guest litterateur Dr. Hampa Nagarajaiah have desecrated the holy shrine and ruined the sanctity of Nada Habba: MLC A.H. Vishwanath Mysuru: MLC A.H. Vishwanath has strongly criticised the political speeches made during the inauguration of Dasara-2024 atop Chamundi Hill yesterday, asserting that the event lost its sanctity due to the political undertones. Speaking to reporters at Jaladarshini Guest House here this morning, he stated that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah exploited the traditional Dasara inauguration to advance his political agenda. \u201cCM Siddaramaiah, who once spoke lightly of the Gods, has now sought the blessings of Goddess Chamundeshwari, the presiding deity of Mysuru,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dasara inauguration yesterday devolved into a political platform, with CM Siddaramaiah, MLA G.T. Devegowda (GTD), and even the inaugurator, Dr. Hampana, delivering speeches laden with political tones. It was more of a political event than a devotional one,\u201d Vishwanath lamented. He noted that the speakers, focused on their political agendas, overlooked the rich history of Nada Habba Dasara. \u201cDasara has shifted from being a public celebration to a political affair,\u201d he stated, adding that politicians have brought Dasara to a new low. Is GTD a MUDA beneficiary? Regarding MLA G.T. Devegowda\u2019s (GTD) praise for Siddaramaiah, he described it as mere flattery and theatrics. \u201cOne must wonder whether GTD is a beneficiary of the MUDA scam,\u201d he remarked, implying that the MLA\u2019s unnecessary adulation of the CM raises suspicions about his own connections to several MUDA sites. \u201cGTD turned the entire inauguration into a farce, and there is no excuse for this. The function became hypocritical, with everyone patting themselves on the back. It is truly unfortunate that nobody took the time to speak about Goddess Chamundeshwari, the erstwhile Mysuru Maharajas, or the glory of Dasara,\u201d he regretted. He further noted that Union Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has appointed a Non-Vokkaliga leader (C.B. Sureshbabu of the Kuruba community) as the Legislative Party leader of the JD(S), fearing that appointing a Vokkaliga leader might be detrimental to the party in the future. Vishwanath pointed out that no one from the Opposition has explicitly declared intentions to topple the State government, asserting that the Government is propagating this false narrative to protect itself amid the MUDA scam and divert public attention from it. Netas sullied Mysuru\u2019s reputation The MLC questioned whether Siddaramaiah had overlooked the verdict delivered by Justice M. Nagaprasanna, emphasising that the CM\u2019s wife wrote an emotional letter expressing her intention to return the 14 sites just hours after the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s intervention. He maintained that returning the sites does not erase the wrongdoing, arguing that the offence remains even if it is acknowledged. Vishwanath expressed scepticism about GTD\u2019s sudden vocal support for the CM, noting that the MLA has remained silent on the issue until now and allegedly possesses multiple MUDA sites himself. \u201cPoliticians are responsible for tarnishing Mysuru\u2019s reputation. There must be an investigation into all MUDA site allocations, and previous MUDA Commissioners should face imprisonment for their misconduct,\u201d he declared. MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority He further questioned the current MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority to cancel the Khata of the returned sites while the case is still under judicial review. \u201cSiddaramaiah should first read the 197-page verdict from the High Court. A thorough investigation into the entire MUDA scam is necessary. The current MUDA Commissioner must also be held accountable for hastily cancelling the Khata of the returned sites without properly examining the process,\u201d he stated, challenging the Commissioner\u2019s powers to unilaterally annul the Khata. Vishwanath argued that Siddaramaiah\u2019s remarks seem to suggest he operates above the law, accusing him of undermining the rule of law. He added that the Lokayukta case against Siddaramaiah cannot be withdrawn unilaterally, even after the CM\u2019s wife returned the 14 sites.",

While airlines have been relying on AI for preventive maintenance or improving passenger experience, integrating a risk management platform will help IndiGo adjust its flight schedules proactively and minimise disruptions during emergencies. New tools for the new world This is especially crucial as aviation continues to be affected by global conflicts such as those in West Asia and Ukraine. Airlines have been forced to reroute or cancel flights due to these ongoing conflicts.

This will also help to improve the credit-deposit (C/D) ratio, according to the ratings agency ICRA. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had earlier expressed concern over the high C/D ratio for some lenders and sought a review of business models.Abhishek Dafria, group head, structured finance, ICRA, said the securitisation market\u2014pass-through certificates (PTCs) plus assignment\u2014witnessed an extraordinary quarter in Q2 FY25, with volumes touching Rs 60,000 crore. About 35 per cent of the volumes originated from private sector banks, which have dived into the securitisation market to improve their credit-deposit ratio given the relatively slower pace of deposit accretion, he added.The country\u2019s largest private lender, HDFC Bank, securitised new car loans worth Rs 9,063 crore through a PTC transaction where mutual funds were key investors. India Ratings has assigned an \"AAA\" rating to this asset-backed securities transaction.\"Regular issuances by large institutions will provide a fillip to the securitisation market, boost investor confidence\u2014including that of foreign portfolio investors\u2014while proactive regulatory guardrails will ensure financial market stability,\u201d said Jatin Nanaware, senior director, India Ratings.Besides banks, ICRA said non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) would also continue to raise funding through securitisation as they diversify their borrowing liabilities and improve their asset-liability management (ALM). The sustenance of volume growth in the coming quarters, however, remains to be seen, given the appetite for large-size transactions, as seen in Q2, may be limited. The securitisation volumes may reach Rs 2.1 trillion in the current financial year (FY25), Dafria of ICRA said.HDFC Bank securitised Rs 19,200 crore of loans as a strategic initiative to lower its high credit to deposit ratio (CD ratio)..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Increase in thermal stress and humidity due to climate change have turned out to be major factors contributing to infertility in dairy cows, posing a serious challenge to livestock farmers. Reportedly, more than 40% of cows slaughtered in Kerala are infertile and in order to address the issue the Animal Husbandry department will establish Regional Livestock Fertility Management Centres (RLFMC) across the State. A first of its kind initiative in Kerala, the project implemented through the Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) will provide multiple treatment options including IVF (in vitro fertilisation) to the farmers. \u201cA large percentage of infertility cases can be corrected. The RLMFC will take cases referred by department veterinarians and normally cows that fail to get pregnant after three sessions of Artificial Insemination (AI) will be considered,\u201d says R. Rajeev, managing director, KLDB. State-of-the-art facilities Each centre will have a mobile unit with state-of-the-art facilities for embryo transfer process, providing doorstep service to the farmers. It will be led by a team of experts, who will assess the cow\u2019s living conditions, feed, health and case history. While treatment for nutritional and hormonal problems will start immediately, some issues will require an extended period to be addressed. In the meantime, the RLFMC team will use software to collect and examine the data of each case and give instructions to the farmers. While infertility causes considerable losses for farmers, it also impacts Kerala\u2019s goal of attaining self-sufficiency in milk production. \u201cThe expense for producing an embryo and transferring it will come to around \u20b96,000. We mainly target heifers as chances of hormonal imbalance are higher in cows. Heifers are ideal carriers for embryo transfer,\u201d says Mr. Rajeev. The centres also offer the provision to opt for quality embryos if the cows are not superior breed. \u201cThe ovum can be taken from any other cow or the farmer can also opt for quality embryos produced by us. The mobile lab will assess fertility issues in cows and also carry out embryo transfers,\u201d he adds. A joint initiative of the State and the Centre, the RLFMCs will come up at Chithara in Kollam and Thalayolaparambu in Kottayam in the initial phase. Minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development J. Chinchurani will inaugurate State\u2019s first RLFMC in Kollam on Saturday.",

        "title": "254,000 jobs added in September as US economic growth holds steady: Report",
        "text": "The US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far surpassing expectations and alleviating concerns about a faltering job market, as per the US Department of Labor. The report has also beaten Wall Street's expectations of a substantial interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the New York Post.Unemployment rate dropsThe unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%, down from 4.2% the previous month, while hourly earnings rose by 4% year-on-year. Consensus estimates had predicted a gain of 150,000 jobs, a modest increase from the 142,000 reported for August. The unemployment rate had previously shown slight fluctuations, falling from an unexpected rise to 4.3% in July.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that further interest rate cuts are likely, but he emphasised a gradual approach designed to support a healthy economy. At the Fed's last meeting on September 18, officials reduced the rate to 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, and projected two additional quarter-point cuts in November and December.\u201cIf the economy performs as expected, that would mean two more cuts this year,\u201d Powell said.Private sector growthData from ADP showed that private sector companies added 143,000 jobs in September, surpassing analysts' estimates of 125,000 and marking a rebound from August's figure of 99,000. This increase ended a streak of five consecutive months of job declines.Despite these positive signs, there are indications of a weakening job market. The Labour Department reported that the quits rate, a crucial measure of worker confidence, fell to 1.9% in August, the lowest since June 2020. The hiring rate also declined to 3.3%, down from 3.4% in July, the weakest rate since August 2013, excluding the pandemic.Low layoffsPayroll growth across most sectors suggests fewer layoffs, although hiring has slowed due to reduced demand following the Federal Reserve's rate hikes of 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% last month, following a 0.5% rise in August, while year-on-year wages rose by 4.0%, up from 3.9% in August. This strong wage growth makes it unlikely that the US central bank will implement another half-percentage-point rate cut at its meeting on November 6-7.ChallengesThe labour market continues to add jobs at a steady pace, allowing Americans to maintain confidence and spending, which supports the economy. However, the hiring rate has slowed significantly, with an average of 116,000 jobs added monthly from June through August, marking the weakest three-month stretch since mid-2020.However, the economy has remained resilient, growing at a 3% annual pace from April to June, boosted by consumer spending and business investments. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta indicates a growth rate of 2.5% for the July-September quarter.Economic concerns weigh heavily on voters as the presidential election on November 5 approaches. While many Americans appreciate the job market's resilience, high prices continue to frustrate them, remaining approximately 19% above levels recorded in February 2021 when inflation began surging.",
        "summary": "The US economy experienced significant job growth last month, adding 254,000 jobs and reducing the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Despite a slowdown in the hiring rate and worker confidence, wage growth remains strong, making further substantial rate cuts from the Federal Reserve unlikely.",

        "text": "Gold has always been a haven both for investors and borrowers. Even in recent times, gold loans are becoming increasingly popular for those seeking quick financial assistance. They allow borrowers to leverage their gold jewellery to secure funds without the need for extensive complicated documentation or a perfect credit score. Moreover, gold loan interest rates are generally lower than unsecured loans, making them a cost-effective borrowing option. Understanding the various benefits of a gold loan is essential, if an individual is planning on availing one. This can significantly improve one's overall borrowing experience. Bajaj Finance Gold Loan All about the gold loan A gold loan is a secured loan where individuals can pledge their 18-22 karat gold jewellery as collateral to obtain funds. This type of loan offers numerous benefits, including: Quick processing Gold loans are typically processed much faster than traditional loans, with many lenders offering instant approvals. This rapid turnaround can be a lifesaver for those facing unexpected expenses. Higher loan amounts Borrowers can receive loans based on the value of the gold pledged, often up to 75% of its market value. This flexibility allows individuals to secure the exact amount they need without overcommitting. No need for perfect credit score Since gold acts as collateral, lenders are more lenient regarding the borrowers credit history. This makes gold loans an attractive option for those who may struggle to secure other types of financing due to a lower CIBIL score. Reasons to choose Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan There are multiple lenders in the market that one can choose from. However, here are some reasons that make Bajaj Finance a preferable choice for many borrowers: Quick loan processing Bajaj Finance processes gold loans quickly, allowing borrowers to get the funds they need without delays. This is particularly helpful when funding immediate expenses, such as medical bills or urgent repairs. Minimal documentation Borrowers can secure a substantial loan amount by submitting their basic KYC documents like Aadhaar card, Voter ID, driving licence, passport, letter from NPR or NREGA job card. High loan amount One can get a loan starting from \u00e2\u0082\u00b95,000 to \u00e2\u0082\u00b92 crore, depending on the value of the gold pledged, gold loan interest rate, and the borrowers liquidity requirements. This makes it possible for individuals to meet their financial needs, whether big or small. Convenient repayment options With multiple repayment plans, borrowers can choose a schedule that suits their financial situation, making it easier to manage repayments. This flexibility ensures that borrowers can stay on top of their finances without feeling overwhelmed. Zero part-prepayment fee Bajaj Finance does not levy any part-prepayment fees, allowing borrowers to save on unnecessary administrative costs when they clear their loans early. This feature is especially beneficial for those who might receive windfalls or bonuses and wish to reduce their debt. Complimentary insurance on gold assets When opting for a loan with Bajaj Finance, pledging gold is insured for free, providing added peace of mind. This safeguard ensures that borrowers do not have to worry about the security of their valuable assets while they are being used as collateral. Steps to apply for a Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan Applying for a gold loan with Bajaj Finance is pretty simple.

        "title": "Insurance Query: Evaluating business-owners\u2019 financial stability",
        "text": "I am 42 years old. I run my own business. I wish to buy life insurance, but I don\u2019t get salary slips, which is an important document to buy a policy. How can I get covered? Congratulations on taking the important step of considering life insurance. It is an essential tool to secure the future of your dependents and safeguard your business interests. Insurance providers understand that entrepreneurs and business-owners like yourself have different financial structures and offer various alternative ways to evaluate your financial stability. There are several options available to you: Bank statements: Your bank statements can offer a clear picture of your financial health and stability. As a business-owner, your transactional history and cash flow from your primary bank account (reasonably reflecting your business and savings) will serve as proof of income. By examining your regular deposits and business-related transactions, we can get a comprehensive understanding of your financial standing. A 12-month record of your bank statements is typically sufficient to demonstrate your financial viability. Using account aggregators, your bank statements can be verified digitally with your consent, with your mobile number and an OTP. Income tax returns (ITR): Another excellent option is your ITR. They reflect your declared income over time and are particularly useful for self-employed individuals or business owners whose income may fluctuate. Your ITR provides consistency, helping us determine an accurate picture of your earning capacity. This is a reliable document for underwriting purposes, giving us the confidence to offer you a suitable insurance policy. Vahan portal: If you own a vehicle, we can retrieve information from the Vahan Dashboard, a government database of registered vehicles. These data help us assess your assets and overall financial position. While vehicle ownership may not directly indicate your full financial strength, it adds another dimension to your profile, further enriching the financial underwriting process. Credit history: Your credit history \u2014 whether through credit card transactions, personal loans, or business loans \u2014 can be accessed via credit bureaus based on your PAN. This allows us to assess your financial behaviour, creditworthiness, and ability to manage financial obligations. A strong credit score is a key indicator of financial health and can significantly strengthen your life insurance application. GST details: As a business-owner, your goods and services tax (GST) filings can be another surrogate for salary slips. GST returns provide insight into your business\u2019 turnover and profitability, helping us assess your financial standing and stability. If your business is registered under GST, sharing your filings can help us tailor your insurance coverage based on your business performance. Other ways In rare cases, when the above financial surrogates may not fully establish your eligibility, there are still ways to secure a policy. Insurers are often open to considering other financial assets you may own, such as property, investments or business assets, that can demonstrate your financial strength. Flexibility is key, and we believe that every customer deserves a thorough and fair evaluation. Points to note You can present any asset you own \u2014 property, mutual funds, fixed deposits, or business assets. All of these contribute to demonstrating your financial health for the purposes of underwriting. Always provide clear, accurate and up-to-date financial documents. This ensures a smooth, hassle-free process with no delays in securing your life insurance policy. Since every individual\u2019s financial situation is unique, especially for business-owners like yourself, insurance companies now offer policies designed specifically for entrepreneurs and other self-employed individuals.

        "title": "RBI survey indicates slowdown in manufacturing",
        "text": "The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) latest quarterly industrial outlook survey of 1,300 manufacturing companies reveals that manufacturing companies are witnessing a slowing growth in the first and second quarter of 2024-25. This is also mirrored in manufacturing PMI which is tapering downwards.\n\nAccording to RBI survey data, the net response (difference in the percentage of companies reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism) regarding production output has decreased from 27.9 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 22.9 per cent in Q2 2024-25. The number was 34.4 in the fourth quarter of FY24. This implies that more manufacturers witnessed slowdown in production this fiscal. One concern is that the companies polled indicated a steep fall in growth expectation of production output in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal.\n\nThe RBI survey report states that the pressure from raw material costs, financing expenses, and salary payments has eased. As a result, expectations of growth in selling prices and profit margins have also softened. \u201cManufacturers polled for better expectations on production, order books, employment, capacity utilisation and overall business situation during Q4:2024-25 and Q1:2025-26. Input cost pressures are likely to continue for manufacturers, who expect to retain pricing power and increase in selling prices on the back of robust demand conditions,\u201d the survey report reads.\n\nGeopolitical strife\n\nRamendra Verma, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat says, \u201cThiscan be attributed to a chain reaction of geo-political situation, which has resulted in supply chain disruptions leading to high inputs costs (for e.g. \u2013 energy and semiconductors). This is also leading to weakening of demand.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, net responses for order book growth dropped 25.6 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 19.5 per cent in Q2 2024-25, while net responses for pending orders increased from 5.9 per cent to 8 per cent in the same period. Similarly, net responses for capacity utilisation fell from 18.7 per cent to 15.1 per cent.\n\nVerma outlined several factors contributing to the low net responses for order books, such as declining consumer confidence and reduced spending, which have led to fewer new orders. Additionally, global economic uncertainties have made businesses reluctant to place large orders. \u201cMany manufacturers are operating below capacity due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions,\u201d Verma explained, adding that this under-utilisation is also linked to more cautious inventory management practices.\n\nSujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, pointed out that the slower growth in related indicators aligns with the decline in industrial production. In Q1 FY25, capacity utilisation dropped after surpassing 75 per cent in the final quarter of the previous fiscal. \u201cOne of the reasons for lower utilisation was elections which usually disrupts activity along with heatwaves especially in the north. This was also highlighted in the PMI survey which indicated some of the factories remained shut due to excessive heat,\u201d Hajra added. \n\nThe monthly Purchasing Managers Index for India\u2019s manufacturing sector has also shown a downward trend. It was reported at 58.8 in April 2024, remained relatively stable at 58.3 in June, but declined slightly to 57.5 in August 2024, and further dropped to 56.5 in September 2024.\n\nThe global market research firm Nomura\u2019s report indicates a similar weakening outlook. \u201cEven as the pace of government spending picks up in coming months and base effects become more favourable, we expect growth momentum to remain soft, due to fading urban pent-up demand, tight monetary policy, a moderation in credit growth, negative real rural wage growth, sluggish private capex and soft external demand,\u201d the Nomura report says.",

They will stay put for two days and public entry to MUDA Office has been restricted.\n\nThe investigation focuses on the controversial allotment of 14 sites to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah\u2019s wife, B.M. Parvathi, along with other irregularities related to 50:50 site allocations, alternative sites and compensatory sites. Social activist Snehamayi Krishna has complained to the ED that irregularities worth Rs. 4,000 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore has happened in MUDA.\n\nThe team, accompanied by armed personnel, travelled from Bengaluru\u2019s Shantinagar Office and arrived at MUDA gate around 10.45 am. More than 20 armed personnel from Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have provided security to the ED sleuths. The Mysuru City Police are providing additional security.\n\nAfter their arrival, an ED representative informed the Police officers on duty at MUDA gate that they were from ED in Bengaluru. Upon hearing the update, MUDA Commissioner A.N. Raghunandan promptly arrived at the gate to welcome the ED officers. Subsequently, the sleuths proceeded directly to the MUDA Commissioner\u2019s chamber on second floor, where they began discussions in the antechamber around 11.30 am.\n\nAn Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Siddaramaiah, Parvathi and others, revolving around allegations of illegal money transfers linked to the land allotments.\n\nRaid at Kengeri home\n\nSources informed Star of Mysore that the ED team also conducted a raid at the residence of J. Devaraju in Kengeri, Bengaluru. Devaraju was the individual who sold the 3.16-acre land at Kesare to B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy, Parvathi\u2019s brother. Mallikarjunaswamy later gifted the land to Parvathi, in exchange for which she received 14 sites in the Vijayanagar Third and Fourth Stages under a 50:50 ratio.\n\nAfter a brief discussion in the antechamber of the Commissioner\u2019s Office, the ED sleuths proceeded to MUDA Chairman\u2019s Office. Chairman K. Marigowda has already resigned from his post. The officers then moved to the meeting room adjacent to Chairman\u2019s Office, where they held discussions with senior officials.\n\nWill cooperate: MUDA Secretary\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the MUDA Office around 12.15 pm, MUDA Secretary Prasanna Kumar stated that the ED has officially commenced its investigation. \u201cWe will cooperate with the sleuths and provide whatever information they request. All documents will be made available, and there will be no public work for two days,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked how much longer the ED sleuths intend to remain in Mysuru, the MUDA Secretary replied that, for now, they would stay for two days. \u201cDepending on their progress, their stay might be extended. Ultimately, it is for them to decide, and I have no role to play in that matter,\u201d he added.\n\nSeeking documents\n\nBefore arriving in Mysuru, the ED had instructed MUDA to submit all the crucial documents related to the case, which forms the basis of the FIR (11/2024) registered by the Lokayukta against Siddaramaiah, his wife Parvathi, his brother-in-law B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy and landowner J. Devaraju.\n\nLokayukta Police have already launched a detailed investigation, examining alleged offences spanning from 1968 to 2023. Teams are tracing records dating as far back as 1935, when Ninga, father of Devaraju, originally owned the disputed land in Kesare\u2019s survey numbers 462 and 464.",

        "title": "Why this small-cap real estate and EPC company is a worthy buy",
        "text": "Both the construction and infrastructure industries have taken off strongly in the post-Covid period. Residential real estate and commercial construction have been on overdrive over the past three-four years. Infrastructure projects such as ports have been in the limelight for a while now and continue to see considerable traction.\n\nAs a play on these segments, Man Infraconstruction (Man Infra) has been a key beneficiary of the offtake in the real estate and construction businesses.\n\nThe company focuses on residential construction and infrastructure projects (ports). It takes an EPC (engineering, procurement and contracting/construction) approach in its infrastructure business as well as select real estate projects. \n\nIn the residential construction segment, Man Infra takes the joint development agreement (JDA), joint venture (JV), development manager (DM) and society redevelopment approaches, which ensure that the upfront investments are minimal and margins are healthy. It is focused on the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in its residential towers projects.\n\nAt \u20b9190, the stock trades at 23 times its per share earnings for FY24 and 19 times its likely per share earnings for FY25. This is among the lowest valuation multiples commanded by any real estate or construction company with mid-sized operations. The BSE Realty trades at a PE of nearly 65 times, while most frontline and mid-sized real estate players trade at price-earnings multiples of 30-70 times. \n\nA track record of strong execution of projects, expertise in residential, commercial properties, as well as ports, multiple revenue streams via a low-risk, asset-light business model and a net-debt-free balance sheet are positives for Man Infra. The company has both private and public sector clients.\n\nThe stock has corrected about 20 per cent from its recent high and presents a reasonably attractive opportunity. Investors with a two-three-year perspective can buy the shares of the company at the current price. \n\nBetween FY22 and FY24, the company\u2019s revenues grew at a compounded annual rate of 43.5 per cent to \u20b91,263.5 crore in FY24, while net profits rose at nearly 111 per cent annually to \u20b9300.4 crore. It enjoys an EBITDA margin of 25.8 per cent in FY24, which is among the best in the industry.\n\nDiversified operating model\n\nMan Infra has been in the construction business for nearly 60 years now. It has specialised capabilities in the ports business. It has helped in the development of eight major ports in India including those of Navi Mumbai, Chennai, Gujarat Pipavav, Mundra and Kochi. It has also been an EPC contractor for leading infrastructure companies and real estate developers. \n\nIn the last several years, Man Infra has been able to up its game in the residential space. Projects such as Atmosphere O2, Mulund West (47 storeys \u2013 two towers), Aaradhya Highpark, Nr. Dahisar (30 storeys \u2013 six towers) and Aaradhya EastWind, Vikhroli (34 storeys) were executed in three-and-a-half to four years.\n\nIn the last 10 years, the company has become a reasonably-established player in the MMR, with a presence in the central, eastern, western suburbs and recently in South Mumbai as well.\n\nIn all, 17 projects totalling 2.4 million sq ft have been delivered, mostly six months to one year ahead of schedule. Around 90 per cent of its inventory reportedly is sold before even the occupancy certificate is received.\n\nMan Infra receives DM fee for handling and marketing a real estate project. It receives EPC margin for in-house construction and engineering capabilities. The company receives interest margin on funds infused into projects. \n\nIn the EPC business, it receives regular EPC margin from the government and private clients. When it professionally manages a site, material and labour of a real estate project, it receives a PMC (project management consultancy) margin. \n\nRevenues from projects executed under the DM model are not reflected in consolidated sales figures, but only the DM fee (12-14 per cent of total project revenues) gets added to the sales and PBT.\n\nFor projects executed under the JV model, sales are not reflected in the consolidated revenue figure, but the company\u2019s share of profits gets added to the bottom line.\n\nThus, in the DM model, all costs and revenues are booked in the landlord\u2019s financials, while in the JV model, all costs and revenues are booked in the SPV, even as Man Infra receives a share of profit based on the extent of its stake in the venture.\n\nThis asset-light approach is set to continue for the company. Given the focus on DM and JV-based revenue generation, the top-line growth may not be as robust as in the past few years, though profitability is set to receive a considerable boost given that minimal to no upfront capital commitment is required.\n\nFuture potential and healthy financials\n\nMan Infra has cash and cash equivalents of \u20b9487 crore as of June 2024. Its debt was only \u20b933 crore as of June 2024, down from \u20b9332 crore in September 2022. Very few real estate and construction players enjoy a net-debt-free balance sheet as well as healthy operating margins.\n\nThe company has 6.1 million sq ft of carpet area waiting for execution over the next several years. Man Infra\u2019s real estate business itself has a visibility of \u20b915,000 crore over the next five-six years, with margins expected to be north of 20 per cent consistently.",

        "text": "As the agriculture minister chairs the annual conference on Rabi crops on Saturday, where strategies will be chalked out with States for a bumper harvest, one important issue to grab attention may be the shortage of Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), the key fertiliser used in wheat, mustard and gram, all three major winter crops. \n\nLatest data show that sales of DAP fell to 7.76 lakh tonnes (lt) last month, which is 51 per cent lower from 15.7 lt year-ago. Monthly sales of DAP in September were reported at 11.15 lt in 2022, 5.96 lt in 2021, 7.65 lt in 2020 and 6.33 lt in 2019.\n\n\u201cFarmers normally buy DAP in September-October to prepare the field for the sowing. With a favourable monsoon and its delayed withdrawal as well as good moisture has created the demand for fertilisers as farmers expect a good harvest of winter crops,\u201d said agriculture scientist A K Singh. \n\nAlso read: India decides to ease rice export curbs further\n\nWith the reports of farmers\u2019 protest over alleged shortages of DAP coming particularly from Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, there is something amiss as far as availability is concerned, Singh added.\n\n\u201cWheat crop this year is very crucial and the government should not take any chance and ensure ample and timely availability,\u201d Singh suggested and added that there should be study on shrivelled crop of wheat, which has been continuing for last few years and the government has been relaxing procurement norms in one state or the other.\n\nAccording to the crop weather watch report, the total fertiliser sale during Kharif season 2024 (April-September) was 319.97 lt which included 189.12 lt of urea, 46.12 lt of DAP, 9.27 lt of MOP and 75.46 lt of complex (a mixture of N, P , K nutrients). The total demand for the season was estimated at 321.44 lt \u2013 177.12 lt of urea, 59.87 lt of DAP, 10.26 lt of MOP and 74.19 lt of complex.\n\nSingh said that it is unusual to see the fall in sales of DAP as against its projected demand whereas there is no such difference noticed in other fertilisers when sales data are compared with demand.\n\nOfficial data show that sales of urea were up 3.1 per cent at 30.89 lt in September 2024 from 29.97 lt year-ago, but those of MOP were down 4.7 per cent at 2.25 lt from 2.36 lt and complex dropped by 11.6 per cent at 16.6 lt from 18.77 lt.\n\nThe Centre will discuss (on October 19) with state officials about the plan and strategies about the on-going Rabi sowing season that started from October 1, to ensure that the winter-grown foodgrains production target of 164 million tonnes (mt) including 115 mt of wheat, 13.65 mt of gram and 13.8 mt of mustard, officials said.\n\nAlso read: Rice exports a tad lower in H1, but trade sees shipments gaining pace in year ahead as govt eases curbs",

The bracelet, passed on to him by his father Salim Khan, has been integral to Salman\u2019s life for several decades. You will never spot Salman without the bracelet. So how does the Firoza bracelet secure Salman Khan? In a recently resurfaced Reddit video, Salman elucidates the protective mechanism of the \u201cFiroza\u201d stone in his bracelet. He says, \u201cThis stone is called Firoza. Apparently, there are only two living stones, they say. One is a Greek, and one is a Firoza. This is the turquoise. What happens with this is if there\u2019s any negativity coming onto you, first this takes it. It gets veins in it and then it cracks. This is my seventh stone.\u201d Healing properties Turquoise, a mesmerising gemstone, is recognised not only for its vibrant blue-green hue but also for its rich history and believed metaphysical properties. The benefits of wearing turquoise are manifold, spanning from health and emotional well-being to spiritual growth,\u201d says Dr Priya Kaul, a spiritual life coach and healer. \u201cIt is supposed to calm and reduce anxiety and tension. Its calming effect can help people handle anger and stress, promoting stability, she says adding, \u201cThis gemstone promotes self-expression and communication, which may help emotional upheaval sufferers.\u201d Firoza, the living stone Turquoise, also popularly known as \u201cFiroza\u201d, is a powerful gem that brings in good luck, blessings of higher powers, and spiritual protection to people who tend to get into conflicts very often. \u201cIt\u2019s a stone that activates your good luck and ability to get through situations. Turquoise is associated with the planet Jupiter, which activates the luck side of divine protection,\u201d says Neelam Naseeb, CEO of MBM Crystals and the Ursoulcompass community. People who tend to be overly emotional at times can wear this crystal to balance their emotions. Neelam says, \u201cAstrologically and spiritually, anyone can wear this crystal to enhance good luck and protection.\u201d She suggests that individuals seeking balance and making decisions based on divine guidance, rather than emotions, should wear this more frequently. Enhanced Communication: Dr Priya refers to turquoise as the \u201cstone of communication.\u201d \u201cIt encourages open dialogue, making it a perfect companion for those in professions that require clear expressions\u2014like teaching, counselling, or public speaking.\u201d Spiritual Growth: \u201cMany practitioners of meditation and yoga wear turquoise to enhance their spiritual journey, as it helps to release outdated belief systems and foster a deeper connection to one\u2019s higher self,\u201d says Priya. Physical Well-Being: People believe that turquoise supports the respiratory system, alleviates ailments like asthma, and promotes overall physical well-being. \u201cIts detoxifying properties may also improve metabolic processes and enhance immunity. People often wear turquoise as a talisman for overall health and protection against illness.\u201d Protection and Safety: Many ancient cultures, including Native Americans, wore it as a safeguard against negative energies, psychic attacks, and physical threats. \u201cFor those who travel frequently or live in uncertain circumstances, wearing turquoise can impart a sense of safety and security.\u201d Promoting Creativity: The vibrant colours of turquoise stimulate creativity and inspire self-expression. Artists, musicians, and writers often wear this gemstone to tap into their creative energies. Aesthetic appeal: Apart from its metaphysical properties, turquoise is visually stunning and can enhance any jewelry collection. It pairs beautifully with many metals and stones, making it a versatile choice for various styles\u2014whether in rings, necklaces, bracelets, or earrings.",

        "title": "Your Guide to Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates in India",
        "text": "Purchasing a car is not just a significant milestone; it\u2019s often a major financial commitment that can impact your budget for years to come. One of the most crucial aspects of financing your vehicle is securing the best car loan interest rates. Whether you\u2019re considering a sleek new model or a reliable used car, understanding how to get favorable loan terms can save you substantial money over time. This guide provides essential tips and insights to help you secure the best deal on your car loan and streamline your new car loan approval process.\n\nWhy Car Loan Interest Rates Matter\n\nCar loan interest rates play a vital role in determining how much you will ultimately pay for your vehicle. A lower interest rate means reduced monthly payments and lower total interest paid over the loan term. On the other hand, a higher interest rate can inflate the overall cost of your vehicle, leading to financial strain.\n\nFor example, consider a \u20b910,00,000 car loan with a five-year term. If you secure a loan with an 8% interest rate, your monthly payment will be approximately \u20b920,000. However, if your interest rate is 12%, your monthly payment jumps to around \u20b922,000. Over five years, that\u2019s a difference of nearly \u20b91,20,000! Clearly, understanding how to obtain the best car loan interest rates is essential for making a sound financial decision.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nSeveral factors influence the car loan interest rates you may qualify for, including:\n\n1. Credit Score\n\nYour credit score is one of the most significant determinants of your car loan interest rates. Lenders assess your creditworthiness based on this score; a higher credit score generally results in a lower interest rate. For example, individuals with a score above 700 typically enjoy more favorable loan terms than those with lower scores.\n\nBefore applying for a car loan, it\u2019s wise to check your credit score. If you find areas for improvement, such as outstanding debts or errors on your credit report, take steps to rectify these issues. Paying off debts and ensuring timely payments can help boost your score, making you more attractive to lenders.\n\n2. Loan Term\n\nThe length of your loan, or the term, can also impact your interest rate. Generally, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates, while longer-term loans may carry higher rates but result in lower monthly payments. It\u2019s crucial to strike a balance that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nWhile a longer loan term might seem appealing due to lower monthly payments, keep in mind that you could end up paying significantly more in interest over the life of the loan. Consider your budget and long-term financial objectives when choosing a loan term.\n\n3. Loan Amount and Down Payment\n\nThe amount you borrow, and your down payment can influence the interest rate offered. A larger down payment reduces the loan amount, which can lead to a lower interest rate. Additionally, a significant down payment shows lenders that you are financially responsible, potentially improving your loan terms.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the car\u2019s purchase price. For example, if you\u2019re purchasing a car for \u20b915,00,000, a down payment of \u20b93,00,000 can significantly improve your chances of securing a better rate.\n\n4. Market Conditions\n\nCurrent market conditions can also affect car loan interest rates. Economic factors, such as inflation and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policies, can influence lending rates across the board. Keeping an eye on market trends can help you time your loan application for better rates.\n\nTips for Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nTo maximize your chances of obtaining the best car loan interest rates, follow these actionable tips:\n\n1. Improve Your Credit Score\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a higher credit score can lead to lower interest rates. Take proactive steps to improve your credit before applying for a loan:\n\n\u2022 Pay bills on time: Late payments can negatively impact your score.\n\n\u2022 Reduce outstanding debts: Aim to lower credit card balances and pay off loans.\n\n\u2022 Check your credit report: Correct any errors that may be affecting your score.\n\n2. Shop Around\n\nNot all lenders offer the same car loan interest rates. To find the best deal, compare rates from various sources, including banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Make sure to take into account the loan terms, fees, and other charges that may apply.\n\nUse online comparison tools to simplify this process. A little research can go a long way in helping you secure a better interest rate.\n\n3. Consider Pre-Approval\n\nGetting pre-approved for a car loan can significantly enhance your bargaining power when shopping for a vehicle. Pre-approval provides you with a clear idea of how much you can borrow and what interest rates you might qualify for. This not only streamlines the buying process but also strengthens your position when negotiating with dealerships.\n\nAdditionally, a pre-approved loan can help you avoid high dealer financing rates, ensuring that you stick to your budget.\n\n4. Negotiate Your Rate\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to negotiate with lenders. If you receive a better rate from another lender, use it as leverage in your discussions. Many lenders are willing to match or even beat competing offers to secure your business.\n\nBe prepared to discuss your credit history and financial situation during negotiations. Demonstrating that you\u2019ve done your research can bolster your position.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Additional Fees\n\nWhen considering a car loan, pay attention to any additional fees that may affect your overall costs. These can include:\n\nProcessing fees\n\nPrepayment penalties\n\nLate payment fees\n\nUnderstanding these charges can help you make a more informed decision about your loan.\n\n6. Stay Informed About Market Trends\n\nKeeping an eye on market conditions can help you identify the best time to apply for a loan. Interest rates can fluctuate based on economic factors, so being informed can guide your decision-making process.\n\nNavigating the world of car loan interest rates doesn\u2019t have to be daunting. By understanding the factors that influence your rate and taking proactive measures, you can significantly reduce your vehicle's overall cost. Start by checking your credit score, comparing lenders, considering your loan term, and confidently negotiating your rate. With these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to drive off in your new car with a loan that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nReady to kick off your journey? Begin by reviewing your credit score and exploring various lenders to uncover the best car loan interest rates available. Your dream car is within reach\u2014ensure you\u2019re financing it wisely!",

Its drones have reportedly been used by both sides in the ongoing war in Ukraine.The Pentagon added DJI to its list of Chinese military-linked companies in 2022. It claimed at that time that China ensures access to advanced technologies and expertise through PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian but support military advancements.

DJI denied these claims and suspended business operations in both Russia and Ukraine in April 2022 to reassess compliance requirements.DJI was also previously blacklisted by the US department of the treasury in 2021 for allegedly supporting the surveillance of the Uyghur minority in China's Xinjiang region.",

That in turn will open the doors for the dollar index to see a fresh rise to 105-105.50 in the coming weeks. \n\nFinds support\n\nThe US 10Yr Treasury yield (4.08 per cent) is getting support around 4 per cent. The yield fell in the first half of the week and made a low of 3.99 per cent. But from there it rose back well in the second half recovering all the loss.\n\nImmediate resistance is at 4.12 per cent. A break above it can take the US 10Yr Treasury yield up to 4.17 and 4.21 per cent this week. The price action thereafter will need a close watch to see if the rise is extending beyond 4.21 per cent or not.\n\nThe outlook will turn negative only if the yield declines below 4 per cent. Only then the chances of a fall to 3.85-3.8 per cent will come into the picture again.\n\nMore downside\n\nThe euro (EURUSD: 1.0867) continues to fall. It touched a low of 1.0811 and has bounced back from there. The broader trend is down. Resistances are at 1.0885 and then 1.0920-1.0930 which can cap the upside if more rise is seen from current levels.\n\nThe outlook is bearish to break 1.08 in the coming days. Such a break can take the euro down to 1.0750 in the short term.\n\nThe level of 1.0750 is a strong support which can halt the current fall. A bounce from there can trigger a corrective rise to 1.09-1.0950 going forward.\n\nThe Indian rupee (USDINR: 84.07) was broadly stable all through last week. The domestic currency was stuck in a narrow 10-paise range of 83.98-84.08 through the week. The break above 84 seen on Wednesday failed to get a strong follow-through rise. There are chances for the rupee to remain stuck between 84 and 84.10 for some more time.\n\nHowever, the bias is negative. We expect the rupee to break 84.10 eventually and decline towards 84.40 going forward. \n\nRupee has to get a sustained rise above 84 in order to see a recovery towards 83.85-83.80.\n\nOn the charts, the medium-term picture is negative for the rupee. It is likely to remain below 83.50 going forward. Once the break below 84.10 happens, it will open the doors for the rupee to weaken towards 84.80-85 over the medium-term.",

        "text": "The Nobel prize in economics for 2024, or more correctly Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded earlier this week has triggered off debates not as much about economics but about colonialism and its institutions. Economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were awarded for their significant work on how a nation\u2019s institutions shape its economic development. Among the most cited in economics, their work not only draws a connection between the two but parses societal institutions into \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cextractive\u201d, and theorises that inclusive institutions have a positive long-term impact on economic prosperity while extractive institutions stifle a country\u2019s economic development. They claim inclusive institutions are the ones that promote democracy, limit corruption, enforce justice and property rights; the extractive show a high concentration of power, corruption, and limited political freedom.\n\nThe claim that certain institutions are a pre-condition for economic development has drawn criticism from within the discipline because inclusive institutions in many high-income western economies came about after their development. Equally important is how countries like China, to take an example, enjoy staggering economic prosperity despite \u201cextractive\u201d institutions. The economists have ignored the impact of colonialism \u2014 and its extractive institutions in colonies \u2014 on economic development. This should interest India where the flavour of the season is to throw off the colonial yoke and symbols. Its institutions, a colonial legacy, still function on the discredited trickle-down theory; there has been a staggering rise in its billionaires count even as household savings have fallen sharply with people spending more on basic necessities. If anything, this year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics draws attention to why it is critical for India to de-colonise its economic structure that was, and continues to be, based on the extractive principle.",

        "text": "State-run lender UCO Bank on Saturday reported around 50 per cent year-on-year growth in its net profit to \u20b9602.74 crore for the second quarter this fiscal, backed by over 45 per cent y-o-y rise in its operating profit and around 44 per cent y-o-y fall in provisions during the period.\n\nThe Kolkata-based bank had registered \u20b9401.67 crore net profit for the second quarter last fiscal. The lender posted \u20b9550.96 crore net profit in the first quarter of the current financial year. \n\nIts operating profit for the second quarter of FY25 grew \u20b945.80 crore to \u20b91431.60 crore from \u20b9 981.88 crore for the corresponding period of FY24, the bank said in a stock exchange filing. \n\nNet Interest Income (NII) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 stood at \u20b92300.34 crore, registering a growth of around 20 per cent on a y-o-y basis as against \u20b91916.55 crore for the same period a year ago. Domestic Net Interest Margin (NIM) rose 25 basis points y-o-y to 3.30 per cent. During the period non-interest income grew 53.48 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9993.07 crore. \n\nTalking to the media, UCO Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Office Ashwani Kumar said the increase in net interest income and non-interest income were the two main factors for the growth in net profit. \u201cOur provision coverage ratio slightly came down and NIM improved,\u201d Kumar said. Provision Coverage Ratio stood at 95.92 per cent as on September 30, 2024.\n\nTotal provision during the quarter fell 44.07 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9492.84 crore compared with \u20b9342.09 crore for the same period last fiscal. Fresh slippages stood at \u20b9864 crore during Q2FY25 compared with \u20b9578 crore in Q2FY24. \u201cSlippage was slightly elevated in this quarter due to one corporate account which turned into an NPA, having an exposure of around \u20b9245 crore,\u201d the MD said. \n\nTotal Recovery and upgradation\n\nTotal recovery and upgradation during the period stood at \u20b91017 crore as against \u20b9656 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal. \n\nUCO Bank has so far recovered around 90 per cent of the \u201cerroneous credits\u201d which certain account holders of the bank had received via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) last year. \u201cActions are on to recover the rest of the money. Our endeavour is to recover maximum during this fiscal,\u201d Kumar said. Notably, certain accounts holders of the Kolkata-based bank in November last year had received a total of around Rs 820 crore \u201cerroneous credits\u201d via IMPS.\n\nThe lender\u2019s asset quality improved during Q2FY25. Gross NPA ratio fell 96 bps year-on-year to 3.18 per cent, whereas net NPA ratio fell 38 bps y-o-y to 0.73 per cent during the period. \n\nThe bank is planning to tap capital markets for raising of equity capital upto \u20b9 1500-2000 crore by way of QIP in one or more tranches. \u201cWe may go for it in the third quarter, subject to market conditions,\u201d Kumar said. \n\nThe bank\u2019s overall loan growth target for this fiscal is 12-14 per cent y-o-y. It expects that home and car loans to grow 18 per cent and 30 per cent y-o-y, respectively, during this festive season.\n\nIn the second quarter the lender witnessed an 18 per cent y-o-y growth in gross advances, while deposits growth stood at 10.57 per cent y-o-y.",

Among the key industries fueling this growth, the Indian government has prioritised the agrochemical sector, recognising it as one of the \u201c12 industries with the greatest potential for India to achieve global leadership.\u201d\n\nThe agrochemical sector has experienced significant progress, with projections estimating its value will reach $8.22 billion by 2024 and grow to $13.08 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 4 per cent. \n\nHowever, FY2023-24 brought its share of challenges, including fluctuating markets, rising raw material costs, and unpredictable monsoons. \n\nAlso read: What is it in the Digital Farm Mission?\n\nResilient industry\n\nThe industry has remained resilient, supported by government initiatives like \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cAtmanirbhar Abhiyan,\u201d strategic investments, and a focus on innovation. Increased collaboration in research and development, alongside the growing focus on manufacturing is expected to further drive the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nInternational magazine Agropages released the rankings of the top 20 Indian agrochemical companies based on their FY 2023-24 performance. The revenue threshold for inclusion in the top 20 list increased to \u20b91,226 crore, up from \u20b91,151 crore in the previous year, reflecting robust growth among the Indian agrochemical companies. \n\nAmong the top 20 companies, 11 surpassed the \u20b92,000 crore sales mark, while nine companies reported revenues between \u20b91,000 crore and \u20b92,000 crore. \n\nNotably, 10 companies posted year-on-year growth, with PI Industries and Safex Chemicals achieving double-digit increases, nearing or exceeding 20 per cent. \n\nOn the other hand, 10 companies faced declines in sales, with Sharda Cropchem and Meghmani Group experiencing the steepest drops.\n\nFocus on R&D pays off\n\nOne of the standout performers in the Agropages rankings was Best Agrolife Ltd (BAL), which climbed from 16th place last year to 13th in FY 23-24. \n\nThe company reported a consolidated revenue of \u20b91,873.3 crores for the fiscal year, showcasing its growth and increasing market presence. Interestingly, the company\u2019s growth relied on building its brand business. Its branded business grew by 85 per cent in FY \u201824, while having shifted its focus from B2B to B2C. \n\nThe company\u2019s focus on R&D and patented products seems to have yielded a strong product presence in the expanding customer base.

The consumer price inflation in India rose to 5.49 per cent in September from 3.65 per cent in the previous month, well above market estimates of 5 per cent. It was the highest inflation rate since the start of the year, overshooting the RBI\u2019s target of 4 per cent after dropping below the threshold in the first two months of the September quarter.\n\nHowever, a significant fall in crude oil prices helped the market to recover from lower levels.\n\nOn the domestic front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to offload shares, selling Rs 21,823 crore in the cash segment, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) kept their buying momentum with purchases totalling Rs16,384 crore in the same segment.\n\nPalka Arora Chopra, Director of Master Capital Services said, \u201cNifty 50 ended its three-week losing streak by closing in the green. The key resistance now stands at 25,000, and a breakout above this could lead to a move toward 25,300.

        "text": "The USD 200 billion Chinese food delivery industry, once a thriving sector that expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic, is now facing a downturn, according to a report by CNN.Having more than doubled in size over three years, this industry \u2013 the world\u2019s largest by revenue and volume of orders \u2013 had provided a steady income for casual workers. However, the workers are now struggling to make ends meet.China\u2019s economic slowdown, prompted by a property crisis and weak consumer spending, has hit delivery workers hard, decreasing their incomes and job stability.On Friday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed a moderation in third-quarter growth and said that weakened consumer spending and the ongoing property market crisis continue to weigh heavily on the economy.Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.6 per cent in the three-month period from July to September, compared with a year ago. That was just slightly higher than the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, who had predicted an expansion of 4.5 per cent, CNN reported.According to a professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, delivery workers will persistently face pressure as long as delivery platforms prioritise cost-cutting measures. \u201cThey are working long hours, really being squeezed,\u201d said Jenny Chan, associate sociology professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong. \u201c[And] they will continue to face pressure as [delivery platforms] have to keep the cost low,\u201d she said.Chan further noted that the economic downturn has led to a shift towards budget-friendly meals, resulting in decreased earnings for delivery workers, who must then work extended hours to maintain their earnings.Apart from the given problems, the workers are constantly under immense pressure to meet tight deadlines, even if it means cutting corners on the road \u2013 by speeding or running red lights \u2013 causing hazards that endanger both themselves and other road users, CNN reported.Delivery workers have been witnessing their paychecks shrink dramatically, increasing their financial struggles.Last year, they made 6,803 yuan (USD 956) a month, according to a report from the China New Employment Research Center. That\u2019s almost 1,000 yuan (USD 140) a month less than they were making five years ago, despite many reporting working longer hours, according to CNN.A 1,000 yuan difference may seem negligible in US dollars, but it\u2019s substantial in China, where the national average monthly wage stood at just 1,838 yuan (USD 258) last year, according to the NBS figures.",

        "text": "Kasauli, Oct 20 (IANS) India\u2019s G20 Sherpa and former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant contends that in order for India to grow at high rates of nine to ten per cent and become a developed economy by 2047, the country\u2019s GDP has to grow by nine times and per capita income by eight times, with manufacturing and urbanisation playing a key role in the process.\n\nHe also hailed India\u2019s chairmanship of the G20 and batted for lateral entry into the government service.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturing has to grow by 16 times. It has to fire on all cylinders. We have to become a manufacturing nation,\u201d Kant told IANS at the Kasauli Literary Festival.\n\nHe also stressed that the country must urbanise in a scientific, sustainable manner, enhance agriculture productivity, and remain a services nation.\n\n\u201cFor all this to happen, you have to provide well-paid jobs to the people and every transition that takes place to manufacturing means that people must move from agriculture to manufacturing and towards urbanisation. The dependence of population in India on agriculture is 46.5 per cent,\u201d Kant added.\n\nHe pointed out that agriculture gives us 16.5 per cent of the GDP, adding that nowhere in the world does this happen.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you need to take the population away from agriculture and put them into manufacturing on better-paid quality jobs. There also needs to be stress on disinvestment, cutting red tape, and ease of doing business which has been this government\u2019s agenda,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nAbout the time when India held the presidency of G20 from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, Kant recollects that the country was able to bring consensus on all key issues confronting the world.\n\nSome of the key issues were a specific action plan for sustainable development goals which had been impacted due to Covid, the issue of strong, sustainable, balanced growth in the global economy, the issue of Green Development Pact, technological transformation and the use of digital public infrastructure and more importantly, the issue of women-led development.\n\n\u201cThese were all critical issues. But to my mind, our biggest achievement during G20 was the fact that it spoke the voice of the Global South, and under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, was able to make the African Union an integral member of G20. So, in a way, we succeeded in making it from G20 to G21 which has made G20 a far more inclusive body in the world. Now, it covers almost 90 per cent of the global population and covers a very vast, almost 80 per cent of the global GDP. So, this has been India\u2019s biggest achievement,\u201d Kant said.\n\nStressing that it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wish to hold G20 meetings in most states and UTs, and not just at one or two places, the former bureaucrat said: \u201cWe took it to every nook and corner of the country. And every state was an active participant. This required clockwork precision. It was a very federal G20. Every state brought their one district and a product forward.\u201d\n\nAdding that the country has succeeded hugely when it comes to ease of doing business, Kant claims what India has achieved in last eight years what it could not achieve in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe have scrapped over 1,600 laws. And moved up 79 positions in the World Bank ease of doing business. India has now become an easy and simple nation,\u201d he said.\n\nKant feels that the next lot of reforms have to happen by the states which have to make procedures simple.\n\n\u201cThis is very critical. India has done a lot of work in terms of insolvency, bankruptcy code, real estate regulation act, and goods and services tax. We have opened up, reduced the corporate tax, and opened up the economy for the private sector in a much bigger way while the FDI has also grown,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked why small traders are not very happy with the introduction of GST, Kant said that there will be some unhappy people when you bring in major reforms of paperless digital tax, as you are cutting out human intervention completely.\n\n\u201cGST rates in some areas are high but that is an issue where states and Central government have to sit down and sort out,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout India\u2019s focus right now, the former NITI Aayog CEO said first and foremost, the country needs to drive manufacturing in a big way and increase exports in order to become an exporting nation.\n\n\u201cWe must urbanise and must improve learning and health outcomes and nutritional standards which is very important. The social indicators to improve are very critical. Health, education, nutrition, all these are very critical over a long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nConsidering that NITI Ayog during his reign had several lateral entries, India\u2019s G20 Sherpa said that he has always been in favour of lateral entrants considering they bring in a lot of fresh thinking.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to find ways of, introducing new talents into government to constantly push for innovation and transformation within government,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that there was no disconnect between major schemes and their implementation on the ground, Kant cited a few examples.\n\n\u201cWe have made 40 million houses and provided pipe water connection to 253 million Indians. Around 130 million toilets and 88,000 kilometres of road have been made. Now this is the kind of infrastructure which no other country has been able to make in seven years. What disconnection are you talking about?\u201d",

During the previous year, the soyameal shiipments stood at 18.36 lakh tonnes. \n\nThe increase in shipments is despite the fact that Indian soyameal had been expensive in the world market by around $100-150 per tonne.\n\nIran was the largest buyer with volumes of around 4.15 lakh tonnes followed by Bangladesh at 3.02 lakh tonnes. Nepal was the third largest buyer with volumes of 1.92 lakh tonnes and Germany at 1.06 lakh tonnes and Afghanistan at 85,181 tonnes. \n\nAlso read: Iran turns saviour for pricey Indian soyameal exports\n\n\u201cIn view of demand from Iran, Bangladesh and Nepal export of soybean meal during this oil year was higher than last year by 15.90 per cent, resulting in better crushing and production of soybean meal\u201d said D N Pathak, Executive Director, The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA).\n\nSoyabean meal production increased during the year to 94.69 lakh tonnes, up from previous year\u2019s 91.79 lakh tonnes as per the latest estimates revealed by SOPA. Soyameal imports reduced during the year marginally to 0.25 lakh tonnes, down from same period last year\u2019s 0.27 lakh tonnes. \n\nDomestic consumption by the feed sector was a tad lower at 66 lakh tonnes during oil year 2023-24, down from previous year\u2019s 67 lakh tonnes, while the off-take from food sector was flat at 8 lakh tonnes. \n\nAlso read: India\u2019s oilmeal exports down by 8.5% in H1 of current fiscal \n\nFor the current oil year 2024-25, SOPA expects the production of soyabean to increase by around 6 per cent to over 125.8 lakh tonnes on higher yields, over previous year\u2019s 118.74 lakh tonnes. This is mainly on account of higher yields on account of favourable weather conditions. The yields are estimated to be higher this year at 1063 kg per hectare as against 1002 kg per ha in the previous year, as per the survey carried out by SOPA recently in the key producing states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.",
