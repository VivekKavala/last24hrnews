                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Musk the greatest cutter Trump praised Musk for his approach to handling workforce reductions during an interview on Musk's social media platform, X, in August.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>During the conversation, Trump expressed admiration for Musk's decisive management style, especially in dealing with strikes and layoffs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He commented, You're the greatest cutter.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Your money is being wasted, Musk said to an enthusiastic crowd for Trump, adding, We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Musk’s proposal aligns with Trump’s campaign rhetoric of reducing federal expenditures and shrinking government intervention.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Weeks before Musk's claim, Trump had revealed plans for a unique position for him during a Fox News interview.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>While praising Musk, calling him “a great business guy” and “a great cost-cutter”, Trump said, “He [Musk] said, ‘I could cut costs without affecting anybody.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>’” When asked if Musk would join his Cabinet should he return to office, Trump clarified, “He doesn’t want to be in the Cabinet.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He just wants to be in charge of cost-cutting.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”Earlier, Trump had announced that if he is elected the President of the US, he will create a government efficiency commission – an idea that was pushed by Musk – adding that the Tesla CEO will be its chief.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “We need to do it.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Can't go on the way we are now,” Trump said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, a group of executives and industry leaders, in September.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>As per Trump, the government efficiency commission will be “tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The Republican presidential nominee claimed that in 2022, “fraud and improper payments alone cost taxpayers an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” The commission, he said, will recommend “drastic reforms” and develop a plan to eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months, which he claimed will save “trillions of dollars”.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>How exactly will Musk fit into Trump administration?It may not be easy for Musk to become a part of the Trump administration given his various business interests, financial dealings of his six companies in terms of contracts and funding with the government and his quarrels with various regulators.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Moreover, a new post for Musk must be approved by the Congress.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Musk’s myriad financial and political conflicts might also make it impossible for him to secure Congress’ blessing to run any agency, says a Bloomberg article.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But Musk doesn’t necessarily need an agency or a title to have influence in a Trump White House.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He’s almost certain to remain a powerful consiglieri should Trump win, someone with easy access who can shape legislation and the Oval Office’s agenda.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And 10 of those are ongoing, with the result possibly in the hands of the next president’s administration, the NBC News article says.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The 19 separate fights between Musk and the federal government have involved 12 different government entities and touched on a broad cross-section of everyday life: from a wildlife refuge in Texas near a SpaceX launch site to alleged racial harassment at a Tesla factory in California to Tesla’s decision to market driver-assistance software as “full self-driving” even though it requires human supervision.</p>
