                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>India’s sports market is putting the pedal to the metal, accelerating its growth from $52 billion in 2023 to a whopping $130 billion by 2030.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The change is driven by a rapidly diversifying sports fan base and high engagement from Gen Z audiences, says a new Deloitte-Google report.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

As per the report, Unlocking India’s $130B Sports Potential, the sports ecosystem of India has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It can reach levels faster than the GDP of this country.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A unique position for sports is achieved because of this fact, which makes it quite powerful as an economic driver.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

It is an inflection point for sports in India, a very exciting time, said Roma Datta Chobey, interim country lead for Google India.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> We are now witnessing multi-sport fandom that is climbing rapidly, driven by all of digital engagement activity and enthusiasm from Generation Z, who comprises the largest proportion of sports fans in India.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And that makes wide-open room for businesses to engage the fan base in new creative forms.</p>

With an approximate audience size of 655 million, India’s sports audience now boasts 43% comprising of Gen Z.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Although cricket is still on a leading position, capturing 70% of the digital searches made in relation to sports; interest in kabaddi with 120 million fans and football with 85 million fans is also on the uprise.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Other traditional Indian sports like kho-kho have also gained unprecedented popularity and contributed to a more diversified sports culture.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Rise Of Digital Media

Digital platforms continue to change the consumption of sports in India, and 93% would now like to consume sports through digital channels.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> According to Comscore 2019, the 18-34-year-olds spend 20% more time on non-live sports content like highlights, short-form videos, and interactive experiences, opening new avenues of personalized engagement.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Interactive and AI-driven technologies are furthering such experiences, thus driving growth across YouTube, fantasy sports, and social media.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

According to Chobey, beyond regular television, much room remains for digital-first formats in short-form highlights, behind-the-scenes content, and interactive features.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Personalization will be paramount when reaching out to Gen Z, a group requiring experiences to be both personalized, sensory, and unique, while leveraging AI as much as possible.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Economic Impact And Employment Opportunities

India is also going to have a huge economic impact on the sports industry, projecting 10.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>5 million jobs and $21 billion indirect tax revenue by 2030.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The sports goods and apparel market will continue to grow to a size of $58 billion because of increased awareness about fitness, which further increases demand for merchandise associated with favorite teams and athletes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Esports is growing at a tremendous 25% CAGR and has the potential to reach a size of $200 million by 2030.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

New revenue benchmarks are set by events such as IPL through broadcasting rights and sponsorships.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> IPL alone generates about $1.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The recent happenings are supported by government initiatives like Khelo India and TOPS, helping grassroots growth and enhancing sports infrastructure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The future of the industry must necessarily be about creating sports participation pan India and ensuring easy access from grassroots to elite levels,” said Prashanth Rao, a partner at Deloitte India.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The access routes increase opportunities for broadcasting, advertising, and apparel, and grassroots participation supports long-term growth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Infrastructure And Governance

India, despite growth, still lags significantly in infrastructure and funding.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Sports budget per capita in India stands at a modest $0.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>3, far behind countries like the UK ($9) and Australia ($11).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But that gap is expected to close through initiatives under the new National Sports Policy 2024 and innovative public-private partnerships.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Apart from additional funding, the development of infrastructure access initiatives like the Khelo India Playfield Repository and optimum use of digital facility access are going to assume prime importance.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “This will speed up the process with the help of CSR contributions along with the better utilization of technology to discover gaps,” said Rao.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The face of talent scouting, athlete training, and fan engagement is going to change with artificial intelligence and cloud technology in India.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Assisted by sports-tech start-ups and platforms such as YouTube, India is entering a new age where data-driven scouting and training is going to be the reality of scout culture from rural areas to cities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This mix of formal coaching and digital resources is thus trying to fill up the gaps between technique and professional expertise.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

As Rao said, “Globally, AI in sports is still at an early stage, especially at grassroots levels.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But in India, steps are being taken to integrate video analysis and data-backed scouting even in rural areas.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Growing Rural And Female Fans

Today, the fans in the countryside now contribute to 59% of the overall sum, of whom 36% are female.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kabaddi, kho-kho, and badminton all gained a gigantic following.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This diversity opens an incredible prospect for brands and leagues to embrace a more inclusive and regional consumer reach.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Localization of content has been highlighted as a way to tap into this increase in demography, especially since 77% of Indian fans prefer content in the regional language.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Localization and regional language support can be critical in bridging the gap between urban and rural areas.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It also sheds light on the need for indigenous sports like kho-kho and kabaddi, which could drive inclusion and participation.</p>
