                                </h1>

                                
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>The Chaudhary Bansi Lal cricket ground at Lahli in Haryana, immortalized by Sachin Tendulkar’s final Ranji Trophy appearance (also his last domestic match) in 2013, has once again captured the spotlight.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This time, it is thanks to the remarkable bowling prowess of a talented young cricketer, Anshul Kamboj, whose recent feat has reignited the spirit and pride of this historic venue.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In the hallowed halls of Indian cricket, where legends are written in feats of skill, sweat, and sheer will, Haryana’s Anshul Kamboj has etched his name alongside the greats with a performance for the ages.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A 10-wicket haul in a single innings is the stuff of folklore, a record that places Kamboj in the elite company of Indian cricketing stalwarts.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In the fifth round of the Ranji Trophy clash, in the quiet, cricket-steeped town of Lahli, Kamboj unleashed a spell that razed through Kerala’s line-up, achieving an astonishing 10/49.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Having ended November 14 evening with eight out of eight, Kamboj achieved this feat on November 15, by capturing the last two remaining beleaguered Kerala batsmen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> With each wicket he captured, he seemed to cast a spell, a pacer’s rendition of magic as he tore through the opposition with precision and relentless intensity.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This feat, to any student of the game, is the stuff of cricketing dreams—a once-in-a-lifetime performance that elevates a bowler from merely good to legendary.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The historical echo: A select pantheon of legends!

To put Kamboj’s achievement into perspective, only two bowlers in the entire Ranji Trophy history before him had managed to accomplish this Herculean feat—Premangsu Mohan Chatterjee for Bengal in the 1956-57 season and Pradeep Sunderam for Rajasthan in 1985-86.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Just think of it: countless bowlers, thousands of matches, innumerable overs—and only two men had ever conquered an entire line-up single-handedly in the Ranji Trophy’s storied history.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kamboj, with his 10-wicket haul, has joined this exclusive club, making him only the third Ranji bowler to achieve this near-mythical accomplishment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

And if that weren’t enough to underscore his greatness, this wasn’t merely a one-off.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kamboj’s name is now etched into the even rarer realm of Indian first-class cricket, where only six Indian bowlers have ever taken all 10 wickets in an innings.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Standing proudly alongside Anil Kumble, Subhash Gupte, Debasis Mohanty, and the aforementioned Chatterjee and Sunderam, Kamboj has attained a summit few even dare to dream of.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Lahli’s Lion: Roaring through the Kerala line-up

Kamboj’s spell was nothing short of lionhearted.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kerala’s top order, was no pushover and were, in fact, the backbone of the team, sturdy, proven batsmen who had shown both form and resilience.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Yet, Kamboj dismantled them, each dismissal an exercise in control, precision, and tactical brilliance.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The Kerala batters had no answer to Kamboj’s relentless pursuit.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They fell like dominos, succumbing one after another to his perfectly placed deliveries.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> By tea, he had dismissed the core of Kerala’s batting lineup, leaving the team in shambles and his teammates in awe.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In a span of a few hours, Kamboj had woven together a tapestry of pace bowling mastery that will be remembered for generations.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The four half-centurions (Rohan Kunnummal, Akshay Chandran, Skipper Sachin Baby & wicket keeper batter Mohd.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Azharuddeen) and Kerala’s anchors, were sent back to the pavilion, leaving the Kerala team stranded at sea by Kamboj’s fury.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> His last few scalps were merely a formality, and his opponents were simply characters in the unfolding drama of his cricketing ascent to greatness.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The emerging force: A season of success

This wasn’t Kamboj’s first brush with brilliance this season.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He had shown flashes of his potential on the bigger stage as well.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Representing India A in the ACC Emerging Asia Cup in Oman, he made waves.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And in the Duleep Trophy 2024, he turned heads yet again, capturing an eight-wicket haul (8 for 69 versus India B) in just his second outing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Only the third pacer to achieve such an extraordinary feat in the history of the Duleep Trophy, Kamboj had announced himself as a force to be reckoned with.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

And let’s not forget, Kamboj’s incredible 10-for came hot on the heels of his IPL debut earlier this year with the Mumbai Indians.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Before stepping onto the IPL field, he had played a modest nine T20 games, a number that hardly hinted at the storm brewing beneath the surface.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But Kamboj, undeterred by the pressure, rose to the occasion and made his mark on the grandest domestic T20 stage, adding to his tally of 23 wickets in 15 List-A games.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The rarest of feats: A legacy etched in pace

In first-class cricket, where spin often overshadows pace in terms of wickets, a fast bowler’s ten-wicket haul is rare—a near-mythical achievement.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This makes Kamboj’s milestone all the more extraordinary, a triumph not only of skill but of character and resilience.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The legacy of this match in Lahli will live on, with Kamboj’s name whispered in reverence whenever tales of all-time great bowling performances are told.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Like Kumble before him, who famously demolished Pakistan in Delhi’s iconic Kotla, with a 10-wicket spell, Kamboj’s ten-for is a testament to the indomitable spirit that drives every bowler who dares to dream.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Future bound: A star rising in Indian cricket

With such a meteoric rise, Anshul Kamboj has raised the bar for what the future holds for him in Indian cricket.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He has shown not just potential but a readiness to meet the demands of elite-level cricket, and his performances have come at pivotal moments, both in domestic tournaments and for India A.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> His ten-wicket haul is a reminder to cricket fans everywhere that the Ranji Trophy remains the crucible for India’s greatest talents, where players like Kamboj can forge their identities and prepare for greater heights.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In cricket, the old adage holds that form is temporary, but class is permanent.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If Kamboj’s performance in Lahli is anything to go by, he has that permanent class in abundance, an innate ability to rise when it matters most.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> As he steps onto more significant stages in the seasons to come, cricket enthusiasts across India and beyond will be watching closely.</p>
