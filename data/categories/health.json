        "text": "Aquaphobia is a type of specific phobia that is an irrational fear of something that does not pose much danger. A person with aquaphobia has extreme fear or anxiety when thinking about or seeing water. They may avoid places near water, such as swimming pools or lakes. In severe cases, sufferers may stop bathing or using water from the sink to clean themselves.\n\nAquaphobia is often mistaken for another phobia called hydrophobia. Although both are afraid of water, aquaphobia and hydrophobia are not the same. Because, hydrophobia is not actually caused by trauma to water, but is a symptom of rabies infection.\n\nSymptoms of Aquaphobia\n\nThe symptoms of aquaphobia vary greatly from person to person. For example, some people with this phobia may be afraid of deep water or strong tides. Others may experience intense anxiety just thinking about water. Regardless of the type or amount of water, people with aquaphobia experience anxiety in response to the water.\n\nSome of the symptoms of aquaphobia include:\n\nFeelings of fear, anxiety, or panic when thinking about water\nExcessive or irrational fear and aversion to water\nFear and anxiety in the presence of water that significantly affect a person\u2019s ability to socialize or function.\nContinuous avoidance of water.\n\nA person with aquaphobia tends to experience anxiety, fear, or panic when exposed to water. Physical effects of aquaphobia include:\n\nRapid heartbeat.\n\nShallow breathing.\nTightness or pain in the chest or throat.\nTrembling when exposed to water.\n\nDizziness and nausea. \nConfusion or disorientation.\n\nMeanwhile, children with specific phobias such as aquaphobia may express anxiety or fear by:\n\nCrying and having tantrums.\nRefusing to speak or move.\nPhysically attached to a parent or a particular object.\n\nPeople who have specific phobias often have at least one additional mental health condition, including:\n\nDifferent types of anxiety disorders.\nDepression.\nBipolar disorder.\nImpulse control disorder.\n\nCauses and Risk Factors of Aquaphobia\n\nThe causes of specific phobias such as aquaphobia are not well understood. However, there is some evidence that phobias can be genetic. If you have a family member with a mental health condition, such as anxiety or another phobia, you may be at risk of developing a phobia.\n\nHowever, aquaphobia is often caused by a traumatic event during childhood, such as a near drowning. It can also be the result of a series of negative experiences. This usually occurs in childhood and is not as severe as a traumatic experience.\n\nOn the other hand, experts also claim that changes in brain function also play a role in developing specific phobias.\n\nMeanwhile, another theory proposes that phobias are learned associations. For example, a person may develop a particular phobia after observing a phobic reaction in another person. Such as a parent, sibling, or friend. The person may internalize the other person\u2019s fearful reaction and adopt the same aversion to the object or situation.\n\nDiagnosis of Aquaphobia\n\nTo diagnose aquaphobia, doctors or psychologists use the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). However, currently, the DSM-5 does not have a specific diagnosis or category for aquaphobia. Instead, the use of this manual aims to identify the fear of water under the diagnosis of specific phobias or specific mental conditions.\n\nIf you suspect you have aquaphobia, see your doctor right away. Your doctor can refer you to a mental health specialist who can diagnose and treat the phobia.\n\nBased on the criteria from the DSM-5, a mental health specialist will most likely diagnose aquaphobia (or a specific phobia). This diagnosis can be given if you have experienced symptoms of aquaphobia for at least six months. Part of the diagnosis also includes ruling out other mental health conditions, such as:\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nPTSD or Post-traumatic stress disorder.\nPanic disorder.\n\nAquaphobia Treatment\n\nConsidering that aquaphobia is a specific phobia, there are two forms of psychotherapy that can be used as the main treatment, namely:\n\n1. Exposure therapy\n\nExposure therapy can help change a person\u2019s fear response. The procedure involves exposing the phobic to the object or situation that triggers the phobic response repeatedly and gradually.\n\nIn the procedure, a mental health professional will conduct exposure therapy in a safe and controlled environment. During each session, they will also record and analyze the individual\u2019s reactions, thoughts, feelings, and sensations.\n\n2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\n\nCBT is another important element in treating specific phobias. In the procedure, the health professional will address the thought and behavior patterns that occur during the phobic response. During CBT, the psychologist will help the person with specific phobia understand which thoughts and behavior patterns contribute to the phobia. They work with their patients to change these patterns in order to overcome the phobia.\n\nCBT can also involve learning relaxation techniques and coping mechanisms to manage anxiety, fear, and panic. This can help teach people how to respond appropriately during exposure therapy.\n\nIn addition, anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications may also be prescribed to help reduce the symptoms of aquaphobia. Doctors usually prescribe these medications in combination with CBT.\n\nComplications of Aquaphobia\n\nAll phobias can hinder the sufferer\u2019s productivity and daily activities. In severe Aquaphobia, this condition can affect the sufferer\u2019s quality of life. This is because the sufferer of this phobia may not want to take a shower or bathe. This can ultimately affect the sufferer\u2019s cleanliness and self-confidence. In addition, the risk of a number of diseases can also increase if the sufferer of this phobia does not maintain personal hygiene.\n\nSome people with aquaphobia may experience panic attacks. These attacks can cause:\n\nFeeling dizzy or lightheaded.\nFeeling the impending doom.\n\nNoncardiac chest pain.\nRacing heartbeat.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea).\n\nAquaphobia Prevention\n\nMost specific phobias cannot be prevented. However, it is important for people with phobias to seek intervention and treatment early after a traumatic experience. This can prevent people with specific phobias from developing more severe anxiety disorders due to their phobias.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nIf you experience several symptoms of aquaphobia for almost six months, immediately check your condition with a psychologist or psychiatrist.",

The group's recommendation was endorsed by CDC Director Mandy Cohen. The CDC's prior guidance for pneumococcal vaccines was for adults aged 65 and over and children under 5. The shots are also suggested for certain adults and children who are immunocompromised. Both companies had asked the CDC to lower age recommendations to include adults 50 and up. The wider recommendations could bode well for Pfizer, which has been struggling to find new sources of revenue amid a decline in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and treatment. The company's pneumococcal shot, called Prevnar, is one of its best-selling products with about $6 billion in annual sales.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Merck's recently approved vaccine, however, gives Pfizer some major competition.

        "text": "What is Anosmia?\n\nAnosmia is the inability or decreased ability to smell. It can be permanent or temporary depending on the cause.\n\nIn fact, some people have this condition from birth, while others lose the ability to smell due to some condition.\n\nExperts estimate that anosmia and hyposmia affect between 3 and 20 percent of the human population. Hyposmia is a decreased ability to smell.\n\nSometimes people refer to this condition as smell blindness. This condition can be permanent or temporary. Smelling a particular odor is a complex process involving both the brain and the nose.\n\nWhen a person smells a scent, air enters the nose and odor molecules attach to receptors on nerves that sense smell, called olfactory nerves. These nerves line the olfactory epithelium, which is the tissue that lines the nasal cavity.\n\nWhen odor molecules from the environment stimulate these nerves, they send signals to the brain. The brain receives the olfactory information and processes it into a scent that a person can identify.\n\nA disturbed sense of smell can affect a person\u2019s quality of life, especially when tasting food because the sensation of food taste is a combination of the senses of smell and taste.\n\nTherefore, sufferers will experience appetite disorders which can result in malnutrition.\n\nIn addition, this condition can also cause sufferers to be unaware of danger signs around them, for example not being able to detect the smell of stale food, the smell of a gas leak, or the smell of smoke from a fire.\n\nSymptoms of Anosmia\n\nWhen people experience anosmia, they may notice that they can no longer smell identifiable odors.\n\nOn the other hand, people who are born with anosmia due to genetic differences may not realize they have anosmia, having never had the ability to smell.\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can cause loss of the sense of smell.\n\nIf a person living with a neurodegenerative disease notices a loss of smell, they should seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. Sometimes anosmia is an early sign of a neurodegenerative disease.\n\nWhen a person can no longer smell, they cannot perceive odor warnings in food and the environment.\n\nPeople living with anosmia may experience a lower quality of life-related to social interactions, eating, and mental well-being.\n\nRisk Factors for Anosmia\n\nSome things that are risk factors for this condition are:\n\nHaving a nasal infection or head trauma.\nAged over 60 years.\nSuffering from neurodegenerative disease.\nTaking medications that can cause anosmia.\nUndergoing radiation therapy to the head or neck.\n\nCauses of Anosmia\n\nIn the past, this disorder occurred in many people who had COVID-19. But overall, there are various other things that can cause disorders in the olfactory pathway that lead to anosmia, including:\n\nObstructive Disorders\n\nObstruction or blockage of the sense of smell is the most common cause of anosmia.\n\nOne cause of obstruction is inflammation, such as flu, rhinitis (colds), and rhinosinusitis. In addition, the presence of lumps in the nostrils, such as nasal polyps, can also cause obstruction of smell.\n\nHead Trauma\n\nHead injuries due to trauma are also one of the common causes of anosmia.\n\nThis is caused by a head injury which results in damage to the nose and sinuses which becomes a mechanical obstacle to being able to smell.\n\nIn addition, head trauma can also cause damage to the olfactory nerve. Anosmia due to head trauma can be temporary or permanent depending on the type of damage that occurs.\n\nAging and Neurodegenerative Processes\n\nThe aging process is a normal condition and is associated with a decrease in the ability to smell. This is due to the loss of a number of cells in the olfactory nerve.\n\nIn addition, several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Lewy Body dementia also result in decreased ability to smell.\n\nCongenital Disease\n\nTurner syndrome and Kallman syndrome are some congenital conditions that can cause permanent anosmia.\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nAnosmia is one of the side effects of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nDiagnosis of Anosmia\n\nLoss of smell can be difficult to detect. Your doctor may ask you questions about your current symptoms, examine your nose, perform a complete physical exam, and ask about your medical history.\n\nYour doctor may also ask about when the problem started, whether all or only some types of smell are affected, and whether or not you can taste food.\n\nDepending on the answers, the doctor may also perform one or more of the following tests:\n\nCT scan, which uses X-rays to create detailed images of the brain;\nMRI scans, which use radio waves and magnets to look at the brain;\nX-ray of the skull;\nNasal endoscopy to look inside the nose.\n\nAnosmia Complications\n\nPeople with anosmia may lose interest in food leading to malnutrition and weight loss.\n\nPeople with anosmia should also ensure that they have a working smoke and fire alarm in their home at all times.\n\nThey should also be careful with food storage and natural gas use, as it may be difficult to detect spoiled food and gas leaks.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n\nProperly label food with expiration dates;\nRead labels on chemicals, such as kitchen cleaners and insecticides;\nBe careful when using electrical equipment.\n\nAnosmia Treatment\n\nTreatment depends on the cause. If the loss of smell is due to COVID-19, a cold, allergies, or a sinus infection, it will usually go away on its own within a few days.\n\nYou should consult a doctor if anosmia does not go away after cold or allergy symptoms subside.\n\nTreatments that may help with anosmia caused by nasal irritation include:\n\nDecongestant;\nAntihistamines;\nSteroid nasal spray;\nAntibiotics, for bacterial infections;\nReduce exposure to nasal irritants and allergens;\nQuit smoking.\n\nLoss of smell caused by nasal obstruction can be treated by removing whatever is blocking the nasal passages.\n\nThis removal may involve procedures to remove nasal polyps, straighten the nasal septum, or clear the sinuses. Unfortunately, older adults are more likely to lose their sense of smell permanently.\n\nThere is currently no treatment available for people with congenital anosmia.\n\nPeople with partial loss of their sense of smell can add concentrated flavorings to foods to enhance their enjoyment.\n\nAnosmia Prevention\n\nBecause anosmia is a symptom of many health-related conditions, it cannot always be prevented.\n\nHowever, there are several things that can be done to reduce the risk:\n\nAvoid toxic chemicals and the environment.\nDo not smoke.\nWear protective gear when playing contact sports, as anosmia can be caused by brain injury.",

Although both are included in eating disorders, these two mental problems have differences.\n\nThe difference between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa is seen from the weight and behavior that appears. Bulimia mental disorder generally has a normal weight because sufferers have an obsession with overeating, then vomiting the food.\n\nMeanwhile, anorexia sufferers generally have less than normal body weight and have an obsession to be thin. Anorexia can be very dangerous because it causes malnutrition in the body of the sufferer.\n\nSymptoms of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nThe signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa are related to signs of starvation.\n\nAnorexia also includes emotional and behavioral problems involving unrealistic perceptions of body weight and an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat.\n\nSigns and symptoms can be difficult to spot because what is considered underweight varies from person to person. Also, some people may not appear very thin.\n\nPeople with anorexia nervosa also often disguise their thinness, eating habits, or physical problems.\n\n Physical symptoms\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms of anorexia may include:\n\nExtreme weight loss or no weight gain according to development.\nThin appearance.\nAbnormal number of blood elements.\nDizziness or fainting.\nBluish discoloration of the fingers.\nHair that is thinning, breaking or falling out.\nFine, downy hair covers the body.\nNot having menstruation.\nConstipation and stomach ache.\nDry or yellowish skin.\nCold intolerance.\nIrregular heart rhythm.\nLow blood pressure.\nSwelling of the arms or legs.\nTeeth are worn down and calluses on the knuckles from vomiting.\n\nBinge and purge type of anorexia, similar to bulimia. However, anorexics generally struggle with an abnormally low body weight, whereas bulimics are usually overweight.\n\n Emotional and behavioral symptoms\n\nBehavioral symptoms of anorexia may include attempts to lose weight by:\n\nSeverely restricting food intake through diet or fasting.\nOver-exercising.\nOvereating and self-induced vomiting to eliminate food, possibly including the use of laxatives, enemas, diet aids, or herbal products.\n\nMeanwhile, emotional and behavioral signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa include:\n\nPreoccupation with food, which sometimes includes cooking elaborate meals for others but not eating them himself.\nOften skip meals or refuse to eat.\nDenying hunger or making excuses for not eating.\nEat only certain foods, usually those that are low in fat and calories.\nDoesn\u2019t want to eat when there are a lot of people.\nLying about how much food is consumed.\nFear of gaining weight which may include repeatedly weighing or measuring the body.\nFrequently check the mirror for flaws.\nComplaining about being fat or having fat body parts.\nCovering layers of clothing.\nThe mood of the day is flat or lacking emotion.\nSocial withdrawal.\n\nLack of interest in intimate relationships.\n\nIn fact, the way the brain works for people with eating disorders is actually not the same as normal people.\n\nCauses of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nUnfortunately, experts do not yet know for sure what causes anorexia nervosa.\n\nAs with many diseases, there may be a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors.\n\n Biological\n\nAlthough it is not clear which genes are involved, there may be genetic changes that put some people at higher risk of developing anorexia.\n\nAdditionally, a person may also have a genetic predisposition to perfectionism, sensitivity, perseverance, and all the traits associated with anorexia.\n\n Psychological\n\nSome people with anorexia nervosa have obsessive-compulsive personality traits that make it easier to stick to a strict diet and forget about food even when hungry.\n\nThey may have extreme perfectionism, leading to thoughts that they are never thin enough.\n\nIn addition, they also have high levels of anxiety and engage in restricted eating to reduce it.\n\n Environment\n\nThere is a lot of modern popular culture that emphasizes that the ideal body is a slim body. Success and fame are often equated with the ideal thin body.\n\nPeer pressure can also help fuel the desire to be thin, especially among young girls.\n\nRisk Factors for Anorexia Nervosa\n\nAnorexia is more common in girls and women. However, today\u2019s boys and men are also developing eating disorders, which may be related to increased social pressure.\n\nAnorexia is also more common in teenagers. However, people of any age can develop this eating disorder.\n\nAdditionally, the disorder is rare in those over the age of 40. Teenagers may be at greater risk because of all the changes that occur in their bodies during puberty.\n\nAdditionally, teens may also face peer pressure and be more sensitive to criticism or even casual comments about their weight or body shape.\n\nMeanwhile, there are several factors that can increase the risk of anorexia, namely:\n\nCertain gene changes may put certain people at higher risk of developing anorexia.\n\nThose who have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling, or child who has the disorder have a much higher risk of anorexia.\n\n Poor diet and starvation\n\nDieting is the single most important risk factor for eating disorders. There is strong evidence that the symptoms of anorexia nervosa are actually symptoms of starvation.\n\nStarvation affects the brain and causes mood swings, rigidity in thinking, anxiety, and decreased appetite.\n\nStarvation and weight loss can change the way the brain works in at-risk individuals. This can then normalize the formation of restrictive eating behaviors and make it difficult for them to return to normal eating habits.\n\n Transition\n\nWhether it\u2019s a new school, home or job, a breakup, or the death or illness of a loved one, any of these changes can bring emotional stress and increase the risk of anorexia.\n\nIn addition, parents also need to be aware of the parenting patterns they apply because Mistakes in Parenting Children Cause Anorexia Nervosa.\n\nDiagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nDoctors can make a diagnosis through interviews, physical examinations, and various supporting examinations.\n\nA doctor will diagnose anorexia if they find the following characteristics:\n\nSufferers restrict food intake to maintain or gain less than normal body weight without paying attention to the calories and energy the body needs.\nHave a great fear of gaining weight or being fat. This fear will eventually make the sufferer do activities that can reduce the body weight that is already less than normal.\nHaving problems seeing yourself, such as constantly looking at your weight and body shape and denying that your weight is far below normal.\n\nThen, the doctor will perform several physical examinations, including:\n\nMeasure weight and height.\nCheck the condition of nails and skin.\nPerform examinations on the stomach, heart and lungs.\nMeasuring vital signs, such as body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.\n\nIn order to get a more accurate diagnosis, the doctor may recommend several supporting examinations.\n\nThe goal is to rule out other potential problems causing weight loss or potential complications. These tests include:\n\nLaboratory tests, including a complete blood count, urinalysis, and measuring protein and electrolyte levels in the blood. Other tests include kidney, thyroid, and liver function.\nConducting a mental health evaluation, in the form of an interview to find out how the sufferer feels, their eating habits, and their thought patterns.\nX-rays to determine bone health and density, as well as the potential for lung infections or heart problems.\n\nAnorexia Nervosa Treatment\n\nHere are some steps for treating anorexia nervosa that you can take:\n\n Consultation with medical and psychological professionals\n\nAn important first step is to seek help from a medical and psychological team experienced in treating eating disorders.\n\nA doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist can help diagnose and plan appropriate treatment.\n\n Nutrition and weight recovery\n\nIn cases of anorexia nervosa, weight restoration is a priority to restore healthy body function. Consult a dietitian to plan a balanced diet.\n\n Cognitive behavioral therapy\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one form of therapy that is effective in treating anorexia nervosa.\n\nThis therapy helps sufferers identify negative thought patterns and behaviors related to eating and weight. The therapist will also help them replace these thought patterns with healthier and more realistic ones.\n\n Family therapy\n\nThis type of therapy is generally intended for teenagers who suffer from anorexia nervosa.\n\nInvolving the family in care can help build support and understanding of the family\u2019s role in recovery.\n\n Group support\n\nJoining a support group for eating disorders can help individuals feel more accepted and gain support from people who are going through similar things.\n\n Overcoming emotional problems\n\nTherapy also helps individuals deal with emotional issues that trigger the condition, such as anxiety, depression, or stress. Doctors usually prescribe medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers.\n\n Avoid comparing yourself\n\nAlso, don\u2019t compare yourself to others, especially regarding weight and appearance.\n\nFocus on your own recovery. Sufferers also need to be open. Don\u2019t hesitate to talk to those closest to you about the struggles you\u2019ve been through.\n\nIf it has reached a critical stage and the symptoms of malnutrition are leading to death, the sufferer needs immediate medical treatment.\n\nSide Effects of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nAnorexia can have many complications. In severe cases, complications can lead to death, even when a person is not very thin.\n\nThis condition can occur due to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) or an imbalance of electrolytes or minerals such as sodium, potassium, and calcium which maintain fluid balance in the body.\n\nOther complications of anorexia include:\n\nHeart problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms, or heart failure.\nOsteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures.\nMuscle loss.\nNot experiencing menstruation in women. While in men, decreased testosterone levels.\nDigestive problems, such as constipation, bloating or nausea.\nElectrolyte abnormalities, such as low blood potassium, sodium, and chloride.\nKidney problems.\n\nIf an anorexic person becomes severely malnourished, every organ in the body can be damaged, including the brain, heart, and kidneys.\n\nThis damage may not be fully reversible, even when anorexia is under control.\n\nIn addition to a number of physical complications, people with anorexia also commonly have other mental health disorders . These include:\n\nDepression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.\nPersonality disorders.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nAlcohol and substance abuse.\nSelf-harm, suicidal thoughts, or suicide attempts.\n\nPrevention of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nUnfortunately, there is no surefire way to prevent anorexia nervosa. However, there are a few things you can try to reduce your risk of developing the condition, including:\n\nNot demanding or putting pressure on family regarding appearance or appearance.\nHelps increase self-confidence among family members.\nFocus on other things that have nothing to do with appearance.\nDiscuss with your doctor if you want to go on a diet or make changes to your eating patterns to lose weight.",

        "title": "Anosmia Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Anosmia?\n\nAnosmia is the inability or decreased ability to smell. It can be permanent or temporary depending on the cause.\n\nIn fact, some people have this condition from birth, while others lose the ability to smell due to some condition.\n\nExperts estimate that anosmia and hyposmia affect between 3 and 20 percent of the human population. Hyposmia is a decreased ability to smell.\n\nSometimes people refer to this condition as smell blindness. This condition can be permanent or temporary. Smelling a particular odor is a complex process involving both the brain and the nose.\n\nWhen a person smells a scent, air enters the nose and odor molecules attach to receptors on nerves that sense smell, called olfactory nerves. These nerves line the olfactory epithelium, which is the tissue that lines the nasal cavity.\n\nWhen odor molecules from the environment stimulate these nerves, they send signals to the brain. The brain receives the olfactory information and processes it into a scent that a person can identify.\n\nA disturbed sense of smell can affect a person\u2019s quality of life, especially when tasting food because the sensation of food taste is a combination of the senses of smell and taste.\n\nTherefore, sufferers will experience appetite disorders which can result in malnutrition.\n\nIn addition, this condition can also cause sufferers to be unaware of danger signs around them, for example not being able to detect the smell of stale food, the smell of a gas leak, or the smell of smoke from a fire.\n\nSymptoms of Anosmia\n\nWhen people experience anosmia, they may notice that they can no longer smell identifiable odors.\n\nOn the other hand, people who are born with anosmia due to genetic differences may not realize they have anosmia, having never had the ability to smell.\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can cause loss of the sense of smell.\n\nIf a person living with a neurodegenerative disease notices a loss of smell, they should seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. Sometimes anosmia is an early sign of a neurodegenerative disease.\n\nWhen a person can no longer smell, they cannot perceive odor warnings in food and the environment.\n\nPeople living with anosmia may experience a lower quality of life-related to social interactions, eating, and mental well-being.\n\nRisk Factors for Anosmia\n\nSome things that are risk factors for this condition are:\n\nHaving a nasal infection or head trauma.\nAged over 60 years.\nSuffering from neurodegenerative disease.\nTaking medications that can cause anosmia.\nUndergoing radiation therapy to the head or neck.\n\nCauses of Anosmia\n\nIn the past, this disorder occurred in many people who had COVID-19. But overall, there are various other things that can cause disorders in the olfactory pathway that lead to anosmia, including:\n\nObstructive Disorders\n\nObstruction or blockage of the sense of smell is the most common cause of anosmia.\n\nOne cause of obstruction is inflammation, such as flu, rhinitis (colds), and rhinosinusitis. In addition, the presence of lumps in the nostrils, such as nasal polyps, can also cause obstruction of smell.\n\nHead Trauma\n\nHead injuries due to trauma are also one of the common causes of anosmia.\n\nThis is caused by a head injury which results in damage to the nose and sinuses which becomes a mechanical obstacle to being able to smell.\n\nIn addition, head trauma can also cause damage to the olfactory nerve. Anosmia due to head trauma can be temporary or permanent depending on the type of damage that occurs.\n\nAging and Neurodegenerative Processes\n\nThe aging process is a normal condition and is associated with a decrease in the ability to smell. This is due to the loss of a number of cells in the olfactory nerve.\n\nIn addition, several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Lewy Body dementia also result in decreased ability to smell.\n\nCongenital Disease\n\nTurner syndrome and Kallman syndrome are some congenital conditions that can cause permanent anosmia.\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nAnosmia is one of the side effects of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nDiagnosis of Anosmia\n\nLoss of smell can be difficult to detect. Your doctor may ask you questions about your current symptoms, examine your nose, perform a complete physical exam, and ask about your medical history.\n\nYour doctor may also ask about when the problem started, whether all or only some types of smell are affected, and whether or not you can taste food.\n\nDepending on the answers, the doctor may also perform one or more of the following tests:\n\nCT scan, which uses X-rays to create detailed images of the brain;\nMRI scans, which use radio waves and magnets to look at the brain;\nX-ray of the skull;\nNasal endoscopy to look inside the nose.\n\nAnosmia Complications\n\nPeople with anosmia may lose interest in food leading to malnutrition and weight loss.\n\nPeople with anosmia should also ensure that they have a working smoke and fire alarm in their home at all times.\n\nThey should also be careful with food storage and natural gas use, as it may be difficult to detect spoiled food and gas leaks.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n\nProperly label food with expiration dates;\nRead labels on chemicals, such as kitchen cleaners and insecticides;\nBe careful when using electrical equipment.\n\nAnosmia Treatment\n\nTreatment depends on the cause. If the loss of smell is due to COVID-19, a cold, allergies, or a sinus infection, it will usually go away on its own within a few days.\n\nYou should consult a doctor if anosmia does not go away after cold or allergy symptoms subside.\n\nTreatments that may help with anosmia caused by nasal irritation include:\n\nDecongestant;\nAntihistamines;\nSteroid nasal spray;\nAntibiotics, for bacterial infections;\nReduce exposure to nasal irritants and allergens;\nQuit smoking.\n\nLoss of smell caused by nasal obstruction can be treated by removing whatever is blocking the nasal passages.\n\nThis removal may involve procedures to remove nasal polyps, straighten the nasal septum, or clear the sinuses. Unfortunately, older adults are more likely to lose their sense of smell permanently.\n\nThere is currently no treatment available for people with congenital anosmia.\n\nPeople with partial loss of their sense of smell can add concentrated flavorings to foods to enhance their enjoyment.\n\nAnosmia Prevention\n\nBecause anosmia is a symptom of many health-related conditions, it cannot always be prevented.\n\nHowever, there are several things that can be done to reduce the risk:\n\nAvoid toxic chemicals and the environment.\nDo not smoke.\nWear protective gear when playing contact sports, as anosmia can be caused by brain injury.",

Other tests include kidney, thyroid, and liver function.\nConducting a mental health evaluation, in the form of an interview to find out how the sufferer feels, their eating habits, and their thought patterns.\nX-rays to determine bone health and density, as well as the potential for lung infections or heart problems.\n\nAnorexia Nervosa Treatment\n\nHere are some steps for treating anorexia nervosa that you can take:\n\n Consultation with medical and psychological professionals\n\nAn important first step is to seek help from a medical and psychological team experienced in treating eating disorders.\n\nA doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist can help diagnose and plan appropriate treatment.\n\n Nutrition and weight recovery\n\nIn cases of anorexia nervosa, weight restoration is a priority to restore healthy body function. Consult a dietitian to plan a balanced diet.\n\n Cognitive behavioral therapy\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one form of therapy that is effective in treating anorexia nervosa.\n\nThis therapy helps sufferers identify negative thought patterns and behaviors related to eating and weight. The therapist will also help them replace these thought patterns with healthier and more realistic ones.\n\n Family therapy\n\nThis type of therapy is generally intended for teenagers who suffer from anorexia nervosa.\n\nInvolving the family in care can help build support and understanding of the family\u2019s role in recovery.\n\n Group support\n\nJoining a support group for eating disorders can help individuals feel more accepted and gain support from people who are going through similar things.\n\n Overcoming emotional problems\n\nTherapy also helps individuals deal with emotional issues that trigger the condition, such as anxiety, depression, or stress. Doctors usually prescribe medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers.\n\n Avoid comparing yourself\n\nAlso, don\u2019t compare yourself to others, especially regarding weight and appearance.\n\nFocus on your own recovery. Sufferers also need to be open. Don\u2019t hesitate to talk to those closest to you about the struggles you\u2019ve been through.\n\nIf it has reached a critical stage and the symptoms of malnutrition are leading to death, the sufferer needs immediate medical treatment.\n\nSide Effects of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nAnorexia can have many complications. In severe cases, complications can lead to death, even when a person is not very thin.\n\nThis condition can occur due to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) or an imbalance of electrolytes or minerals such as sodium, potassium, and calcium which maintain fluid balance in the body.\n\nOther complications of anorexia include:\n\nHeart problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms, or heart failure.\nOsteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures.\nMuscle loss.\nNot experiencing menstruation in women. While in men, decreased testosterone levels.\nDigestive problems, such as constipation, bloating or nausea.\nElectrolyte abnormalities, such as low blood potassium, sodium, and chloride.\nKidney problems.\n\nIf an anorexic person becomes severely malnourished, every organ in the body can be damaged, including the brain, heart, and kidneys.\n\nThis damage may not be fully reversible, even when anorexia is under control.\n\nIn addition to a number of physical complications, people with anorexia also commonly have other mental health disorders . These include:\n\nDepression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.\nPersonality disorders.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nAlcohol and substance abuse.\nSelf-harm, suicidal thoughts, or suicide attempts.\n\nPrevention of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nUnfortunately, there is no surefire way to prevent anorexia nervosa. However, there are a few things you can try to reduce your risk of developing the condition, including:\n\nNot demanding or putting pressure on family regarding appearance or appearance.\nHelps increase self-confidence among family members.\nFocus on other things that have nothing to do with appearance.\nDiscuss with your doctor if you want to go on a diet or make changes to your eating patterns to lose weight.",

        "title": "Color Blind Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Color Blind Color blindness is the inability to see the difference between certain colors. Although many people commonly use the term \u201ccolor blindness\u201d for this condition, color blindness in the sense that everything is seen in shades of black and white is very rare. So most people who are color blind see a different color than they should see. Color blindness is usually an inherited condition, and men are more likely to be born with the condition. Most people with color blindness cannot distinguish between certain shades of red and green. Less commonly, a person with this vision disorder cannot distinguish between blue and yellow. In addition, certain eye diseases and some medications can also cause color blindness. Symptoms of Color Blindness A person may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. Some people find out that they or their child has color blindness symptoms when it causes confusion. Such as when there is a problem distinguishing colors in traffic lights or interpreting color-coded learning materials. The most common color blindness is the inability to see some shades of red and green. Often, a person who is less able to see red-green or blue-yellow is not fully sensitive to either color. This condition can be mild, moderate, or severe. Can Color Blind People See Any Colors? The following is an explanation of what colors color blind people can see, based on the type of color blindness: 1. Red-Green Color Blindness This is a condition where the photopigments in the red cones or green cones of your eyes do not function properly. There are several types: Deuteranomaly: This is the most common form of color blindness and affects 5 percent of men, but is rare in women. It occurs when the green cone photopigment does not function properly. Yellow and green appear redder, and it is difficult to distinguish blue from violet. Protanomaly: Occurs when the red cone photopigments do not function properly. Orange, red, and yellow appear greener, and the colors are less vibrant. It is usually mild and does not cause problems in daily life. It is rare in women and affects about 1 percent of men. Protanopia: A person does not have functioning red cone cells. Reds appear only dark gray. Some shades of orange, yellow, and green appear yellow. This is rare in women and affects only about 1 percent of men. Deuteranopia: A person does not have functioning green cone cells. Red looks yellow-brown, and green looks beige. This affects 1 percent of men and is rare in women. 2. Blue-Yellow Color Blindness This is when the blue cone photopigment is missing or not functioning properly. This is the second most common type affecting men and women equally. Tritanomaly: Blue cone cells work only in a limited way. Blue looks greener, and pink is difficult to distinguish from yellow and red. This condition is very rare. Tritanopia: also known as blue-yellow color blindness, is a condition where someone does not have blue cone cells. Blue looks green, and yellow looks light gray or purple. This condition is also very rare. 3. Complete Color Blindness Also has another name monochromacy, which is when someone does not see color at all and vision is not very clear. There are two types, namely: Cone monochromacy: This condition occurs when 2 of the 3 cone photopigments, such as red, green, or blue, are not functioning. When only one type of cone is functioning, it is difficult to distinguish one color from another. Rod monochromacy: also known as achromatopsia, is the most severe form of color blindness. None of the cone cells have functioning photopigments. As a result, the world appears in black, white, and gray. Meanwhile, color blindness in children is often detected late. Because children tend not to know and are not aware that what they see may not be perfect. Risk Factors There are many things that increase the risk of experiencing this vision disorder, including: Inherited from parents. Having certain diseases. Taking certain medications. Exposure to chemicals. Done. Causes of Color Blindness Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that occurs with the eye\u2019s ability to respond to different wavelengths of light. Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters the eye through the cornea and passes through the transparent lens. The jelly-like tissue in the eye (vitreous humor) to the wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of the eye in the macular area of \u200b\u200bthe retina. Cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), or long (red) wavelengths of light. Chemicals in the cone cells trigger reactions and send wavelength information through the optic nerve to the brain. If your eyes are not abnormal, you will perceive color. But if your cone cells lack one or more wavelength-sensitive chemicals, you won\u2019t be able to distinguish between red, green, or blue. Causes of color blindness include: 1. Genetic disorders Inherited color deficiencies are much more common in males than females. The most common color deficiency is red-green, with blue-yellow deficiency being much less common. It is rare to have no color vision at all. You can inherit a mild, moderate or severe degree of the disorder. Inherited color deficiencies usually affect both eyes, and the severity does not change throughout life. 2. Certain diseases Several conditions can cause color deficits in the eyes. Starting from sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic alcoholism, and leukemia. One eye will be more affected than the other, and the color deficit will improve if the underlying disease can be treated. 3. Certain eye diseases This condition can also occur due to eye disease that causes damage to the part of the eye that helps see color. Examples of eye diseases include glaucoma or macular degeneration. 4. Consumption of certain medications Some medications can alter color vision, such as some drugs that treat certain autoimmune diseases, heart problems, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, infections, nervous disorders, and psychological problems. 5. Aging factors Your ability to see colors slowly declines as you age. 6. Chemicals Exposure to certain workplace chemicals, such as carbon disulfide and fertilizers, can cause color vision loss. Color Blindness Diagnosis If you have trouble seeing certain colors, your eye doctor can perform a test to see if you have a color deficiency. You will have a complete eye exam. Then, the doctor will perform supporting tests to support the examination. Here are some types of color blindness tests that doctors can perform: 1. Ishihara test This examination is the option that doctors most often recommend. In the procedure, the doctor will ask the patient to recognize numbers or letters that are shown faintly on the image in the form of colored dots. 2. Color Arrangement Test This examination aims to provide a detailed analysis of this condition and/or a person\u2019s ability to recognize colors accurately. This color blindness test consists of a number of colored discs or plates that a person must arrange in the correct color order. 3. Cambridge Color Test This test involves using a computer screen. When a person undergoes it, the doctor will ask them to identify the letter \u201cC\u201d on the screen that is a different color than the surrounding colors. Color Blindness Treatment There is no cure for color blindness. Except for color vision problems related to the use of certain medications or eye conditions. Stopping the medication that is causing the vision problem or treating the underlying eye disease may result in improved color vision. Wearing colored filters over glasses or colored contact lenses can enhance the perception of contrast between confusing colors. However, such lenses will not improve the ability to see all colors. Several rare retinal disorders associated with color deficiencies can be modified with gene replacement techniques. This treatment is being studied and may be available in the future. In addition, you can also try the following tips to help overcome this condition: Memorize the order of colored objects. If it is important to know individual colors, such as traffic lights, memorize the order of the colors. Label colored items that you want to match with other items. Ask someone with good color vision to help you sort and label clothes. Use technology. Such as apps for mobile phones and digital devices that can help identify colors. Color Blindness Prevention The causes of color blindness are divided into factors that sufferers cannot control (genetic) and factors that sufferers can control. Here are steps you can take to reduce the risk of color blindness: 1. Prevention for genetic factors If the cause of color blindness is a genetic factor, then there is no preventative measure that a person can take. Therefore, it is important for couples who want to get married to discuss genetic testing with their doctor before planning a pregnancy. 2. Prevention for controllable causes For causes of color blindness that you can control, there are several efforts to reduce the risk: Routinely undergo a comprehensive health check. Have an eye exam every year. Implement a healthy lifestyle. If working in a sector that is prone to exposure to hazardous chemicals, be sure to wear proper eye protection. Exercise regularly. Consume healthy, balanced nutritious food. Especially food that is healthy for the eyes. Complications of Color Blindness In general, this condition can cause the child\u2019s learning process to be less than optimal. In addition, there will be many adjustments that sufferers will have to make. However, the most severe level of this condition is total color blindness. In this condition, sufferers can only see colors such as gray, white, and black. In addition, people with total color blindness are also at risk of experiencing other vision disorders, such as: Nystagmus or a condition where the eyeballs make rapid and repeated movements without intention. Photophobia or sensitivity to bright light. Decreased visual acuity. Amblyopia or lazy eye syndrome. Farsightedness or hypermetropia. When to See a Doctor? If you suspect you or someone you love has trouble distinguishing certain colors or changes in color vision, see an eye doctor for testing. Remember, it is important for children to get a comprehensive eye exam. Including color vision testing, before starting school. Also, there is no cure for genetic color deficiencies. But if eye disease or illness is the cause, then treatment can improve color vision.",

        "title": "Lazy Eye(Amblyopia) Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Lazy Eye(Amblyopia) The medical term for lazy eye is amblyopia. This condition occurs when the brain only connects to one eye, causing poor vision in the other eye. This causes the brain to ignore signals from the weak or lazy eye. This disease can lead to impaired vision and loss of depth perception. The eye affected by lazy eye does not always look different, although it may \u201cwander\u201d in different directions. The condition usually affects only one eye. However, in some cases, vision in both eyes can be affected. This condition usually occurs in children and is the main cause of decreased vision in children. However, it is important to understand that this condition is not the same as crossed or turned eyes or what is called strabismus. It\u2019s just that strabismus can cause amblyopia if crossed eyes are not used enough. If left untreated, temporary or permanent vision loss can occur. This includes loss of depth perception and three-dimensional vision. Lazy Eye Symptoms (Amblyopia) Lazy eye symptoms are seen from sufferers who cannot focus well with one of their eyes. Because the disturbed eye will not see objects clearly. The brain cannot receive clear data either, so it will start to ignore the image of the object. In many cases, a stronger brain and eyes can make up for these deficiencies very well. Therefore, sufferers do not realize that they have an eye problem. That is why lazy eye is often only diagnosed when a child undergoes a routine eye test. Symptoms of lazy eye can include: Blurred vision. Double vision. Weak depth perception. Rolling the eyes, either up, down, out, or in. People with this condition need to have their vision checked, especially if they have a family history of strabismus, childhood cataracts, or other eye conditions. Risk Factors for Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Risk factors associated with an increased risk of lazy eye include: Born premature Having a family history of lazy eye Developmental disorders. Causes of Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Lazy eye develops as a result of abnormal visual experiences early in life. This changes the nerve pathways between the retina at the back of the eye and the brain. The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals. Eventually, the eyes\u2019 ability to work together decreases, and the brain suppresses or ignores input from the weaker eye. Anything that causes a child\u2019s vision to become blurry or causes the eyes to squint and change direction can cause this condition. Common causes of this condition include: Muscle imbalance (strabismus amblyopia). The most common cause is an imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes. This imbalance can cause the eyes to protrude inward or outward, preventing them from working together. Difference in visual acuity between the eyes (refractive amblyopia). A significant difference between the two eyes can cause lazy eye. Often it is due to nearsightedness, but sometimes it is due to farsightedness or an uneven curvature of the eye\u2019s surface (astigmatism). Glasses or contact lenses are usually used to correct this refractive problem. In some children, this eye condition is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems. Problems with one eye, such as a cloudy area in the lens (cataract), can block clear vision in that eye. Infantile deprivation amblyopia requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. It is often the most severe type of amblyopia. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Diagnosis Amblyopia diagnosis can be determined from a medical interview, physical examination, and several supporting examinations such as: Crowding phenomena test, testing using the Snellen chart. Density filter neutral test, a vision test using reduced light intensity. Worth\u2019s four dot test, a test to see fusion and stereopsis vision. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Treatment Effective lazy eye treatment involves treating the underlying eye condition first. Simple early treatment measures that can be taken may include the use of glasses, contact lenses, eye patches, eye drops, or vision therapy. The earlier the condition is treated, the better the outcome. However, recovery is still possible if amblyopia is diagnosed and treated when you are older. 1. Glasses/contact lenses If you have amblyopia due to nearsightedness or farsightedness, or have astigmatism in one eye, then corrective glasses or contact lenses may help. 2. Eye patch Wearing an eye patch over your dominant eye can help strengthen your weaker eye. Your doctor may recommend wearing the patch for 1 to 2 hours a day, depending on how severe your amblyopia is. Blindfolds will help develop the areas of the brain that control vision. 3. Eye drops Eye drops can be used once or twice a day to blur the vision in the good eye. Like an eye patch, this treatment encourages you to use your weaker eye more often. This can be an additional alternative to lazy eye treatment. 4. Surgery If you have crossed eyes or eyes that point in opposite directions, you may need surgery on the eye muscles. Lazy Eye Complications Certain complications can occur with lazy eye, including: Blindness. If left untreated, sufferers can eventually lose vision in the eye affected by lazy eye. This vision loss is usually permanent. Eye Alignment. Strabismus, where the eyes are misaligned, can be permanent. Central Vision. If children do not receive treatment, central vision may not develop properly. This can affect their ability to perform certain tasks. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Prevention Lazy eye cannot be prevented. However, you can stop it from getting worse or causing permanent problems. The best way to prevent vision loss due to amblyopia is to have regular eye exams. Make sure your child has a comprehensive eye exam at 6 months of age and then again at 3 years of age. When to See a Doctor? When you experience symptoms of this eye problem and it starts to interfere with your vision, see an eye doctor immediately for further treatment. Proper treatment can minimize the effects so that treatment can be done faster.",

        "title": "Pterygium Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Pterygium Pterygium is an eye disease that occurs due to the growth of a pink, triangular tissue membrane that appears on the white part of the eyeball. This condition is also known as surfer\u2018s eye. Typically, this condition begins on the cornea near the nose and can grow to the pupil (the black part of the eye). This condition is usually only found in one eye. However, if you experience it in both eyes, this eye disorder is called pterygia. This disease can cause discomfort and trigger itching. If not treated immediately, this condition can increase the risk of closed pupils and impaired vision. Symptoms of Pterygium This disease develops slowly. At the beginning of the appearance of pterygium, you will not experience any symptoms. However, symptoms will be felt more as the condition worsens. There are several symptoms that sufferers often experience in the early stages of its development, such as: A pink line appears on the white of the eye. Red and irritated eyes. Dry eyes accompanied by itching and a burning sensation. Feeling like there is sand or dust in the eyes. Eyes that water more often. The vision became a little blurry. Worsening symptoms are characterized by the growth of a membrane that increasingly covers the cornea and impaired vision. Pterygium Risk Factors Avoid various risk factors that can trigger this disease, such as: Spending too much time outdoors during the day. Eyes exposed to dust, sand, and air pollution can cause eye irritation. Dry eyes. Causes of Pterygium It is not yet known exactly what causes pterygium. However, too much direct exposure to ultraviolet light is thought to be the cause of this condition. There are several theories that try to explain the pathogenesis of pterygium. For example, geographical variations affect the incidence of pterygium, which is shown by most studies that have been done. This is based on the higher incidence of pterygium in countries closer to the equator. The increased prevalence of pterygium is thought to be due to the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation, particularly UV-B radiation, which affects people in equatorial regions. The hypothesis is that this radiation causes mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, thereby facilitating abnormal proliferation of the limbal epithelium. Apart from direct exposure to sunlight, eye irritation that is not treated properly can also trigger pterygium. Diagnosis of Pterygium A doctor can diagnose this condition based on a physical exam using a slit lamp. This lamp allows the doctor to see a person\u2019s eye with the help of magnification and bright lighting. Additional tests include: Visual Acuity Test. This test involves reading letters on an eye chart. Corneal Topography. This medical mapping technique is used to measure changes in the curvature of the cornea. Photo Documentation. This procedure is done by taking pictures that aim to track the growth rate of the pterygium. Pterygium Treatment If the symptoms of pterygium are still mild or still in the early stages, doctors will generally prescribe medication to reduce irritation or redness in the eyes. Medication can be given with steroid eye drops, artificial tears, and so on. However, if the pterygium has reached an advanced stage and disturbing symptoms are found, such as impaired vision, the doctor will recommend surgery to remove this abnormal tissue growth and remove it. After that, conjunctival tissue or placenta can be used to fill the empty space where the pterygium lesion was. Pterygium Complications If left untreated, this condition can trigger severe scarring of the cornea. Scarring can increase the risk of vision loss. Pterygium Prevention Prevention of pterygium disease can be done by using sunglasses with lenses that can block 99-100 percent of UV A and UV B every day when going outdoors and the weather is hot. Don\u2019t forget to use head coverings, such as hats, which can protect your eyes from direct exposure to sunlight.",

        "title": "Conjunctivitis Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis, also called pink eye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva. Well, the conjunctiva itself is a clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye (sclera) and the inside of the eyelids. This inflammatory disorder of the conjunctiva can cause the white part of the eye to appear reddish or pink. This eye disease is usually caused by bacterial or viral infections, to allergic reactions. Even so, this disorder rarely affects vision. In addition, conjunctivitis most often attacks children, because this eye disease can spread quickly in schools and daycare centers. However, conjunctivitis is rarely serious, especially if it is found and treated quickly. The role of parents is very important to address this problem in children quickly so that the discomfort caused can be overcome immediately. Symptoms of Conjunctivitis Symptoms of conjunctivitis vary depending on the type and cause. In general, the symptoms of conjunctivitis are: Red eyes in one or both eyes. The eyes also often feel itchy and like there is sand in them. The eyes can produce a thick, crusty discharge at night, making it difficult to open your eyes in the morning. Enlarged lymph nodes may also be found. Eyes feel burning and/or sore. Swollen eyelids. Blurred vision. Eyes are sensitive to light. Green or white discharge from the eyes. Risk Factors for Conjunctivitis There are several factors that increase a person\u2019s risk of experiencing this eye problem, including: Using contact lenses, especially long-term wear. Exposure to someone infected with the virus or bacteria causes this eye disorder. Being exposed to something that causes a person to be allergic. Causes of Conjunctivitis As mentioned earlier, there are three main types that cause this eye disorder, namely infections from viruses or bacteria, and allergies. However, there are several other causes that can cause conjunctivitis, such as: Reaction to eye drops. Irritants to shampoo, dirt, smoke, and chlorine. Fungi, amoeba, and parasites. Conjunctivitis is also sometimes caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Gonorrhea and Chlamydia are examples of STDs that can cause conjunctivitis. Types of Conjunctivitis There are several types of conjunctivitis that are distinguished by their causes. Here is a more complete explanation: Viral Conjunctivitis This viral eye condition is the most common type of conjunctivitis. This type of pink eye is highly contagious and often spreads in certain settings, such as schools and other crowded places. This condition can cause burning red eyes with discharge. Bacterial Conjunctivitis This eye problem is also considered very contagious. A bacterial infection causes the eyes to turn pink. This disorder can also cause pain in the eyes with lots of sticky pus in the eyes. Some bacterial infections can also cause little or no discharge. Allergic Conjunctivitis This eye problem is caused by an allergic reaction to pollen, animals, cigarette smoke, pool chlorine, car exhaust, and many more. This conjunctivitis is not contagious. When it occurs, you can feel very itchy, red, and watery, and the eyelids can become swollen. Diagnosis of Conjunctivitis To make a diagnosis, the doctor will initially ask questions about symptoms and recent medical history related to conjunctivitis. After that, supporting examinations are carried out by taking samples of fluid flowing from the eye to be analyzed in the laboratory (culture). This laboratory examination can help the doctor to determine the cause of the disorder. For example, caused by bacteria, viruses, allergies, or other problems. After that, the determination for the right treatment can be done. Conjunctivitis Treatment Treatment for this eye disorder depends on the underlying cause. Here are some treatments: For viral conjunctivitis, doctors will not prescribe antibiotics, as it usually resolves on its own within one to three weeks. To create more comfort, apply a cool, wet cloth to the eyes. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment. However, if the conjunctivitis is caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia, oral antibiotics are needed. Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with vasoconstrictors, antihistamines, and steroid eye drops. This can help relieve itching and swelling. General treatment is symptomatic for all types of conjunctivitis, namely compressing the eyes with warm water for 5-10 minutes 4 times a day to relieve discomfort. In addition, artificial tears can also be given. For conjunctivitis sufferers who use contact lenses, it is recommended not to wear contact lenses until the eyes are completely healed. Complications of Conjunctivitis If left untreated, conjunctivitis can cause complications in the form of inflammation of the cornea that affects vision. This can happen to both children and adults. Therefore, proper evaluation and treatment are needed to avoid problems such as blurred vision or light sensitivity so that the risk of complications is smaller. Conjunctivitis Prevention Here are some ways you can do to prevent conjunctivitis: Keep your hands clean and do not touch your eyes with your hands. Wash your hands more often. Use clean towels and cloths every day. Do not share towels or washcloths. Change pillowcases as often as possible. Limit the use of eye cosmetics, such as mascara. Do not share eye cosmetics or personal eye care items. Avoid allergy triggers. Clean contact lenses regularly, especially before use. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms of conjunctivitis, such as eye pain, a feeling of something stuck in your eye, blurred vision, and light sensitivity, see an eye doctor immediately for treatment. Those who wear contact lenses should stop wearing them as soon as symptoms of conjunctivitis begin. If symptoms do not improve within 12 to 24 hours, make an appointment with your eye doctor to make sure you do not have a more serious eye infection related to your contact lens use.",

        "title": "Presbyopia Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Presbyopia Presbyopia or old eyes is a condition in which the eyes slowly lose their ability to focus quickly on close objects. This condition is something that commonly occurs as we age. Presbyopia generally appears at age 40 and continues to develop until age 65. This is related to the eye lens which is surrounded by elastic muscles. These muscles can change the shape of the lens to focus light to fall right on the retina. Unfortunately, as we age, the muscles around the eye lens will lose their elasticity and harden. As a result, the eye lens cannot bend light properly to focus it on the retina. Symptoms of Presbyopia Symptoms of presbyopia begin to be experienced since someone enters the age of 40 years, usually, someone is not aware that he has presbyopia because he can still try to adjust. You need to recognize the symptoms of presbyopia especially if you are over 40 years old. The symptoms that appear are usually marked by: Difficulty reading newspapers or writing on a cell phone or letters from a close distance, and when you move the object away, the writing is more legible. Vision becomes blurry when looking at objects at close range. Eyes feel sore and head feels tense and sore after reading at close range or writing. The above complaints will get worse when you do it in low light conditions. Risk Factors for Presbyopia The most significant risk factor for presbyopia is age. Most people lose some of their ability to focus on near objects by age 40. However, certain diseases or medications can cause presbyopia in people younger than 40. When symptoms of presbyopia occur earlier than usual, it is called premature presbyopia. In addition, a person is at higher risk for premature presbyopia if they have: Anemia, which is a lack of enough normal blood cells. Suffering from cardiovascular disease. Diabetes, or difficulty metabolizing blood sugar. Having hyperopia, or farsightedness, which means the sufferer has greater difficulty seeing objects that are close up than objects that are far away. Multiple sclerosis, which is a chronic disease that affects the spine and brain. Myasthenia gravis, which is a neuromuscular disorder that affects the body\u2019s nerves and muscles. The presence of trauma or certain eye diseases. Have vascular insufficiency, or poor blood flow. In addition, some prescription and over-the-counter medications can also increase a person\u2019s risk of developing early presbyopia. Examples of these medications are: Anti-anxiety medication. Antidepressant. Antihistamines. Antipsychotics. Antispasmodic. Diuretic. Causes of Presbyopia First of all you need to know that in order to see an object, the human eye must capture light, and focus the light from the object being viewed to the retina in the eye. When the object is at a closer distance, the lens of the eye that is responsible for focusing the light captured by the cornea of \u200b\u200bthe eye becomes more flexible. The lens of the eye is different from the cornea, because the lens of the eye has a flexible nature, and can change shape with the help of the circular muscles that surround it. When you look at an object that is far away, the circular muscles relax. Likewise, when you look at an object at close range, the circular muscles of the eye will tense and make the lens of the eye change shape in order to focus the light received. In presbyopia, the eye lens will experience changes to become harder and begin to lose its flexibility, this happens with age. As a result of this loss of flexibility, the eye lens becomes difficult to focus the existing light. As a result, the resulting image becomes unfocused/blurry. Presbyopia Diagnosis Presbyopia can be diagnosed through a routine eye examination consisting of a vision examination through an eye refraction test, and a complete eye examination. Presbyopia Treatment Until now, several steps that can be taken to overcome presbyopia include: Wearing glasses. Using contact lenses. Refractive eye surgery, such as LASIK surgery. Eye lens implantation. Korean inlay, which is the act of inserting a small plastic ring into each cornea to change the curvature of the cornea. Complications of Presbyopia If presbyopia is not diagnosed or not properly corrected, the sufferer\u2019s vision will gradually deteriorate. This condition can make presbyopia sufferers have problems maintaining their daily activity and productivity levels. Especially when sufferers have to read small writings, they can experience headaches and eye fatigue. Everyone develops presbyopia as they age, so presbyopia may also be accompanied by other types of eye problems. Presbyopia can occur in combination with: Astigmatism. An imperfection in the curvature of the cornea that causes blurred vision. Hyperopia, or farsightedness. Myopia, or nearsightedness. In addition, people with presbyopia may also have different types of eye problems in each eye. Presbyopia Prevention To date, there is no proven technique to prevent presbyopia. However, there are steps you can take to improve your eye health and slow the progression of presbyopia, namely: Have regular eye exams. Manage chronic health conditions that can cause vision loss, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Wearing sunglasses. Wear protective eyewear when participating in activities that may result in eye injury. Eat a healthy diet with foods containing antioxidants, vitamin A, and beta carotene. Make sure you wear glasses with the right lens size. Use good lighting when reading. When to See a Doctor? If you experience one or more symptoms of presbyopia, see a doctor immediately. The goal is that appropriate treatment can be carried out early so that the risk of complications can be minimized.",

        "title": "Cataract Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Cataract Cataracts are a disease when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy and opaque. In general, cataracts develop slowly and are not initially felt to be disturbing. However, over time, cataracts will interfere with vision and make sufferers feel like looking at a foggy window, making it difficult to drive, read, and do daily activities. This eye disease is the leading cause of blindness in the world that can be treated. Cataract Symptoms Sufferers can experience several symptoms, for example: Blurred vision like fog. See circles around the light. Double vision. Decreased vision at night. Glare when looking at car headlights, the sun, or lamps. Frequently change the size of glasses. The colors around it look faded. Cataract Risk Factors There are several factors that can increase the risk of cataracts, including: Aging. Aging is the most common cause of lens opacities or cataracts. History of trauma. Eye lenses that have experienced trauma, such as sharp material fragments entering the eye, being hit by a ball, fireworks, can cause cataracts to develop more quickly. Infection during pregnancy. If the mother has an infection during pregnancy, especially rubella, it can be the main cause of congenital cataracts in the child that is born. Congenital cataracts can occur in one or both of the child\u2019s eyes. Taking certain medications over a long period of time, such as corticosteroids and amiodarone, can trigger cataracts. People with certain diseases. People with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypokalemia, and atopic dermatitis may be associated with the development of cataracts later in life. Smoking and alcohol consumption habits. Prolonged exposure to sunlight on the eyes. Exposure to toxins or poisons. Family history of cataracts. History of eye surgery. Causes of Cataracts The most common cause of cataracts is due to aging or trauma that causes changes in the eye tissue. The lens of the eye is mostly made up of water and protein. As we age, the lens becomes thicker and less flexible. This causes protein clumps and reduces the amount of light reaching the retina, a light-sensitive layer located at the back of the eye. This condition eventually causes blurry and dull vision. The lens changes start out as a mild yellow-brown color, but worsen over time. Some inherited genetic disorders can also cause other health problems that can increase the risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, previous eye surgery, or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications can also cause the eye disease to develop. Cataract Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose cataracts by reviewing your medical history and symptoms and performing a thorough eye exam, including: Visual field examination. Visual acuity test. Examination using a tool directed from the side of the eye, to show cloudiness in the eye lens ( shadow test ). Other additional examinations that can also be performed to diagnose cataracts include: A slit lamp examination, which allows the eye doctor to see the structures in the front of your eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the retina, if abnormalities in other organs in the eye are suspected. Applanation tonometry. This test measures the fluid pressure in the eye. Cataract Treatment If cataracts aren\u2019t too bothersome, you may just need new glasses to help you see better. If cataracts cause vision to worsen and make it difficult to carry out daily activities, surgery is a treatment that can be performed to overcome this eye problem. Cataract surgery is generally safe and does not require hospitalization. There are two types of cataract surgery, namely: Small incision cataract surgery ( phacoemulsification ). This surgery is done by making a small incision on the edge of the cornea. Next, the doctor will shine ultrasound waves to destroy the lens and then remove it using a suction device. Extracapsular surgery. This surgery requires a larger incision to remove the cloudy lens nucleus. The remaining lens is then removed using a suction device. In both types of surgery, an artificial lens, also called an intraocular lens, is inserted to replace the original lens. The surgery takes about an hour and is painless. Doctors usually use eye drops to numb the eye and keep the patient conscious during the surgery. Cataract Complications In most cases, cataracts will continue to worsen over time, causing vision to decrease. This can make it difficult for sufferers to drive, even endangering safety, as well as the sufferer\u2019s overall quality of life. If left untreated for a long time, cataracts can often cause total blindness. Untreated cataracts can also become \u201chyper-mature,\u201d a condition that makes them more difficult to remove and more likely to cause complications of cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is usually safe and rarely causes complications. However, it is not impossible for complications from cataract surgery to occur, including: Eye inflammation. This complication usually occurs when the sufferer has a large or thick cataract. Light sensitivity. When this condition persists, it may be due to dryness or inflammation. Photopsia, or seeing flashes of light or floaters. This condition occurs when the gel inside the eye separates from the retina. Photopsia is common and usually resolves within a few months. Macular edema. This is caused by a buildup of fluid in the macula, the central part of the retina at the back of the eye. Ptosis, or drooping eyelid. This complication can occur due to surgical trauma. Intraocular lens dislocation. This occurs when a new (intraocular) lens implant is not properly seated in the eye\u2019s capsular bag, which holds it in place or is dislocated. Torn or detached retina. This is more likely to occur in younger sufferers and is the result of the retina pulling away from the back of the eye. Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) or a second cataract, can occur because cataract surgery removes the front part of the lens but leaves the back in place. Cataract Prevention Some efforts that can be made to prevent cataracts include: Have your eyes checked regularly by an eye specialist. Protect your eyes from impact and prolonged exposure to sunlight by using glasses that protect against ultraviolet rays, both UVA and UVB. Manage other health problems, such as diabetes, that can increase the risk of cataracts. Limit the habit of driving at night. Improve lighting in the house. Using a magnifying glass when reading. Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption Implement a diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables. When to See a Doctor? If some of the cataract symptoms above appear and become increasingly disturbing or worsen, so that the sufferer feels pain in the eyes or has difficulty carrying out daily activities, it is a good idea to immediately see an eye specialist for further examination and treatment.",

        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is one of the most common hormonal problems among women of reproductive age. In this condition, women may experience symptoms such as irregular or missed periods, fertility problems, excessive hair growth - especially on the face - and acne. If you are suffering from PCOS or have recently been diagnosed with it, you'll know how challenging it can be. While there is no permanent cure for this condition, the good news is that you can manage it. How? By taking charge and being more mindful of your dietary practices. However, many start following diets without knowing if they're really good for their condition. Are you also feeling confused about what to eat and what not to? Recently, nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary took to her Instagram handle to clear this confusion and share the three worst diets for women with PCOS.Also Read: What To Drink For PCOS: 5 Quick And Easy Herbal Drinks Shared By Ayurvedic Expert Here Are 3 Worst Diets For Women With PCOS, According To The Nutritionist: 1. Intermittent Fasting Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a popular diet in recent times. In this, you are required to alternate between eating and fasting periods. While it may work well for some, Rashi recommends avoiding it if you have PCOS. She explains, \"If you're going to do intermittent fasting every single day, and not cyclically, it's going to raise your cortisol levels and bring down your progesterone.\" When this happens, it can mess up your hormones and worsen your condition. 2. Low Calorie Diet Low-calorie diets are great for losing weight, but not for people with PCOS. According to Rashi, eating low-calorie foods like salads all the time can do more harm than good. In fact, it can make your condition worse. This is because your body may go into survival mode, instead of focusing on thriving processes like ovulation. You may be getting your period, but this does not necessarily mean you are ovulating. Therefore, it's essential to fulfil your recommended daily calorie intake, which is about 1600 to 2400 calories a day. 3. All Fruit Diet Do you resort to having fruits all the time, thinking they are healthy? Well, this is exactly why you're unable to manage your symptoms, especially if you have insulin-resistant PCOS. For the unversed, this specific type of PCOS is caused by blood sugar dysregulation. The nutritionist explains that eating too many fruits at once can cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar levels. So, while you think you're eating healthy, it can worsen your hormones. If you want balanced hormones, start with balanced blood sugar levels.Also Read:Should You Avoid Dairy If You Have PCOS?

This includes all types of fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens. Protein-rich foods, on the other hand, will help promote satiety and improve insulin sensitivity. Along with this, you must also include omega-3 fatty acids in your diet since they can help improve fertility, regulate hormones, and even reduce facial hair growth. When trying to manage PCOS, your focus should be on following a well-balanced diet, not a strict one. PCOS can be managed by making the right dietary choices.

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Peppermint Tea",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Peppermint Tea: Peppermint, a cross between watermint and spearmint, is native to Europe and Asia. For thousands of years, people have used it for its pleasant, minty taste and numerous health benefits. The essential oil found in peppermint is menthol, which gives the plant its cooling properties and recognizable minty scent.Peppermint tea is generally sweet and free of caffeine. Many studies have shown that peppermint tea may have health benefits such as improving digestion, boosting focus, and relieving migraine. Peppermint tea is typically consumed as a beverage. Let us read some of the possible benefits of drinking peppermint tea below.5 Health Benefits of Ginger TeaFollowing are some of the top health benefits of peppermint tea.1. Alleviates Digestive Problems: Peppermint may help alleviate digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and indigestion. This is because peppermint relaxes the digestive system and eases pain. Additionally, some animal studies indicate that peppermint can prevent smooth muscle contractions, which can help relieve spasms in the gut. While there are no studies on peppermint tea and digestion, experts believe that the tea may have similar health benefits.2. Relieves Headaches and Migraines: Peppermint, known for its muscle-relaxing and pain-relieving properties, has the potential to alleviate certain types of headaches. The menthol found in peppermint oil stimulates blood flow and offers a cooling sensation, which may contribute to pain relief. While there is limited scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of peppermint tea in relaxing muscles and reducing headache pain through its aroma, applying peppermint oil directly to the temples may provide some relief.7 Health Benefits of Rosemary Tea3. Prevents Menstrual Cramps: According to a study published in 2016, peppermint oil capsules were found to be equally effective in reducing menstrual pain as mefenamic acid, a common over-the-counter pain medication. The research team tested the effectiveness of peppermint oil on 127 young women with dysmenorrhea and found some promising results. Some people also consume peppermint tea as a home remedy for menstrual cramping.4. Alleviates Nasal Congestion: Although consuming peppermint tea won't cure a cold on its own, the menthol scent of the mint combined with the steam from the tea could help clear your nasal passages if you have a blocked nose.7 Health Benefits of Black Tea5. Prevents Bad Breath: Peppermint not only has a refreshing flavor, but its antibacterial qualities may also aid in eliminating the microorganisms that are causing the mouth odor. It's also said to prevent a film of bacteria from accumulating on your teeth, maintaining the health of your whites.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "All You Need To Know About NPS Vatsalya Yojana",
        "text": "The government has launched a new scheme under the National Pension System (NPS) aimed at financially securing the future of children. The NPS Vatsalya scheme, announced in the Union Budget 2024 in July, was launched by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on September 18. The pension scheme will be managed under the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). The scheme allows parents and legal guardians to invest to build a retirement corpus for their children from their childhood up to the age of 18 years. 1) How to open an NPS Vatsalya account? Opening an NPS Vatsalya account is easy and can be done either online or at designated Points of Presence (POPs) like India Post and banks. How to open the account online: Visit the eNPS website. From the National Pension System (NPS) dropdown list, click on 'NPS Vatsalya (Minors)' menu and under that 'Register Now.' Enter the guardian's details - date of birth, PAN number, mobile number and emailClick 'Begin Registration.' Verify the OTP sent to the guardian's mobile number and email.After verification, an acknowledgment number will appear; click 'Continue'Fill in the minor's and guardian's details, upload the necessary documents and click 'Confirm.'Make the initial contribution of Rs 1,000. Your PRAN will be generated, and the NPS Vatsalya account will be opened in the minor's name. To open the NPS Vatsalya account through Points of Presence registered with the PFRDA, a complete list of POPs is available on the PFRDA website. 2) Who can open this account? The NPS Vatsalya Yojana is open to: Indian citizens under 18 years.Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) below 18 years.Parents or guardians who wish to open the account on behalf of their minor children. 3) How does this NPS Vatsalya Yojana work? The NPS Vatsalya Scheme operates as a savings-cum-pension plan that allows parents to invest in an NPS account for their minor children. Once the child turns 18, the account transitions automatically into a regular NPS Tier I account. By ensuring early investment and structured savings, NPS Vatsalya aims to build a solid financial foundation for young individuals. This scheme not only secures the child's future but also encourages continued participation in the NPS framework. 4) How much money can be deposited minimum? The minimum annual contribution to an NPS Vatsalya account is Rs 1,000, with no upper limit on the amount that can be deposited. 5) How much money can be withdrawn, when, and what about interest? The NPS Vatsalya Scheme allows partial withdrawals before the child turns 18 under specific conditions. Parents or guardians can: Withdraw up to 25% of the contributed amount.Make withdrawals only after the account has been active for 3 years.Use the withdrawal option up to three times before the child turns 18.Withdraw funds for purposes such as education, treatment of specified illnesses, or disability of more than 75%, as defined by the PFRDA. The child has the option to exit the NPS Vatsalya account upon reaching adulthood instead of converting it to a regular NPS account. The withdrawal conditions are as follows: A minimum of 80% of the accumulated amount must be reinvested in an annuity plan, while the remaining 20% can be withdrawn as a lumpsum.The entire money can be withdrawn in one lumpsum if the total corpus is less than Rs. 2.5 lakh.In the event of death:If the minor (subscriber) dies, the entire corpus is given to the guardian (nominee).If the guardian dies, a new guardian must be registered through fresh KYC.If both parents die, the legal guardian can continue the scheme without further contributions until the child turns 18. In conclusion, NPS Vatsalya Yojana provides a strong financial safety net for children, blending early investment with long-term benefits.",

        "title": "10 Health Benefits Of Adding Lemons To Your Daily Diet",
        "text": "Lemons are small, bright yellow citrus fruits known for their sour taste and high vitamin C content. They are incredibly healthy due to their rich supply of antioxidants, particularly vitamin C, which strengthens the immune system, aids in collagen production, and promotes skin health. Lemons also contain fibre and beneficial plant compounds that support digestion, weight management, and heart health by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Consuming lemons daily can boost hydration, enhance nutrient absorption, detoxify the body, and even prevent kidney stones. Their versatile nutrients make them a simple but powerful addition to a healthy diet. In this article, we discuss in detail how consuming lemons daily can boost your health. Here's how lemons can boost your overall well-being 1. Rich source of vitamin C Lemons are packed with vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and protects against colds and flu. Vitamin C also helps repair tissues, promotes collagen production, and strengthens the skin. 2. Improves digestive health Lemon juice stimulates the production of digestive juices like bile, helping to improve digestion. Its acidic nature also helps break down food more effectively and relieves symptoms of indigestion, such as bloating and heartburn. 3. Aids in weight loss Lemons are low in calories and high in fibre, particularly pectin, which can help you feel fuller for longer and reduce cravings. Drinking lemon water before meals can support portion control and weight management. 4. Promotes hydration Adding lemon to water encourages you to drink more, helping to maintain hydration throughout the day. Staying hydrated improves metabolism, energy levels, and overall cellular function. 5. Boosts heart health The vitamin C and plant compounds in lemons help lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Consuming lemons regularly can reduce the risk of heart disease by improving vascular health and preventing artery blockage. 6. Supports skin health Lemon's antioxidant properties protect the skin from free radical damage, which can cause premature aging. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, helping to keep the skin firm, reduce wrinkles, and heal wounds. 7. Helps detoxify the body Lemons act as a natural diuretic, promoting urination and helping flush out toxins from the body. This detoxifying effect supports kidney health and helps maintain overall detoxification through the liver. 8. Prevents kidney stones The citric acid in lemons increases urinary citrate levels, which helps prevent the formation of kidney stones. Drinking lemon water regularly can dilute urine, reducing the risk of stone formation. 9. Boosts iron absorption Lemons enhance the absorption of non-heme iron, the type of iron found in plant-based foods. Adding lemon juice to meals can improve iron uptake, reducing the risk of iron deficiency anaemia. 10. Supports oral health The antibacterial properties of lemons can help fight bacteria in the mouth, reducing the risk of gum disease and bad breath. However, due to their acidity, lemons should be consumed in moderation to avoid tooth enamel erosion. Adding lemons to your daily diet provides a wide range of health benefits.

        "title": "Facts about sea turtles you need to know",
        "text": "Sea turtles are ancient and vital creatures, having lived in the world\u2019s oceans for over 100 million years. Found in warm and temperate seas, they play a crucial role in maintaining marine ecosystems. However, sea turtles face increasing threats from climate change, habitat destruction, and human activities. Their unique life cycle and migratory patterns make them particularly vulnerable, yet they remain symbols of resilience. Every year on June 16, \u2018World Sea Turtle Day\u2019 is celebrated to raise awareness about the conservation efforts needed to protect these magnificent animals and highlight their importance to ocean health. Fascinating facts about sea turtlesLife expectancy of 80 yearsSea turtles have an impressive lifespan, with many species living between 50 and 80 years. They take two to three decades to mature, and once they do, they remain actively reproductive for about 10 years. Sand temperature determines their genderThe temperature of the sand where sea turtles lay their eggs plays a crucial role in determining the sex of the hatchlings. Cooler sand temperatures produce male sea turtles, while warmer sand tends to result in females. This temperature-based sex determination is sensitive to climate change, impacting future turtle populations.Florida faces a shortage of male sea turtlesDue to record-high temperatures in Florida, the sands where sea turtles nest have become significantly hotter. This has led to an alarming trend where most eggs are hatching as females, resulting in a growing shortage of males. Sea turtles migrate thousands of milesSea turtles are known for their remarkable migrations. The leatherback turtle, for example, travels more than 10,000 miles annually across the Pacific Ocean. Loggerhead turtles have been tracked migrating from Japan to Baja, covering around 8,000 miles. These long-distance migrations are essential for feeding, breeding, and survival.They play a vital role in ocean ecosystemsSea turtles are essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. They graze on seagrass beds and coral reefs, preventing overgrowth and promoting biodiversity. By controlling jellyfish and crustacean populations, sea turtles help balance the food web. Their presence ensures the health of the oceans, benefiting many other species.Their shells cannot retractUnlike land turtles, sea turtles cannot retract their heads or flippers into their shells. This makes them more vulnerable to predators like sharks and killer whales. Hatchlings and eggs face even greater threats from animals such as raccoons and seabirds, making protection crucial for their survival in the wild.Human activities pose major threatsHuman activity is a significant threat to sea turtles. Coastal development reduces nesting sites, while artificial light disorients hatchlings, leading them away from the ocean. Plastic pollution also presents a major danger, with many sea turtles mistaking debris for food, which often results in fatal blockages or entanglement.There are only 6.5 million sea turtles leftThe current global sea turtle population is estimated at 6.5 million, with most species classified as endangered or critically endangered. This decline is primarily due to habitat loss, illegal hunting, and accidental capture in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are critical to prevent further decline and to protect these iconic marine species.Hawksbill and Kemp\u2019s Ridley turtles are critically endangeredHawksbill turtles, known for their striking shells, have a population of only about 57,000 individuals, making them critically endangered. Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles, another critically endangered species, are even rarer, with just around 10,000 individuals left. Both species are under severe threat from climate change and human activities.Sea turtles thrived during the COVID-19 pandemicDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced human activity on beaches gave sea turtles a break from disturbances. In Florida, where around 400,000 sea turtle nests were recorded in 2019, researchers found improved nesting success during lockdowns in 2020. Fewer beachgoers and less waste allowed turtles to thrive without human interference.Sea turtles have existed for over 100 million yearsSea turtles are among the oldest creatures on Earth, having existed for more than 100 million years. They have survived drastic changes in the planet\u2019s climate and ecosystem over millennia. However, their ability to adapt is being tested by the accelerated pace of modern climate change and human impacts on the oceans.They can hold their breath for hoursSea turtles are highly adapted to life in the ocean and can hold their breath for up to five hours when resting. When active, they surface every few minutes for air. This ability is essential for their long dives, especially when they are feeding or avoiding predators in the deep sea.Excellent navigation skillsThey use the Earth's magnetic fields to navigate thousands of miles, returning to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs.Sea turtles help combat climate changeBy grazing on seagrass beds, sea turtles play a role in regulating the ocean\u2019s carbon cycle. Seagrasses absorb carbon dioxide and store it, helping mitigate the effects of climate change. The health of these underwater meadows depends on sea turtles, as they prevent overgrowth and maintain biodiversity in marine ecosystems.Conservation efforts Many organisations and governments are working to protect sea turtles through measures like reducing bycatch in fisheries, protecting nesting sites, and banning plastic waste. The Sea Turtle Conservation Project, in particular, aims to protect species such as the Olive Ridley turtle. Launched in 1999 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in collaboration with the UNDP, it focuses on Indian coastal states, particularly Orissa. It uses satellite technology to monitor nesting areas, safeguard breeding habitats, and promote collaboration at national and international levels for turtle conservation efforts.Also read: Why does Octopus have blue blood?",

        "title": "Celiac Disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Celiac Disease Celiac disease is a serious autoimmune disease. It occurs in people with a genetic condition where gluten consumption causes damage to the small intestine. Celiac is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide, but only about 30 percent are diagnosed. Celiac Disease Symptoms The symptoms are not the same as food allergies. When accidentally ingesting food containing gluten, the person will experience intestinal problems such as diarrhea, excessive gas, and constipation. Other symptoms seen in sufferers include: Stomach ache. Nauseous. Anemia. Rash or dermatitis herpetiformis). Loss of bone density. Headache or general fatigue. Bone or joint pain. Mouth ulcers. Weight loss. Heartburn. In children, they are at risk of experiencing intestinal problems than adults. Symptoms are characterized by: Nausea or vomiting. Bloating or swelling in the stomach. Diarrhea. Constipation. Too much fat in the stool (steatorrhea). Weight loss. Risk Factors for Celiac Disease Celiac is at high risk for the following groups: Having a family history of Celiac or dermatitis herpetiformis. Having type 1 diabetes. Having Down syndrome or Turner syndrome. Having autoimmune thyroid disease. Having Addison\u2019s disease. Causes of Celiac Disease It is not yet known exactly what causes Celiac. This disease triggers a reaction from the immune system to gluten by damaging the small hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine. Damaged villi prevent the body from getting essential nutrients from food. Celiac Disease Diagnosis Celiac diagnosis is done with the following steps: Serology tests. These tests look for antibodies in the blood. Elevated levels of certain antibody proteins indicate an immune reaction to gluten. Genetic testing. Testing is done with human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) to rule out celiac disease. If the test results indicate celiac disease, your doctor will likely do further testing by: Endoscopy. This procedure uses a long tube with a tiny camera on the end. The camera allows the doctor to see the small intestine and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to analyze damage to the villi. Capsule endoscopy. This procedure uses a small wireless camera to take pictures of the entire small intestine. The camera is inside a vitamin capsule that is swallowed. As the capsule travels through the digestive tract, the camera takes pictures of the condition of the intestine. Celiac Disease Treatment Celiac treatment can be done with the following steps: Gluten-Free Diet These are the foods that sufferers need to avoid Wheat. Barley. Wheat. Potato flour. Malt. Semolina. Triticale. Bread. Pasta. Cereals. Spell. Gluten can be hidden in foods, medicines, and non-food products, including: Modified food starch, preservatives, and food stabilizers. Prescription and over-the-counter medications. Vitamin and mineral supplements. Herbal and nutritional supplements. Lipstick products. Toothpaste and mouthwash. Envelopes and stamp glue. Play-doh. Vitamin and Mineral Supplements The use of supplements is done in patients with anemia or severe nutritional deficiencies. Supplements consumed include: Copper. Folate. Iron. Vitamin B-12. Vitamin D Vitamin K. Zinc. Complications of Celiac Disease Untreated Celiac Disease can cause: Malnutrition. This occurs when the small intestine cannot absorb enough nutrients from food. Malnutrition causes anemia and weight loss. In children, malnutrition causes growth retardation and short stature. Weakening of bones. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D causes softening of bones (osteomalacia or rickets) in children and loss of bone density (osteopenia or osteoporosis) in adults. Infertility and miscarriage. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D causes reproductive problems. Lactose intolerance. Damage to the small intestine causes abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating or drinking dairy products containing lactose. Cancer. People who do not maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer. Nervous system problems. Some people experience seizures or nerve disease in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Celiac Disease Prevention Prevention is done by reducing the risk. These are the steps that can be taken: During pregnancy, stick to a gluten-free diet. Gluten consumption during pregnancy activates the disease and causes malabsorption of nutrients in both mother and fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage. Genetic testing for babies. If the baby tests positive for Celiac, antibody blood tests should be done after the child is 3 years old and every two to three years thereafter. Breastfeeding for at least six months. Based on research, delayed symptoms among infants at risk of Celiac disease who are breastfed for at least 6 months, can occur. Introduce gluten slowly after the child is between 4 and 6 months old. Adding gluten to children while breastfeeding lowers the risk of Celiac disease after they are 2 years old. Mothers who breastfeed their children after adding gluten to their diet reduce the risk of their children developing Celiac disease later in life.",

        "title": "Chagas disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Chagas disease is a zoonotic disease transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans and vice versa. This disorder causes inflammation and infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a type of parasite in the form of insects, such as fleas and cockroaches. Therefore, Chagas disease is often referred to as the kissing bug. The insects that spread the parasite that causes Chagas disease are from the genus Triatoma, including Triatoma infestans, Rhodnius prolixus, and Panstrongyius megistus. The disease is more common in South America, Central America, and Mexico, where the triatomine insects originate. This disease can infect everyone without exception. If not treated immediately, Chagas disease can cause serious heart and digestive problems. In someone who has acute disease, the parasite needs to be destroyed. But if the disorder is chronic, the treatment that needs to be done is to manage the symptoms and prevent the infection from spreading. Chagas Disease Symptoms A person who has Chagas disease will experience a number of symptoms, namely: Fever Fatigue Pain in the body Headache Rash Loss of appetite Diarrhea Vomiting Swelling of the eyelids In general, these symptoms will last for several weeks or even longer but can disappear on their own. However, it is advisable to see a doctor if Chagas disease symptoms recur or if you have just returned from a country with high exposure to the T. cruzi parasite. By immediately checking yourself with a doctor, Chagas disease can be treated quickly. Chagas Disease Risk Factors Some factors that can increase a person\u2019s risk of developing Chagas disease include: Receiving a blood transfusion or organ transplant from a person with the disease. Consuming raw food that has been contaminated with the parasite or eating undercooked meat from infected animals. Pregnant women who are infected can transmit the disease to the fetus in the womb. Living in rural areas with poor sanitation or living in countries with high exposure to the T. cruzi parasite, such as Central America, South America and Mexico. Living in a housing complex that has triatomine insects. Travelers visiting countries with high exposure to the disease. Spending time in a forest filled with wild animals that may be infected. Causes of Chagas Disease The most common cause of Chagas disease is the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of an insect called a triatomine. The insect can become infected with T. cruzi when it ingests the blood of an animal infected with the parasite. These insects usually bite humans while they are sleeping. Infected insects defecate after feeding and leave parasites on the skin. The most commonly bitten parts of the body are areas with thin skin, such as the eyes or mouth. After that, the parasite enters the body through the eyes, mouth, cuts or scratches, or insect bites. Scratching or rubbing the bite area can cause the parasite to enter the body. Once inside the body, the parasite multiplies and eventually spreads. Chagas Disease Diagnosis The doctor will first perform a physical examination, such as asking about the symptoms experienced and other factors that can increase the risk of contracting Chagas disease. If you experience symptoms of Chagas disease, a blood test may be needed to confirm the presence of the T. cruzi parasite or the levels of proteins produced by the immune system (antibodies) to fight the parasite in your blood. If diagnosed with Chagas disease, it is recommended to undergo several additional tests to determine whether the disease is already in the chronic phase and has the potential to cause heart or digestive complications. These supporting tests include: Electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor heart activity. Chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged. Echocardiogram to see if there are changes in the heart or its function. Abdominal X-ray to look for changes in the colon. Endoscopy. Chagas Disease Treatment In the early stages, Chagas disease is quite easy to cure. Treatment focuses on killing the T.cruzi parasite by taking benznidazole and nifurtimox. These drugs must be taken for 2 months. Treatment will be effective if the drugs are taken as soon as possible after infection. This disease needs to be treated immediately so that it does not enter the chronic phase because the medicine cannot cure the disease. However, this medicine can slow its development and minimize serious complications. In addition, some additional treatments may be needed depending on the signs and symptoms that arise, such as: Heart-related complications require taking medications, a pacemaker, or the use of other devices to ensure the heart remains healthy. Complications related to treatment require changes in diet, consumption of drugs, corticosteroids, and others. Chagas Disease Complications If Chagas disease has progressed to the chronic phase, serious heart or digestive complications can occur. These may include: Heart failure. Enlargement of the esophagus (megaesophagus). Enlargement of the large intestine (megacolon). Chagas Disease Prevention Chagas disease is a dangerous disease. However, you can avoid this disease by doing some preventive measures such as the following: Spray the inside and around the house with insecticide. Do not stay in muddy areas, filled with straw, or in shacks for long periods of time. Put up a mosquito net on the bed. Using mosquito repellent lotion. Maintain food hygiene and storage. Checking donor blood, organs, cells, and tissues before receiving a transfusion. Perform routine uterine check-ups to avoid transmitting this disease to your child. Do not consume raw foods. When to See a Doctor? If you have just visited a country that has a high risk of Chagas disease and are experiencing symptoms, it is a good idea to get checked immediately.",

        "text": "What is Kidney Disease? Kidney disease is one of the medical conditions that are prone to occur so you should be aware of it. The kidneys are two organs shaped like red beans that are located on either side of the upper back of the body, right under the human ribs. The function of the kidneys includes producing renin, an enzyme that regulates blood pressure. In addition, the kidneys also produce erythropoietin compounds that function to stimulate red blood cell production. This organ also functions to filter the body\u2019s metabolic waste. Even healthy kidneys can keep the salt and mineral levels balanced in the body. No less important, the kidneys are able to produce active compounds from vitamin D so that bone health is maintained. When the kidneys are damaged, the body\u2019s metabolic waste will cause swelling in the ankles, vomiting, shortness of breath and lack of sleep. Symptoms of Kidney Disease In fact, the symptoms of kidney disease that appear in each sufferer will be different. This is because of the different types of kidney disease that individuals experience. In fact, some of them do not show any symptoms at the beginning of this condition. Therefore, it is better to know more about the health symptoms associated with kidney disease. Here are the early signs and symptoms that everyone should be aware of: You will experience fatigue, lack of energy, and even difficulty concentrating. Having trouble sleeping. Changes in skin health that become drier and itchier. Experiencing increased frequency of urination. There is blood in the urine. Urine that is foamy and has a pungent odor. Not only that, urine also has a very dark color. Experiencing persistent swelling in the eye area. Swollen ankles and feet. Experiencing decreased appetite. More frequent muscle pain or cramps. In addition to the above symptoms, there are also some Often Ignored Symptoms of Kidney Disease. It is important to immediately recognize and ask a doctor if there are any suspicious complaints or signs. Kidney Disease Risk Factors People with diabetes are at higher risk of developing kidney disease. In fact, diabetes is the main cause of this condition. However, the risk of kidney disease also increases in individuals with the following conditions: Have high blood pressure. Have high cholesterol levels. Smoking habit. Have other family members with a history of kidney disease. Elderly, over 65 years old. Research shows that this condition is more common in people of African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian descent. In addition, this condition is also often associated with other medical conditions, such as: Blockage of blood vessels in the arms or legs. Suffering from diabetes or sugar disease. High blood pressure or hypertension. Suffering from heart failure. Currently undergoing intensive care in hospital due to a serious illness. Suffering from liver disease. Types of Kidney Disease This condition consists of several different types. Here are the types of kidney disease that often occur: 1. Chronic kidney disease or chronic kidney failure Experts also often refer to this disease as chronic kidney failure. This disease occurs when kidney function is gradually lost. When this condition occurs, the body will slowly accumulate waste or substances that the body does not need. Over time it can cause health problems in other organs. 2. Acute kidney disease This type of kidney disease is a sudden decline in kidney function. There are a number of causes that can trigger acute kidney disease. Starting from lack of fluid and blood, injury to the kidneys, or blockages that cause fluid to return to the kidneys. 3. Kidney stones This condition is indicated by the formation of solid objects or gravel in one or both kidneys. Usually, this condition occurs due to high levels of certain minerals in the urine. 4. Kidney infection Doctors also call this condition pyelonephritis. This condition can occur due to an untreated urinary tract infection. As a result, bacteria move towards the kidneys and cause infection. 5. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes cysts to appear in the kidneys. 6. Glomerulonephritis Disorders of the glomerulus or glomerulonephritis are conditions when the kidneys become inflamed. The glomerulus is a part of the kidney organ that plays a role in filtering waste materials, as well as removing excess fluids and electrolytes from the body. Glomerulonephritis can occur in a short time (acute) or long-term (chronic). For the cause, glomerulonephritis can occur due to many factors. For example, such as infection, autoimmune disease, or as an impact of inflammation that attacks blood vessels. Causes of Kidney Disease The causes of this condition will vary depending on the type. For example, the causes are: The kidneys do not have enough blood flow. There is direct damage to the kidneys. Kidney tissue damage due to drugs or severe infection (sepsis). Have a history of chronic kidney disease. Obstruction of urine from the kidneys. Meanwhile, chronic or long-term kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition damages kidney function. This condition eventually causes kidney damage to worsen over months or years. Meanwhile, diseases or conditions that cause chronic kidney disease can include type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as high blood pressure. Kidney Disease Diagnosis Immediately visit the nearest hospital when you experience some health problems related to kidney disease. There are several examinations that you can do to find out the condition of your kidneys, such as: Blood tests , usually these tests are to filter waste from the blood by estimating the glomerular filtration rate or eGFR. A doctor can also perform a urine test to determine the health condition of your kidneys. Kidney biopsy is a procedure where a specialist doctor takes a tissue sample from the kidney to then examine in detail in the laboratory. USG, to get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe current condition of the kidneys and detect other disorders, such as tumors or cysts. Kidney Disease Treatment Treatment for this condition will also depend on the type and cause of the disease. However, treatment generally aims to relieve symptoms and reduce the condition from getting worse. There are several treatments that doctors can recommend for sufferers, such as: Use of medications. For example, the use of ACE inhibitors to help control blood pressure and protein in the urine. In addition, the use of antibiotics can also be prescribed by doctors to inhibit bacterial growth. Kidney stone crushing to treat large kidney stones. Dialysis that lasts for 3-5 hours with a frequency of about 3 times per week. Surgical procedures to remove kidney stones or polycystic kidneys and kidney transplantation. In addition to these treatment options, doctors will also recommend that sufferers of this condition live a healthy lifestyle to ease kidney function. Efforts to implement a healthy lifestyle are: Limit your intake of foods high in salt, sugar, and cholesterol. Routinely check for diseases you have. For example, diabetes, hypertension, and autoimmune diseases. Increase your consumption of water. Limit consumption of alcoholic beverages. If you smoke, people with kidney disease need to stop this habit immediately. Increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Exercise regularly. Kidney Disease Cure Rate The cure of this condition will actually depend on the type. For example, in chronic kidney failure, this disease cannot be completely cured. However, treatment, medical care, and the implementation of the right lifestyle can help people with this disease to carry out normal activities and extend their life expectancy. Meanwhile, for cases of acute kidney failure which usually occurs temporarily, appropriate medical treatment and care can restore or improve kidney function. Kidney Disease Prevention Immediately check the condition of the kidney stones by visiting a doctor to do some tests. Do a urine test first to check for infections and stones in the urine. And do a blood test to make sure the kidneys are functioning properly. There are also preventive measures to reduce the risk of getting this disease, such as: Follow the directions for use. When using over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, follow the directions on the package. Taking too much or too often can cause kidney damage. Maintain ideal body weight. Make sure to exercise regularly and adopt a healthy diet. Read more about recommended exercise times at: Note, This is a Good Exercise Time for Health . Don\u2019t smoke. Smoking can damage your kidneys and worsen existing kidney damage. Manage your medical conditions well. If you have a disease or condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to manage it. Complications of Kidney Disease Long-term kidney disease can negatively impact almost every part of the body. Possible complications include: Fluid retention, which can cause swelling in the arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). A sudden increase in the level of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia), which can interfere with heart function. Anemia. Heart disease such as coronary heart disease. Weak bones and increased risk of fractures. Decreased sex drive, impotence or decreased fertility. Damage to the central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes, or seizures. Decreased immune response, which makes sufferers more susceptible to infection. Pericarditis, is inflammation of the sac-like membrane that surrounds your heart (pericardium). A pregnancy complication that carries risks to both the mother and the developing fetus. Permanent damage to the kidneys (end-stage renal disease), which ultimately requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms of kidney disease that do not improve, immediately check your health condition with an internal medicine specialist . Remember that proper treatment from the start can reduce the risk of dangerous complications.",

        "text": "What Is Diabetes (High Blood Sugar)? Diabetes or sugar disease (high blood sugar) is a chronic (long-term) disease that you need to be aware of. The main sign of this disease is an increase in blood sugar (glucose) levels above normal values. This condition occurs when the sufferer\u2019s body is no longer able to take sugar (glucose) into the cells and use it as energy. This condition ultimately results in the accumulation of extra sugar in the body\u2019s bloodstream. Uncontrolled diabetes can have serious consequences, causing damage to various organs and tissues of the body. For example, organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. There are two main types of diabetes, namely type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If explained, here is an explanation of both, namely: Type 1 diabetes. This type is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body\u2019s immune system will attack itself. In this condition, the body will not produce insulin at all. Type 2 diabetes. In this type of diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin or the body cells of people with type 2 diabetes will not respond normally to insulin. Symptoms of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) The symptoms of this health problem will appear differently in each sufferer. Because this condition will depend on the severity and type of diabetes that the sufferer has. However, in general there are several symptoms that will be experienced by sufferers, both type 1 and type 2, namely: Increased thirst. Increased frequency of urination. Easily tired or feeling constantly tired. There are visual disturbances, such as blurred vision. The occurrence of continuous infections in the body, which commonly occur in the gums, skin, and vaginal area (in women). Unexplained weight loss. The presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are byproducts of the breakdown of muscle and fat that occur when there is not enough insulin available). Therefore, immediately check yourself with a doctor if you experience one or more of these symptoms. This aims to ensure that sufferers receive appropriate treatment early on so that the risk of complications from diabetes can be avoided. Risk Factors for High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) There are several risk factors for type 1 diabetes, including: Family history or hereditary factors, namely when someone will have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes if there are family members who suffer from the same disease because it is related to certain genes. Geographical factors, people who live in areas far from the equator, such as Finland and Sardinia, are at risk of developing type 1 diabetes. This is due to the lack of vitamin D that can be obtained from sunlight, which ultimately triggers autoimmune diseases. Age factor. This disease is most often detected in children aged 4\u20137 years, then in children aged 10\u201314 years. Other triggering factors include consuming cow\u2019s milk at too early an age, water containing sodium nitrate, cereals, and gluten before the age of 4 months or after 7 months, having a mother with a history of preeclampsia, and suffering from jaundice at birth. Meanwhile, here are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes, including: Overweight or obesity. High distribution of abdominal fat. Inactive lifestyle and rarely doing activities or exercising. History of type 2 diabetes in the family. Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans have higher rates of disease compared to whites. Age over 45 years, although it is possible that it can occur before the age of 45 years. Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. History of diabetes during pregnancy. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is characterized by irregular menstruation, excessive hair growth, and obesity. Causes of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) Normal blood sugar levels are less than 100 mg/dL. If blood sugar levels have reached 100-125 mg/dL, it means you have entered prediabetes status. Meanwhile, blood sugar levels that reach 126 mg/dL and above are classified as diabetes. High blood sugar levels are known as hyperglycemia. Basically, hyperglycemia is a condition when blood sugar levels increase or are excessive. Meanwhile, diabetes is a disease that is mostly influenced by hyperglycemia. The cause of high blood sugar from diabetes occurs due to disorders in the body. Because this condition makes the body unable to use blood glucose into cells. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood. In type 1 diabetes, this disorder occurs because the immune system, which usually attacks viruses or other harmful bacteria, attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells. As a result, the body lacks or cannot even produce insulin so that the sugar that should be converted into energy by insulin causes a buildup of sugar in the blood. While in type 2 diabetes, the body can produce insulin normally. However, insulin cannot be used normally by the body. This condition is also known as insulin resistance. Diagnosis of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) The doctor will diagnose this condition in a person by conducting a medical interview. Then, the doctor will also check the glucose levels in a blood test. There are three types of tests that doctors can use to measure blood glucose levels, namely: 1. Fasting blood glucose test For this test, people with diabetes need not eat or drink anything except water (fasting). This fasting is for at least eight hours before the test. Because food can greatly affect blood sugar, this test allows the doctor to see baseline blood sugar. 2. Random blood glucose test This examination can be done randomly by diabetics. Even when you are fasting. 3. A1c This test, also known as HbA1C or glycated hemoglobin test, aims to show a person\u2019s average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. 4. Oral glucose tolerance test In this test, the doctor will measure blood glucose levels after fasting overnight. Then the diabetic will drink a sweet drink. Later, the patient\u2019s blood glucose levels are checked at one, two and three o\u2019clock. In addition, the doctor will also perform blood and urine tests to distinguish whether someone has type 1 or 2 diabetes. Later, the blood will be checked for autoantibodies (autoimmune signs that the body\u2019s immune system is attacking itself). Meanwhile, urine will be checked for ketones (a sign that a person\u2019s body is burning fat as an energy supply). Diabetes Treatment Treatment will be adjusted to the type of diabetes you have. Insulin therapy is one of the treatments that can be done by sufferers of this condition, both type 1 and type 2. In fact, in fairly severe cases of type 1 diabetes, pancreas transplantation may be an option to treat damage to the pancreas. Meanwhile, people with type 2 diabetes will be given several types of medication. However, generally, there are several treatments that must be done to reduce the risk of diabetes, such as: 1. Implement a healthy diet If you have diabetes, you should adjust your diet to a healthy one. Focus on your intake of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Not only that, you also need to consume fiber and reduce certain types of food, such as foods containing saturated fat, processed carbohydrates, and artificial sweeteners. 2. Do physical activity regularly Everyone certainly needs physical activity to maintain optimal health, including people with diabetes. Exercise is one activity that can be done to lower blood sugar levels by converting it into energy. You can choose to do light exercise, such as walking, swimming, or cycling. Make these activities a daily routine to help you avoid your diabetes condition getting worse. Diabetes Medication Recommendations Here are some recommendations for diabetes medications that you can use: Gliabetes 30 mg 10 Tablets. Is a drug containing Pioglitazone HCl to treat type 2 diabetes. Diabemed 24 Capsules. Useful for overcoming and preventing diabetes, as well as lowering the sugar level in the blood and keeping it stable. Inlacin 100 mg 5 Strips (6 Capsules/Strip) \u2013 Save on Bulk Prices. Contains a combination of Lagestroemiaspeciosa and Cinnamomum burmannii to help lower blood glucose levels. Pioglitazone HCl 30 mg 3 Strips (10 Tablets/Strip) \u2013 Routine Medication. It is a tablet medication that is useful in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Amaryl M 1 mg/250 mg 3 Strips (10 Tablets/Strip) \u2013 Routine Medication. Contains a combination of Metformin and Glimepiride which is useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes Prevention Although risk factors such as family history and race cannot be changed, there are other risk factors that can be prevented early through implementing a healthy lifestyle. Here are some healthy lifestyle steps that you can take to prevent this disease, including: Maintain ideal body weight by consuming low-fat foods. Eat high-fiber foods such as fruits and vegetables. Reduce consumption of sweet foods and drinks. Exercise regularly and do lots of physical activity. Reduce the amount of time spent sitting still for too long, such as when watching television. Avoid or quit smoking. Diabetes Complications Complications from this disease will develop gradually. The longer a person has it and the more uncontrolled the disease is, the higher the risk of complications. Ultimately, complications can be disabling or even life-threatening. The following are some possible general complications of diabetes, namely: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes can increase the risk of various problems with the cardiovascular system. These include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Eye damage (retinopathy). Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can cause complications in the form of damage to the retina of the eye, Nerve damage (neuropathy). Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that feed nerves, especially in the feet. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. In addition, diabetes also has the potential to cause kidney damage, sexual dysfunction, and even miscarriage as complications.",

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Hibiscus Tea",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Hibiscus Tea: Hibiscus, a flowering plant that thrives in warmer climates, produces deep red flowers with a sweet and tart cranberry-like flavor. The part of the hibiscus plant used for making tea is known as the calyx. It protects and supports the flower.Hibiscus has cultural significance in many parts of the world and is generally used in food and traditional medicine. It has been used to treat a wide range of conditions for centuries, including high blood pressure, indigestion, and obesity. Modern science also suggests that there may be other health benefits to using the hibiscus plant, including lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight management. However, more research is required to confirm these findings.5 Health Benefits of Peppermint TeaFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of hibiscus tea.1. Prevents Disease: The Hibiscus plant is rich in many antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, Vitamin C, and anthocyanin. These antioxidants help the body fight off harmful molecules called free radicals. Free radicals are linked to several different diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Although the body's antioxidants fight against the free radical damage, antioxidant-rich foods can also help prevent disease.2. Reduces Inflammation: The anti-inflammatory properties of hibiscus have been demonstrated in several animal and human investigations. Numerous disorders, including cancer, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, are caused by inflammation. It appears that hibiscus may have anti-inflammatory properties, however, more research is required to reach a definitive conclusion.5 Health Benefits of Ginger Tea3. Lowers Blood Pressure: High blood pressure, affecting nearly half of all adults in the United States can lead to severe health issues such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated that drinking hibiscus tea can lower blood pressure in humans. However, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health cautions that hibiscus and other herbal remedies only modestly reduce blood pressure and cannot substitute medications for individuals diagnosed with high blood pressure.4. Lowers Cholesterol: High cholesterol affects millions of adults and can lead to serious health issues such as heart attack and stroke. Although some clinical studies have shown that hibiscus may lower cholesterol levels, others have shown little to no effect. While hibiscus tea may help maintain healthy cholesterol levels, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness.5 Health Benefits of Chamomile Tea5. Promotes Weight Loss: Numerous studies indicate that hibiscus extract, which is more concentrated than hibiscus tea, has a good effect on weight loss, which may help avoid obesity. There isn't any proof, though, that hibiscus tea has the same effect.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Keto Diet Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What Is The Keto Diet? The keto or ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet. This type of diet is useful as a medical treatment and is an effective option for short-term weight loss. This diet has been linked to the treatment of epilepsy. In fact, ketogenic diets can help reduce seizures in people with epilepsy, especially in children who do not respond to medication. The mechanism is not fully understood, but this low-carb, high-fat diet is said to change activity in the brain. Effects that are felt include reducing sensitivity to stimuli that cause seizures. When undergoing a diet, the body produces ketone compounds as the main source. This compound has a protective effect on the body against seizures due to epilepsy. In addition, the keto diet also helps control blood sugar levels and improves mood stability. These conditions also contribute to seizure control. However, further research is needed to confirm these benefits. Benefits of the Keto Diet for Body Health You need to know that the keto diet should not be done long-term by healthy people. However, in general, this type of diet offers a number of benefits, including: 1. Lose weight A study entitled Ketogenic diet for weight loss and its implications on health: A literature study in ResearchGate states that ketogenic is a popular diet pattern for losing weight. The method is by limiting carbohydrate intake to 50 grams per day. This diet is quite effective in helping to lose weight in the short term. The duration itself is less than 6 months. 2. The keto diet is good for people with diabetes and prediabetes Diabetes presents with symptoms such as metabolic changes, high blood sugar, and impaired insulin function. Following a keto diet can help manage these symptoms. This is because the diet helps eliminate excess fat associated with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome. A study in the ACP Journals found that the keto diet can improve insulin sensitivity by up to 75 percent. Additionally, another study in the Journal of Diabetes Research conducted research on women with type 2 diabetes. The study found that following a keto diet for about 90 days significantly reduced hemoglobin A1C levels, a measure of long-term blood sugar management. 3. Reduces the risk of heart disease The keto diet is a diet that increases the intake of healthy fats. This method can reduce the risk of heart disease by improving risk factors. For example, reducing blood pressure, body fat, and blood sugar. A study entitled Effects of ketogenic diets on Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Evidence from Animal and Human Studies in Nutrients states that ketogenic is a useful diet pattern for improving several components of metabolic syndrome. The syndrome causes sufferers to experience a group of health problems simultaneously, one of which is heart disease. By reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome, the potential for heart disease can also be reduced. 4. The keto diet can reduce the intensity of Parkinson\u2019s symptoms. Parkinson\u2019s is a nervous system imbalance disorder that interferes with the body\u2019s ability to control balance and movement. One of the symptoms is slowed body movement. A study in PubMed Central found that the keto diet may help improve symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, more research is needed on these benefits. 5. Other health benefits In addition, following a healthy ketogenic diet can also provide health protection benefits for the body against the following conditions: Cancer. Experts are currently exploring diet as an additional treatment for cancer, as they suspect that diet may help slow tumor growth. Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The keto diet is also said to help reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and slow its progression. Epilepsy. Studies have shown that this diet also plays a role in reducing seizures in children with epilepsy. Polycystic ovary syndrome. Following a ketogenic diet may help reduce insulin levels, which may play a role in polycystic ovary syndrome. However, further research is needed to determine the benefits of the keto diet for these medical conditions. It is always best to discuss the best treatment with a nutritionist. Foods to Eat During the Keto Diet When on a keto diet, you should include fat in every meal. However, the ratio of fat, carbs, and protein can vary from person to person based on age, weight, and medical conditions. This is why, you should always discuss with your doctor before undergoing a keto diet. The types of healthy unsaturated fat intake that you can consume on a keto diet are: Nuts, such as almonds, and walnuts. Grains. Avocado. Know. Olive oil.

Grains and nuts. Some of the types are peas, beans, chickpeas, soybeans, lentils, or green beans. Fruits. Avoid consuming mangoes, bananas, grapes, apples, peaches, pears, pineapples, and papaya. Refined sugar. Included in beverages, such as cola, soda, artificial sweeteners, sugar, honey, and alcohol. Snacks, especially those high in preservatives and containing artificial sweeteners. In addition, you must also avoid high-protein foods, acidic foods, and foods that contain alkaline. How to Start a Keto Diet? Unfortunately, many people still mistake the keto diet with carbs. Both are similar, but not the same. Find out the difference through the article Similar but Not the Same, Here\u2019s the Difference Between the Carb and Keto Diets. If you\u2019re just starting a ketogenic diet, here are some things to keep in mind: 1. Pay attention to your intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. First, you have to limit your carbohydrate intake, consume moderate amounts of protein, and consume high amounts of fat per day. This makes the body burn fat as its main fuel source and break it down into \u2018ketones\u2019 in a process called ketosis. A person on a keto diet should consume 20 grams to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day, or less. For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates is equivalent to 2 slices of bread and a banana. The reason is that carbohydrates make up about a tenth of the daily kilojoule intake on the keto diet. This way, the body remains in a constant state of ketosis. A kilojoule itself is a measure of how much energy the body gets from food. 2. Maintain body intake Ketosis is a condition where the body lacks carbohydrate intake to be converted into energy. When experiencing ketosis, the kidneys will work harder to remove more fluids and electrolytes. Therefore, make sure to consume sodium and potassium intake, and drink plenty of water while on the keto diet. 3. Pay attention to the duration of the keto diet How long is the keto diet actually? This type of diet is good for you to do in the short term, namely for 2 to 3 months. The maximum limit is 6 to 12 months. The practice not only reduces body weight but also improves health. If you are just starting to try this diet, induction is the first phase that you must go through. The method is, stop eating at 8 pm and eat again the next day at 12 noon. This induction phase lasts for 7 days. 4. Discipline in implementing the keto diet Don\u2019t forget, make sure you are disciplined and consistent in following this diet. Pay attention to all the rules, including reducing carbohydrate and sugar intake. If you continue to consume carbohydrate and sugar intake, then the diet will not work. This is because fat in the body cannot be transmitted into energy. 5. The emergence of keto flu symptoms When in the induction phase, keto dieters may experience keto flu. This condition appears with symptoms of weakness and dizziness. The disorder occurs because the body is adjusting to the loss of carbohydrates. Later, the body will start to get used to burning fat as an energy source. 6. Pay attention to health history If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, gallbladder problems, or other chronic illnesses, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting a keto diet. 7. Write a food menu During the induction phase, you should only include 20 grams of carbohydrates in your body. As for fat intake, you can get it from beef, chicken, turkey, and steak, not processed foods such as sausages, nuggets, and meatballs. 8. Pay attention to protein intake The standard protein requirement is normally around 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. Meanwhile, keto dieters need a higher protein intake. The amount is around 1.5 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. 9. Pay attention to calorie intake In addition to high protein, you also have to pay attention to your calorie intake. Usually, the number of calories your body needs is around 2,000 kilocalories with a composition of 55 to 60 percent fat from the total food you consume. Note that calorie intake should not exceed the recommended limit, because it can increase fat stores in the body. Similar to protein, the body will store excess fat in the form of lipoproteins. 10. Avoid eating starchy vegetables Next, avoid consuming starchy vegetables. This includes potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, and beans. This step aims to keep participants in a state of ketosis. 11. Increase your egg intake Eggs are one of the best foods for keto dieters. This type of food is high in protein and contains healthy fats that can support the weight loss process. However, pay attention to how to process it. You can fry it with olive oil that contains healthy fats. In addition, you can also boil it and make it as a salad or sandwich topping. 12. Cook your own food By cooking your own food, you will not consume excessive carbohydrates. You are free to reduce or increase the right intake so that the diet gives optimal results. 13. Know the side effects The side effects of undergoing a keto diet that may occur are not limited to keto flu. You are also at risk of experiencing digestive disorders, such as bloating, constipation, and frequent farting. These problems arise because the body\u2019s fiber intake is not met. 14. Be patient to get the results During the first week, your body will experience effects that may make you uncomfortable. For example, dizziness and weakness. However, the process will be visible for several weeks afterward. So, be patient to get maximum results. Who Can\u2019t Do The Keto Diet? Although effective in helping to lose weight, there are groups of people who should not do this diet, including: 1. People with cardiovascular risk Ketogenic is done by consuming high-fat foods. This is dangerous for groups of people with a history of cardiovascular problems. Because this diet can increase the risk of heart failure. 2. Pregnant women Pregnant women who only consume certain foods are at risk of experiencing nutritional deficiencies that are useful for fetal growth and development. Not only that, this diet can also cause babies to be born with low birth weight. 3. People with digestive disorders Ketogenic is a low-fiber diet. This diet is certainly not suitable for people with digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The impact can range from nutritional deficiencies to decreased quality of life. 4. People at risk of osteoporosis The ketogenic process in the body also causes a decrease in bone mineral levels. This can certainly increase the risk of osteoporosis which triggers bone fractures, thus reducing the quality of life of sufferers. 5. People with diabetes Ketogenic can indeed help control blood sugar and insulin levels. However, this diet pattern is not suitable for sufferers who are undergoing insulin treatment. This is because this process can cause a drastic decrease in blood sugar which can be fatal. Is Keto Diet Safe for Health? This diet is generally safe for most healthy people. However, some people may experience some side effects at first, especially as their bodies adjust. Some side effects of the keto diet are: Lack of energy. Poor mental function. Sleep disorders. Nauseous. Digestion feels uncomfortable. Decreased physical performance. These effects are temporary and may subside over time. However, if you follow the keto diet long-term, side effects can include: Low protein in the blood. Excess fat in the liver. Kidney stones. Micronutrient deficiencies. To avoid this, you can try a low-carb diet regularly for the first few weeks. This will make your body burn more fat before you completely eliminate carbohydrates. In addition, the keto diet can also change the body\u2019s water and mineral balance. So, try adding extra salt to your food or taking a mineral supplement. When you first start the keto diet, you may want to eat until you are full and avoid restricting your calories too strictly. Usually, the keto diet can help you lose weight without having to intentionally restrict calories.",

        "title": "Bell\u2019s Palsy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Bell\u2019s Palsy? Bell\u2019s palsy is a temporary weakness that occurs on one side of the facial muscles. The side of the face affected by Bell\u2019s palsy will usually appear to droop. Generally, this condition occurs in pregnant women, people with diabetes, and HIV. This nerve condition is often misunderstood as cerebral palsy, or the meaning is often confused. In fact, Bell\u2019s palsy and cerebral palsy are two different conditions. Bell\u2019s palsy is a condition where damaged nerves in the face affect the sense of taste and the way the body produces tears and saliva. Bell\u2019s palsy usually comes on suddenly and gets better within a few weeks. Meanwhile, cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect muscle movement and coordination. The condition occurs due to damage to the immature and developing brain, and most often occurs before birth. In many cases, cerebral palsy also affects vision, hearing, and sensation. Bell\u2019s palsy will cause one-half of the face to appear to droop. Smiles can only be done on one side, and the eye on the affected side refuses to close. This condition is also known as acute peripheral facial paralysis, the cause of which is unknown, and can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown, but many experts believe the condition is the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Or it may be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. Bells Palsy Symptoms Bell palsy causes different symptoms in each sufferer. Symptoms of paralysis that occur on one side of the face can be divided into two types, namely: Partial paralysis (mild muscle weakness). Total paralysis (no movement at all, but this is very rare). Bell\u2019s palsy also affects the sufferer\u2019s mouth and eyelids, making it difficult for these two parts to open and close. The following are the symptoms of Bell\u2019s palsy that you need to know: Ear pain on the paralyzed side of the face. The affected ear will be more sensitive to sound. Ringing in one or both ears. Decreased or changed sense of taste. The affected part of the mouth will drool easily. Mouth feels dry. Pain around the jaw. Headache and dizziness. Difficulty eating, drinking, and speaking. Bell\u2019s palsy is a disorder that occurs in the muscles and nerves of the face, so this condition does not impact the performance of the brain and other parts of the body. If paralysis on one side of the face is also accompanied by paralysis in other parts of the body, the sufferer really needs serious treatment from a doctor. Risk Factors A link was found between migraines and weakness in the face and limbs. A 2015 study revealed that people who suffer from migraines may be at higher risk of developing Bell\u2019s Palsy. In addition, Bell\u2019s Palsy is more common in: People aged 15-60 years. Those who have diabetes or upper respiratory disease. Pregnant women, especially in the third trimester. Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold Recurrent attacks of Bell\u2019s palsy are rare. However, in some cases, there is a family history of recurrent attacks, suggesting the possibility of a genetic predisposition to Bell\u2019s palsy. Causes of Bells Palsy Until now, experts do not know for sure the cause of Bell\u2019s Palsy. However, they suspect that this condition occurs because the nerves that control the facial muscles are compressed or disturbed. In addition, the cause of paralysis occurs due to inflammation of a viral infection, one of which is the herpes virus. You need to know that Bell\u2019s palsy has nothing to do with stroke. Here are some causes of Bell\u2019s palsy on the face: Injuries due to accidents occur due to lacerations to the chin or cracks in the skull. Hereditary facial paralysis, this condition occurs in children who are born with weakness or paralysis of the face. Surgical injury, this condition usually occurs during parotid gland surgery. Meanwhile, several viral infectious diseases that are suspected of being related to Bell\u2019s palsy are: Herpes simplex. Chickenpox and shingles. Infectious mononucleosis (epstein-barr). Cytomegalovirus infection. Respiratory disease (adenovirus). German measles (rubella). Mumps (mumps virus). Flu (flu B). Coxsackievirus. According to the US National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, many experts believe that something can trigger a dormant viral infection, essentially awakening and triggering Bell\u2019s palsy. If you are stressed or have recently been sick, those can be potential triggers. So can recent physical trauma or even lack of sleep. Autoimmune conditions can also be other triggers. The facial nerve reacts to the infection by swelling, which can cause pressure on the bony (fallopian) canal through which the facial nerve passes to the side of the face. Inflammation of the facial nerve can reduce blood flow and oxygen to the nerve cells. Damage to these cranial nerves and nerve cells can lead to paralysis of the facial muscles. In most cases of Bell\u2019s palsy, paralysis on one side of the face can usually recover completely. Therefore, it is best to contact a doctor to understand the condition experienced. Diagnosis The American Medical Association (AMA) states that treatment is more effective when given early. Therefore, sufferers are advised to visit a doctor immediately after experiencing symptoms. Diagnosing Bell\u2019s Palsy is a process of elimination. Doctors will look for other conditions that cause facial paralysis, such as a tumor, Lyme disease, or stroke. The medical staff will also examine the sufferer\u2019s head, neck, and ears. The doctor will also assess the facial muscles to determine if any nerves other than the facial nerve are affected. If the diagnosis is still uncertain, the doctor will refer the sufferer to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist or otolaryngologist. Here are the tests you can do to diagnose Bell\u2019s palsy: Electromyography (EMG): This procedure can be done by placing electrodes on the sufferer\u2019s face. The machine will then measure the electrical activity of nerves and the electrical activity of muscles in response to stimulation. This test is useful for determining the level of nerve damage, as well as its location. MRI, CT Scan, or X-ray. These tests are good for determining whether there is another underlying condition, such as a bacterial infection, skull fracture, or tumor. Blood tests to check for bacterial or viral infections. Bells Palsy Treatment To reduce swelling in the facial nerve, sufferers can use prednisolone or prednisone (a group of corticosteroid drugs). Meanwhile, to prevent problems arising in the eyes that cannot close, sufferers usually need eye drops. About 70 percent of people with Bell\u2019s palsy recover. Most will start to improve within two to three weeks. However, it can take up to 10 months to fully recover depending on the extent of nerve damage. If a specific cause of Bell\u2019s palsy can be identified by your doctor, such as an infection, that cause will be treated. If not, symptoms will be treated as needed. One of the treatments that doctors recommend for Bell\u2019s palsy is to protect the eyes from drying out at night or when working in front of a computer screen. Eye care includes eye drops during the day, ointments at bedtime, or keeping the room humid at night. These treatments help protect the cornea from being scratched, which is essential for the management of Bell\u2019s palsy. The doctor may also prescribe other treatments for the sufferer\u2019s condition based on the severity of symptoms and medical history. Other treatment options include: Steroids to reduce inflammation. Antiviral drugs. Analgesics to relieve pain. Physical therapy to stimulate the facial nerve. In addition to the above treatments, learn about therapies to treat Bell\u2019s Palsy. Bells Palsy Prevention Start a healthy lifestyle by eating high-fiber foods and exercising regularly. In addition, do regular health checks. Bells Palsy Complications Bell\u2019s Palsy usually resolves within a short period of time and does not cause long-term complications. However, during the illness, most people with Bell\u2019s Palsy are unable to close their eye on the affected side of their face. That is why it is very important to prevent dry eyes at night or when working on a computer. The eye care you need is eye drops during the day, ointment at bedtime, or making the room humid at night. These methods can help protect the cornea from being scratched. Other complications of Bell\u2019s palsy can include: Permanent damage to the facial nerve. A person may have synkinesis, a condition in which moving one part of the face causes another part to move without the person realizing it. For example, your eyes close when you smile. Partial or complete blindness in the eye that will not close due to excessive dryness, and scratches on the protective membrane of the eye (cornea).",

        "text": "What is Cerebral Palsy? Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect movement and muscle coordination. In many cases, cerebral palsy also affects vision, hearing, and sensation. This condition occurs due to damage to the immature and developing brain, and most often occurs before birth (during pregnancy). However, cerebral palsy can also occur during the birth process, or in the first year after birth. In general, cerebral palsy causes movement disorders associated with excessive reflexes, spasticity or flexibility of the limbs and body. In addition, other signs include unusual postures, unintentional movements, unsteady walking, or a combination of all of these. Cerebral Palsy Symptoms The signs and symptoms of this disease can vary greatly from person to person. Cerebral palsy can affect the entire body, or be limited primarily to one or two limbs, or one side of the body. Common signs and symptoms include problems with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues. The following is an explanation of the symptoms of cerebral palsy from a number of aspects: `1. Symptoms in movement and coordination Stiff muscles and excessive reflexes (spasticity), the most common movement disorder. Variations in muscle tone, such as being too stiff or too floppy. Stiff muscles with normal reflexes (rigidity). Lack of balance and muscle coordination (ataxia). Tremors or involuntary, jerky movements. Slow, wriggling movements. Favoring one side of the body, such as reaching with only one hand or dragging a foot while crawling. Difficulty walking, such as walking on toes, a crouched gait, a scissor-like gait with crossed knees, a wide-legged gait, or an asymmetrical gait. Difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes or picking up utensils. 2. Symptoms when talking and eating Delay in speech development. Difficulty speaking. Difficulty with sucking, chewing, or eating. Excessive salivation or difficulty swallowing. Developmental Disorders. Delays in reaching motor skill milestones, such as sitting or crawling. Learning difficulties. Intellectual disability. Delayed growth, resulting in smaller than expected size. 3. Other issues Brain damage can cause other neurological problems, such as: Seizures ( epilepsy ). Difficulty hearing. Problems with vision and abnormal eye movements. Abnormal touch or painful sensations. Bladder and bowel problems, especially in children with cerebral palsy are more susceptible to bladder stones. Mental health conditions, such as emotional disorders and behavioral problems. The brain disorder that causes this condition does not change over time, so symptoms usually do not get worse with age. However, as the child gets older, some symptoms become more or less obvious. Muscle shortening and muscle stiffness can worsen if not treated promptly. Cerebral Palsy Risk Factors There are a number of factors that can put a baby at increased risk of cerebral palsy, including: Premature birth (birth before reaching 37 weeks of gestation). Low birth weight (less than 2.5 kilograms). Breech birth occurs when the baby\u2019s bottom or legs come out first Rh incompatibility, which occurs when the Rh type of the pregnant parents\u2019 blood does not match the Rh type of their baby\u2019s blood. Negative habits in mothers during pregnancy. For example, smoking, drinking alcohol or using drugs. The birth of twins or more (triplets), especially when one baby survives and the other dies at birth. Causes of Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy occurs due to abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain. This usually occurs before the child is born, but can also occur at birth or in early infancy. In many cases, the cause of cerebral palsy is unknown. Many factors can cause problems with brain development, including: Gene mutations that result in genetic abnormalities or differences in brain development. Maternal infection that affects the developing fetus. Fetal stroke, a disruption of blood supply to the developing brain. Bleeding into the brain in the womb or during birth. An infection in a baby that causes inflammation in or around the brain. Traumatic head injuries in infants, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or physical abuse. Lack of oxygen to the brain is associated with difficult labor or delivery, although birth-related asphyxia is a much less common cause than historically thought. Diagnosis Cerebral Palsy A doctor will diagnose cerebral palsy by taking a complete medical history, performing a physical examination that includes a detailed neurological exam, and evaluating the symptoms. In addition, to support the diagnosis, the doctor can also perform additional tests such as: Electroencephalogram (EEG). Aims to evaluate electrical activity in the brain. MRI. The purpose of this examination is to identify brain irregularities or injuries. CT scan. A CT scan creates clear cross-sectional images of the brain. It can also reveal brain damage. Ultrasonography (USG). Cranial ultrasound is a method of using high-frequency sound waves to obtain basic images of a young baby\u2019s brain. Blood tests. Aim to rule out other conditions, such as bleeding disorders. If a doctor confirms a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, they may refer the person to a specialist who can test for neurological problems. Neurological examination can detect: Vision loss and disturbances, such as blurred vision in one or both eyes. Deaf condition. Speech delay. Intellectual disability. Movement disorders. Cerebral Palsy Treatment Children and adults with cerebral palsy require lifelong care with a medical care team. In addition to a pediatrician or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist (physiotherapist), and a pediatric neurologist to oversee the child\u2019s medical care, the team includes a variety of therapists and mental health specialists. Remember, there is no cure for cerebral palsy. However, there are many cerebral palsy treatment options that can help improve a person\u2019s daily functioning, including: 1. Medicines Medications that can reduce muscle tension can be used to improve functional ability, treat pain, and manage complications related to spasticity or other cerebral palsy symptoms. Muscle or nerve injections. To treat certain muscle tightening, your doctor may recommend injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), or other agents. You may need to repeat the injections every three months. Oral muscle relaxants. Medications such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, or dantrolene are often recommended by doctors to relax the muscles. Medications to reduce saliva. One option is Botox injections into the salivary glands. 2. Therapy Various therapies play an important role in treating cerebral palsy: Physical Therapy Exercise and muscle training can help a child\u2019s strength, flexibility, balance, motor development, and mobility. Parents will also learn how to safely care for their child\u2019s daily needs at home, such as bathing and feeding the child. For the first 1 to 2 years after birth, both physical and occupational therapists work on issues such as head and trunk control, rolling over, and grasping. Then, both types of therapists are involved in the wheelchair assessment. Braces, splints or other supportive devices may be recommended for your child to help with function, such as improving walking and stretching stiff muscles. Speech and Language Therapy A speech-language pathologist can help improve a child\u2019s ability to speak clearly or communicate using sign language. They can also teach you how to use communication devices, such as computers and voice synthesizers if communication is difficult for you. Speech therapists can also address feeding and swallowing difficulties. Recreational Therapy Some children benefit from regular recreational or competitive or adaptive sports, such as therapeutic horseback riding or skiing. This type of therapy can help improve a child\u2019s motor skills, speech, and emotional well-being. Both adults and children benefit from regular physical activity and exercise for general health and fitness. 3. Operating Procedure Surgery may be necessary to reduce muscle tension or correct bone deformities caused by spasticity. This treatment includes: Orthopedic Surgery. Children with severe contractures or deformities may require surgery on the bones or joints to place their arms, spine, hips, or legs in the correct position. Cutting Nerve Fibers. If other treatments don\u2019t help, the surgeon will cut the nerves that serve certain spastic muscles. One procedure that the doctor may perform is a selective dorsal rhizotomy. This relaxes the leg muscles and reduces pain, but can cause numbness. 4. Other Treatments If necessary, your doctor may recommend medications and other treatments to treat some of the symptoms. Medication may be recommended to treat seizures, pain, osteoporosis, mental health conditions, and problems with sleep, oral health, eating and nutrition, bladder incontinence, vision, or hearing. Cerebral Palsy Prevention You can\u2019t prevent most cases of cerebral palsy, but you can reduce your risk. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you can take the following steps to maintain your health and minimize pregnancy complications: Get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated against diseases, such as rubella, preferably before becoming pregnant, can prevent infections that can cause fetal brain damage. Get regular pregnancy checkups. Visiting your doctor regularly can help prevent premature birth, low birth weight, and infections. Avoid certain intakes. For example, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. Because some of these substances have been associated with the risk of cerebral palsy. Practice good public safety. Prevent head injuries in children by providing appropriate protection and supervision. For example, ensuring that children wear helmets when riding bicycles. Cerebral Palsy Complications Without proper treatment, people with cerebral palsy are at risk of experiencing complications, such as: Communication difficulties, such as speech and language disorders. Spinal problems, such as scoliosis, lordosis (swayback) and kyphosis (hunchback). Osteoarthritis. It is pressure on the joints or abnormal joint alignment due to muscle spasticity. If you want to know more about this disease. Contractures occur when muscles become locked in a painful position. Osteopenia, or poor bone density that can make bones break easily. Dental problems. Incontinence. When to See a Doctor? It is important to get a proper diagnosis for any movement disorder or developmental delay in your child. See a neurologist if you have concerns about symptoms of loss of awareness of surroundings or unusual body or muscle movements, impaired coordination, difficulty swallowing, eye muscle imbalance, or other developmental problems.",

        "title": "Epilepsy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a condition that can cause someone to have repeated seizures. Epilepsy can attack someone when there is damage or changes in the brain. In the human brain, there are neurons or nerve cells that are part of the nervous system. Each nerve cell communicates with each other using electrical impulses. In cases of epilepsy, seizures occur when these electrical impulses are produced excessively, causing uncontrolled behavior or body movements. In fact, epilepsy can happen to anyone. This disease can affect people of all ages and all genders. According to WHO, around 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological diseases in the world. Symptoms of Epilepsy Recurrent seizures are the main symptom of epilepsy. The characteristics of the seizures will vary and depend on which part of the brain is first affected and how far the damage has progressed. Types of epileptic seizures are divided into two based on the disturbance in the brain, namely: 1. Partial seizures In partial or focal seizures, only part of the brain is affected. These partial seizures are divided into two categories, namely: Simple partial seizures This is a seizure in which the sufferer does not experience loss of consciousness. Symptoms can include jerking limbs, or tingling sensations, dizziness, and flashes of light. The part of the body that experiences seizures depends on which part of the brain is affected. For example, if epilepsy disrupts the brain function that controls hand or foot movement, then only those two limbs will experience seizures. Partial seizures can also cause sufferers to experience emotional changes, such as feeling suddenly happy or afraid. Complex partial seizures Sometimes, focal seizures affect the sufferer\u2019s awareness, making them appear confused or semi-conscious for a few moments. This is called a complex partial seizure. Other characteristics of a complex partial seizure are blank stares, swallowing, chewing, or rubbing hands. 2. Generalized seizures In generalized or generalized seizures, symptoms occur throughout the body and are caused by a disorder that affects all parts of the brain. The following are symptoms that can occur when someone has a generalized seizure: Eyes open during seizure. Tonic seizures. The body becomes stiff for a few seconds. This may be accompanied by rhythmic movements of the arms and legs or nothing at all. The muscles in the body, especially the arms, legs, and back, twitch. Atonic seizures, where the body\u2019s muscles suddenly relax, causing the sufferer to fall uncontrollably. Clonic seizures, which are rhythmic jerking movements that usually affect the muscles of the neck, face, and arms. Sometimes, people with epilepsy make noises or scream during a seizure. Bedwetting. Difficulty breathing for a while, so the body looks pale or even blue. In some cases, a generalized seizure leaves the sufferer completely unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the sufferer appears confused for several minutes or hours. There is a type of epilepsy that is commonly experienced by children, known as absence epilepsy or petit mal. Although this condition is not dangerous, the child\u2019s academic performance and concentration can be disrupted. The characteristics of this epilepsy are loss of consciousness for a few seconds, blinking or moving the lips, and a blank stare. Children who experience these seizures will not be aware or remember what happened during the seizure. Epilepsy Risk Factors Several factors that can potentially increase the risk of developing epilepsy include: Age. Epilepsy is generally experienced by children and the elderly. However, this condition can also be experienced by all groups who are at risk of developing epilepsy. Genetics. A family history of health problems can be a trigger for epilepsy. Head injury. Head injury can be one of the causes of epilepsy. Stroke and vascular disease. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can cause brain damage that can trigger this condition. Dementia. Brain infection. Inflammation of the brain or spinal cord can increase the risk of developing epilepsy. History of seizures in childhood. Seizures can be caused by high fever. In this condition, children are more susceptible to epilepsy. Causes of Epilepsy Epilepsy can start at any age, generally this condition occurs since childhood. Based on the cause, epilepsy is divided into two, namely: Idiopathic epilepsy, also known as primary epilepsy. This is a type of epilepsy that has no known cause. Some experts suspect that this condition is caused by genetic factors (hereditary). Symptomatic epilepsy, also called secondary epilepsy. This is a type of epilepsy that has a known cause. A number of factors, such as severe head injury, brain tumors, and strokes are thought to cause secondary epilepsy. Apart from the causes above, there are several other causes including: Immune disorders. Conditions that cause the immune system to attack brain cells, called autoimmune diseases, can cause epilepsy. Developmental disorders. Birth defects that affect the brain are often the cause of epilepsy, especially in people whose seizures are not controlled with anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis of Epilepsy The steps taken before the doctor makes a diagnosis include a physical examination, recording your medical history, asking about your activities, and possibly asking you to have a blood test. Your doctor may also ask about your symptoms during your seizure and ask you or your family if you experience any of the following during your seizure: Brain jerk. Muscle stiffness. Urinating or defecating during a seizure. Changes in breathing. Skin color becomes pale. Blank stare. Loss of consciousness. Difficulty speaking or understanding what people are saying to you. In addition, doctors also perform several tests to find out how the brain is performing by checking: How to walk. Muscle. Sensitivity. Thinking ability. Next, the doctor will recommend the following tests, if you are suspected of having epilepsy, such as: EEG or electroencephalogram. This is a test to find out the problem of electrical activity in the brain. Blood tests. These tests are useful for detecting signs of infection and other health problems. Epilepsy Treatment Although epilepsy cannot be cured, there are many treatment options available. As many as 70 percent of epilepsy sufferers can manage their disease with medication. There are several treatments to control epilepsy ranging from taking anti-seizure drugs, special diets, to surgery. Consumption of anti-seizure drugs This medication can control seizures in about 60 to 70 percent of people with epilepsy. Your doctor may prescribe one or more anti-seizure medications, a dose of medication, or a combination of medications to find the best medication to control your seizures. The choice of anti-seizure medication also depends on several things, such as: Types of seizures. Previous response to anti-seizure medications. Other medical conditions you have. Potential interactions with other drugs currently being taken. Side effects of anti-seizure drugs. Age. Overall health condition. This is because some anti-seizure medications have been linked to birth defects. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Special diet The ketogenic diet and the Atkins diet (a diet high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates) are two of the most common diets sometimes recommended for people with epilepsy. Most diets are recommended for children whose medical treatment is ineffective and whose condition does not allow for surgery. A low glycemic index diet may also reduce seizures in some people with epilepsy. Operation Your doctor may consider surgery if anti-seizure medication does not control your seizures and your seizures get worse. Epilepsy surgery can be a safe and effective treatment option when more than two trials of anti-seizure medications have failed to control seizures. Epilepsy surgery options include: Surgical resection. Removal of abnormal tissue. Severance. Cutting of the bundle of fibers that connects areas of the brain. Stereotactic radiosurgery. Targeted destruction of abnormal brain tissue. Implantation of a neuromodulation device. This device sends electrical impulses to the brain to reduce seizures over time. Epilepsy Prevention Apart from medication, there are several ways that can be done to prevent epilepsy, such as: Drive safely This is done to prevent traumatic brain injury. Be careful when doing activities. For example, use a bicycle helmet when cycling and a motorcycle helmet when riding a motorbike, use a seat belt, and provide a child passenger seat. This is done to reduce motor vehicle and traffic injuries. Pay attention to the steps Falls are a major cause of brain injury. Older adults and children are more likely to suffer a brain injury from a fall. Treat injuries early Get help immediately if a traumatic brain injury occurs. The risk of epilepsy is high in severe brain injuries. Taking good care of injuries can help prevent epilepsy. Healthy lifestyle Eating healthy foods, exercising such as walking every day, and not smoking can prevent epilepsy. Apart from epilepsy, this healthy lifestyle can also reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease. Vaccine Immunization, also known as a vaccine, can reduce the chances of getting an infection which can sometimes cause epilepsy. Maintain cleanliness An infection called cysticercosis is the most common cause of epilepsy. This disease is caused by a parasite and can be prevented through good hygiene and food preparation practices. Health checks and early treatment of cysticercosis can prevent epilepsy. Maintaining health during pregnancy Several problems during pregnancy and childbirth can cause epilepsy. Follow a prenatal care plan with your obstetrician or nurse to keep yourself and your baby healthy. When to See a Doctor? You need to contact a doctor if you experience the following symptoms of epilepsy: The seizure lasted more than 5 minutes. Breathing or consciousness does not return after the seizure stops. The second seizure occurred soon after. High fever. Heat exhaustion. Is pregnant. Have diabetes. Injuring oneself during a seizure. Still having seizures despite taking anti-seizure medication. Having a seizure for the first time. While it may be uncertain whether or not you have had a seizure, it is always a good idea to see a doctor right away if you suspect something or someone tells you about behavior you are not aware of.",

        "title": "Bladder Stones Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Bladder Stones Bladder stones or bladder calculi are stones that form from mineral deposits in the bladder. Everyone is actually at risk of having them. However, men over the age of 50 are at higher risk of experiencing it. Especially for men who have an enlarged prostate. As for bladder calculi, they can block the urinary tract and cause pain when urinating, difficulty urinating or not being able to urinate at all. If not treated immediately, these stones have the potential to cause infection and complications. Treatment of this condition usually requires medical assistance. However, if the stone is small, bladder calculi can come out with urine. Symptoms of Bladder Stones Some bladder calculi pass out of the body in the urine and do not cause any symptoms. However, large bladder stones can irritate the bladder and cause severe pain, bleeding, and problems urinating. Signs and symptoms include: Changes in urine color. The sufferer may have cloudy or dark urine or may see blood in the urine. Frequent urination. You may feel like you always need to urinate, even if you just went. Pain. With stones, there is usually pain or burning when urinating. You may also feel pain that comes and goes in the lower abdomen. In men, sometimes the pain will be felt in the penis or testicles. Stopping and starting. You may have trouble starting a urine stream, even when you really need to go. Sometimes the urine stream stops and starts (intermittent urination). Urinary tract infection. These stones can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). Symptoms of a UTI include frequent, painful urination and cloudy, smelly urine. However, you need to understand that bladder stones and urinary tract infections are two different conditions. Risk Factors for Bladder Stones Men, especially those over 50, are more likely to have bladder stones. Other conditions that can also increase the risk include: Obstruction of urine flow. Any condition that blocks the flow of urine from the bladder to the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, can lead to the formation of bladder calculi. There are several causes, but the most common is an enlarged prostate. Nerve damage. Stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, herniated disks, and a number of other problems can damage the nerves that control bladder function. A person is also at risk for nerve damage and conditions that cause bladder outlet obstruction. These conditions will further increase the risk of stones. Causes of Bladder Stones This condition can develop when the bladder does not empty completely. This condition causes the urine to become concentrated. Concentrated urine can crystallize and form stones. Some infections can cause bladder stones to form. Sometimes underlying conditions that affect the bladder\u2019s ability to hold, store, or excrete urine can also lead to the formation of bladder calculi. Any foreign material present in the bladder is likely to cause bladder stones. The most common conditions that cause this condition include: 1. Prostate Gland Enlargement An enlarged prostate ( benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) can cause bladder calculi in men. An enlarged prostate can block the flow of urine, preventing the bladder from emptying completely. 2. Damaged Nerves Normally, nerves carry messages from the brain to the bladder muscles, directing them to tighten or relax. If these nerves are damaged, either by stroke, spinal cord injury, or other health problems, the bladder may not empty completely. Another term for this condition is neurogenic bladder. 3. Inflammation of the bladder This condition sometimes occurs due to urinary tract infections or radiation therapy to the pelvis, can cause bladder calculi . 4. Use of medical devices The use of a bladder catheter through the urethra to help urine drain from the bladder can cause stones to form. So can objects that accidentally migrate into the bladder. Examples include contraceptive devices or urinary stents. Mineral crystals, which later become stones, tend to form on the surface of these devices. 5. Suffering from kidney stones Stones that form in the kidneys are not the same as bladder stones. But small kidney stones can travel down the ureter to the bladder and grow into stones. Bladder Stone Diagnosis To diagnose this disease, your doctor may need one or a combination of the following tests: Physical exam. The doctor may place his or her hand on the person\u2019s lower abdomen to feel for an enlarged bladder. Urine Test. Your doctor may need a urine sample to check for signs of blood, bacteria, and crystallized minerals. CT Scan. This scan combines several X-ray images to show internal organs in detail. In addition to detecting stones, CT scans can also be useful for detecting a number of other health problems. Ultrasonography. Produces images by bouncing sound off internal organs. Intravenous pyelogram. This procedure involves injecting a special fluid into a vein that will drain to the kidneys and bladder. The doctor will then use X-rays to look for signs of kidney stones. Bladder Stone Treatment If the size of the bladder stone is quite small, then treatment is sufficient by drinking 1200 milliliters of water per day. The goal is to help the stone pass naturally with urine. However, if the size is large enough, the doctor can perform the following medical procedures: Cystolitholapaxy. In this procedure, the doctor will crush the stones in the bladder into small pieces using a laser, ultrasound, or mechanical means. Once the stones are small, they will be easier to pass along with the urine. Surgery. This procedure may be an option if the stone is too large and too hard to pass by cystolitholapaxy. Bladder Stone Complications Although some cases of bladder are asymptomatic, it does not mean that you should take this health condition lightly. Because, without proper treatment, this condition can cause the following two main complications: Chronic bladder dysfunction. This condition is characterized by increased frequency of urination along with pain during urination. Sometimes, bladder calculi can completely block urine from leaving the body. Urinary tract infection. This infection can recur and therefore requires proper treatment. Because, if ignored, this condition is dangerous to health. Well, more complete information about the dangers, Bladder Stone Prevention Bladder stones are usually the result of an underlying condition that is difficult to prevent. However, anyone can reduce their chances of developing bladder stones by following these tips: Check for unusual urinary symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of prostate enlargement or other urological conditions can reduce the risk of developing these conditions. Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking more fluids, especially water, can help prevent stones from forming. This is because fluids dilute the concentration of minerals in the bladder. How much water you should drink will depend on your age, size, health, and activity level.",

        "title": "Urinary Tract Infection Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Urinary Tract Infection Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a condition when the urinary system experiences an infection. It can be in the ureter, kidney, bladder, and urethra. Generally, the infection attacks two parts, namely the urethra and the bladder. Although it can happen to anyone, this infection is more likely to occur in women. In addition, this infection can attack deeper parts and the most common one that occurs is a bladder infection (cystitis). Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections in Women and Men UTIs can cause the lining of the urinary tract to become red and inflamed (irritated). Some of the characteristics of UTI that can occur in men and women include: 1. Characteristics of Urinary Tract Infections in Women Symptoms of urinary tract infections in women can include: Pain or burning sensation when urinating. More frequent urination. Urine smells and has a different color than usual. Pelvic or lower abdominal pain. Feeling weak and unwell. Fever. Shivering. Bloody urine (hematuria). In girls, they tend to be restless or cry when urinating. 2. Characteristics of Urinary Tract Infections in Men Although more common in women, men can also experience urinary tract infections (UTIs) with the following symptoms: Pain or burning sensation when urinating. Difficulty urinating. Frequent urination. Pain in the lower abdomen or lower back. Urine smells and is colored differently than normal. Fever. A feeling of discomfort in the pelvic or genital area. Exhaustion. Intense pain. Risk Factors for Urinary Tract Infections General risk factors for urinary tract infections include: Have urinary tract abnormalities. Having a blockage in the urinary tract. Have a low immune system. Using a catheter. Having surgery or a urinary tract examination. This disease is more common in women, and many women experience it more than once during their lifetime. Several factors that increase the risk of this disease in women, namely: Sexually active. The anatomy of the female body has a shorter urethra than men. Using certain types of contraception. Already menopausal. Women who have the habit of wiping the genital area after urinating from back to front are also at risk of contracting this disease. This is because the urethra is located close to the anus which tends to have a lot of bacteria. Sexual intercourse can also cause bacteria to enter the urinary tract, apart from dirty habits after urinating. Therefore, cleaning the genital area after having sex is very important. Types of Urinary Tract Infections UTIs are divided into several types, depending on which part of the urinary tract is infected. Some common types are: Urethritis. Infection of the urethra, the hollow tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. Cystitis. A bacterial infection of the bladder that often spreads from the urethra. Pyelonephritis. This occurs in the kidneys, usually due to an infection that has spread to the urinary tract, or from a blockage in the urinary tract. Obstruction in the urinary tract causes urine to flow back into the ureters and kidneys. Causes of Urinary Tract Infections The cause of urinary tract infections is bacteria that infect one part of the urinary system. The type of bacteria that most often causes this infection is E. coli. However, there are several other types of bacteria that can also cause UTIs. Such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. This disease can occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and grow in the bladder. Although the urinary system works to prevent bacteria from entering through the urethra, sometimes it can still happen. Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection Some tests and procedures to diagnose urinary tract infections, namely: Urinalysis. Examination of a urine sample, looking for white blood cells, red blood cells, or bacteria. Urine Culture Examination. This is useful to determine the type of bacteria present, in order to determine the right treatment. Imaging tests. Such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, to see images of the urinary tract. Cystoscopy. An examination using a special instrument inserted through the urethra to look inside the bladder. Urinary Tract Infection Treatment The most common treatment for this disease is by administering antibiotics. This drug is able to kill bacteria, thereby eliminating the infection that occurs. However, make sure to finish the antibiotics according to the doctor\u2019s prescription so that the bacterial infection is resolved and the body does not become resistant to the drug later. In addition, it is also necessary to consume more water so that bacteria can be removed from the urinary tract system. So, Can Urinary Tract Infections Be Cured with Pipemidic Acid? If this condition recurs three times in a year or more, ask your doctor to recommend a specific treatment plan. Some treatment options that you can undergo include: Using low doses of antibiotics over a longer period to help prevent recurrent infections. Taking a single dose of antibiotics after intercourse, to prevent common triggers of infection. Take antibiotics for 1 or 2 days whenever you feel symptoms. So, if you experience bladder problems, contact this doctor immediately. Recommended Medications for Treating Urinary Tract Infections The following are recommended medications for treating urinary tract infections: Floxifar 500 mg 10 Caplets. Tablets containing the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin which are useful for treating infections in the urinary tract, bones and joints, and digestive tract. Scopma 10 mg 10 Caplets. Used to treat stomach pain or serious digestive disorders. Spasmolit 10 mg 10 Tablets. A hard drug that can be consumed based on doctor\u2019s instructions. This drug contains Hyoscine Butylbromide to treat digestive disorders such as paroxysmal pain in the stomach or small intestine. Tequinol 500 mg 10 Caplets . Can be consumed to treat severe infections caused by bacteria such as urinary tract infections, urethritis, and infections of the digestive tract and respiratory tract. Baquinor Forte 500 mg 10 Caplets . Antibiotics containing Ciprofloxacin are useful for treating infections of the urinary tract, skin and soft tissue, bones and joints, to acute osteomyelitis. Helixim Dry Syrup 30 ml. Is a type of antibiotic that contains Cefixime to treat urinary tract infections without complications. Cefspan Dry Syrup 30 ml. With Cefixime content, this drug is an antibiotic to treat urinary tract infections, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. Buscopan 10 mg 10 Tablets . Tablets containing Hyoscine-N-butyl bromide are useful for treating spastic disorders in the digestive tract, urinary tract, bile duct, and genital tract in women. Prive Uricran 10 Capsules . Supplements that contain multivitamins and Isoflavones that are useful for maintaining urinary tract health. Complications of Urinary Tract Infections Urinary tract infections that are not treated immediately can trigger urosepsis, a condition where bacteria in the infected kidney spread to the blood. This causes many bad effects, such as shock and even death. In addition, in some cases this disease can also cause: Premature birth, if this disease occurs in pregnant women. Permanent kidney damage if the bacteria spread to the kidneys. Narrowing of the urinary tract. Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections Here are some efforts to prevent urinary tract infections: Not holding urine. Always clean the genital area from front to back after urinating. Drink plenty of water. You should avoid feminine hygiene sprays, feminine fragrances, and other products for the feminine area because they will only irritate the mucosa. Clean the genital area before having sex. After intercourse, urinate. This is to remove any bacteria that may have entered the urethra. Don\u2019t wear underwear for days. Do not wear tight bottoms as they will increase humidity.",

        "title": "Acromegaly Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Acromegaly Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder that develops when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones will increase in size. In childhood, this condition causes an increase in height called gigantism. However, in adulthood, body changes do not occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of the hands, feet, and face, and is called acromegaly. Symptoms of Acromegaly Symptoms of acromegaly can vary and usually develop slowly. Initially, symptoms usually include: Swelling of the hands and feet. Usually, marked by changes in ring and shoe size. Fatigue and difficulty sleeping. Snoring. Changes in facial appearance, such as the eyebrows, lower jaw, and nose becoming larger, and the gaps between the teeth becoming wider. Numbness and weakness in the hand caused by pressure on the nerves in the hand. In children and teenagers, it will be very high. In advanced conditions, complaints may increase, such as: Large hands and feet. The size of the nose and lips, as well as the large tongue. Skin changes, such as becoming thicker, rougher, and oilier or sweating more often. The voice becomes deeper. Joint pain. Chest pain. Headache Visual disturbances. Decreased libido. Menstrual disorders in women and erectile dysfunction in men. Risk Factors for Acromegaly Acromegaly is usually related to genetics, so a family history of acromegaly can be a risk factor. It is also important to note that acromegaly can begin at any time after puberty. However, it is more common in middle age. People are usually unaware of the condition. This is because changes in the body occur slowly over many years. Causes of Acromegaly Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of the brain, just behind the bridge of the nose. This area produces growth hormone and a number of other hormones. It is important to note that growth hormone plays an important role in managing physical growth. When the pituitary gland releases GH into the bloodstream, it triggers the liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Insulin is what causes bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH can lead to too much IGF-1, which can cause the signs, symptoms, and complications of acromegaly. In adults, tumors are a common cause of too much GH production: 1. Pituitary tumor In most cases, acromegaly is caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and visual disturbances, are caused by the tumor pressing on surrounding brain tissue. 2. Non-pituitary tumors In some people with acromegaly, a tumor in another part of the body, such as the lung or pancreas, causes the condition. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumor produces a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH. Diagnosis of Acromegaly To diagnose acromegaly, the doctor will ask about the patient\u2019s medical history and perform a physical examination. Then, the doctor may recommend the following tests: IGF-1 measurement. Before performing this test, your doctor will ask you to fast overnight. On the day of the test, your doctor will take a blood sample to measure the level of IGF-1 in your blood. Elevated IGF-1 levels indicate acromegaly. Growth hormone suppression test. This is the best method to confirm a diagnosis of acromegaly. During this test, your blood GH levels are measured before and after you drink sugar (glucose). In people who do not have acromegaly, a glucose drink usually causes GH levels to drop. However, if you have acromegaly, your GH levels will tend to remain high. Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help determine the location and size of a tumor on your pituitary gland. If a pituitary tumor isn\u2019t visible, your doctor may recommend other imaging tests to look for non-pituitary tumors. Treatment and Side Effects of Acromegaly Treatment for acromegaly usually depends on the symptoms experienced. In acromegaly sufferers who have a pituitary gland tumor, it is usually recommended to remove the tumor through surgery, which may need to be followed by drug therapy or radiation therapy. 1. Surgery Tumor removal therapy is one of the effective therapies for acromegaly sufferers due to pituitary tumors. The choice of tumor removal requires prior examination to ensure its benefits. In conditions where the tumor is too large and cannot be removed completely, a partial removal is usually performed. This will then be followed by medication or radiotherapy before further surgery. Pituitary gland tumor removal surgery is an operation that requires general anesthesia and is performed in the operating room. Surgery or surgical procedures to remove pituitary gland tumors have several risks, such as the risk of damaging healthy tissue and infection of the meninges. The surgeon will provide an explanation before performing the procedure and will try to minimize any risks that may occur. 2. Medicine The doctor will give medication after surgery or in conditions where surgery cannot be done for some reason. The purpose of giving medication is to reduce the production of growth hormone. Types of drugs that can be given include dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogs, and growth hormone antagonists. Somatostatin analogs can cause side effects on the stomach or digestive tract, such as diarrhea and nausea or gallstones. 3. Radiation Radiation may be used to destroy large tumors or any remaining tumors after surgery, or when other treatments are ineffective. This method can slowly help lower GH levels when used in conjunction with medications. Reducing GH levels using this method may take several years. At least the sufferer needs to be given radiation therapy in several sessions, four to six weeks. The types of radiation therapy that may be used are: Conventional radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy is usually given daily for four to six weeks. People may not see the full effects of this therapy for 10 years or more after treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery. This method uses 3D imaging to deliver high doses of radiation to tumor cells while limiting the amount of radiation to surrounding normal tissue. Usually, this type of radiation can be given in a single dose. GH levels can return to normal within five to 10 years with this method. Unfortunately, radiation can interfere with fertility. In rare cases, this treatment method can cause someone to lose their vision, have brain injuries, or have secondary tumors. Prevention of Acromegaly Until now, no method has been found that can prevent acromegaly, so early detection and treatment is the most effective step in treating this disease. Complications of Acromegaly If left untreated, acromegaly can cause serious health problems. Complications of this rare disease include: High blood pressure ( hypertension ). High cholesterol. Heart problems, especially an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy). Osteoarthritis. Type 2 diabetes Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Precancerous growths (polyps) in the lining of the colon. Sleep apnea Carpal tunnel syndrome. Changes or loss of vision. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms or complaints that indicate acromegaly, talk to your doctor immediately to get the right treatment.",

        "title": "Albinism Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Albinism Albinism or albino is a congenital disorder that causes sufferers to experience a lack of melanin or even no pigment at all. Therefore, the skin, hair, and eye color of sufferers of this condition are pale and tend to be white. Although this condition cannot be cured, sufferers can still live a normal life and carry out daily activities like normal people in general. Symptoms of Albinism There are several symptoms of albinism that occur with variations in sufferers. Symptoms of this condition generally affect the color of the skin, hair, eyes, and vision. 1. Symptoms on the skin and hair The most obvious symptoms of albinism are white hair and very pale and light skin. However, in some cases, hair color can range from white to brown. In addition, skin coloring can also be in the form of pigmentation, which is when the color is lighter than it should be in certain areas. People of African descent who have this condition may have light brown or reddish-brown skin and have freckles. For some, their skin color can be nearly the same as a parent or sibling without albinism. If people with albinism are exposed to sunlight, they may experience: Spots. Moles, colorless or pink. Large freckles or solar lentigines. Sunburned and unable to sunbathe. For some people with this condition, their skin color will never change. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and adolescence, causing slight changes in color. 2. Symptoms in hair An albino\u2019s hair color can range from very white to brown. However, albinism of African or Asian descent may have yellow, red, or brown hair. Hair color can darken in early adulthood. Hair color changes can also occur due to contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker as you age. 3. Eye color symptoms People with albinism usually have pale eyelashes and eyebrows. Eye color ranges from light blue to brown, and can change with age. In people with albinism, the colored part of the eye (the iris) usually lacks pigment. This allows light to shine through the iris and makes the eyes very sensitive to bright light. As a result, very light-colored eyes may appear red in certain lighting. 4. Symptoms in vision Visual impairment is the main symptom of all types of albinism. Eye problems that may occur may include: Rapid, uncontrolled back-and-forth movements of the eyes (nystagmus). Unusual head position or posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movement and see better. Eyes that cannot look in the same direction at the same time or appear crossed (strabismus). Having trouble seeing objects close up or objects far away, called nearsightedness or farsightedness. Having excessive sensitivity to light (photophobia). There is a difference in the curvature of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye (astigmatism), which causes blurred vision. There is a difference in the development of a thin layer of tissue on the inside of the back wall of the eye (retina). This difference results in reduced vision. Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that do not follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye (optic nerve misrouting). Having poor depth perception, meaning not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. Risk Factors for Albinism Albinism is a condition that someone has since birth. A child is at high risk of being born with this condition if they have parents with the same condition. In addition, it can also occur if the parents carry the gene mutation that causes albinism. To date, research has not found any possible activities or diseases that could increase the risk factors for albinism. Causes of Albinism The cause of this condition is a change in one of the genes. Some genes provide instructions for making one of several proteins involved in melanin production. Then, cells called melanocytes will produce melanin which is present in the skin , hair, and eyes. Genetic changes can cause melanin to be absent altogether or to decrease in quantity. Types of Albinism There are different types of albinism that can occur based on the gene changes that cause the disorder. The types will differ based on how they run in families and the genes that are affected. 1. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) This type is the most common. OCA albinism involves two copies of the altered gene, one from each parent. This condition is also called autosomal recessive inheritance. Oculocutaneous albinism is the result of changes in one of eight genes that range in label from OCA-1 to OCA-8. OCA causes decreased pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, as well as vision. The amount of pigment varies by type. The skin, hair, and eye color that results from OCA also varies by type. 2. Ocular albinism Ocular albinism is limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of this type is type 1. This type is inherited due to a change in the gene on the X chromosome from a mother who carries one X gene. This gene has then changed when it is passed down to the child. This is also called X-linked recessive inheritance. However, ocular albinism usually occurs only in males and is less common than OCA. 3. Albinism related to hereditary syndrome Examples of this type of albinism are Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome which is a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and intestinal diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is also a form of OCA, as well as immune problems and recurrent infections, brain and nerve problems, bleeding disorders, and other serious problems. 4. Griscelli syndrome Griscelli syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder. It occurs due to a defect in one of three genes. Only about 150 cases of the syndrome were recorded worldwide between 1978\u20132018. This condition occurs with albinism, but may not affect the entire body. In addition, Griscelli syndrome also occurs due to immune problems and neurological problems. Griscelli syndrome usually causes death in the first decade of life. Diagnosis of Albinism Albinism occurs at birth. Generally, diagnosing this condition is not difficult and only requires an examination by a doctor. This examination can be done by a doctor by: Physical examination includes examination of skin and hair pigmentation. Comprehensive eye examination. Comparing the pigmentation of a child with albinism with other family members. Review your child\u2019s medical history, including any bleeding that won\u2019t stop, serious bruising, or unexpected infections. Albinism Treatment Although it cannot be cured, treatment for albinism focuses on maximizing the ability to see and protecting the skin by providing proper care. Use sunglasses to protect the eyes from direct exposure to ultraviolet rays. Wear clothing that covers the skin and use sunscreen to protect the skin from sun exposure. Use of special glasses if you experience eye and vision problems. Do skin care and skin cancer prevention. For example, by having a skin exam at least once a year to screen for skin cancer or spots that can lead to cancer. Prevention of Albinism Albinism is not a disease that someone can prevent in some way because it is a hereditary condition. If you want to know about the risk of this condition occurring in children, you can do a genetic counselor to find out what type of albinism might occur. Complications of Albinism The lack of melanin produced by the body causes the skin, hair and eyes to become pale. The following are complications that may occur in people with albinism: Visual impairment However, people with albinism can learn to use their vision over time. Some people with albinism may be able to overcome problems with astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness with glasses or contact lenses. Skin cancer Lack of melanin in the body can cause skin cancer in people with albinism. Check regularly if you experience symptoms of skin cancer. Also, minimize exposure to the sun for a long time. Problems in the social environment People with this condition are at high risk of social isolation, due to the social stigma behind the condition. When to See a Doctor? If you experience signs and symptoms of albinism, you can talk further with a doctor to find out the cause and proper treatment. In addition, you can consult a doctor for treatment if you experience complications or the impact interferes with daily activities.",

        "title": "Cold Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Cold Allergy Not everyone can stay comfortable when facing cold air. Some people experience cold allergy problems, or in medical terms is cold urticaria. This problem can cause itchy welts and redness of the skin within minutes of exposure to cold. The symptoms of cold allergies experienced by each person can vary, ranging from mild to severe reactions. For some people, swimming in cold water can cause loss of consciousness, drop in blood pressure, and even be fatal. This disorder occurs most often in adolescents and may disappear completely after a few years. In addition, preventive measures are very important so that this problem does not recur. Cold Allergy Symptoms Signs or symptoms that can arise when someone experiences a cold allergy can range from mild to severe. For mild symptoms may include: Temporary reddish spots accompanied by itchy welts on the skin areas exposed to the cold. Bad skin reaction when the cold wears off. Experience swelling in the hands when holding cold objects. There is swelling of the lips due to consuming cold food or drinks. Then, for severe reactions, among others: Experiencing anaphylaxis which can cause fainting, heart palpitations, body swelling, and shock. Swelling of the tongue and throat that makes it difficult to breathe. Heart palpitations. Decreased blood pressure. Faint. Symptoms of urticaria begin immediately when the skin experiences a sudden drop in air temperature or cold water. Each episode can last up to about two hours. The most severe problem occurs when the whole body is exposed to cold, such as swimming in cold water. If not treated immediately, the sufferer can lose consciousness and drown. Cold Allergy Risk Factors This disorder, called cold urticaria, is most common in teenagers. About half of those who suffer from it may or may not get better after 6 years. Risk factors can be conditions or situations that increase a person\u2019s likelihood of experiencing an allergic reaction when exposed to cold temperatures or extreme temperature changes. Here are some risk factors you need to be aware of: History of allergies. A person who has a history of allergies to certain substances, such as pollen, animal dander, or certain foods, is more susceptible to this condition. Asthma. People who have asthma or other allergies, such as allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis (eczema), are at higher risk of developing this condition. Age. Children and adolescents tend to be more susceptible to it than adults. Family history. If you have a family history of this condition or other allergies, you may also be at higher risk for developing this condition. Environmental exposure. People who live or work in environments that tend to be cold or are exposed to cold temperatures for extended periods of time may be at higher risk for developing this condition. Outdoor activities. Being active in cold temperatures or extreme temperature changes can increase the risk of cold allergies. Low humidity. Environments with low humidity, especially in winter, can also trigger cold allergies. Physical activity. Some people experience cold allergies especially when doing physical activities, such as running or exercising in cold temperatures. Cholinergic urticaria reaction. Some people develop an allergic reaction called cholinergic urticaria when their body temperature rises due to physical activity, stress, or heat. Causes of Cold Allergies Allergies can appear when the skin is exposed to cold weather and are at risk of appearing in windy and humid conditions. Research has found that this condition is caused by the release of histamine and chemicals into the bloodstream triggered by cold air. People who suffer from it will experience a rash or itching on the skin after: Eat or drink something cold. Put ice on the skin. Swim or soak in cold water. Walking outdoors in cold weather. There are three most common types of cold allergies, namely: Essential cold allergy. This type occurs in people who have no family history of the disease. Symptoms can appear within minutes of exposure to cold. Then, symptoms can subside within an hour or two. Familial or hereditary cold allergy. This type runs in families. Symptoms take a long time to appear, usually 30 minutes to 48 hours after exposure. However, symptoms can last for one to two days. Autoimmune. This type occurs when the body releases histamine in response to cold. Histamine is a chemical made by the immune system in response to allergies. However, the reason for the release of histamine is unknown. Cold Allergy Diagnosis Cold urticaria can be diagnosed by placing an ice cube on the skin for five minutes. If you do have this disease, a red bump may form a few minutes after the ice cube is removed. In addition, this disorder can also be influenced by the immune system. Therefore, the doctor may need to do a blood test or other supporting tests. Cold Allergy Treatment In severe cases of cold allergies, it can have fatal consequences, such as swelling of the throat and tongue. As a result, this can cause difficulty breathing, anaphylactic reactions causing low blood pressure, heart palpitations, fainting, and swelling of the arms and legs (torso). Generally, this condition can disappear on its own within weeks to months, but some can last quite a long time. For this reason, if you suddenly feel signs of an allergy, you should immediately see a doctor. Depending on the severity of the condition, the sufferer may need to manage existing conditions before or after exposure. The doctor may also prescribe medications such as: Antihistamines. These drugs can counteract histamine or the substance that triggers itching. Sufferers can use antihistamines before exposure to cold to prevent a reaction or after exposure to control a reaction that has already occurred. Desensitization. This treatment involves gradually exposing your body to increasingly cold temperatures. For example, taking a cold shower that gets colder and colder over time. Desensitization can help your body adjust and control its reaction to cold. However, never try this treatment without talking to your doctor first. Epinephrine or adrenaline injection. This medication can slow down a severe allergic reaction. This injection can only be given by a doctor in a hospital. Some people who are at risk for a severe reaction may carry an epinephrine auto-injector. Cold Allergy Prevention For sufferers, it is recommended not to swim in cold water. When the entire surface of the skin is exposed to cold, it can cause a severe reaction, causing the sufferer to lose consciousness and drown. Well, there are several other ways that can be done to reduce the possibility of cold urticaria symptoms, namely: Wear protective clothing when the weather is cold, such as jackets, hats, gloves, and scarves. Make sure all parts of the skin are covered. Check the water temperature before you dip in and be sure to avoid cold water. If you like swimming, be sure to choose a heated pool and warm weather. Take a shower with warm water. Do not consume cold food and drinks. Take antihistamines before exposure to cold. If your doctor prescribes an epinephrine autoinjector, always carry it with you to prevent serious reactions. If you need to have certain surgeries, talk to your surgeon about your cold allergy. The surgical team can take steps to prevent symptoms in the operating room. Cold Allergy Complications The main possible complication of cold allergies is a severe reaction that occurs after the skin area is exposed to cold. For example, when swimming in cold water. So, is it true that cold allergies can cause sinusitis? When to See a Doctor? If you experience the signs and symptoms of a cold allergy above, talk to your doctor immediately to find out the cause and get the right treatment. Seek emergency care immediately if you are suddenly exposed to a cold and experience an anaphylactic response or difficulty breathing.",

        "title": "Peanut Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What Is a Peanut Allergy? A peanut allergy is a common condition in which a person\u2019s body reacts to the proteins contained in certain nuts. Nuts that commonly cause allergic reactions include peanuts, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachios. Peanut allergies can cause severe, even life-threatening symptoms and affect a person\u2019s quality of life. A peanut allergy occurs when a person\u2019s immune system perceives the proteins in peanuts as foreign and produces chemicals that damage the body to fight the proteins. When these substances are released into the blood, they cause allergic symptoms. An allergy occurs when the body mistakenly identifies nuts as a harmful food. When you consume nuts, your immune system overreacts, causing a serious, even life-threatening response. Peanut allergies can occur in people of all ages but are most common in children. Some people can outgrow a peanut allergy, but for those who are more sensitive, a peanut allergy can cause a very severe reaction. Nuts that commonly cause allergic reactions include peanuts, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachios. Additionally, Brazil nuts, filbert nuts, Macadamia nuts, pecans, and cashews can also cause allergic reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, it is very important to provide first aid. Peanut Allergy Symptoms Peanut allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe and can occur within minutes of consuming peanuts or even hours later. Some common symptoms of a peanut allergy include: Diarrhea Difficulty breathing Skin rash Nausea and vomiting Stomach cramps Swelling, usually on the tongue or lips More severe peanut allergy symptoms such as anaphylaxis can occur within minutes of consuming peanuts. Anaphylaxis is a very severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Hard to breathe Fast and irregular heartbeat Low blood pressure Cold and pale skin Bloating, nausea, and vomiting Chest pain or discomfort in the chest Death The allergic reactions that appear in each sufferer will be different. In fact, one sufferer may have different allergic reactions when consuming different types of nuts. Risk Factors for Peanut Allergy There are several risk factors that can increase a person\u2019s risk of experiencing a peanut allergy. History of Allergies or Asthma If someone has a history of allergies or asthma, then they have a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy. People who have a history of other allergies, such as other food allergies, are also at higher risk. Family History As explained previously, if a family member has a peanut allergy, the risk of peanut allergies in other family members will increase. Age Children are at higher risk of developing peanut allergies than adults. However, adults can also experience peanut allergies, especially if they have a history of allergies or asthma. Gender Several studies have shown that men have a higher risk of developing peanut allergies than women. Ethnicity Some ethnic groups are at higher risk for developing peanut allergies than others. For example, Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans Causes of Peanut Allergies The exact cause of peanut allergy is not known for certain. However, there are several factors that are thought to play a role in the development of this condition. Genetics Peanut allergies can be passed from parents to their children. If one or both parents have a peanut allergy, their child has a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy. Immune System A peanut allergy occurs when the immune system responds to the proteins in peanuts as harmful foreign substances. The body then produces antibodies to fight these proteins, and each time these proteins enter the body, the immune system releases histamine and other chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Early Exposure to Peanuts Early exposure to peanuts can increase a child\u2019s risk of developing a peanut allergy. Several studies have shown that giving foods containing nuts to babies before the age of 6 months can increase the risk of peanut allergies in the baby. Peanut Allergy Diagnosis The diagnostic process is carried out by a specialist doctor based on the results of interviews and complaints experienced by the sufferer. The following are some supporting examinations including: Medical History The first step in diagnosing a peanut allergy is to conduct a medical interview to determine the patient\u2019s allergy history and symptoms. The doctor will ask about the patient\u2019s allergy history and whether they have had any allergic symptoms after consuming peanuts or foods containing peanuts. The doctor will also ask for information about symptoms by the patient, such as skin rashes, itching, swelling, nausea, vomiting and even difficulty breathing. Skin Test Skin testing is one of the most common methods in diagnosing peanut allergies. The skin test involves injecting a small amount of peanut protein into the patient\u2019s skin and then waiting for a reaction. If an allergic reaction occurs, the skin will become red and itchy. Blood Test Blood tests involve taking a sample of the patient\u2019s blood and testing whether they have antibodies to peanut proteins. This blood test is known as the immunoglobulin E (IgE) test and can help determine whether or not a patient has a peanut allergy. However, blood tests are not always accurate and cannot determine the severity of the allergy. Elimination and Provocation Test An elimination test involves removing nuts from the patient\u2019s diet for a period of time to see if symptoms improve. After that, the patient will be given food containing nuts and then observed to see if the symptoms reappear. An elimination test can help identify a peanut allergy, but it is not always accurate. Meanwhile, provocation tests should be performed under medical supervision and involve gradually introducing foods containing peanuts to see if the patient experiences an allergic reaction. This test can help identify the severity of the allergy and help the doctor plan the appropriate treatment. Diagnostic Tools There are also several tools that can help in the diagnosis of peanut allergies. Peanut Allergy Detector A peanut allergy detector is a device that can detect peanut proteins in food and beverages. This tool works by measuring the levels of peanut protein in food or beverage samples. If the protein content of the peanut is high, then the food may contain peanuts and could potentially cause an allergic reaction. Epinephrine Auto-Injector This is a device used to administer epinephrine injections in an emergency Peanut Allergy Symptoms Prevention To prevent the emergence of allergic reactions to nuts, here are some steps you can take: Read the packaging labels before purchasing groceries. Ask the restaurant waiter before ordering food. Do not breathe air containing peanut residue. Wear a bracelet stating if your child has a peanut allergy. Carry medications such as antihistamines with you wherever you go to treat mild allergic reactions. Carry an epinephrine shot with you wherever you go to treat severe allergic reactions. Peanut Allergy Treatment Medications can help reduce the symptoms of a peanut allergy. Here are some medications your doctor may prescribe to treat a peanut allergy: Antihistamines Antihistamines can help reduce allergy symptoms, such as itching, skin rashes, and nasal congestion. Some examples of available antihistamines are cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. Corticosteroids These compounds can help reduce inflammation and swelling caused by peanut allergies. Corticosteroids are available in pill or injection form. Some examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone. Epinephrine This compound is a drug used to treat serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. Epinephrine works by narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate, thereby helping to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, itching, and swelling.",

As a result, the immune system will react to food substances that are classified as dangerous or allergens. Even small amounts of an allergenic food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, this allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. In addition, this condition can be acute or sudden, but it can also be chronic or last for a long time. Food allergies are often confused with another health condition, food intolerance. However, they are two different health conditions. Because food intolerance is a reaction from the digestive system. It has nothing to do with antibodies like food allergies. Food Allergy Symptoms A person who experiences this condition can experience various symptoms in his body. A person can experience these symptoms with mild or high intensity depending on the amount of allergen they consume. The symptoms include: A reddish rash that appears on the surface of the skin. Itchy rash. Tingling in the oral cavity. Difficulty swallowing. Swelling of the mouth, face, and other parts of the body. Nausea and vomiting. Itchy eyes. Sneeze. Shortness of breath or labored breathing. Dizzy. Stomach ache or diarrhea. Dry, cracked, red, and itchy skin. The genital and anal areas appear reddish. Constipation. Heartburn. More frequent bowel movements. There is mucus or blood in the stool when defecating. Pale skin. Seems more fussy in babies. In addition, food allergies in some cases can cause anaphylaxis, the symptoms of which can include: Heart beats fast. Hard to breathe. Sudden anxiety and fear. Blood pressure drops drastically. Unconscious or fainting. Food Allergy Risk Factors Anyone can experience it, but there are several factors that can increase the risk, such as: 1. Family history Allergies can run in families. If a close family member has asthma or any allergic disease, including food allergies, eczema, and seasonal allergies, the person is more likely to develop the condition. 2. History of other food allergies If you already have an allergy to one food, you may be at higher risk of developing allergies to other foods. Likewise, if you have other types of allergic reactions, such as hay fever or eczema, your risk of developing a food allergy is greater. 3. Age Babies and children are more susceptible to food allergies. However, as they get older, their digestive tracts become more mature in digesting foods that can trigger allergies. 4. Gut bacteria Some studies suggest that people with peanut or seasonal allergies may have altered gut bacteria conditions. Foods That Are Prone to Causing Allergies There are several types of food that accumulate approximately 90 percent of allergies that people have. These foods also fall into the category of eight major allergens. Here are the types of food and drinks. Egg. Fish. Milk. Nuts that come from trees. Peanuts. Seafood. Soya bean. Wheat. Causes of Food Allergies Not a few people have difficulty finding the cause of their allergies. However, this condition usually occurs due to the following: 1. Immune system Antibodies are special proteins produced by the immune system to protect the body. Well, antibodies work by identifying potential dangers that threaten the body, such as bacteria and viruses. The job of antibodies is to signal the immune system to release chemicals to kill the threat and prevent the spread of infection. In the most common type of allergy, antibodies known as immunoglobulin E (IgE), mistakenly target certain proteins in food as a threat. IgE can cause several chemicals to be released, the most important of which is histamine. 2. Histamine Most of the typical symptoms that appear during an allergic reaction are due to histamine. Well, this substance can cause symptoms such as: Dilation of small blood vessels, so the skin becomes red and swollen. Affects the nerves in the skin, causing itching. Increases the amount of mucus produced in the lining of the nose which causes itching and burning sensations. In most cases, histamine release is limited to a specific part of the body, such as the mouth, throat, or skin. 3. Non-IgE mediated allergies Another type of food allergy is non-IgE-mediated food allergy, which occurs due to different cells in the immune system. This condition is much more difficult for doctors to diagnose because there is no accurate test to confirm a non-IgE-mediated food allergy. This type of reaction is mostly limited to the skin and digestive system, causing symptoms such as heartburn, indigestion, and eczema. In infants, non-IgE-mediated food allergies can also cause diarrhea and reflux, where stomach acid rises into the throat. 4. Certain foods In children, the foods that most often cause allergic reactions are eggs, milk and milk products, soy, wheat, and nuts. In adults, foods that often cause allergic reactions are nuts, fish, and seafood. Food Allergy Diagnosis To make a diagnosis, the doctor needs to ask a number of questions and perform tests. If symptoms develop rapidly, your doctor may recommend a skin prick test or blood test. However, if symptoms develop more slowly, your doctor may suggest a food elimination test. 1. Ask questions First of all, the doctor will ask you several questions about the patterns and symptoms you are experiencing, such as: How long does it take for symptoms to appear after exposure to food? How long do the symptoms last? How severe are the symptoms? Is this the first time these symptoms have occurred? If not, how often do they occur? What foods might be the culprit and how much to consume? Do you have any allergies or other allergic conditions? Is there a history of allergies in the family? Is (or is) the child breastfed or bottle-fed? In children, the doctor may need to assess the child\u2019s weight and size to ensure that their growth is appropriate for their age. 2. Skin prick test During a skin prick test, your doctor will place a drop of food extract on your arm. The skin is then pricked with a small lancet, allowing the allergen to come into contact with cells of the immune system. Itching, redness, and swelling are signs that indicate a positive reaction. The test is usually painless. 3. Blood test An alternative to the skin prick test is a blood test. This test aims to measure the amount of allergic antibodies in the blood to certain foods. To perform this test, the doctor will take a blood sample for examination in the laboratory. 4. Food elimination test In a food elimination test, a person must avoid foods that are likely to cause an allergic reaction for 2-6 weeks. The food is then reintroduced afterward. If symptoms disappear when food consumption stops, but reappear after the allergic person consumes the food, then this condition usually indicates a food allergy or intolerance. Food Allergy Complications Food allergies rarely cause serious complications. However, in severe cases, they can cause serious complications. Well, here are some food allergy complications that you need to be aware of, namely: 1. Anaphylaxis In some people, allergies can trigger a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. This condition can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, such as: Narrowing and tightening of the airways. A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in the throat that makes it difficult for a person to breathe. Shock with severe drop in blood pressure. Rapid pulse. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness, Seek medical help immediately or go to the emergency room if you or someone around you experiences the above signs. 2. Atopic dermatitis Eczema or atopic dermatitis is another complication of this allergy. This condition can cause itchy skin reactions and redness of the skin (eczema). Food Allergy Treatment The only way to completely treat an allergic reaction is to avoid the food that causes the allergy. However, there are several things you can do to ease the reaction. For mild allergic reactions, over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines can help reduce symptoms. You can take this medicine after being exposed to food that causes allergies to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines cannot treat severe allergic reactions. For severe allergic reactions, you may need an emergency epinephrine injection. If your doctor has prescribed epinephrine for you to use, you should make sure that both you and those around you understand how to operate the injection in an emergency. In addition, make sure to always have an injection ready in case you suddenly experience an allergy. Having extra, unexpired epinephrine on hand is also a good safety measure. Researchers have studied the use of oral immunotherapy as a treatment for food allergies. This therapy delivers small doses of the food you are allergic to. The doctor will ask the patient to swallow or place the food under the tongue (sublingual). Then the dose will be increased gradually under the supervision of a doctor. Food Allergy Prevention The most appropriate way to prevent allergic reactions is to know and avoid foods that cause allergies. Always read food and drink labels carefully to see if there are any ingredients that could cause allergies. If you are visiting a restaurant, ask the waiter about the ingredients on the menu that you want. The goal is to make sure there are no ingredients that can trigger allergies. If there are food and drink ingredients that can trigger allergies, ask the chef to remove them. For children, don\u2019t forget to tell the teacher or childcare staff if your little one has certain food allergies.",

        "text": "You must have seen someone whose skin and hair are white. This condition occurs because the person has albinism. This disorder occurs because the body lacks or does not have the pigment melanin. Albinism has several levels of severity, ranging from white skin and hair, thin hair, to vision problems. It can affect anyone, but the likelihood depends on the region. In Africa, albinism can affect one in every 5,000-15,000 people. In Europe and the United States, albinism can affect one in every 17,000-20,000 people. Albinism can affect both sexes equally and all races. What is Albinism? Albinism is a hereditary disease characterized by a much lower level of melanin production than normal people. Melanin is a pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color. People with albinism generally have lighter skin and hair than their family members or people around them. In addition, they may also have vision problems, which is common for them. Melanin normally protects the skin from damage caused by sunlight or ultraviolet. Therefore, someone with albinism will be more sensitive to sun exposure. In addition, people with albinism are also at risk of developing skin cancer if exposed to sunlight for too long. Facts about Albinism Here are some facts about albinism that you may not know: Although albinism is one of the safest genetic disorders a person can have, it can also cause certain health problems. The most common problem is a vision problem called ocular albinism. Certain types of albinism can be passed from mother to child and can cause serious problems, such as blindness. Even if no damage occurs, the lack of pigmentation in the eyes can cause extreme sensitivity to light and abnormal retinal development. The physical appearance of a person with albinism looks different from normal people. Generally, albino people have blue or gray eyes. Even in some cases, the eyes of sufferers of this disorder are pink or red. A person with albinism must pay more attention to their eye health because their vision is considered low. These people must use contact lenses or glasses to correct their weak vision. A person with this skin color disorder does not have the pigmentation that can protect their skin from direct exposure to sunlight. Albinism not only occurs in humans but can also occur in animals. This skin pigmentation disorder cannot be transmitted, either through blood transfusion, skin contact, or through organisms that can spread the disease. Albinism is an incurable disorder, as the root cause of the disease is genetic. However, the eye and skin problems are a result of the disorder and can be treated in the right way.",

        "title": "Alkaptonuria Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria or black urine disease is a rare disease that occurs due to a genetic mutation of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD). The HGD gene mutation that occurs causes the homogentisate oxidase enzyme to fail to work properly. This enzyme functions to break down and decompose two amino acids called tyrosine and phenylalanine. People with this disease experience a buildup of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body, causing urine and certain body parts to turn dark. This disease can occur since childhood but can go undetected until adulthood because it sometimes does not cause symptoms. This disease is quite rare because it only occurs in one in every 250,000 people in the world. There are certain countries that have more cases of this disease than other countries. However, you need to know that this disease can occur in men and women of all ages. Symptoms of Alkaptonuria The typical early symptom of too much HGA in the body is dark to black urine, which usually occurs from birth. Beyond that, symptoms of this condition can occur in almost any part of the body, from tendons, bones, nails, ears, and liver. 1. Ochronosis and ochronotic osteoarthropathy Sufferers can experience ochronosis and ochronotic osteoarthropathy in adulthood with symptoms that are slow. Ochronosis is a bluish-black patch/color due to the accumulation of HGA in certain parts of the body, such as connective tissue. These symptoms usually begin to appear in the 3rd\u20135th decade and are found in the eyes and ears, and can also be present on the skin. In addition to the occurrence of a bluish-black color in the ears, thickening can also occur, such as in the ear cartilage. 2. Joint problems Symptoms such as pain or stiffness in the joints can also occur. Initially, the pain will be felt in the lower back, then spread to the knees, waist, and shoulders. These symptoms are similar to those of osteoarthritis. In severe cases, the sufferer\u2019s cartilage can also potentially weaken and become damaged. This can lead to joint damage and the need for joint replacement surgery. 3. Accumulation of homogentisic acid This can happen to connective tissues such as ligaments, bones (arthropathy), and tendons. These tissues will become blackish, weak, and easily damaged. This can cause thickening of the tendons or inflammation (tendonitis) in sufferers. 4. Organ problems Sufferers can also experience aortic valve stenosis in the heart, kidney stones, and prostate stones. This can occur due to homogentisic acid deposits in the organs so that the organs and blood vessels harden. 5. Discoloration of eyes, skin, and nails This disease can also cause black and brown spots to appear on the whites of the eyes. In addition, the skin and nails can also change color to have bluish or blackish spots. Skin color can change throughout the body. These changes are most visible in areas that have sweat glands such as the cheeks, forehead, and armpits. Risk Factors for Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria is a hereditary disease. This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning it can be inherited when both parents have the same abnormal gene but do not have symptoms. However, if one parent is normal and the other has alkaptonuria, the child is at risk of developing alkaptonuria but without symptoms. This disease can be experienced by anyone, both men and women. However, in men, this condition is more likely to develop with quite severe symptoms. Causes of Alkaptonuria The cause of alkaptonuria is a mutation in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene. This gene functions to control the production of the homogentisate oxidase enzyme which functions to break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine in the body. In the case of alkaptonuria sufferers, this gene is malfunctioning, which causes the sufferer\u2019s body to not have enough enzymes to break down both amino acids. As a result, homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulates in the sufferer\u2019s body. Under normal conditions, if there is excess homogentisic acid it will be excreted from the body by the kidneys. However, alkaptonuria disease causes homogentisic acid to not be excreted completely, so it accumulates in various body tissues and causes symptoms of alkaptonuria. Diagnosis of Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria can usually be diagnosed based on its typical symptoms, family history, and homogentisic acid level testing. In cases of family history, the disease occurs hereditarily from the parents\u2019 genes. A person must inherit two abnormal HGD genes, one from their mother and one from their father, to develop the disease. This is so rare that the condition is considered rare. In some cases, people with alkaptonuria have bone or joint inflammation at a young age, but do not have complaints of dark urine. Homogentisic acid examination can be checked through urine examination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Another way can be done using X-ray and CT scan methods (imaging methods). This is done to determine the presence of joint, spinal, and heart valve disorders. Finally, by detecting HGD gene mutations with molecular examination. Treatment of Alkaptonuria Until now there is no treatment or therapy that can cure alkaptonuria. Because this disease occurs throughout life, the treatment is done to reduce symptoms and reduce the risk of worsening of the disease. Here are some ways to treat the disease that your doctor might recommend. 1. Nitisinone This drug can reduce the level of homogentisic acid in the body. Nitisinone can slow the rate of disease progression and its consumption needs to be with a doctor\u2019s recommendation. Nitisinone can be consumed by sufferers together with pain relievers. 2. Physiotherapy Doing physiotherapy can also be an option for people with alkaptonuria. If stable and routine, physiotherapy can build muscles and strengthen joints. Physiotherapy can also reduce the symptoms that sufferers experience. It is best to avoid strenuous activities while you are undergoing physiotherapy. You can also find out more about whether exercises such as Pilates Can Prevent Alkaptonuria. 3. Meet certain nutritional needs People with this disease should also consume foods low in tyrosine and phenylalanine protein, as well as consume ascorbic acid (vitamin C). A low-protein diet can also reduce the side effects of taking nitisinone. Complications of Alkaptonuria There are several complications that can occur due to this disease. Usually, the complications that occur are due to the severity of the disease and how long the sufferer has had this disease. The complications that can occur are: Arthritis. Heart disease. Kidney disorders. Prevention of Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria can be prevented by gene testing for every couple who are going to get married as an early detection. Especially, if one of the partners has a family history of this disease. When to See a Doctor? If you or your family have indications of symptoms or signs that point to alkaptonuria, immediately discuss it with a doctor to get the right treatment.",

        "title": "Alkalosis Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alkalosis Alkalosis is a medical condition that occurs when the pH level of human blood rises above the normal value, which is around 7.35 to 7.45. Under normal circumstances, human blood pH is well maintained in this range because it plays an important role in healthy body functions. However, when blood pH is too high, it can have negative effects on the human body. Alkalosis can be divided into two types, namely respiratory alkalosis and metabolic alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when a person hyperventilates or takes in too much oxygen. While metabolic alkalosis occurs when the body loses too much acid or produces too much bicarbonate. Symptoms of Alkalosis Minimal alkalosis can cause some unpleasant symptoms, although they are usually not serious. Some of the most common symptoms of minimal alkalosis include: Tingling and numbness in the hands and feet Unusual tiredness and fatigue Muscle cramps or spasms Headache Sleep disturbance or insomnia If the condition is not treated immediately, symptoms will get worse and can progress. These symptoms can lead to shock or even coma. Call emergency medical care immediately if someone experiences symptoms such as: Dizzy; Difficulty breathing; Confusion; Faint; Coma. Risk Factors for Alkalosis The following risk factors can increase the risk of alkalosis: Chronic lung disease; Chronic lung infection; Chronic kidney disease; Acute kidney injury; Loss of excessive fluids (dehydration) Causes of Alkalosis There are several factors that can cause alkalosis. Some of them include: Hyperventilation When someone hyperventilates, they take in too much oxygen and expel too much carbon dioxide from their body. This can cause the blood pH to rise, resulting in alkalosis. Increase consumption of alkaline foods Foods that contain a lot of alkali, such as fruits and vegetables, can increase blood pH. If someone consumes too much of these foods, it can cause alkalosis. Use of certain medications Some medications, such as diuretics and antacids, can cause the body to lose acid and lead to alkalosis. Diagnosis of Alkalosis The symptoms of this condition can be similar to other medical conditions, so it\u2019s important not to try to diagnose yourself. Make an appointment with your doctor to have a health evaluation. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. They will likely order tests to rule out other conditions. Common tests include: Urinalysis; Urine pH level test; Basic metabolic panel; Arterial blood gas analysis. Complications of Alkalosis The following are some complications that can occur in alkalosis: Paralysis Severe alkalosis can cause paralysis, which usually begins in the hands and feet. This condition results from decreased levels of calcium ions in the blood, which affects nerve and muscle function. Seizures Alkalosis can increase the likelihood of seizures. This is because high blood pH can affect nerve activity and trigger seizures. Calcium Loss Alkalosis can cause calcium loss from the bones and can affect long-term bone health. This is especially true in metabolic alkalosis, which is usually due to loss of stomach acid or the use of certain medications. Electrolyte Imbalance Disorders High pH levels can affect the electrolyte balance in the body, which can affect the function of organs and systems in the body. Alkalosis can cause disturbances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels, which can affect general health and fluid balance in the body. Heart Failure and Death Severe alkalosis can affect heart function and can lead to heart failure or death. This is especially true of severe respiratory alkalosis, which is usually the result of a serious medical condition, such as a heart attack or stroke. Treatment and Prevention of Alkalosis Treatment of alkalosis depends on the cause. In mild cases of alkalosis, treatment can be done by stopping the triggering factor, such as stopping drugs that affect the blood\u2019s pH balance. In more severe cases of alkalosis, treatment involves providing therapy aimed at restoring the blood\u2019s pH balance. One treatment for alkalosis is the administration of intravenous fluids containing sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). This therapy aims to increase chloride levels in the blood and reduce bicarbonate levels. If alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation (breathing too fast), then the treatment that can be done is to reduce the frequency and depth of breathing. This therapy can be done by calming the patient or giving sedatives. It is important to identify and treat alkalosis quickly, as it can affect the function of organs such as the heart and brain. If you experience symptoms of alkalosis such as difficulty breathing, muscle cramps, or confusion, contact your doctor immediately for proper treatment.

        "text": "Egg Allergy Egg allergy is a condition that causes an abnormal reaction from the immune system to egg protein. In this condition, the immune system recognizes eggs as a substance that can be harmful to the body. This then causes the immune system to push the body to release histamine. This is what causes allergy symptoms to appear. People with this condition can experience mild to severe symptoms. In general, egg white is the part of the egg that most often triggers allergies than the yolk. This allergy generally occurs in babies and will disappear before entering adolescence. Egg Allergy Symptoms Symptoms of this condition usually appear a few moments to a few hours after the sufferer consumes eggs or foods containing eggs. Some symptoms that appear due to this allergy are: Red rash on the skin. Itchy. Stuffy or runny nose and sneezing. Stomach cramps. Nausea and vomiting. Stomach ache. Diarrhea. Shortness of breath accompanied by wheezing. Cough. Chest pain. In rare cases, allergies to these foods can cause severe, life-threatening symptoms (anaphylaxis). Symptoms that can appear include: Rapid pulse. Swelling in the throat. Blood pressure drops drastically. Dizzy. Loss of consciousness or fainting. Egg Allergy Risk Factors There are several risk factors that make someone more susceptible to allergies, including: 1. Age Babies and children are more susceptible to allergies because their digestive tracts are not yet mature and perfect. The body\u2019s organs are also still unable to digest certain types of food properly, resulting in side effects on the body. 2. Family history Egg allergies can be hereditary. This means that someone can experience it if there are family members who are also allergic to the proteins contained in eggs. Hereditary allergies occur because certain genes are inherited from parents to children. 3. History of other allergies in the family Not only the same allergy, someone can also have a food allergy if one or both parents have other types of allergies. For example eczema, asthma, or rhinitis. This condition can affect the child\u2019s genes and cause allergies to certain foods. 4. Atopic dermatitis People with atopic dermatitis or skin inflammation are at higher risk of developing food allergies because their skin condition is already sensitive. Just like when allergies form, atopic dermatitis also appears in childhood. Causes of Egg Allergy Food allergies can occur because the body\u2019s immune system reacts more strongly than it should. In the context of foods such as eggs, the immune system identifies egg proteins as substances that are harmful to the body and not food. As a result, the body reacts by releasing histamine into the blood and causing an allergic reaction. Allergies can occur due to the egg white, the yolk, or both. In children, the most common allergy is egg white allergy. While in adults, egg yolks are more likely to cause allergies. In breastfed infants, allergies usually occur due to the mother\u2019s breast milk consuming eggs. This condition is also triggered by the imperfect digestive tract of infants and children. Egg Allergy Diagnosis You can get an egg allergy diagnosis through a complete medical examination with a doctor. In general, allergy testing can occur in several different ways, namely blood tests, physical, and consumption. Previously, the doctor will ask for a history of the disease and symptoms experienced by the sufferer, as well as a history of allergic diseases in both parents of the sufferer. Then, the doctor can do one or more tests to prove allergies. First, the doctor can perform a physical examination to see signs of allergies that appear on the sufferer\u2019s body. The doctor will place a small amount of egg protein on the surface of the sufferer\u2019s skin and observe the symptoms of allergies that arise. In addition, doctors can also give sufferers a small amount of eggs to consume so that symptoms can appear. Of course, this test is safe because the amount of allergen consumption is very small. The last option is to have a blood test to see the immune system\u2019s response to eggs by measuring the amount of antibodies in the blood. Once the patient is proven to have an allergy, the doctor will gradually advise the sufferer to eliminate eggs from their daily menu while observing the symptoms that arise. Egg Allergy Treatment Treatment for this allergy is to not consume eggs or foods containing eggs. Medicines from doctors aim to reduce the symptoms that arise. Some commonly used medicines are: 1. Antihistamine Antihistamines are a type of medication that can relieve allergy symptoms. You can use this medication after consuming eggs and feeling the symptoms. The purpose of its use is to avoid severe allergic reactions. For those with severe allergies, it is best to always have this medicine on hand to avoid serious side effects. 2. Adrenaline Not only hormones in the body, adrenaline is also an allergy reliever. Allergy sufferers can use this drug by injecting it into the skin to treat serious allergic reactions in the form of anaphylaxis. Sufferers with serious symptoms should go to the hospital immediately for further treatment. Egg Allergy Prevention The best way to prevent allergies is to not consume eggs or foods and drinks that contain eggs. Some efforts to prevent egg allergies that can be done include: Be careful about the contents of every food consumed, especially when eating out. Ask the waiter or chef about the egg content in the menu you are going to eat. Carefully read the labels on food packaging. In some cases, small amounts of egg content can also trigger allergy symptoms. For breastfeeding mothers whose babies have egg allergies, avoid consuming eggs because they can enter the breast milk that the baby will drink. Replace eggs with other commonly used substitute ingredients for food processing. Use a special bracelet or necklace for allergy sufferers when traveling outside the home. Tell your child\u2019s family or caregiver that your child has an egg allergy and explain what to do when allergy symptoms appear. Discuss with your doctor every time your child is going to be vaccinated because some vaccines, such as influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and yellow fever contain egg protein which can trigger allergic symptoms. Contact This Doctor If You Have an Egg Allergy If you experience signs and symptoms of allergies such as a red rash on the skin, itching, stuffy nose or runny nose and sneezing, or stomach cramps, after eating eggs, contact a doctor immediately. The doctor will provide consultation, advice, and treatment needed according to your condition.",

        "title": "Milk Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Milk Allergy Milk allergy is a condition in which a person\u2019s immune system reacts to cow\u2019s milk protein and its derivatives. This allergy is prone to targeting children, although some adults can also experience this allergy throughout their lives. These allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe and can affect the digestive system, skin, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. This allergy can also mean a reaction of the immune system to products derived from milk. This condition is generally prone to occur in children, especially when consuming cow\u2019s milk or its derivatives. However, it is possible that this condition can be caused by goat\u2019s milk, sheep\u2019s milk, or other mammals. The milk proteins that most often cause allergies are whey and casein. Milk Allergy Symptoms Allergy symptoms usually appear one hour after consuming milk. Symptoms include: Vomit. The breath sounds wheezy. Redness of the skin. Itchy. Swollen. Diarrhea or loose stools accompanied by blood in the stool. Stomach cramps. Cough. Runny nose. Watery eyes. Itchy red rash around the mouth. The presence of colic in babies is characterized by the baby crying non-stop and without any clear reason. Allergy symptoms usually appear within minutes to hours after consuming cow\u2019s milk products and their derivatives. However, in some cases, symptoms may appear within 24 to 48 hours. In severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) the following symptoms may occur: The airways and throat are blocked, resulting in shortness of breath. Blood pressure drops drastically. Red face and itching all over the body. First-aid measures should be taken if anaphylaxis occurs. Sufferers should immediately receive medical help at the hospital. Risk Factors Some people are at higher risk of developing allergies (susceptible) than others. Some of these include: There is a history of allergies in family members, for example asthma, eczema, rhinitis, hay fever. Babies and children are more susceptible to it because their digestive system is not yet perfect. However, this condition will improve with age and maturity of the digestive tract. There is a history of atopic dermatitis (skin inflammation originating from allergies in children). Having allergies to other foods that generally develop after the allergy occurs. Causes of Milk Allergy The main cause of this allergy is a disruption in the sufferer\u2019s immune system which incorrectly identifies the protein in milk as a substance that is harmful to the body. This triggers the immune system to produce Immunoglobulin E to neutralize the allergen and release histamine into the blood, causing allergy symptoms. Milk allergy is different from lactose intolerance. If the allergy is caused by a disorder of the immune system, while lactose intolerance occurs because the body is not yet able to accept certain substances, and has nothing to do with the sufferer\u2019s immune system. This allergy occurs when a person\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies cow\u2019s milk protein as a threat and produces antibodies to fight it. It causes allergic reactions when a person consumes cow\u2019s milk products and its derivatives. Some of the most common cow\u2019s milk proteins that cause allergies are casein and whey. Risk factors for developing this allergy include: Family history of allergies This allergy History of other food allergies Age: children are more likely to experience this allergy than adults. Digestive disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) High environmental exposure to allergens Milk Allergy Diagnosis Some steps that the doctor will take to confirm the diagnosis are as follows: Asking about the sufferer and their family\u2019s history of allergies, including what foods and drinks they have eaten, the allergy symptoms that arise, and whether the symptoms decrease or disappear when the food is stopped. Physical examination to check for indications of allergies in the sufferer\u2019s body. Blood sample testing to check the levels of Immunoglobulin E antibodies in the sufferer\u2019s blood. Test through the skin, usually by making a small wound on the surface of the sufferer\u2019s skin. The small wound on the skin will show a small amount of milk protein. If during observation a small itchy lump appears in the area, it indicates a milk allergy. Milk Allergy Complications Children who experience this condition are at greater risk of experiencing other health problems, such as: Allergies to other foods, such as eggs, soy, peanuts, or beef. Hay fever. This is a common reaction to pet dander, dust mites, grass pollen, and other substances. Milk Allergy Treatment In children, this condition will disappear with age. However, in some cases, there are children who continue to have allergies into adulthood. The most important treatment is to avoid milk and food products containing milk. Consumption of drugs to reduce allergy symptoms are: Antihistamines have the benefit of reducing discomfort due to symptoms originating from allergic reactions. Adrenaline to treat severe allergy symptoms (anaphylaxis) by injection by a doctor. Milk Allergy Prevention Avoiding allergies to milk is by not consuming milk or products containing milk or milk protein. Some products that contain milk or its proteins are butter, yogurt, pudding, cakes, ice cream, cheese, foods containing lactose or lactate, candy, chocolate, caramel, and products containing whey and casein. In breastfeeding mothers, the way to prevent cow\u2019s milk allergy in babies is to provide exclusive breastfeeding without adding formula milk or other drinks and foods during the first 6 months of the baby\u2019s life. Breast milk is considered the best food and can prevent allergies in babies. If a baby has been diagnosed with this allergy, the doctor will advise the mother not to consume cow\u2019s milk or products containing cow\u2019s milk so that the substance does not enter the baby through breast milk. If your child is not breastfed, there are several alternatives. Giving hypoallergenic formula milk, soy milk, or rice milk can be an alternative substitute to prevent symptoms. Mothers can consult a doctor if their child has symptoms and provide replacement formula milk according to the doctor\u2019s recommendations.",

        "text": "Allergies in Children Allergies are a problem with the immune system. Normally, the human body defends itself against harmful things, such as viruses or bacteria. However, sometimes the defense system violently attacks something that is actually harmless, such as dust, pollen, or mold. Allergy triggers are called allergens. When a child with allergies is exposed to that allergen, their immune system mistakenly believes it is harmful to their body. As a result, their body\u2019s defenses overreact, treating the substance as an invader and trying to fight it off. To protect the body, the immune system makes antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). These cause certain cells to release chemicals (including histamine) into the bloodstream to defend against the allergen \u201cinvader.\u201d The release of these chemicals is what causes allergic reactions. Reactions can affect the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and future exposure to the same allergen will trigger the allergic response again. Allergy Symptoms in Children Allergic reactions can occur anywhere in the body. This includes the skin, eyes, stomach lining, nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. This is where immune system cells can be found to fight germs that are inhaled, swallowed, or come into contact with the skin. Allergic reactions can cause children to experience the following symptoms: Stuffy nose, sneezing, itching, or runny nose, and itching in the ears or roof of the mouth. Red, itchy, watery eyes. Red, itchy, dry skin. Hives or itchy bumps. Itchy rash. Asthma symptoms, such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing. A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can also occur. This can cause difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, fainting, or death. Risk Factors for Allergies in Children Any child can develop allergies, but the condition is more common in children from families with a history of allergies. This is because allergies can be passed down through genes from parents to children. However, it does not mean that children who have parents with allergies will definitely experience it too. A person usually does not inherit a specific allergy, but only the possibility of having an allergy. Some children can develop the health condition, even though no family member has allergies. In addition to genetics, children who are allergic to one thing are also at high risk of developing allergies to others. Causes of Allergies in Children There are many things that can trigger allergic reactions in children. However, the most common triggers or allergens are: Tree, grass, and weed pollen. Natural rubber latex. Mold. Dust mites. Fur, urine, or oil from animal skin. Certain types of foods, such as eggs, nuts, milk. Some types of drugs. Hair. Bee sting. Pests such as cockroaches and rats. Diagnosis of Allergies in Children If your child has flu-like symptoms that last more than a week or two or has the \u2018flu\u2019 at the same time every year, take him to the doctor. The doctor will likely take your child\u2019s complete medical history and recommend allergy testing. Here are some tests that can be used to diagnose allergies in children: 1. Skin test This is the most common allergy test. A skin test measures the presence of IgE antibodies to a specific allergen (such as food, pollen, or animal dander). In this test procedure, a small amount of diluted allergen is placed on the skin. The area is pricked or scratched. If a person is allergic to the allergen, a small bump (like a mosquito bite) appears after about 15 minutes. 2. Blood test This test measures IgE antibodies to specific allergens in the blood. A blood test may be used if your child cannot have a skin test because they have a skin condition or if they are very sensitive to a particular allergen. However, a positive blood test does not always mean that the child has a specific allergy. The positive result still needs to be interpreted by a doctor who is familiar with the test and the child\u2019s medical history. 3. Challenge test This test needs to be supervised by an allergist. A small amount of the allergen will be given to the child by mouth (consumed) or inhaled. Only a challenge test can tell how severe an allergy is. A skin or blood test reaction only tells you the likelihood of some type of reaction, not how severe it is. Allergy Treatment in Children There is no cure for allergies, but you can manage the symptoms. The best way to manage them is to avoid the allergen. Parents should talk frequently with their children about allergies themselves and the reactions they may experience if they consume or come into contact with allergens. Tell all caregivers, from nurses to teachers, about your child\u2019s allergies. If avoiding allergens is not possible, your doctor can prescribe medications, including antihistamines, eye drops, and nasal sprays. In some cases, doctors recommend allergy shots (immunotherapy) to help desensitize a child to an allergen. However, this treatment is only useful for allergens such as dust, mold, pollen, animals, and insect stings. Allergy shots are not used for food allergies. Allergy Complications in Children Here are some allergy complications that can occur in children: Anaphylaxis. This is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening for a child. Asthma. If a child has allergies, they are more likely to develop asthma. This is triggered by exposure to allergens in the environment (allergy-induced asthma). Sinusitis and ear or lung infections. The risk of developing these conditions is higher if you have a cold or asthma. Allergy Prevention in Children Here are some ways that can be done to prevent allergies: Stay indoors on windy days to avoid blowing pollen around. Clean as much dust as possible in the house, especially in the child\u2019s bedroom. Use air conditioning instead of opening windows. Place the dehumidifier in a humid area of \u200b\u200byour home. But remember to clean it often. After playing outside, ask your child to immediately take a shower or bath, wash his hair, and change clothes. Avoid traveling or vacationing to places where pollen is high, such as parks, etc.",

        "text": "What is a Drug Allergy? A drug allergy is an allergic reaction of the immune system to a particular drug. The immune system misidentifies a drug as a substance that is harmful to the body. Both chemical and herbal drugs can cause allergic reactions. The immune system basically helps protect the body from disease. The immune system is designed to fight disease-causing agents, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and other harmful substances. However, in cases of drug allergies, the immune system mistakes the drug entering the body as one of the body\u2019s invaders. The body responds to the drug as a threat, so the immune system begins to make antibodies. It is a special protein programmed to attack threats. But unfortunately in this case it is a drug that is being attacked. Drug Allergy Symptoms Symptoms usually occur a few hours after taking the drug. However, symptoms can also develop gradually, not appearing immediately when first using the drug. In some cases, new symptoms appear after a few days or weeks of using the drug. Common symptoms experienced by sufferers include: Red rash or bumps on the skin. Itchy. Fever. Swollen. Shortness of breath or noisy breathing. Runny nose. Cough. Itchy and watery eyes. In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis may be accompanied by: The heart beats fast. The airways and throat narrow, making it difficult to breathe. Restless and anxious. Dizzy. Loss of consciousness or fainting. Blood pressure drops drastically. In very serious and life-threatening conditions, symptoms may be accompanied by: The skin is reddish and painful. The outer skin peels off. The skin looks blistered. Fever. The rash or blisters spread to the eyes, mouth, and genital area. If severe or very serious allergy symptoms are found, the sufferer must be rushed to the hospital immediately. Causes of Drug Allergies It\u2019s possible that you may not be aware of your initial exposure to a drug. Some evidence suggests that some drugs, such as antibiotics, may be good for the immune system in making antibodies. Some drug allergic reactions may occur through a different process. Researchers believe that some drugs may bind directly to a type of white blood cell (T cell) in the immune system. This event triggers the release of chemicals that can cause an allergic reaction the first time a person uses the drug. Allergies are also caused by the immune system incorrectly identifying a drug as a substance that is harmful to the body. As a result, the body will produce antibodies and cause allergic symptoms to arise. Some drugs that can cause allergies are: Antibiotics (for example Penicillin). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (anti-inflammatory). Aspirin. Corticosteroid creams or lotions. Anti-seizure (anticonvulsant). Autoimmune disease medications. Herbal medicines. Insulin. Vaccine. Hyperthyroidism medications. Chemotherapy drugs. Drugs for HIV and AIDS infections. Bee pollen products. Contrast materials used in imaging tests ( radiocontrast media ). Anesthetics. Drug Allergy Risk Factors Not everyone is at risk for it. Some risk factors are: Increased exposure to a drug, for example, due to repeated use, over a long period of time, or at high doses. Heredity. If a family member has an allergy to a drug, a person is at greater risk of developing it. Having other types of allergies, such as food allergies. Having allergies to other drugs, for example, someone who is allergic to penicillin will also be allergic to amoxicillin. Having certain diseases, such as HIV or Epstein-Barr virus infection. Drug Allergy Diagnosis Diagnosis is carried out through several steps, including: Travel history of drug allergies, history of other allergies, and family history of allergies. Physical examination related to allergy symptoms, including red rashes, blisters, and checking the condition of the sufferer\u2019s respiratory tract and heart. Laboratory tests include skin tests and blood tests. Drug Allergy Treatment How to manage this condition depends on how severe it is. With a severe reaction, a person should avoid the drug completely. The doctor may replace the drug with another type of anti-inflammatory drug that does not cause allergies. If someone has a mild reaction, their doctor may still prescribe it. However, it is also possible that the doctor will prescribe other medications to control allergic reactions. Certain medications can help block the immune response and reduce symptoms. These medications include: Antihistamines The body makes histamine when an allergen enters the body. The release of histamine can trigger allergy symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation. Antihistamines block the production of histamine and can calm the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Antihistamines come in the form of pills, eye drops, creams, and nasal sprays. Corticosteroids This condition can cause swelling of the airways and other serious symptoms. Corticosteroids can help reduce the inflammation that causes these problems. Bronchodilator If allergies cause wheezing or coughing, your doctor may recommend a bronchodilator. This medicine helps open the airways and makes breathing easier. Bronchodilators are available as liquids and powders for use in inhalers or nebulizers. Drug Allergy Prevention If you have a drug allergy, the best prevention is to avoid the problem drug. Steps you can take to prevent this include: Inform your doctor or healthcare provider. Make sure that the allergy is clearly identified in your medical records. Also inform other healthcare providers, such as your dentist or other medical specialists. Wear identification that shows drug allergies. This can be a medical alert bracelet that identifies allergies. This information can ensure proper care in an emergency.",

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Black Rice",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Black Rice: Black rice, also known as forbidden or purple rice, is a variety of rice that belongs to the Oryza sativa L. species. The distinctive black-purple color of black rice comes from a pigment called anthocyanin, which has powerful antioxidant properties. This deep purple-black rice variety is not only beautiful but also has a long history of being consumed by the wealthy and royalty. In ancient China, it was forbidden for all but royalty to eat black rice. However, today it is a staple in numerous cuisines around the world, due to its mild, nutty flavor, chewy texture, and nutritional benefits. There are two varieties of Oryza sativa rice, japonica and indica. Japonica is a stickier and short-grained rice that is grown in drier, upland fields, while indica is a long-grained rice that is grown in submerged, lowland fields.5 Health Benefits of Turmeric CoffeeBlack rice has a number of health benefits. The deep color of the grain is attributed to the presence of anthocyanins, which have potent antioxidant properties. These pigments help to protect cells against damage, and they can also help to reduce inflammation and the risk of cardiovascular conditions. In addition, eating black rice can help to improve heart health and overall fitness.Let us read some more health benefits of black rice below.1. Improves Heart Health: Research on black rice\u2019s impact on heart health is limited. However, many of its antioxidants, including flavonoids and anthocyanins, have been found to contribute to heart health. Flavonoids have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease and death, while anthocyanins may improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels.2. Supports Weight Loss: Black rice is a good source of protein and fiber. These nutrients can aid in weight loss by reducing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness. Early animal research suggests that anthocyanins, present in black rice, may contribute to reduced body weight and body fat percentage. While human studies on black rice\u2019s role in weight loss are limited, it is effective in promoting weight reduction when combined with brown rice.5 Health Benefits of Sparkling Water3. Promotes Eye Health: Black rice contains high amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are carotenoids that support eye health. These compounds act as antioxidants, protecting the eyes from potentially harmful free radicals. Lutein and zeaxanthin, in particular, have been shown to safeguard the retina by filtering out harmful blue light waves.4. Reduces Cancer Risk: Black rice contains anthocyanins, which have been linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, according to a review of population-based studies.

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Probiotics",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Probiotics: Probiotic supplements are live microorganisms that claim to enhance human health by altering the bacteria and other microorganisms in the digestive tract. Probiotics are found in fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, kombucha, and pickles. They are also available as dietary supplements.Although probiotics are gaining popularity due to their potential to promote digestive health and improve symptoms of certain medical conditions, they are not safe for everyone.Probiotic supplements contain high concentrations of beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts. They may contain a single or multiple strains of probiotics. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most common probiotic species in these supplements. Let us read about the health benefits of probiotics below.5 Health Benefits of Black RiceFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of probiotics.1. Maintain Microbiome: Probiotics alter the levels of microorganisms in the intestines, improving the overall composition, which is referred to as microbiome. When that composition is out of balance, doctors refer to it as dysbiosis. Probiotics can treat dysbiosis by increasing the number of beneficial bacteria and decreasing the number of harmful bacteria.2. Promote Weight Loss: It is believed that probiotics can aid in weight loss as the microbes in our gut play a vital role in breaking down food and converting it into energy. A healthy microbiome is thought to enhance calorie burning and reduce fat storage. Research has revealed differences in gut microbes between obese and lean individuals. However, studies on the effectiveness of probiotics for weight loss have yielded inconsistent findings. Some studies have shown that individuals consuming probiotics experienced greater weight and body fat loss compared to those who did not, while other studies reported no significant difference. Surprisingly, a few studies even observed weight gain among those taking probiotics.5 Health Benefits of Turmeric Coffee3. Prevents Infections: The beneficial microbes that live in different parts of our bodies help us in a variety of ways. One of the most important ways is by fighting off the more harmful types of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites that might also want to live with us. Probiotics, in theory, fight on the side of our beneficial microbes. Many probiotic products are formulated with beneficial bacteria and yeasts to prevent or recover from bacterial or yeast infections in different body parts, including atopic dermatitis of the skin, dental cavities, vaginal and urinary tract infections (UTIs), and more.4. Enhance Mental Health: Several studies have linked gut health to mood and mental health. According to researchers, probiotic supplements may play a critical role in some mental health disorders. Supplementing for 1-2 months with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains has been shown to enhance anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and memory, as per a review of human studies.5 Health Benefits of Sparkling Water5. Promote Heart Health: Probiotics may contribute to heart health by lowering LDL bad) cholesterol and blood pressure. Certain lactic acid-producing bacteria can reduce cholesterol by breaking down bile in the gut. Bile, a naturally occurring fluid primarily composed of cholesterol, aids in digestion. By breaking down bile, probiotics prevent its reabsorption in the gut, thereby reducing the amount of cholesterol that can enter the blood. High cholesterol level in the blood is one of the main reasons behind many heart issues.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Hepatitis E: Here's Everything You Need To Know",
        "text": "Hepatitis E is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). It is a waterborne disease that primarily affects the liver and is most common in regions with poor sanitation, such as parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Central America. Hepatitis E can be acute but usually does not become chronic, and in most cases, people recover fully. However, it can be dangerous for pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems. In this article, we discuss the signs, causes, and prevention tips for hepatitis E. Causes 1. Contaminated water The virus is most often spread through drinking water that has been contaminated with faeces containing the hepatitis E virus. Outbreaks typically occur in areas with poor sanitation or during natural disasters that disrupt water systems. 2. Undercooked or contaminated food In some cases, eating raw or undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish (which may carry HEV) can also transmit the virus, especially in developed countries. 3. Poor hygiene practices The virus can be transmitted through contact with an infected person's stool, such as when hygiene practices (like handwashing) are not followed after using the bathroom. 4. Blood transfusions Rarely, hepatitis E can spread through transfusions of infected blood, especially in countries where the virus is endemic. Signs Hepatitis E usually presents symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 6 weeks. While some cases may be asymptomatic (especially in children), the common signs and symptoms of hepatitis E include: Fatigue: Feeling unusually tired and weak.Jaundice: A yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by increased bilirubin levels.Dark Urine and Pale Stools: The liver's reduced ability to process bilirubin causes darker urine and pale, clay-coloured stools.Abdominal Pain: Typically felt in the upper right side of the abdomen, where the liver is located.Nausea and Vomiting: A general feeling of sickness, including loss of appetite and frequent vomiting.Fever: A mild fever may accompany other symptoms.Joint and Muscle Pain: Body aches are common during the acute phase.Enlarged Liver (Hepatomegaly): In some cases, the liver may become swollen and tender. Prevention tips Preventing hepatitis E involves proper hygiene and sanitation practices, especially in areas where the virus is prevalent. Here are some prevention strategies: Always drink clean, safe, and treated water. If you are in a region with questionable water quality, boil water before drinking, or use bottled water for drinking and cooking.Especially in areas with poor sanitation, avoid eating raw or undercooked meats (especially pork and shellfish) and fruits or vegetables that may have been washed in contaminated water.Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water, especially after using the bathroom, handling food, or coming into contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or materials.Ensure proper disposal of human waste and use appropriate sewage treatment systems to avoid contaminating water sources.In regions where hepatitis E is common, blood donations should be carefully screened for HEV.Although not widely available, a vaccine for hepatitis E (Hecolin) is licensed in China and may become more available in the future, especially in high-risk areas. Follow these prevention tips and look out for the signs and causes to reduce your risk of hepatitis E. Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Cod liver oil, a popular supplement derived from Atlantic cod fish, boasts a wealth of health benefits due to its rich content of essential nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. While similar to regular fish oil, cod liver oil stands out due to its higher vitamin D content, making it a valuable source of this often-deficient vitamin.Consuming cod liver oil may positively impact blood lipid levels, reduce inflammation, and strengthen bones. Athletes commonly use it to aid in muscle recovery.Both cod liver oil and regular fish oil are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are known for their anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects. However, cod liver oil is particularly noteworthy for its vitamin A content, crucial for immune system function, cellular growth, eye health, and reproduction.5 Health Benefits of Ridge GourdVitamin D, another abundant nutrient in cod liver oil, plays a vital role in bone health and brain development. Deficiency in vitamin D is a global concern, affecting over a billion people, and has been linked to various health issues, including bone fractures, metabolic syndrome, and potentially heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.Supplementing with cod liver oil offers a potent way to increase the intake of these essential vitamins and fatty acids, potentially providing numerous health advantages.Following are some of the impressive health benefits of cod liver oil.1. Improves Heart Health: The high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in cod liver oil helps reduce triglycerides, a type of fat in the body, and may contribute to preventing heart disease. While limited studies have specifically examined the effects of cod liver oil, numerous studies support the positive role of omega-3 fatty acids in heart health.2. Reduces Blood Lipid Levels: Cod liver oil can help balance lipid levels in the body, potentially reducing the risk of hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol. Although research specifically on cod liver oil is limited, some studies have observed a decrease in lipid levels when participants combined cod liver oil with cholesterol medications.5 Health Benefits of Probiotics3. Decreases Inflammation: Cod liver oil exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties. Vitamins A and D, both found in cod liver oil, act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, aiding in muscle recovery from soreness caused by inflammation.4. Improves Bone Health: Preserving bone health is of paramount importance as you advance in age. This is because your body starts losing bone mass after you turn 40. This can lead to fractures later in life, especially after menopause. Cod liver oil is an excellent dietary source of vitamin D and may reduce age-related bone loss. It does this by aiding your body in the absorption of calcium from the gut, which is a vital mineral for strong bones.5 Health Benefits of Black Rice5. Supports Eye Health: Over 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from vision loss, which is a serious health issue. Although there are many causes of vision loss, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma are two of the more common ones, and both can be caused by persistent inflammation. According to certain studies, glaucoma risk factors such as nerve damage and ocular pressure are decreased by omega-3 fatty acids. Cod liver oil is rich in Vitamin A, which in turn serves many health benefits. Diets rich in vitamin A may greatly reduce the risk of glaucoma and AMD compared to the low vitamin A diets. Although vitamin A is excellent for eye health, taking excessive amounts may lead to vitamin A toxicity and several associated health issues.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Alopecia Areata Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alopecia Areata Alopecia is the medical term for hair loss. One type is alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease, a condition in which the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body itself. This disease attacks hair follicles. Hair follicles are the structures where hair grows. This disease causes hair follicles on the head, face, or body to become smaller and stop producing hair, initially causing hair loss and eventually baldness if left untreated. Symptoms of Alopecia Areata Symptoms caused by alopecia areata include: Baldness in a circular pattern in one or more areas where hair used to grow, which is temporary but can also be permanent. Baldness that can spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) and even the entire body (alopecia universalis). Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, in the form of nails that change shape, have white lines with a thin and rough surface or are split. Baldness that can be accompanied by a burning or itching sensation on the scalp. Risk Factors for Alopecia Areata Various risk factors for alopecia areata include: History of the same disease in family members. Increasing age. Other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus erythematosus. Having abnormal nail color, shape, texture, or thickness. Psychological problems, such as stress, depression, anxiety, or paranoid disorders. Causes of Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system mistakenly attacks other parts of the body, in this case hair follicles. When this happens, hair growth shrinks and slows, and hair begins to fall out, often in clumps. The more hair follicles the immune system attacks, the more hair will fall out. The extent of hair loss varies. In some cases, it occurs in only a few places. However, hair loss can be more extensive. In some rare cases, a person can lose all the hair on their head (alopecia areata totalis) or their entire body (alopecia areata universalis). It is still not known for certain why the immune system attacks hair follicles. It is believed that a person\u2019s genetic makeup can be a trigger for autoimmune reactions to alopecia areata. In addition to genetics, alopecia areata can also be triggered by other autoimmune disorders. In a study found that people with a family history of alopecia areata, also have a personal history or other family members who suffer from other autoimmune disorders such as atopy. Atopy is a disorder characterized by a tendency towards hypoallergic, thyroiditis, and vitiligo. Types of Alopecia Areata There are several types of alopecia areata. Each type is characterized by the level of hair loss and other symptoms that may be experienced. Here are the types of alopecia areata: Patchy alopecia areata, the main characteristic of this type is that there are areas or patches of hair loss that only occur in certain areas of the body. Alopecia totalis occurs when hair loss affects the entire scalp. Alopecia universalis is hair loss that occurs not only in the head area but also other areas of the body. For example, the face, eyebrows, even eyelashes. Diffuse alopecia areata, this condition occurs when hair thins suddenly all over the scalp. Ophiasis alopecia is hair loss that occurs along the sides and in the lower scalp area. Diagnosis of Alopecia Areata There are several ways to diagnose alopecia areata. These include a physical examination, a medical interview, and if necessary, taking a skin biopsy sample and blood tests. Physical examination The doctor will examine the area of \u200b\u200bhair loss and the level of hair loss. In the area of \u200b\u200bhair loss, the hair will be pulled out slowly and it will be observed whether the hair comes off easily. Next, the doctor will examine the hair and follicles to see what their shape is, whether it is normal or not. Then the doctor will examine the nails. Medical interview Such as asking about current illnesses or family medical history. Performing a scalp biopsy sample The goal is to find out other causes of hair loss, such as a fungal infection called tinea capitis. During the biopsy, a small portion of the scalp is removed and then analyzed in a laboratory using a microscope. Blood test This supporting examination is performed if the patient is suspected of having an autoimmune disease. Blood tests are intended to check for abnormal antibodies, C-reactive protein levels, iron, thyroid hormones, testosterone hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Complications of Alopecia Areata Some complications of alopecia areata include: Baldness becomes permanent. Have a greater risk of developing or having a family history of asthma, allergies, and other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease and vitiligo. Psychological disorders in the form of emotional disorders due to lost self-confidence, which can develop into depression. Alopecia Areata Treatment Until now, a suitable treatment to cure alopecia areata has not been found. The treatment given aims to stimulate hair growth to grow back faster. The most common forms of alopecia areata treatment are corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs that can suppress the immune system. Most of these treatments are given through local injections, ointments, or oral medications. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that affect the body\u2019s immune system. They can be injected through the scalp or other areas. Corticosteroids can also be given as pills or applied to the skin as ointments, creams, or foams. Topical immunotherapy is a type of therapy used to treat baldness and stimulate hair growth. The treatment method is to apply chemicals to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction. If successful, this reaction can cause hair to grow back. Other medications prescribed to promote hair growth and suppress the immune system include minoxidil, anthralin, SADBE, and DCPC. While they help hair regrowth, they do not prevent new bald patches from forming. In addition to the treatment, alopecia areata sufferers are also advised to provide more protection in bald areas. Alopecia areata sufferers can use sunscreen when doing outdoor activities, or wear glasses to protect the eyes from sunlight and dirt. In addition, sufferers also need to use head protection such as hats, wigs, and scarves so that the scalp can be protected from sunlight, or to keep the scalp warm when the air is cold. Prevention of Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata cannot be prevented because the cause is unknown. This autoimmune disorder may be caused by several factors. Including family history, other autoimmune conditions, and even other skin conditions. However, there are several preventive measures that can be taken, including: Limit the use of hair care devices that risk damaging or drying out hair. Limit the use of chemicals for hair.",

        "title": "Aortic Aneurysm Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Aortic Aneurysm\n\nAn aortic aneurysm is a condition where there is a balloon-like bulge that usually occurs due to weakening of the muscles in the aorta wall.\n\nThe aorta is the largest and most important blood vessel in the human body. Its function is to distribute oxygenated blood from the heart to all parts of the body.\n\nThe aorta has thick walls so it can maintain its shape even though the blood pressure inside it is relatively high.\n\nThis wall is actually strong and thick. However, in this condition, the wall becomes weak so that it is unable to withstand blood pressure.\n\nAs a result, the wall will start to enlarge. If the wall is torn or broken, this condition can cause bleeding, and can even be fatal.\n\nSymptoms of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nSymptoms of an aortic aneurysm can vary depending on its location. For example, in the abdominal aorta, chest (thoracic) or both (thoraco-abdominal).\n\nHowever, abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common than thoracic or both locations.\n\nIn some conditions, aneurysms with small swelling or bulging usually do not show any symptoms.\n\nHowever, if it gets bigger, then the sufferer will start to feel many symptoms depending on its location. For abdominal aneurysm sufferers, the symptoms that appear are:\n\nProlonged pain in the inner or side of the abdomen.\nPain in the back.\nIt feels like a throbbing sensation around the navel.\n\nMeanwhile, the symptoms that appear if you experience a thoracic or chest aneurysm include:\n\nBreath becomes short.\nFrequent coughing.\nThe voice becomes hoarse.\nFeeling pressure and pain in the chest.\nPain in the back.\n\nFurthermore, symptoms that may appear if the aortic aneurysm tears or ruptures (dissection), namely:\n\nSevere pain that occurs suddenly in the back, chest, and abdomen.\nDifficulty breathing.\nThe body feels very weak.\nMy head felt like it was spinning.\nThe heart beats very fast.\n\nMake sure a ruptured aortic aneurysm is treated immediately. Otherwise, it can cause severe bleeding which can be fatal.\n\nRisk Factors for Aortic Aneurysm\n\nIt is important to know the risk factors for aortic aneurysm, as this condition often appears during examinations for other conditions.\n\nWell, here are the various risk factors:\n\nThe risk of aortic aneurysm tends to increase with age. Older people have a greater chance of developing an aortic aneurysm.\n\nMen are at higher risk than women. However, women who have a family history of aortic aneurysm or other risk factors are also at higher risk.\n\nSmoking is a major risk factor for developing an aortic aneurysm. The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the artery walls and weaken them.\n\nFamily history\n\nIf a family member has had an aortic aneurysm, your risk of having one may increase because there are genetic factors involved.\n\nHypertension and heart disease\n\nHigh blood pressure can damage artery walls and increase the risk of this disease.\n\nSome congenital heart defects or medical conditions that affect blood flow in the body can also increase the risk of an aortic aneurysm.\n\nHistory of infection and injury\n\nInfections in the wall of the aorta, such as endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), can cause inflammation and damage the artery wall.\n\nInjury to the chest or abdomen, such as in a car accident or other traumatic event, can cause damage to the aortic wall and trigger the formation of an aneurysm.\n\nConnective tissue disease\n\nSome diseases that affect connective tissue, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, or other connective tissue diseases, can weaken the artery walls and increase the risk of aneurysm.\n\nThis condition can increase pressure on the arteries and worsen the risk of aneurysm.\n\nIn addition, doctors usually recommend that someone with the following criteria undergo screening:\n\nAged 65 or older.\nMale gender.\nHaving a bad habit of smoking.\nHave high blood pressure.\nSuffering from high cholesterol.\nThe presence of diabetes mellitus.\nHaving a family history of aneurysms.\nHaving a genetic disorder, such as Marfan syndrome. You can read the article Marfan Syndrome for complete information on this disease.\n\nCauses of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nThe cause of an aortic aneurysm is the weakening of one part of the blood vessel, resulting in a lump that is at risk of rupturing at any time.\n\nThe exact cause of this weakening of the blood vessels can vary from person to person, ranging from blood vessel disease, injury, to uncertain conditions.\n\nThis condition is divided into two types, namely:\n\n1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs along the abdominal aorta. This type of aneurysm is the most common, accounting for about \u00be of cases.\n\nThe cause of abdominal aortic aneurysm is still uncertain, but it is likely related to atherosclerosis, smoking, high blood pressure, and genetics.\n\n2. Thoracic aortic aneurysm\n\nThoracic aortic aneurysms occur along the thoracic aorta. This type of aneurysm is less common.\n\nThis condition is usually genetically related or can occur in people born with bicuspid aortic valve conditions, Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome.\n\nOther causes that can lead to the emergence of an aortic aneurysm are high blood pressure, infection, atherosclerosis, high cholesterol, and trauma.\n\nDiagnosis of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nThe doctor will diagnose an aortic aneurysm by conducting a physical examination, medical interview, and radiological examination.\n\nDuring a physical examination, the doctor will examine the patient\u2019s heart to detect blood flow problems. Then, the doctor will examine the legs and feet.\n\n1. Medical interview\n\nAt this stage, the doctor will ask questions covering the symptoms experienced by the sufferer.\n\nFor example, when the symptoms started, whether the sufferer smokes or not, the patient\u2019s and family\u2019s medical history, and whether the patient has had a recent chest injury.\n\n2. Radiological examination\n\nThis examination has several purposes.\n\nSuch as determining the location of the aneurysm, estimating the size of the lump, how fast it is growing, finding out if there are other blood vessels that are infected, and looking for blood clots or inflammation.\n\nThese tests include ultrasound, CT SCAN or MRA, echocardiogram, and angiogram.\n\nThe ultrasound test aims to help doctors check the size of the aneurysm.\n\nAdditionally, doctors perform this test to follow any changes in the aneurysm and help measure the risk of rupture of the aneurysm.\n\n4. CT scan and MRA\n\nThe doctor will perform a computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) examination if a more detailed examination is necessary.\n\nThis examination aims to determine the relationship between the aneurysm and the renal blood vessels or other organs, as well as to see the growth of the thoracic aortic aneurysm.\n\n5. Echocardiogram\n\nAn echocardiogram is an ultrasound that is used to study the heart.\n\nIn order to diagnose a thoracic aneurysm, a person may undergo one of these procedures, either a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).\n\n6. Angiogram\n\nAn angiogram is a procedure that can help doctors determine the size of the aneurysm, check for aortic dissection or blood clots, and see if other blood vessels are involved.\n\nAortic Aneurysm Treatment\n\nThe main goal of aortic aneurysm therapy or treatment is to prevent the blood vessel from rupturing.\n\nThe doctor will look at the size and other possible risk factors in the sufferer to determine the type of therapy.\n\nHere\u2019s how to treat it based on the type of aneurysm:\n\n1. Abdominal Aneurysm\n\nSpecifically for abdominal aneurysms, doctors usually determine the choice of therapy based on their size.\n\n3-4.4 centimeters: the size is still small, so the doctor will recommend having a routine ultrasound examination every year to monitor the enlargement of the aneurysm.\n4.5\u20145.4 centimeters: medium size, so you need an ultrasound examination every three months to monitor the enlargement of the aneurysm.\n5.5 centimeters or more: size in the large category, usually requires surgery to prevent further enlargement or rupture of the aneurysm.\n\nIn addition to regular check-ups, doctors also prescribe medication to prevent or reduce the risk of a ruptured or torn aorta.\n\nSome types of drugs include:\n\nStatin drugs are used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of aortic blockage due to atherosclerosis.\nBeta-blockers are a group of drugs that help lower blood pressure by slowing the heart rate.\nAngiotensin 2 receptor blocker (ARB) drugs are used to lower blood pressure if beta blocker drugs do not provide optimal results.\n\n2. Thoracic Aneurysm\n\nMeanwhile, in thoracic aortic aneurysm, doctors provide treatment based on the size of the aneurysm, the severity of the symptoms that appear, and the risk of surgery.\n\nThoracic aortic aneurysm therapy includes:\n\nRoutine monitoring\n\nThis type of therapy is a therapeutic option for small aneurysms that are not at risk of rupture.\n\nUsually, the doctor will recommend a routine CT scan or MRI every 6 months (depending on the size of the aneurysm) to see if the aneurysm is enlarged.\n\nBecause it is potentially fatal, you also need to know what first aid is like when experiencing this condition.\n\nConventional surgery\n\nDoctors will recommend this procedure in cases where the aneurysm is large and at risk of rupture.\n\nConventional surgery is performed using general anesthesia and the installation of a special device (graft) to prevent blood flow from pressing on the aneurysm further.\n\nEndovascular surgery\n\nIt is a less invasive surgical procedure. This method uses a special tool that is inserted into the aorta through a small tear or through a catheter inserted into a leg vein.\n\nAfter the surgical procedure, the doctor will usually ask the patient to be disciplined in adopting a healthy lifestyle and diet.\n\nNot only does this habit help speed up the healing process, it also helps reduce the risk of aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\nSome of the efforts that doctors recommend include:\n\nDo not smoke.\nAvoid excessive thoughts and anxiety that can trigger stress.\nDo not do heavy physical activities, such as weight lifting.\nLimit fat intake so that blood cholesterol levels decrease.\n\nComplications of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nComplications from an aortic aneurysm can be life-threatening. Some conditions that may occur include:\n\nAortic dissection, which is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta wall. This condition causes blood to collect between the inner and middle layers of the aorta wall. As a result, the aorta can rupture or organs cannot get enough blood.\nAortic insufficiency and aortic regurgitation. Both occur when the aortic valve does not close properly because the adjacent part of the aorta is enlarged. This allows some blood to flow back into the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder, which can lead to heart failure.\nRupture of the aorta, which causes dangerous bleeding in the body and leads to shock.\nCardiac tamponade. This is compression of the heart due to increased fluid in the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart.\nKidney failure, due to lack of blood flow to the kidneys.\nLack of blood flow to the intestines, which causes inflammation and injury to the colon.\n\nAortic Aneurysm Prevention\n\nSome efforts you can try to reduce the risk of developing an aortic aneurysm are:\n\nImplement a healthy diet\n\nConsume foods that are rich in fiber, low in saturated fat, and low in salt to maintain healthy blood vessels.\n\nFruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and nuts are healthy food choices that can help maintain blood vessel elasticity.\n\nControl blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) can increase the risk of this condition. Therefore, measure your blood pressure regularly and follow your doctor\u2019s recommended guidelines for controlling your blood pressure.\n\nStop smoking\n\nSmoking can damage blood vessel walls and increase the risk of aneurysm.\n\nQuitting smoking is a very important step in maintaining healthy blood vessels and heart. This is why smokers are more susceptible to aortic aneurysm disorders.\n\nStay active\n\nExercising regularly can help maintain a healthy weight, improve blood circulation, and strengthen the heart muscle.\n\nTry to live an active lifestyle by doing physical activities that you enjoy.\n\nCholesterol control\n\nHigh cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increase the risk of aneurysms.\n\nControl cholesterol levels by eating low-cholesterol foods, exercising, and having regular check-ups.\n\nControl diabetes\n\nUncontrolled diabetes can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of this condition. Managing blood sugar levels well is an important step in preventing aneurysms.\n\nReduce stress\n\nChronic stress can negatively impact heart and blood vessel health. Find ways to reduce stress such as meditation, yoga, or enjoyable hobby activities.\n\nRoutine health checks\n\nHaving regular health checks can help detect risk factors or health conditions that require early attention.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nImmediately carry out an examination if you feel the symptoms as previously mentioned.\n\nAlso ask your doctor if you have high risk factors for this disease, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, genetics, or the bad habit of smoking.",

        "text": "Brain Aneurysm\n\nA brain aneurysm is a balloon-shaped bulge that forms in a blood vessel in the brain. At first glance, the bulge looks like a berry hanging from the brain stem. A brain aneurysm can leak or rupture and cause bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).\n\nA ruptured brain aneurysm most often occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A ruptured aneurysm is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nHowever, most cases are unruptured brain aneurysms. This condition does not cause any health problems or cause any symptoms. It is usually detected when the sufferer is undergoing an examination to diagnose another medical condition. In some cases, treatment for an unruptured brain aneurysm can prevent a future rupture.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Symptoms\n\nThe symptoms that appear are differentiated based on the severity of the disease experienced by the sufferer. The two types are unruptured brain aneurysm and ruptured brain aneurysm. Here is an explanation of each:\n\n1. Unruptured Brain Aneurysm\n\nUnruptured brain aneurysms generally do not cause symptoms in sufferers. New symptoms will appear when the size of the aneurysm gets bigger and presses on the nerve tissue in the brain. The following are symptoms experienced by sufferers of unruptured brain aneurysms:\n\nVision problems, such as vision loss or double vision.\nPain above or around the eye.\nNumbness or weakness on one side of the face.\nDifficulty speaking.\n\nLoss of balance.\nDifficulty concentrating.\nHaving problems with short-term memory.\n\n2. Ruptured Brain Aneurysm\n\nSymptoms of a ruptured brain aneurysm start with a sudden and excruciating headache. The pain is like being hit by a blunt object and feels very painful. The following are the symptoms experienced by people with a ruptured brain aneurysm:\n\nLoss of consciousness.\nConvulsions.\nFeeling sick.\nBlurred or double vision.\nSudden confusion.\nNeck feels stiff or sore.\nDecreased sensitivity to light.\nWeakness on one side of the body or a particular limb.\n\nCauses of Brain Aneurysm\n\nA brain aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. The brain requires a large blood supply. This blood supply is sent through 4 major blood vessels that run from the neck to the brain. These blood vessels divide into smaller vessels.\n\nIf you can imagine it, it is like a tree trunk that splits into branches and twigs. Most aneurysms develop at points where blood vessels divide and branch because these areas are considered weaker than other areas.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Risk Factors \n\nThere are several conditions or habits that increase a person\u2019s risk of developing a brain aneurysm. Here are some of them:\n\nSmoking. Smoking can significantly increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm. This is due to the harmful substances in tobacco smoke that damage the walls of blood vessels.\nHigh blood pressure. The risk is higher if you are a high blood pressure sufferer who is obese, consumes a lot of salt, eats less vegetables and fruits, and consumes excessive alcohol.\n\nFamily history. Having a parent, brother or sister with a history of brain aneurysm is an unavoidable risk factor.\n\nAge. The risk of developing a brain aneurysm increases with age. Most cases are diagnosed in people over the age of 40.\n\nGender. Women are at greater risk of developing a brain aneurysm than men because estrogen levels are significantly lower after menopause.\n\nWeakness in the blood vessels. In some cases, brain aneurysms are caused by a weakness in the blood vessels that is present at birth.\n\nSevere head injury. Brain aneurysms can develop after a severe brain injury, especially if blood vessels in the brain are damaged. This trigger is rare.\n\nAutosomal polycystic kidney disease. This is a genetic condition that causes many cysts to develop in the kidneys. Cysts are characterized by small, fluid-filled sacs.\n\nTissue disorders. Tissue disorders in people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan syndrome cause weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the body, including the brain.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta. This condition is characterized by a narrowing of the main artery in the body (aorta), which is present from birth. This disease is a common type of congenital heart disease.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Diagnosis \n\nThe correct step in diagnosing a brain aneurysm is to perform an examination. First of all, the sufferer will be asked about symptoms, previous illness history and family history of illness, as well as daily activities.\n\nIf there is a suspicion of a brain aneurysm, the doctor will perform a number of supporting examinations to confirm the diagnosis. Some of these supporting examinations include:\n\n1. CT Scan (A Computerized Tomography)\n\nThe patient is positioned lying down in this examination. Then the doctor will insert a contrast agent or dye into the patient\u2019s body. The goal is so that the aneurysm can be seen when the image of the brain\u2019s blood vessels is taken.\n\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\nSimilar to a CT scan, the patient will lie down. Then the doctor will scan the blood vessels in the brain. Aneurysms that are larger than 3\u20135 millimeters can be detected using an MRI or CT scan.\n\n3. Angiogram\n\nAngiogram can show weak points in blood vessels is a good test to detect aneurysms. In this test, the sufferer will be given anesthesia and a tube-like device is inserted through the blood vessels in the legs, up to the blood vessels in the head.\n\nThen, the dye will be inserted by the doctor into the blood vessels of the brain and the condition of the blood vessels will be seen on the monitor screen. If there is an aneurysm in the brain, it can be seen directly with this examination.\n\n4. Examination of Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid)\n\nThis supporting examination is carried out by taking spinal fluid using a special needle to see if there are any signs of bleeding.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Treatment\n\nBased on the stages, brain aneurysm therapy is divided into two types. In small aneurysms, which have not ruptured, and do not cause symptoms, therapy is carried out with routine observation, as well as taking preventive measures so that the aneurysm does not get bigger and rupture.\n\nSome efforts made, such as:\n\nDo not take stimulant drugs.\nNo smoking.\nMaintain normal blood pressure.\nAvoid foods that contain high fat.\nGet used to a healthy diet.\nLimit caffeine consumption.\nDo not lift heavy objects.\nLose weight with a healthy diet.\n\nSurgery is recommended if the aneurysm is at risk of rupturing. If a brain aneurysm ruptures, it is a medical emergency, and immediate surgery is required. This therapy aims to prevent blood from flowing to the site of the ruptured aneurysm. The procedures performed include:\n\n1. Surgical Clipping\n\nThis surgery is performed by opening the skull and then attaching a clamp to the ruptured aneurysm.\n\n2. Endovascular Coiling\n\nThis procedure is done by inserting a special tube (catheter) into a blood vessel in the leg until it reaches the head. Next, the doctor will install a device to close the bleeding (coil). This surgery is done without opening the skull.\n\n3. Flow Diverter Surgery\n\nThis procedure is performed if the previous two procedures are not possible. In this type of surgery, a device called a stent will be installed in the blood vessel, so that blood can flow without leaking back. All surgical procedures are therapies that can cause the risk of complications, such as brain damage or stroke.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Prevention \n\nAneurysms cannot always be prevented. However, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing an aneurysm.\n\nQuit or don\u2019t smoke.\nConsume a balanced nutritious diet and reduce salt intake.\nReduce alcohol consumption.\nMaintain ideal body weight by following a healthy diet.\nExercise regularly.\nReduce caffeine intake.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nIt is recommended to immediately check yourself when a number of the symptoms mentioned appear. The right steps can save you from potential complications. Remember, losing your life is a fatal impact that can occur.",

        "title": "Angina Pectoris Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Angina Pectoris\n\nAngina pectoris is a disease that occurs due to disruption of oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart muscle. The typical symptom of this disease is chest pain that can interfere with daily activities.\n\nThe blood supply to the heart muscle can be disrupted due to narrowing or blockage in the blood vessels. This disease can occur suddenly and can affect anyone.\n\nHowever, there are several factors that can increase the risk of angina, starting from high cholesterol levels, having diabetes, having a history of hypertension, stress, being overweight or obese, and actively smoking. A history of heart disease, and rarely exercising can also increase the risk of angina.\n\nSymptoms of Angina \n\nMost people with angina describe chest pain or pressure. Most people also describe a squeezing or tightness sensation in the chest.\n\nMeanwhile, a small number of others said the symptoms of angina felt like indigestion. However, the rest of the sufferers said it was difficult to describe angina symptoms specifically.\n\nWhen angina occurs, here are a number of symptoms that sufferers can feel, including:\n\nChest pain that can spread to the left arm, neck, jaw, and back.\nThe chest feels like it is being squeezed or pressed by a heavy object.\nHard to breathe.\nThe body feels tired.\n\nExcessive sweating.\n\nCauses of Angina\n\nIn order to function properly, the heart needs enough oxygen-rich blood. Two large vessels, called the coronary arteries, supply blood to the heart.\n\nThe main cause of angina is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries. If you look at the triggers, there are three types of angina, namely:\n\n1. Stable angina\n\nGenerally, this condition is triggered by physical activity, such as exercise. When exercising, the heart organ requires more oxygen supply from the bloodstream.\n\nHowever, these needs will not be met if there is a blockage or narrowing of the coronary vessels. Stable angina attacks can also occur due to other things, such as smoking, stress, overeating, and cold air.\n\n2. Unstable angina\n\nThis condition occurs due to fat deposits or blood clots that reduce or block blood flow to the heart.\n\nEven though the sufferer has taken medication and rested, chest pain due to unstable angina will still persist.\n\nIf not treated properly, unstable angina attacks can develop into heart attacks.\n\n3. Variant angina (Prinzmetal\u2019s sitting angina)\n\nIn this condition, there is a temporary narrowing of the heart arteries due to spasm or stiffness of the blood vessels. This type of angina can even attack people who are resting. Because this variant of angina can occur at any time.\n\nTemporary narrowing of the blood vessels causes the oxygen supply from the blood flow to the heart to decrease and chest pain occurs. Symptoms of this type of angina can be treated with medication.\n\nDiagnosis of Angina\n\nIn addition to conducting a physical examination and asking about the history of symptoms experienced by the sufferer, there are several other examinations that doctors will generally perform, such as:\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). The use of an ECG or heart recording aims to see whether the patient\u2019s blood flow is disturbed or decreased.\nEchocardiogram. This examination aims to assess the function of heart muscle contraction and heart valve function which can decrease if there is damage to the heart muscle, due to impaired blood flow or parts of the heart that do not receive enough blood flow.\nExercise Tolerance Test ( Exercise Tolerance Test ). The main purpose of this examination is to measure the heart\u2019s endurance during physical activity before angina symptoms arise.\nCardiac scintigraphy. This examination aims to determine whether blood flow in the blood vessels is disturbed.\nCoronary angiography. This examination aims to determine whether the coronary blood vessels are blocked and how severe the blockage is.\nBlood test. This type of test aims to measure the level of cardiac enzymes in the blood to determine heart damage due to a heart attack.\nChest X-ray (X-ray). This examination aims to see whether the symptoms experienced by the sufferer are due to conditions other than angina or to see if there is an enlarged heart.\nCT scan of the heart. This examination aims to determine how severe the narrowing of the heart vessels is, and whether there is an enlargement of the heart that is not very visible from the results of the chest X-ray.\n\nAngina Treatment\n\nCan angina pectoris be cured? The answer is that angina pectoris cannot be cured. But angina pectoris can be treated if the symptoms appear at any time.\n\nThe goal of angina treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms and reduce the risk of heart attack and death.\n\nThe following are options for angina treatment including:\n\n1. Sitting Wind First Aid\n\nThere are several ways you need to do immediately if you experience angina symptoms. First aid that you can do for yourself, including:\n\nStop Activities and Take a Rest Immediately\n\nIf you experience chest pain during activity, immediately stop the activity and rest, such as sitting or lying down.\n\nTaking Medicines\n\nIf symptoms do not subside after resting, take a dose of angina medication. You are advised to sit or lie down before taking the medication, as the medication can make you dizzy. Take the smallest dose you usually take. For example, a full tablet, half or even a quarter of a tablet. Here\u2019s how to use angina medication:\n\nSpray medication. Spray once under the tongue.\nTablets. Place the medicine under the tongue, but do not swallow. When symptoms stop, spit out the remaining tablet.\nWait Before Taking Additional Doses\n\nWait 5 minutes. If angina symptoms persist, take another dose, then wait another five minutes.\n\nTell the Family\n\nTell your family or closest people about your condition so they can help.\n\nContact the Nearest Hospital\n\nIf angina does not improve after 10 minutes of waiting or gets worse, immediately contact the nearest hospital for an ambulance and emergency medical treatment.\n\n2. Lifestyle changes \n\nHeart disease is a common cause of angina. Making lifestyle changes to maintain heart health is an important part of angina treatment.\n\nHere are some efforts that can be made:\n\nDon\u2019t smoke and avoid exposure to cigarette smoke. It is common knowledge that smoking is one of the habits that can increase many health problems.\nExercise and manage your weight. As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day. If you are overweight, talk to your doctor about safe weight-loss options. Ask your doctor what weight is best for you.\nChange your diet. Eat healthy foods low in salt and saturated fat, and choose healthy foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\nManage other health conditions. Diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol can cause angina. Therefore, it is important for people with these conditions to manage and monitor their conditions.\nPractice stress relief. Exercising more, practicing mindfulness, and connecting with others in a support group are some ways to reduce emotional stress.\nAvoid or limit alcohol. If you choose to drink alcohol, drink in moderation.\n\n3. Medical action \n\nMedical treatment options for angina are divided into two options, namely the use of medication and surgical procedures.\n\nUse of drugs\n\nIf lifestyle changes such as healthy eating and exercise don\u2019t improve heart health and relieve angina pain, medications may be the answer.\n\nMedications to treat angina may include:\n\nNitrates. These drugs help relax and widen blood vessels so more blood can flow to the heart. The most common form of nitrate doctors prescribe for angina is nitroglycerin.\nAspirin. This medication can reduce blood clotting, making it easier for blood to flow through narrowed heart arteries. Preventing blood clots can reduce the risk of heart attack.\nClot-preventing medications. Certain medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta), make blood platelets less likely to stick together, so your blood doesn\u2019t clot.\nBeta-blockers. Beta-blockers cause the heart to beat more slowly and with less force, which lowers blood pressure.\n\nSometimes, a non-drug option or Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) may be recommended by your doctor to improve blood flow to the heart.\n\nWith EECP, your doctor will place a blood pressure-type cuff around your calf, thigh, and pelvis.\n\nEECP requires several treatment sessions. EECP can help reduce symptoms in people with frequent, uncontrolled angina (refractory angina).\n\nOperating procedure \n\nThere are a number of surgical procedures that your doctor may recommend to treat angina, including:\n\nAngioplasty surgery. This procedure involves placing a stent in the blood vessels of the heart. This procedure is the main procedure in treating coronary artery blockages.\nBypass surgery. This procedure aims to divert blood flow so that it does not pass through blocked or damaged blood vessels by using blood vessels from other parts of the body.\n\nRecommended Medicine for Angina Pectoris\n\nThere are various choices of angina medication with a doctor\u2019s prescription that you can take, including:\n\nConcor 1.25 mg 10 Tablets. Antihypertensive drug containing bisoprolol fumarate 1.25 mg. This drug can help treat hypertension, angina, and chronic heart failure.\nZendalat 10 mg 10 Tablets. Zendalat contains nifedipine 10 mg, which can help prevent certain types of chest pain, including angina. It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.\nCardio Aspirin 100 mg 10 Tablets. Aspirin class drug that works as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet. How it works, prevents the platelet aggregation process in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina patients.\nAspilets 80 mg 10 Chewable Tablets. These chewable tablets contain acetylsalicylic acid 80 mg, which is a non-steroidal analgesic compound. You can use this medicine to treat unstable angina, as well as temporary ischemic brain attacks.\nCardicap 5 mg 10 Tablets. Antihypertensive drug Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB), which can be used as first-line treatment for hypertension, stable angina, and variant angina.\nIntervask 5 mg 10 Tablets. Contains amlodipine, a drug that works as an antihypertensive Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB). You can use this drug as a first-line treatment for variant angina and stable angina.\nAdalat Oros 30 mg 10 Tablets. Used to treat hypertension and angina. It contains nifedipine which works by relaxing the heart muscles and blood vessels so that blood flows easily and the heart load is reduced.\n\nIn addition to taking medication, angina sufferers also need to know how to provide first aid when experiencing it.\n\nPrevention of Angina\n\nAngina pectoris is a condition that you can prevent. There are several preventive measures you can take, including:\n\nExercise regularly. If you want to know when is the right time to exercise.\nEat heart-healthy foods.\nAvoid foods that are harmful to the heart.\nMaintain ideal body weight.\nLimit consumption of alcoholic beverages.\nQuit smoking.\n\nAngina Complications\n\nChest pain that occurs with angina can make everyday activities uncomfortable. However, one of the most dangerous complications is a heart attack.\n\nWarning signs and symptoms of a heart attack include:\n\nA feeling of pressure, fullness, or squeezing pain in the middle of the chest, lasting more than a few minutes.\nThe pain spreads beyond the chest to the shoulders, arms, back, or even to the teeth and jaw.\n\nIncreased episodes of chest pain.\nNausea and vomiting.\nContinuous pain in the upper abdominal area.\nHard to breathe.",
