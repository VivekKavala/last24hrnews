The top court stated that the NCLAT disregarded the Court’s January 2023 order by allowing the adjustment of a Rs 150 crore performance bank guarantee (PBG) against an infusion requirement of Rs 350 crore from the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium (JKC), Jet Airways’ resolution applicant.The Naresh Goyal-led airline, which was once India's premiere airline, has been grounded since 2019. Later, NCLAT had approved the transfer of Jet's ownership rights to a consortium of UK's Kalrock Capital and United Arab Emirates-based entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan .The apex court today noted that liquidation will be in the best interest of its lenders and employees as Jalan-Kalrock Consortium failed to implement the resolution plan, five years since its approval.Further, the bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra directed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai to take steps for appointment of liquidator.The Supreme Court pronounced its judgment on a batch of appeals including one by lenders against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's order approving the takeover of Jet Airways (India) Ltd. by the JKC.The lenders, led by State Bank of India, have argued that the consortium has failed to meet the conditions for the takeover of the airline and is no longer in a position to revive the airline.Jet Airways Liquidation: What SC saidJustice Pardiwala said that the litigation surrounding the airline was “an eye-opener” with numerous lessons for India’s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).The Supreme Court today found the NCLAT’s judgment perverse, noting that it misread material evidence and disregarded legal principles. It said that the bank guarantee was meant to stay active until the conclusion of the insolvency process. Consequently, the Supreme Court noted JKC’s failure to infuse the promised funds of Rs 350 crore, which makes enough grounds for Jet Airways’ fate towards liquidation.The court also permitted lenders to encash PBG of Rs 150 crore.The top court was to decide whether to uphold the takeover of Jet Airways, making it the first-ever successful completion of a bankruptcy resolution of an airline in India, or liquidate the airline, a prayer made by the lenders.\", 'summary': \"The Supreme Court has ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, rejecting a takeover bid by Kalrock Capital and Murari Lal Jalan.

The court emphasized the “peculiar and alarming” circumstances of the case and pointed to the improper execution of the resolution plan.\\n\\nCourt Criticizes Tribunal for Approving Plan Without Full Payments\\n\\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the transfer of ownership to the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium (JKC) without fulfilling its financial obligations was unacceptable. The creditors, including major banks like State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB), had appealed the decision, arguing that the consortium had failed to pay an initial ₹350 crore as part of the approved resolution plan. Despite this, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had previously upheld the resolution plan in March.\\n\\nLiquidation Seen as Best Option for Creditors and Stakeholders\\n\\nThe Court underscored that liquidation should be a last resort for creditors, but with the resolution plan now deemed unviable, it ruled that liquidation would be the best course of action. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, along with Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, highlighted that the interests of creditors, employees, and other stakeholders needed to be prioritized. In their ruling, they said, “Liquidation must be available to lenders as a last resort… since resolution plan is no longer capable of implementation.”\\n\\n₹200 Crore Infused by JKC to Be Forfeited\\n\\nThe Court’s decision also included the forfeiture of the ₹200 crore that was already infused into Jet Airways by the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium. Additionally, the NCLAT’s Mumbai Bench has been directed to appoint a liquidator to oversee the winding-up process.\\n\\nTimeline of Events: Jet Airways and the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium\\n\\nJet Airways, once a prominent airline in India, was grounded in April 2019. After a prolonged battle, the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium, led by Murari Jalan and Florian Fritsch, secured the bid for ownership in 2021. However, since then, multiple legal and financial hurdles have delayed the execution of the resolution plan, leading to its eventual failure to meet the required payments.\\n\\nNCLAT’s Role in Controversial Decision\\n\\nThe NCLAT’s controversial decision in March to approve the transfer of ownership was challenged after JKC failed to make the agreed payments. Initially, JKC was required to pay ₹4,783 crore as part of the plan, but only ₹200 crore was paid, which the court ruled insufficient to sustain the plan’s implementation.\\n\\nPlea for Escrow Account Withdrawn by JKC\\n\\nIn May, JKC sought permission from the NCLAT to place the ₹200 crore into an escrow account for further use. However, this plea was withdrawn after the tribunal denied the request, citing the ongoing Supreme Court hearing. This withdrawal marked a significant moment in the legal battle.\\n\\nFinancial Delays Continue at Jet Airways\\n\\nIn addition to the legal challenges, Jet Airways faced significant financial delays. In May 2023, the airline announced a delay in releasing its financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ending March 2023. The monitoring committee set up to oversee the resolution plan’s implementation also faced obstacles, further complicating the airline’s revival efforts.\\n\\nALSO READ: Election Commission Reschedules By-Polls in Kerala, Punjab, And Uttar Pradesh To Boost Voter Turnout', 'summary': \"In a landmark decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court of India invoked its powers under Article 142 to overturn a tribunal's ruling and order the liquidation of Jet Airways, after the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium failed to fully pay creditors.\\n\\n\\nThe post Supreme Court Orders Liquidation Of Jet Airways, Citing &#8216;Extraordinary&#8217; Circumstances appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/supreme-court-orders-liquidation-of-jet-airways-citing-extraordinary-circumstances/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Supreme-Court-Orders-Liquidation-Of-Jet-Airways.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 08:12:31', 'author': 'Prateek Levi', 'authors': ['Prateek Levi'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.328}, {'id': 263254864, 'title': 'Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors', 'text': 'Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, invoking its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. This decision sets aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) order that allowed the airline’s ownership transfer to the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium (JKC) without full payment to creditors.\\n\\nThe court cited “peculiar and alarming” circumstances around the unresolved financial obligations and concluded that liquidation was the only viable path to achieving justice for all stakeholders. According to the bench, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, “Liquidation must be available to lenders as a last resort… since the resolution plan is no longer capable of implementation.”\\n\\nNon-Payment Prompts Liquidation Order\\n\\nThe NCLAT had previously upheld the resolution plan on March 12, clearing the ownership transfer of Jet Airways to JKC. However, this was challenged by creditors, including the State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB), following JKC’s alleged failure to pay the initial ₹350 crore required by the resolution plan. Overall, JKC had committed to a total payment of ₹4,783 crore, but incomplete payment led to prolonged delays in the plan’s implementation.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the ₹200 crore already invested by JKC would be forfeited and ordered the NCLT’s Mumbai bench to appoint a liquidator immediately to begin the liquidation process for Jet Airways.\\n\\nIssues with the NCLAT’s Resolution Decision\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling underscored a strong disapproval of the NCLAT’s decision to proceed with the ownership transfer despite the incomplete payments by JKC. The judgment highlighted that Article 142—allowing the Court to make any order for “complete justice”—was invoked due to the “flagrant disregard” shown by the NCLAT in enforcing the original conditions.\\n\\nAccording to the Court, the NCLAT’s decision went against established legal principles and compromised creditors’ rights by enabling JKC’s partial fulfillment of the payment obligations. The court further observed that “the resolution plan’s non-implementation now necessitates liquidation as a measure to uphold creditors’ rights and ensure proper compensation to the workers and stakeholders involved.”\\n\\nJKC’s Withdrawal from Escrow Proposal\\n\\nThe Jalan-Kalrock Consortium had previously sought permission from the NCLAT to transfer ₹200 crore into an escrow account to facilitate the payment process. However, this proposal was withdrawn in May after the tribunal declined relief, noting that the matter was already under Supreme Court consideration.\\n\\nJet Airways, once a prominent player in India’s aviation sector, has been grounded since April 2019. In 2021, JKC, a consortium led by UAE-based businessman Murari Jalan and Florian Fritsch of Kalrock Capital Partners, won the bid for Jet Airways. A monitoring committee was subsequently established to oversee the resolution plan’s execution, but financial complications and legal delays impeded the process.\\n\\nFuture of Jet Airways and Stakeholder Implications\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways marks a significant chapter in India’s aviation industry. The Supreme Court’s directive aims to settle long-standing financial grievances, ensuring creditors, including SBI and PNB, receive their due payments. Additionally, the forfeited ₹200 crore and Performance Bank Guarantee of ₹150 crore from JKC could help lenders recover part of the airline’s unpaid debts.\\n\\nThis liquidation order also raises questions for Jet Airways’ employees and other stakeholders, who had hoped for the airline’s revival. The Supreme Court’s decision emphasizes the need for adherence to resolution plans and the financial protection of creditors, signaling a firm stance against lapses in payment obligations.\\n\\nALSO READ: Indian Railways Achieves Historic Milestone By Transporting 3 Crore Passengers In A Single Day', 'summary': 'Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, invoking its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.\\n\\n\\nThe post Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/jet-airways-faces-liquidation-as-supreme-court-invokes-article-142-what-it-means-for-creditors/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jet-Airways.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 08:28:21', 'author': 'Chief Justice Dy,Lavanya R', 'authors': ['Chief Justice Dy', 'Lavanya R'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.378}, {'id': 263256884, 'title': 'SC orders liquidation of Jet Airways', 'text': 'New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered liquidation of cash-strapped Jet Airways, saying that the resolution plan, approved five years ago, is no longer capable of implementation.\\n\\nA Bench headed by CJI, D.Y.

The court's decision came in response to a plea by the lenders, who were against the transfer of ownership of the grounded airline to Jalan Kalrock Consortium (JKC). The bench, which also included Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj, exercised its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, a provision that allows the court to pass such orders as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it. The court's ruling has far-reaching implications. It has ordered the forfeiture of Rs 200 crore that had been infused by JKC and directed the lenders to invoke a Rs 150 crore Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG). The Committee of Creditors (CoC), led by the State Bank of India, had argued before the apex court that the proposed revival plan was not in the best interest of the lenders. They questioned the order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that had upheld the resolution plan. Earlier this year, in January, the Supreme Court had ordered JKC, the successful resolution professional bidder for the cash-strapped airline, to deposit Rs 150 crore in an Escrow account jointly held by the State Bank of India and JKC. The court had warned of legal consequences if JKC failed to furnish the bank guarantee. The court had also asked the NCLAT to decide by the end of March 2024 on the lenders' plea challenging the ownership of the grounded Airways to JKC. The consortium had committed to an infusion of Rs 350 crore equity as per the court-approved resolution plan to assume ownership of Jet Airways. A three-member bench of the NCLAT had agreed to an adjustment of Rs 150 crore from the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) towards the payment of Rs 350 crore. Jet Airways, once one of India's largest and most popular airlines, had entered the corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in June 2019 due to severe financial distress. The NCLAT had directed the Jet Airways monitoring committee to complete the transfer of ownership within 90 days. However, the consortium was four years behind on its payment schedule at the moment. The bench questioned the compliance and merits of the consortium's performance under the resolution plan. It sought a clarification on why the consortium had not complied with the court's previous directives, specifically the infusion of funds in cash and the execution of the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG). Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the consortium, argued that the revival of Jet Airways was a commercial endeavour, subject to various external factors and the consortium cannot be held solely responsible for delays caused by security clearances and other procedural hurdles. Despite the setbacks, the consortium had remained committed to reviving the airline. They had infused Rs 350 crore into Jet Airways and were determined to re-establish the operations of the airline up and running in 2024.\", 'summary': 'The Supreme Court has ordered the liquidation of the beleaguered airline Jet Airways.

The merger, which aims to consolidate Air India and Vistara into one of India’s largest airlines, could face both opportunities and challenges as the industry undergoes a major transformation. With Jet Airways now out of the competitive field, the landscape is shifting, and the merged entity will need to navigate this changing environment carefully to emerge as the dominant force in the Indian aviation market.\\n\\nReduced Competition: Opportunities For Air India-Vistara\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways removes a key competitor from the domestic airline industry, which will likely have a significant impact on market dynamics. Once a major player in both domestic and international flights, Jet Airways’ removal will reduce the number of airlines competing for the same routes and market share. This opens up space for the merged Air India-Vistara entity to capture a larger share of both domestic and international travelers.\\n\\nWith the combined resources of Air India and Vistara, this larger entity will have a strengthened capacity to expand its routes, provide more frequent services, and offer enhanced customer experiences. It will now have the chance to dominate the full-service airline space, especially on long-haul international routes where Jet Airways had once competed aggressively.\\n\\nHowever, while the reduced competition could be seen as an advantage for the merged airline, there is also a risk of overconsolidation. If Air India and Vistara monopolize too many routes, it could reduce consumer choices and increase ticket prices. Regulatory oversight will be crucial in ensuring that the merger does not lead to anti-competitive practices.\\n\\nAir India-Vistara Merger: Operational Synergies And Challenges\\n\\nAs Air India and Vistara move toward integration, the liquidation of Jet Airways removes a significant player that might have otherwise competed for certain routes, fleets, and airport slots. For the new entity, this could simplify the operational landscape in terms of managing air traffic, especially when it comes to resource allocation such as gates, slots, and airspace rights.\\n\\nHowever, the integration process itself will still pose challenges. Merging the operations of two airlines, each with its own fleet, systems, and operational protocols, is never a straightforward task. The airlines will need to address complex issues related to fleet management, staff integration, and technology unification. For example, Air India’s older fleet could be supplemented by Vistara’s newer, more modern aircraft, but this will require careful management to ensure that the combined airline has a fleet that is both competitive and efficient.\\n\\nMoreover, both Air India and Vistara operate in different segments of the market, with Vistara being known for its premium services and Air India having a wider, more budget-conscious customer base. Merging these brands into a cohesive unit will require a clear strategy that addresses the needs of both premium and economy passengers, with seamless transitions between the two offerings.\\n\\n Frequent Flyer Program Integration: Club Vistara and Flying Returns\\n\\nA key aspect of the Air India-Vistara merger is the integration of their respective frequent flyer programs: Club Vistara (CV) and Flying Returns. As part of the merger, members of both programs will see their points transferred to Flying Returns, ensuring a smooth transition for loyal customers.\\n\\nFor frequent flyers, this means that all Club Vistara points will be converted to Flying Returns points on a 1:1 basis. Importantly, these points will not lose value during the transfer, and any points due to expire will remain valid for at least one year after the migration. Additionally, existing tier statuses (Silver, Gold, Platinum) will be retained, so flyers won’t lose any benefits associated with their loyalty status.\\n\\nPerhaps most beneficial is the fact that the points from both Club Vistara and Flying Returns will be combined to determine the member’s final tier status. This could lead to an upgrade for some frequent flyers, especially if their combined points from both programs push them over the threshold for a higher tier. For instance, if a member has a significant balance of points in both programs, they could see themselves moved up to a higher tier such as Platinum from Gold, further increasing their access to premium benefits such as priority boarding, lounge access, and reward flights.\\n\\nMoreover, unused upgrade vouchers and complimentary flight tickets from Club Vistara will also be transferred to Flying Returns. These vouchers will retain their validity, but they will now be usable on the expanded route network of the merged airline, which will likely cover more destinations and offer greater flexibility.\\n\\n Financial and Operational Impact: Jet Airways Liquidation\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways could have a significant financial and operational impact on the aviation sector. Jet Airways, once a major competitor to Air India, had been grounded in April 2019 due to financial insolvency and had been undergoing a resolution process ever since. However, its failure to meet the conditions laid out in the resolution plan, including non-payment of dues, led the Supreme Court to invoke its powers under Article 142 to liquidate the airline.\\n\\nFrom a financial perspective, the liquidation of Jet Airways opens up space for Air India and Vistara to capture more customers, expand their services, and gain market share. This is particularly true on international routes where Jet Airways had been a major player. With Jet Airways now out of the picture, the merged Air India-Vistara entity will be in a stronger position to negotiate bilateral agreements with foreign governments and expand its footprint globally.\\n\\nHowever, the financial strain caused by the liquidation may also lead to some turbulence in the market. Jet Airways had a significant amount of debt, and the liquidation process is expected to result in the loss of jobs, as well as challenges for creditors. While the merger between Air India and Vistara is financially backed by the Indian government, there will still be operational costs associated with absorbing Jet’s market share and integrating additional resources, such as aircraft and airport slots, into the merged airline’s fleet.\\n\\nLegal and Regulatory Considerations for the Merger\\n\\nThe merger between Air India and Vistara, along with the liquidation of Jet Airways, is likely to come under the scrutiny of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and other regulatory bodies. The CCI will assess whether the merger would result in a monopoly in certain sectors, particularly on lucrative international routes, and whether it would reduce consumer choice or increase prices.\\n\\nAt the same time, the liquidation of Jet Airways, which had been part of a long legal process, could also lead to changes in how regulatory authorities manage the restructuring and dissolution of airlines in the future. As the aviation sector adjusts to these changes, regulatory bodies will need to balance the need for consolidation with ensuring that the market remains competitive and accessible to consumers.\\n\\nLong-Term Implications: Creating a Dominant National Carrier\\n\\nWith Jet Airways now in liquidation and Air India and Vistara set to merge, the Indian aviation market is on the brink of a new era. The combined entity of Air India and Vistara will be well-positioned to take advantage of India’s growing travel market, both domestically and internationally.\\n\\nIn the long term, the merger could lead to the emergence of a dominant national carrier that could rival other international airlines. With a larger fleet, an expanded network, and a more cohesive service offering, Air India-Vistara could become a force to be reckoned with in global aviation. However, the success of the merger will depend on how well the airline manages the integration process, retains customer loyalty, and adapts to the rapidly evolving landscape of the aviation industry.\\n\\n A New Chapter for India’s Aviation Sector\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways and the merger of Air India and Vistara are both transformative events in the Indian aviation industry. While the Jet Airways liquidation removes a major competitor, the combined force of Air India and Vistara presents a unique opportunity to reshape the airline market, offering better service, more extensive networks, and improved loyalty benefits for passengers.\\n\\nFrequent flyers can look forward to the benefits of tier retention, the extended validity of their points, and the potential for upgrades. However, the industry will need to watch how the integration process unfolds, as operational challenges, regulatory scrutiny, and financial considerations continue to shape the future of India’s aviation sector. In the end, if the merger is successful, it could pave the way for India to have one of the world’s most competitive and customer-centric airlines.\\n\\nRead More : Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors', 'summary': 'The recent Supreme Court ruling to liquidate Jet Airways has profound consequences for India’s aviation landscape, particularly in the context of the ongoing merger between Air India and Vistara.\\n\\n\\nThe post Impact Of Jet Airways Liquidation On Air India-Vistara Merger appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/impact-of-jet-airways-liquidation-on-air-india-vistara-merger/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Air-India-Vistara-Merger.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 09:42:39', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.144}, {'id': 263274044, 'title': 'Supreme Court orders liquidation of Jet Airways', 'text': 'New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered liquidation of cash-strapped Jet Airways, saying that the resolution plan, approved five years ago, is no longer capable of implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bench, headed by CJI D.Y.

Another similar liquidation of airlines took place on November 7, 2024. The Supreme Court of India on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, highlighting the ongoing struggles in the Indian aviation market. This marks the culmination of an intense period of financial instability, fierce competition, and operational challenges.\\n\\nThe Jet Airways Liquidation\\n\\nThe recent decision by the Supreme Court to liquidate Jet Airways is a significant moment in the country’s aviation history. Jet Airways, which once held a dominant position in the Indian airline industry, ceased operations in April 2019 after struggling with mounting debts, poor financial health, and intense competition from low-cost carriers. Despite efforts to revive the airline under a new management consortium, the process encountered numerous setbacks. This led to the latest Supreme Court judgment in November 2024, which pointed out that the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had not adhered to earlier rulings by the top court. Jet Airways’ closure has now been confirmed as a permanent shutdown, ending a historic chapter in Indian aviation\\u200b.\\n\\nThe Decline of Indian Airlines: A Pattern of Struggles\\n\\nJet Airways is far from the only major airline in India to succumb to financial failure. The timeline of Indian airline collapses reveals a pattern of operational challenges, mounting debts, high fuel prices, and market mismanagement, often exacerbated by fierce competition and a low-cost pricing war.\\n\\n1. Kingfisher Airlines (2005–2012)\\n\\nFounded by businessman Vijay Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines once promised to revolutionize the Indian aviation industry with its luxury offerings. However, Kingfisher quickly became a symbol of airline failure. The airline’s high operating costs, massive debt, and unsuccessful merger with Air Deccan in 2007 led to its eventual closure in 2012. Despite enjoying a large market share at its peak, the airline was unable to recover from continuous financial losses\\u200b.\\n\\n2. Paramount Airways (2005–2010)\\n\\nParamount Airways, a regional carrier operating out of Chennai, aimed to serve business travelers with its fleet of new-generation Embraer aircraft. However, the airline struggled with high operational costs and an unsustainable business model. Despite initial success, Paramount shut down in 2010 due to mounting debts and an inability to expand its fleet\\u200b.\\n\\n3. Air Deccan (2003–2007)\\n\\nAir Deccan, India’s first low-cost carrier, revolutionized air travel by making it affordable for the masses. However, its rapid expansion led to operational inefficiencies, and the airline was unable to generate consistent profits. In 2007, it merged with Kingfisher Airlines, but the combined entity continued to face financial difficulties, leading to the eventual downfall of both\\u200b.\\n\\n4. Air India and Indian Airlines Merger (2007)\\n\\nAir India and Indian Airlines were merged in 2007, but the consolidation did not bring the expected financial stability. While Air India continued to operate, its combined operations were plagued with inefficiency, mismanagement, and rising operational costs. In recent years, Air India was privatized under Tata Group, signaling a new era for the carrier, though the merger of Indian Airlines remains a classic example of how consolidation doesn’t always guarantee success\\u200b.\\n\\n5. GoFirst (2023)\\n\\nGoFirst (formerly GoAir), owned by the Wadia Group, filed for bankruptcy in May 2023 due to mounting debts and the grounding of half its fleet, which was caused by delays in engine deliveries from Pratt and Whitney. Despite a strong customer base and a considerable share in the low-cost segment, GoFirst struggled to remain profitable amid the volatile aviation market and high operating costs\\u200b.\\n\\n6. Other Regional Airlines\\n\\nA number of regional airlines have also shut down in recent years, including:\\n\\nAir Mantra (2012-2013), which ceased operations after a short stint due to low passenger bookings\\u200b.\\nAir Pegasus (2015-2016), which collapsed under financial strain despite initially operating in regional markets\\u200b.\\nAir Costa (2013-2017), which also faced operational difficulties leading to its shutdown after four years of operation\\u200b.\\nAir Carnival (2016-2017), which halted services after facing financial turmoil\\u200b.\\n\\nWhy Do So Many Airlines Fail in India?\\n\\nThe frequent collapse of airlines in India can be attributed to several interconnected factors:\\n\\n1. High Operational Costs\\n\\nFuel prices, taxes, and maintenance costs have always been major issues for Indian airlines. The volatility in fuel prices, especially during periods of global instability, has a disproportionate impact on airline economics. Airlines like GoFirst, which were grounded due to engine delays, also face high maintenance and leasing costs that can break the bank\\u200b.\\n\\n2. Intense Competition\\n\\nIndia’s aviation market is fiercely competitive, with numerous low-cost carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet, and AirAsia India providing low fares. This has led to price wars that make it difficult for legacy airlines to maintain profitability\\u200b.\\n\\n3. Debt and Mismanagement\\n\\nMany airlines, especially the older ones like Kingfisher, Jet Airways, and Air India, accumulated massive debts over time. Poor financial management and lack of strategic planning often led to their downfall\\u200b.\\n\\n4. Economic Instability\\n\\nIndian airlines are also vulnerable to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, changes in government policy, and fluctuating currency exchange rates. The falling value of the rupee, for example, increases the cost of importing aircraft and spare parts\\u200b\\n\\nA Grim Future or Room for Recovery?\\n\\nDespite the numerous collapses, India’s aviation market remains one of the fastest-growing in the world. However, with intense competition, high costs, and frequent financial struggles, only those airlines with robust business models and efficient management seem to survive. The collapse of major carriers like Jet Airways and Kingfisher serves as a cautionary tale for those looking to enter the aviation sector, particularly in a market that is still developing despite its vast potential\\u200b\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Indian aviation sector has experienced significant turbulence over the past 15 years, with over a dozen airlines collapsing due to a mix of financial mismanagement, stiff competition, and operational challenges. Whether new carriers can avoid the mistakes of the past remains to be seen, but for now, it’s clear that only the fittest survive in India’s skies.', 'summary': 'The Supreme Court of India on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, highlighting the ongoing struggles in the Indian aviation market\\n\\n\\nThe post SC Orders Liquidation Of Jet Airways; How Many Indian Airlines Have Collapsed in the Past 15 Years?

According to the notification, farmers having an area of land of less than two acres will pay an environmental compensation of Rs 5,000.\\nHowever, the penalty has been increased to Rs 10,000 for farmers having an area of land of two acres or more but less than five acres, and to Rs 30,000 for farmers having an area of land of more than five acres.

Majority of cases were reported from Punjab (5041), followed by Haryana (888), Uttar Pradesh (1544), Delhi (12), Rajasthan (1332) and Madhya Pradesh (3697).

Another consular camp in Brampton was targeted by anti-India protesters, causing significant disturbances. Despite these challenges, over 1,000 life certificates were successfully issued to applicants, indicating the Consulate’s determination to continue its services to the Indian community.\\n\\nSimilar anti-India disruptions were also reported at consular camps in Vancouver and Surrey on November 2 and 3, underscoring the persistent efforts to obstruct routine consular work. These incidents are part of a broader pattern of rising hostility against India and its representatives in Canada, particularly in relation to the growing influence of Khalistani extremism.\\n\\nAlarm Over the Growing Threat of Khalistani Extremism\\n\\nThe increasing frequency of such violent disruptions has alarmed many within Canada’s Hindu community. In response, prominent Hindu organizations, including the Canadian National Council of Hindus (CNCH), the Hindu Federation, and leaders from local temples, have issued a directive calling for greater accountability from Canadian politicians. The directive explicitly prohibits the use of temple facilities for political purposes unless those politicians demonstrate “concrete efforts” to address the rising threat posed by Khalistani extremism in the country.\\n\\nThe directive reflects a growing sense of insecurity within Canada’s Hindu community, which feels increasingly vulnerable in light of the rise of Khalistani separatist activities and the growing influence of extremist elements. The organizations have called on politicians to take a more proactive stance in tackling these issues, rather than allowing religious intolerance and violence to proliferate.\\n\\nThere is also mounting frustration with the Canadian government’s handling of the issue. Critics argue that under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s leadership, Canada has failed to adequately address the growing threat posed by Khalistani separatism and its violent manifestations. The issue has been a point of contention between India and Canada, with India repeatedly raising concerns about the safety of its citizens and the protection of its cultural institutions in Canada.\\n\\nIndia’s Continued Advocacy for Its Citizens’ Safety\\n\\nDespite the ongoing security challenges, India has remained steadfast in its commitment to ensuring the safety of its nationals in Canada. Both the Consulate General of India in Toronto and the High Commission of India in Ottawa have emphasized their determination to continue offering consular services, including life certificates and other essential documentation, to the Indian community, regardless of the ongoing threats. The Indian government has called on Canadian authorities to take stronger action against the perpetrators of these violent acts and to provide greater protection to places of worship and community centers.\\n\\nThe violence and disruption at consular camps are symptomatic of a larger issue that has been growing in Canada: the increasing radicalization and influence of Khalistani extremism. As incidents like these continue to occur, India’s concerns about the safety of its citizens in Canada are expected to grow. Indian officials are likely to continue pressing the Canadian government for stronger action to curb these acts of violence and ensure the protection of Hindu religious institutions and individuals.\\n\\nRising Tensions Amid Political and Religious Divisions\\n\\nThe ongoing disturbances in Canada have sparked significant debate about the role of Khalistani extremism in the country and its impact on the broader Indian diaspora. As tensions rise, the relationship between India and Canada continues to be tested. The Indian government has made it clear that it will continue to advocate for the safety and security of its citizens, even as the situation in Canada becomes more complex.\\n\\nThe issue is not only one of security but also one of political and religious divisions, with certain segments of Canada’s Sikh population supporting the Khalistani cause while others, including the broader Hindu community, express concern over the increasing radicalization. The growing divide underscores the challenges faced by the Canadian government in balancing religious freedom with national security concerns.\\n\\nAs this situation continues to unfold, the Indian government will likely continue to urge its Canadian counterparts to take a stronger stance against Khalistani extremism and work towards a safer and more secure environment for all communities, particularly the Hindu and Indian diaspora in Canada.', 'summary': 'The Consulate General of India in Toronto has made the decision to cancel several consular camps that were previously scheduled to issue life certificates to Indian pensioners.\\n\\n\\nThe post Indian Consulate In Toronto Cancels Consular Camps Over Security Threats appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/indian-consulate-in-toronto-cancels-consular-camps-over-security-threats/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Indo-Canada.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 08:22:04', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.186}, {'id': 263268390, 'title': 'Inability to provide minimum security: India cancels consular camps in Toronto', 'text': 'The Consulate General of India in Toronto has cancelled several consular camps, initially planned to issue life certificates to Indian pensioners, due to security agencies\\' inability to provide minimum protection amid recent violence by Khalistani extremists. \"In view of the security agencies conveying their inability to provide minimum security protection to the community camp organisers, the Consulate has decided to cancel some of the scheduled consular camps,\" read a statement from the Consulate General on X. This decision follows clashes between protesters bearing Khalistani flags and people at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton. The clashes disrupted a consular event co-organised by the temple authorities and the Indian Consulate, marking yet another violent episode against Hindu establishments. On November 4, India voiced its ongoing concern about the safety of its nationals in Canada, following these incidents. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned the violence at the Hindu Sabha Temple, calling on the Canadian government to protect places of worship from attacks and to prosecute those responsible. \"We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada. The outreach of our Consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike will not be deterred by intimidation, harassment, and violence,\" Jaiswal stressed. Similarly, the High Commission of India in Ottawa expressed disappointment over anti-India disruptions at another consular camp in Brampton. \"It is deeply disappointing to see such disruptions allowed for routine consular work,\" the statement noted, highlighting that despite the disruptions, over 1,000 life certificates were successfully issued to applicants. Anti-India disruptions were also attempted at consular camps in Vancouver and Surrey on November 2 and 3.

In a recent interview, Ali spoke about how parenthood has filled a void in his life he never knew existed. “Having a baby fills a void that you weren’t even aware existed. That part never ceases to amaze me. It’s freakin’ hard to work now. I have serious anxiety when I leave home because I just want to see the baby all the time and be around Richa and her,” Ali told Vogue. \\nAli also spoke about how fatherhood has deeply impacted his work and personal life. He explained that having a child has shifted his perspective in ways he didn’t expect, particularly when it comes to emotional expression. “The way I’ll approach subjects in the future, the stories I’ll tell—I can imagine there being a significant shift. We’ve become superheroes because our reflexes go full throttle. This has also brought Richa and me closer. I listen more intently, and now, I’m always aware of two people and their needs,” he said.\\nIn the same interview, Richa shared her personal approach to parenting where she explained how she deliberately avoided overwhelming herself with too much advice which she feels can hinder one’s “natural response.” “When you work on instinct, you take a few hits and misses, but eventually, you figure it out,” she added.\\nWhile she acknowledged that nurses teach the basics, she also pointed out how much parents inherently know when it comes to caring for their newborn. “So I never question the intelligence of nature and try not to interfere with it.

Speaking at the inaugural session of the Anti-Terror Conference-2024 in New Delhi, Shah underscored the importance of collaboration between central and state agencies to effectively combat the growing threat of terrorism.\\n\\nUnified Approach to Combat Terrorism\\n\\nShah emphasized the need for a synchronized effort to combat “terrorism, terrorists, and their ecosystem,” highlighting the role of all law enforcement and intelligence agencies in this united front. Addressing an audience that included police chiefs, senior security officers, and central agency officials, the Home Minister stated, “We need to work together to fight terrorism, terrorists, and their ecosystem. That’s why we are bringing a new national counter-terrorism policy and strategy in which you all will play a key role.”\\n\\nThe new policy, he explained, would bring together state and central agencies in a joint effort to tackle terrorism more effectively, while ensuring that states retain their rights and responsibilities. “This does not reduce the rights of states,” Shah clarified, adding that the strategy aims to build a more unified security framework across India.\\n\\nModel Anti-Terror Squads and Special Task Forces\\n\\nIn line with the government’s counter-terrorism vision, Shah revealed that the government has prepared documents for the establishment of model Anti-Terrorism Squads (ATS) and Special Task Forces (STF) for states and union territories. These model squads and task forces will operate under standardized procedures designed to provide a consistent and effective approach to fighting terrorism across the country.\\n\\nShah explained that while the model SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are being shared with state governments, each state can modify them according to its specific security requirements. This move, Shah stressed, is designed to enhance coordination between state and central authorities, thereby strengthening India’s counter-terrorism capacity without infringing on the powers of individual states.\\n\\nThe Minister also noted that the new national counter-terrorism policy is part of India’s broader security vision, particularly the goal of making India a developed nation by 2047, as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “To make India developed by 2047, we need to deal with all security challenges and have a unified terror-fighting ecosystem,” Shah added.\\n\\nEnhanced Collaboration with Multi-Agency Centre (MAC)\\n\\nA key part of the new counter-terrorism strategy includes the creation of a Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), a platform for real-time intelligence sharing among various agencies and state/UT police forces. This collaborative platform will enhance coordination and improve India’s ability to respond more swiftly and effectively to emerging security threats.\\n\\nThe MAC, Shah explained, will allow for the seamless exchange of information, fostering quicker decision-making and more efficient responses to potential terrorist activities. “The need of the hour is to strengthen coordination and enhance intelligence-sharing to ensure we are ahead of any terrorist plot,” he said.\\n\\nAnti-Terror Conference-2024: Building Synergies\\n\\nThe Anti-Terror Conference-2024, organized by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), is designed to bring together top law enforcement and intelligence officials from across India, as well as experts in law, technology, and forensics, to discuss strategies for combating terrorism. This two-day event serves as a platform for cross-agency collaboration and sharing best practices, ultimately helping to shape future counter-terrorism policies.\\n\\nThe central focus of the conference is to create synergies among various stakeholders involved in national security, with an emphasis on the “whole of government” approach. In addition to the challenges of combating terrorism, topics discussed at the conference include evolving legal frameworks for counter-terrorism investigations, the role of emerging technologies in countering terrorist activities, international legal cooperation, and strategies to dismantle terror networks.\\n\\nKey Attendees and Collaborative Efforts\\n\\nThe conference sees participation from key stakeholders in national security, including 21 Director Generals of Police (DGPs), officials from several central investigative and intelligence agencies such as the CBI, ED, NIA, DRI, NCB, IB, and R&AW, as well as experts from the fields of law, technology, and forensics. These high-level discussions are aimed at improving operational strategies, enhancing coordination between central and state agencies, and ensuring that the country is equipped to handle emerging security challenges.\\n\\nShah concluded his address by emphasizing the importance of ongoing collaboration in strengthening India’s counter-terrorism framework. The government’s unified approach, he said, will be crucial in countering the evolving threat of terrorism and ensuring the safety and security of the nation. Through such initiatives, India is set to build a stronger and more resilient security apparatus that is better equipped to tackle terrorism in all its forms.\\n\\nRead More : Mumbai Police Recieve Message Threatning Shah Rukh Khan', 'summary': 'Amit Shah underscored the importance of collaboration between central and state agencies to effectively combat the growing threat of terrorism.\\n\\n\\nThe post National Counter-Terrorism Policy and Strategy to Be Unveiled Soon : Amit Shah appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/national-counter-terrorism-policy-and-strategy-to-be-unveiled-soon-amit-shah/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/River-Of-Corruption-Cleaned-By-Modi-Says-Amit-Shah-In-JK.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 09:19:16', 'author': 'anirudh,Prime Minister Narendra', 'authors': ['anirudh', 'Prime Minister Narendra'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.248}, {'id': 263266674, 'title': 'National anti-terror policy, strategy to be unveiled soon: HM Shah', 'text': 'New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) The Union government will soon release a national policy and strategy to counter terrorism, that will help demolish the entire terror ecosystem, said Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday, reiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan of “zero tolerance for terrorism”.\\n\\nSpeaking at the ‘Anti-Terror Conference-2024’ organised here, HM Shah said the National Counter-terrorism Policy and Strategy will soon be ready for circulation among all states as they have to lead the fight against “terrorism, terrorists and the terror ecosystem.”\\n\\nHighlighting the importance of infusing technology and training officers in using technology, HM Shah urged state police forces to join hands with Central agencies like the NIA and use federal forensic facilities to demolish the terror ecosystem.\\n\\nHe also paid tributes to 36,468 policemen who laid down their lives for national security and in the fight against terror, claiming that there has been a drop of 70 per cent in terror activities in the country since 2014.\\n\\nHe highlighted the new provisions in the three criminal laws that, for the first time in 76 years after Independence, define terrorism and allow security agencies to pursue trials in absentia against terrorists and financial criminals.\\n\\nTo become a developed nation, the country also needs to upgrade its security system and put in place a unified anti-terrorism ecosystem, he said.\\n\\n“A strong ecosystem against terror can be built only if all states implement the ATS structure, STF structure and training module suggested by the Central agencies,” he said.\\n\\nStressing on the need for information sharing in the battle against terror, HM Shah appreciated the progress made by the Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), under the Intelligence Bureau.

Trudeau’s message echoed sentiments shared by India, which also denounced the attack and expressed concern for the safety of Indian nationals living in Canada.\\n\\nIndia’s Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement highlighting the urgency of ensuring the safety and security of Indian nationals, especially given the recent rise in tensions between the two countries.\\n\\nRising Tensions in Brampton Spark Widespread Concern\\n\\nTensions have remained elevated in Brampton following the violent confrontation at the Hindu Sabha Mandir. Videos circulated on social media captured chaotic scenes, with protesters wielding Khalistani flags and scuffles breaking out as individuals clashed with poles and physical strikes on the temple grounds. The incident underscores a larger pattern of strain in India-Canada relations, following allegations from Prime Minister Trudeau regarding the involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year—claims India firmly rejected as “absurd.”\\n\\nCommunity Leaders Call for Peace and Unity\\n\\nCommunity leaders from both the Sikh and Hindu groups in the Greater Toronto Area have voiced their opposition to the recent violence, emphasizing the need for peace and discouraging divisive actions. Many have echoed Brown’s call for restraint, stressing that mutual respect and adherence to the rule of law are foundational to Canada’s diverse society.\\n\\nWith both local and international leaders condemning the recent altercation, calls for peace and unity continue to resonate, as officials urge both communities to uphold harmony and to allow law enforcement to handle any future tensions with fairness and integrity.', 'summary': 'The Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton has taken action in response to a recent violent altercation on its grounds, suspending its temple priest.\\n\\n\\nThe post Brampton: Hindu Temple Suspends Priest Amid Allegations of Violent Rhetoric in Community Clash appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/world/brampton-hindu-temple-suspends-priest-amid-allegations-of-violent-rhetoric-in-community-clash/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Brampton.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 09:00:13', 'author': 'Khalistani Extremists,Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Khalistani Extremists', 'Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.305}]}, {'news': [{'id': 263204018, 'title': 'Biden Calls Trump To Congratulate Him On His Victory, Invites Him To White House', 'text': 'US President Joe Biden on Thursday made a phone call to president-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him on his victory, the White House said.\\nBiden also spoke over the phone with Vice President Kamala Harris and congratulated her on her historic campaign, the White House said.

Terming the incident as horrific , the apex court had censured the state government over the alleged delay in filing of the FIR and allowing a crowd of thousands to vandalise the state-run facility. The death of the doctor, whose mortal remains indicated injury marks, had sparked nationwide protests and an initial probe had led to the arrest of a civic volunteer by the Kolkata police the next day of the crime.

On X, Rahul Gandhi urged Indians to \"Choose your India: Play-Fair or Monopoly? Jobs or Oligarchies? Competence or Connections? Innovation or Intimidation? Wealth for many or the few?\" In an opinion piece published in a leading daily newspaper, Rahul Gandhi wrote, \"India was silenced by the East India Company, and it was silenced not by its business prowess, but by its chokehold.

A new breed of monopolists has taken its place. They have amassed colossal wealth, even as India has become far more unequal and unfair for everybody else. Our institutions no longer belong to our people, they do the bidding of monopolists. Lakhs of businesses have been decimated, and India is unable to generate jobs for her youth. Bharat Mata is mother to all her children. The monopolisation of her resources and power, this blatant denial of the many for the sake of a chosen few, has wounded her,\" Rahul Gandhi wrote. The opinion piece further read: \"I know that hundreds of India\\'s brilliant and dynamic business leaders are scared of the monopolists. Are you one of them? Scared to talk on the phone? Scared of the monopolists colluding with the state to enter your sector and crush you? Scared of I-T, CBI or ED raids forcing you to sell your business to them?

Trump, 78, clinched Tuesday's election after a polarizing and dizzying campaign marked by two attempts on his life and Kamala Harris' late entry into the race following President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal. In a concession speech at her alma mater Howard University on Wednesday afternoon, Harris sought to console the voters who had hoped she would become the first woman to win the White House. To everyone who is watching, do not despair, she said. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. Harris said she had called Trump to congratulate him and promised to aid his transition. But she was not prepared to embrace his vision for the country. While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign, she said, as some supporters in the crowd shed tears. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people. Biden planned to address the nation on Thursday. Trump's resounding victory underscored how disenchanted Americans had become with the economy, border security and the direction of the country and its culture. Voters demanded a change, even if the agent of change was a convicted felon twice impeached and no longer the Washington outsider he was in his 2016 campaign. Trump has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal and has vowed to use federal law enforcement agencies to investigate or prosecute perceived enemies, including political rivals. Trump and his incoming vice president, U.S. Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. He promised roles in his administration to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a prominent Trump donor, and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The outcome defied polls that showed a razor-close race ahead of Tuesday's Election Day. Trump prevailed in at least five of the seven battleground states to push him over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency and was leading in the remaining two, Arizona and Nevada, where votes were still being tallied. Trump was also on track to become the first Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote since George W. Bush two decades ago. His fellow Republicans wrested control of the U.S. Senate from Democrats and had added to their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, though the outcome there may not be known for several days with dozens of races still uncalled. It was a hell of a good day, said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate Republican leader. Unified Republican control on Capitol Hill would clear the way for major portions of Trump's legislative agenda, as it did in the first two years of his 2017-2021 presidency when Republicans whipped a major tax-cut bill through Congress that mainly benefited the wealthy. America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate, Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida. Major stock markets around the world rallied following Trump's victory, and the dollar was set for its biggest one-day jump since 2020. OVERCOMING ODDS Trump was elected despite persistently low approval ratings, four criminal indictments and a civil judgment against him for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime when a New York jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star. Trump's political career appeared over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat. His efforts to reverse his defeat led to two separate indictments, though all the criminal cases against him are expected to end after his victory. Trump swept away challengers inside his party and then beat Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed falsely was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration. Trump's win will have major implications for U.S. trade and climate change policies, Americans' taxes and immigration, and U.S. foreign policy, including in the Middle East and Ukraine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump, and they discussed the Iranian threat and the need to work together for Israel's security, Netanyahu's office said. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, called for an end to the blind support for Israel from the United States. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed Trump's commitment to peace through strength, while the Kremlin said it would wait and see if his victory could help end the war in Ukraine more quickly. Trump had said he could end the war in 24 hours but has not offered a detailed plan. Trump's tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and U.S. allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon U.S. debt, economists say. A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as immigration, race, gender and reproductive rights. Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally. Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel the victory. Trump's support among women, whose backing Democrats had counted on, improved from four years ago. And his loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force, according to Edison Research exit polls. Meanwhile, many Democratic-leaning voters appear to have stayed home this year. The number of votes cast in counties that supported Trump in 2020 and where nearly all ballots have been tallied grew by almost 2% this year, while votes cast in counties that supported Biden four years ago dropped almost 5%.\", 'summary': \"Defying all odds and overcoming multiple controversies, Donald Trump has been re-elected as the President of the United States.

According to reports, the ED was conducting a pan-India search against subsidiaries and sellers of leading e-commerce players. Nearly 24 such seller locations were being raided by the regulator in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. As per sources, the ED investigation was underway related to alleged Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations. The ED raids aim to find evidence related to alleged money laundering activities that may have been facilitated through online e-commerce platforms. The regulator or e-commerce players did not immediately comment. Amazon and Flipkart have previously faced scrutiny in the country regarding their business practices. In September, a probe by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) reportedly found that Amazon and Flipkart breached local competition laws by favouring specific sellers on their platforms. Meanwhile, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, is also examining numerous complaints related to the use of \"dark patterns\" and planning a crackdown on online e-commerce companies violating consumer protection laws. The use of \"dark patterns\" by online platforms has created controversy in India. These deceptive techniques mislead people into doing something they do not wish to do, such as paying for items or services they did not intend to buy. The Indian government recently released draft guidelines to curb \"dark patterns\" used by big online platforms. The Digital India Act is also equipped to regulate \"dark patterns\" on the internet through user safety provisions. Aiming to guard customers from fake online reviews of products, the government has also issued a comprehensive set of guidelines.

The court specified that when vacancies exist, authorities cannot unreasonably deny appointments to qualified candidates within the consideration list.\"Recruiting bodies subject to the extant rules may devise appropriate procedure for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end provided the procedure so adopted is transparent, non-discriminatory, non-arbitrary and has a rationale nexus to the object sought to be achieved,\" Justice Mishra said.The ruling also addressed a question about government job appointment criteria, which a three-judge bench had referred to in March 2013.

He will be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, which will be his second term in this post.Earlier, Donald Trump was the President of the United States from 2016 to 2020. He had to face defeat in the election field for his second consecutive term from Democratic candidate Joe Biden. A few months before the US presidential election, Joe Biden withdrew from contesting for a second term, after which the Democratic Party declared Kamala Harris as its candidate.This will be only the second instance of a president serving two non-consecutive terms in the White House, the first in over 100 years. Grover Cleveland served as a non-consecutive president in 1884 and 1892. Trump had earlier served as US President from 2016 to 2020.Aiyar also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rapport with Trump. “I also recognize that there is a special rapport at a personal level between PM Modi and Trump, which I think reflects very badly on PM Modi and his personal preferences,” said Aiyar.Aiyar has been known for his candid and sometimes provocative opinions, which have sparked debates and discussions in Indian politics. The relationship between PM Modi and Donald Trump has been a subject of interest for many. While PM Modi has been known to maintain a diplomatic stance, his rapport with Trump has raised eyebrows. During Trump’s presidency, PM Modi invited him to the “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston in 2019, where a crowd of 50,000 attendees impressed Trump. This was followed by Trump’s visit to India in 2020, where he was welcomed with the “Namaste Trump” rally, organized by PM Modi in Ahmedabad, with 100,000 people in attendance.However, it’s worth noting that PM Modi has also been cautious in his interactions with Trump, particularly during the 2024 US presidential elections. Despite Trump’s claims of a potential meeting, PM Modi avoided engaging with either Trump or Kamala Harris during his US visit in September 2024. This decision was likely made to maintain a neutral stance and avoid any perceived endorsement of either candidate. Aiyar also expressed grief over Kamala Harris’s defeat. He said that Kamala Harris, who would have won, would have been the first woman and the first politician from India to become president. This would have been a historic and positive step.“As for Kamala Harris, she was given a very short time. She came up from behind. She was performing extremely well.

This was followed by Trump’s visit to India in 2020, where he was welcomed with the “Namaste Trump” rally, organized by PM Modi in Ahmedabad, with 100,000 people in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, PM Modi has also been cautious in his interactions with Mr. Trump, particularly during the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Despite Mr. Trump’s claims of a potential meeting, PM Modi avoided engaging with both presidential candidates during his U.S. visit in September 2024. \\n\\nMr. Aiyar also expressed grief over Kamala Harris’s defeat. He said that Kamala Harris, who would have won, would have been the first woman and the first politician from India to become President.\\n\\n“This would have been a historic and positive step. As for Kamala Harris, she was given a very short time. She came up from behind. She was performing extremely well. But it seems that very deep fault lines in American society ultimately coalesced against her, and she lost in this race,” said Mr. Aiyar.', 'summary': 'The former diplomat criticises Donald Trump’s character and expresses disappointment over his victory in U.S. presidential election', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-man-of-such-doubtful-character-says-ex-diplomat-mani-shankar-aiyar-on-donald-trumps-win/article68840012.ece', 'image': 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/kerala/ji8xcq/article67496932.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/vbk-Mani%20Shankar%20Aiyar.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 07:26:58', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.084}]}, {'news': [{'id': 263231732, 'title': 'Trump Preps Team, Gets Biden Invite to White House to Discuss Transition', 'text': 'President Joe Biden extended an invitation to President-elect Donald Trump to discuss the transition of power, after Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to support a peaceful transition.Vice President Kamala Harris delivered an impassioned concession speech last night, confirming that she had congratulated Trump on his victory and assured him of her commitment to an orderly transfer of authority. \"We must accept the results of this election,\" she told supporters. \"We owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution.\"According to the Washington Post, President-elect Trump has already begun preparing his administration, with advisors reportedly narrowing down candidates for key Cabinet roles.

In a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt assured that personnel decisions would soon be underway, while Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed the upcoming meeting at the White House, marking the beginning of transition planning.

The top court stated that the NCLAT disregarded the Court’s January 2023 order by allowing the adjustment of a Rs 150 crore performance bank guarantee (PBG) against an infusion requirement of Rs 350 crore from the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium (JKC), Jet Airways’ resolution applicant.The Naresh Goyal-led airline, which was once India's premiere airline, has been grounded since 2019. Later, NCLAT had approved the transfer of Jet's ownership rights to a consortium of UK's Kalrock Capital and United Arab Emirates-based entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan .The apex court today noted that liquidation will be in the best interest of its lenders and employees as Jalan-Kalrock Consortium failed to implement the resolution plan, five years since its approval.Further, the bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra directed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai to take steps for appointment of liquidator.The Supreme Court pronounced its judgment on a batch of appeals including one by lenders against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's order approving the takeover of Jet Airways (India) Ltd. by the JKC.The lenders, led by State Bank of India, have argued that the consortium has failed to meet the conditions for the takeover of the airline and is no longer in a position to revive the airline.Jet Airways Liquidation: What SC saidJustice Pardiwala said that the litigation surrounding the airline was “an eye-opener” with numerous lessons for India’s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).The Supreme Court today found the NCLAT’s judgment perverse, noting that it misread material evidence and disregarded legal principles. It said that the bank guarantee was meant to stay active until the conclusion of the insolvency process. Consequently, the Supreme Court noted JKC’s failure to infuse the promised funds of Rs 350 crore, which makes enough grounds for Jet Airways’ fate towards liquidation.The court also permitted lenders to encash PBG of Rs 150 crore.The top court was to decide whether to uphold the takeover of Jet Airways, making it the first-ever successful completion of a bankruptcy resolution of an airline in India, or liquidate the airline, a prayer made by the lenders.\", 'summary': \"The Supreme Court has ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, rejecting a takeover bid by Kalrock Capital and Murari Lal Jalan.

The court emphasized the “peculiar and alarming” circumstances of the case and pointed to the improper execution of the resolution plan.\\n\\nCourt Criticizes Tribunal for Approving Plan Without Full Payments\\n\\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the transfer of ownership to the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium (JKC) without fulfilling its financial obligations was unacceptable. The creditors, including major banks like State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB), had appealed the decision, arguing that the consortium had failed to pay an initial ₹350 crore as part of the approved resolution plan. Despite this, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had previously upheld the resolution plan in March.\\n\\nLiquidation Seen as Best Option for Creditors and Stakeholders\\n\\nThe Court underscored that liquidation should be a last resort for creditors, but with the resolution plan now deemed unviable, it ruled that liquidation would be the best course of action. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, along with Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, highlighted that the interests of creditors, employees, and other stakeholders needed to be prioritized.

Additionally, the NCLAT’s Mumbai Bench has been directed to appoint a liquidator to oversee the winding-up process.\\n\\nTimeline of Events: Jet Airways and the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium\\n\\nJet Airways, once a prominent airline in India, was grounded in April 2019. After a prolonged battle, the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium, led by Murari Jalan and Florian Fritsch, secured the bid for ownership in 2021. However, since then, multiple legal and financial hurdles have delayed the execution of the resolution plan, leading to its eventual failure to meet the required payments.\\n\\nNCLAT’s Role in Controversial Decision\\n\\nThe NCLAT’s controversial decision in March to approve the transfer of ownership was challenged after JKC failed to make the agreed payments. Initially, JKC was required to pay ₹4,783 crore as part of the plan, but only ₹200 crore was paid, which the court ruled insufficient to sustain the plan’s implementation.\\n\\nPlea for Escrow Account Withdrawn by JKC\\n\\nIn May, JKC sought permission from the NCLAT to place the ₹200 crore into an escrow account for further use. However, this plea was withdrawn after the tribunal denied the request, citing the ongoing Supreme Court hearing. This withdrawal marked a significant moment in the legal battle.\\n\\nFinancial Delays Continue at Jet Airways\\n\\nIn addition to the legal challenges, Jet Airways faced significant financial delays. In May 2023, the airline announced a delay in releasing its financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ending March 2023. The monitoring committee set up to oversee the resolution plan’s implementation also faced obstacles, further complicating the airline’s revival efforts.\\n\\nALSO READ: Election Commission Reschedules By-Polls in Kerala, Punjab, And Uttar Pradesh To Boost Voter Turnout', 'summary': \"In a landmark decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court of India invoked its powers under Article 142 to overturn a tribunal's ruling and order the liquidation of Jet Airways, after the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium failed to fully pay creditors.\\n\\n\\nThe post Supreme Court Orders Liquidation Of Jet Airways, Citing &#8216;Extraordinary&#8217; Circumstances appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/supreme-court-orders-liquidation-of-jet-airways-citing-extraordinary-circumstances/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Supreme-Court-Orders-Liquidation-Of-Jet-Airways.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 08:12:31', 'author': 'Prateek Levi', 'authors': ['Prateek Levi'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.328}, {'id': 263254864, 'title': 'Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors', 'text': 'Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, invoking its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.

According to the bench, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, “Liquidation must be available to lenders as a last resort… since the resolution plan is no longer capable of implementation.”\\n\\nNon-Payment Prompts Liquidation Order\\n\\nThe NCLAT had previously upheld the resolution plan on March 12, clearing the ownership transfer of Jet Airways to JKC. However, this was challenged by creditors, including the State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB), following JKC’s alleged failure to pay the initial ₹350 crore required by the resolution plan. Overall, JKC had committed to a total payment of ₹4,783 crore, but incomplete payment led to prolonged delays in the plan’s implementation.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the ₹200 crore already invested by JKC would be forfeited and ordered the NCLT’s Mumbai bench to appoint a liquidator immediately to begin the liquidation process for Jet Airways.\\n\\nIssues with the NCLAT’s Resolution Decision\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling underscored a strong disapproval of the NCLAT’s decision to proceed with the ownership transfer despite the incomplete payments by JKC. The judgment highlighted that Article 142—allowing the Court to make any order for “complete justice”—was invoked due to the “flagrant disregard” shown by the NCLAT in enforcing the original conditions.\\n\\nAccording to the Court, the NCLAT’s decision went against established legal principles and compromised creditors’ rights by enabling JKC’s partial fulfillment of the payment obligations. The court further observed that “the resolution plan’s non-implementation now necessitates liquidation as a measure to uphold creditors’ rights and ensure proper compensation to the workers and stakeholders involved.”\\n\\nJKC’s Withdrawal from Escrow Proposal\\n\\nThe Jalan-Kalrock Consortium had previously sought permission from the NCLAT to transfer ₹200 crore into an escrow account to facilitate the payment process. However, this proposal was withdrawn in May after the tribunal declined relief, noting that the matter was already under Supreme Court consideration.\\n\\nJet Airways, once a prominent player in India’s aviation sector, has been grounded since April 2019. In 2021, JKC, a consortium led by UAE-based businessman Murari Jalan and Florian Fritsch of Kalrock Capital Partners, won the bid for Jet Airways. A monitoring committee was subsequently established to oversee the resolution plan’s execution, but financial complications and legal delays impeded the process.\\n\\nFuture of Jet Airways and Stakeholder Implications\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways marks a significant chapter in India’s aviation industry. The Supreme Court’s directive aims to settle long-standing financial grievances, ensuring creditors, including SBI and PNB, receive their due payments. Additionally, the forfeited ₹200 crore and Performance Bank Guarantee of ₹150 crore from JKC could help lenders recover part of the airline’s unpaid debts.\\n\\nThis liquidation order also raises questions for Jet Airways’ employees and other stakeholders, who had hoped for the airline’s revival. The Supreme Court’s decision emphasizes the need for adherence to resolution plans and the financial protection of creditors, signaling a firm stance against lapses in payment obligations.\\n\\nALSO READ: Indian Railways Achieves Historic Milestone By Transporting 3 Crore Passengers In A Single Day', 'summary': 'Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, invoking its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.\\n\\n\\nThe post Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/jet-airways-faces-liquidation-as-supreme-court-invokes-article-142-what-it-means-for-creditors/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jet-Airways.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 08:28:21', 'author': 'Chief Justice Dy,Lavanya R', 'authors': ['Chief Justice Dy', 'Lavanya R'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.378}, {'id': 263256884, 'title': 'SC orders liquidation of Jet Airways', 'text': 'New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered liquidation of cash-strapped Jet Airways, saying that the resolution plan, approved five years ago, is no longer capable of implementation.\\n\\nA Bench headed by CJI, D.Y.

The court's decision came in response to a plea by the lenders, who were against the transfer of ownership of the grounded airline to Jalan Kalrock Consortium (JKC). The bench, which also included Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj, exercised its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, a provision that allows the court to pass such orders as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it. The court's ruling has far-reaching implications. It has ordered the forfeiture of Rs 200 crore that had been infused by JKC and directed the lenders to invoke a Rs 150 crore Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG). The Committee of Creditors (CoC), led by the State Bank of India, had argued before the apex court that the proposed revival plan was not in the best interest of the lenders. They questioned the order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that had upheld the resolution plan. Earlier this year, in January, the Supreme Court had ordered JKC, the successful resolution professional bidder for the cash-strapped airline, to deposit Rs 150 crore in an Escrow account jointly held by the State Bank of India and JKC. The court had warned of legal consequences if JKC failed to furnish the bank guarantee. The court had also asked the NCLAT to decide by the end of March 2024 on the lenders' plea challenging the ownership of the grounded Airways to JKC. The consortium had committed to an infusion of Rs 350 crore equity as per the court-approved resolution plan to assume ownership of Jet Airways. A three-member bench of the NCLAT had agreed to an adjustment of Rs 150 crore from the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) towards the payment of Rs 350 crore. Jet Airways, once one of India's largest and most popular airlines, had entered the corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in June 2019 due to severe financial distress. The NCLAT had directed the Jet Airways monitoring committee to complete the transfer of ownership within 90 days. However, the consortium was four years behind on its payment schedule at the moment. The bench questioned the compliance and merits of the consortium's performance under the resolution plan. It sought a clarification on why the consortium had not complied with the court's previous directives, specifically the infusion of funds in cash and the execution of the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG). Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the consortium, argued that the revival of Jet Airways was a commercial endeavour, subject to various external factors and the consortium cannot be held solely responsible for delays caused by security clearances and other procedural hurdles. Despite the setbacks, the consortium had remained committed to reviving the airline. They had infused Rs 350 crore into Jet Airways and were determined to re-establish the operations of the airline up and running in 2024.\", 'summary': 'The Supreme Court has ordered the liquidation of the beleaguered airline Jet Airways.

The merger, which aims to consolidate Air India and Vistara into one of India’s largest airlines, could face both opportunities and challenges as the industry undergoes a major transformation. With Jet Airways now out of the competitive field, the landscape is shifting, and the merged entity will need to navigate this changing environment carefully to emerge as the dominant force in the Indian aviation market.\\n\\nReduced Competition: Opportunities For Air India-Vistara\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways removes a key competitor from the domestic airline industry, which will likely have a significant impact on market dynamics. Once a major player in both domestic and international flights, Jet Airways’ removal will reduce the number of airlines competing for the same routes and market share. This opens up space for the merged Air India-Vistara entity to capture a larger share of both domestic and international travelers.\\n\\nWith the combined resources of Air India and Vistara, this larger entity will have a strengthened capacity to expand its routes, provide more frequent services, and offer enhanced customer experiences. It will now have the chance to dominate the full-service airline space, especially on long-haul international routes where Jet Airways had once competed aggressively.\\n\\nHowever, while the reduced competition could be seen as an advantage for the merged airline, there is also a risk of overconsolidation. If Air India and Vistara monopolize too many routes, it could reduce consumer choices and increase ticket prices. Regulatory oversight will be crucial in ensuring that the merger does not lead to anti-competitive practices.\\n\\nAir India-Vistara Merger: Operational Synergies And Challenges\\n\\nAs Air India and Vistara move toward integration, the liquidation of Jet Airways removes a significant player that might have otherwise competed for certain routes, fleets, and airport slots. For the new entity, this could simplify the operational landscape in terms of managing air traffic, especially when it comes to resource allocation such as gates, slots, and airspace rights.\\n\\nHowever, the integration process itself will still pose challenges. Merging the operations of two airlines, each with its own fleet, systems, and operational protocols, is never a straightforward task. The airlines will need to address complex issues related to fleet management, staff integration, and technology unification. For example, Air India’s older fleet could be supplemented by Vistara’s newer, more modern aircraft, but this will require careful management to ensure that the combined airline has a fleet that is both competitive and efficient.\\n\\nMoreover, both Air India and Vistara operate in different segments of the market, with Vistara being known for its premium services and Air India having a wider, more budget-conscious customer base. Merging these brands into a cohesive unit will require a clear strategy that addresses the needs of both premium and economy passengers, with seamless transitions between the two offerings.\\n\\n Frequent Flyer Program Integration: Club Vistara and Flying Returns\\n\\nA key aspect of the Air India-Vistara merger is the integration of their respective frequent flyer programs: Club Vistara (CV) and Flying Returns. As part of the merger, members of both programs will see their points transferred to Flying Returns, ensuring a smooth transition for loyal customers.\\n\\nFor frequent flyers, this means that all Club Vistara points will be converted to Flying Returns points on a 1:1 basis. Importantly, these points will not lose value during the transfer, and any points due to expire will remain valid for at least one year after the migration. Additionally, existing tier statuses (Silver, Gold, Platinum) will be retained, so flyers won’t lose any benefits associated with their loyalty status.\\n\\nPerhaps most beneficial is the fact that the points from both Club Vistara and Flying Returns will be combined to determine the member’s final tier status. This could lead to an upgrade for some frequent flyers, especially if their combined points from both programs push them over the threshold for a higher tier. For instance, if a member has a significant balance of points in both programs, they could see themselves moved up to a higher tier such as Platinum from Gold, further increasing their access to premium benefits such as priority boarding, lounge access, and reward flights.\\n\\nMoreover, unused upgrade vouchers and complimentary flight tickets from Club Vistara will also be transferred to Flying Returns. These vouchers will retain their validity, but they will now be usable on the expanded route network of the merged airline, which will likely cover more destinations and offer greater flexibility.\\n\\n Financial and Operational Impact: Jet Airways Liquidation\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways could have a significant financial and operational impact on the aviation sector. Jet Airways, once a major competitor to Air India, had been grounded in April 2019 due to financial insolvency and had been undergoing a resolution process ever since. However, its failure to meet the conditions laid out in the resolution plan, including non-payment of dues, led the Supreme Court to invoke its powers under Article 142 to liquidate the airline.\\n\\nFrom a financial perspective, the liquidation of Jet Airways opens up space for Air India and Vistara to capture more customers, expand their services, and gain market share. This is particularly true on international routes where Jet Airways had been a major player. With Jet Airways now out of the picture, the merged Air India-Vistara entity will be in a stronger position to negotiate bilateral agreements with foreign governments and expand its footprint globally.\\n\\nHowever, the financial strain caused by the liquidation may also lead to some turbulence in the market. Jet Airways had a significant amount of debt, and the liquidation process is expected to result in the loss of jobs, as well as challenges for creditors. While the merger between Air India and Vistara is financially backed by the Indian government, there will still be operational costs associated with absorbing Jet’s market share and integrating additional resources, such as aircraft and airport slots, into the merged airline’s fleet.\\n\\nLegal and Regulatory Considerations for the Merger\\n\\nThe merger between Air India and Vistara, along with the liquidation of Jet Airways, is likely to come under the scrutiny of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and other regulatory bodies. The CCI will assess whether the merger would result in a monopoly in certain sectors, particularly on lucrative international routes, and whether it would reduce consumer choice or increase prices.\\n\\nAt the same time, the liquidation of Jet Airways, which had been part of a long legal process, could also lead to changes in how regulatory authorities manage the restructuring and dissolution of airlines in the future. As the aviation sector adjusts to these changes, regulatory bodies will need to balance the need for consolidation with ensuring that the market remains competitive and accessible to consumers.\\n\\nLong-Term Implications: Creating a Dominant National Carrier\\n\\nWith Jet Airways now in liquidation and Air India and Vistara set to merge, the Indian aviation market is on the brink of a new era. The combined entity of Air India and Vistara will be well-positioned to take advantage of India’s growing travel market, both domestically and internationally.\\n\\nIn the long term, the merger could lead to the emergence of a dominant national carrier that could rival other international airlines. With a larger fleet, an expanded network, and a more cohesive service offering, Air India-Vistara could become a force to be reckoned with in global aviation. However, the success of the merger will depend on how well the airline manages the integration process, retains customer loyalty, and adapts to the rapidly evolving landscape of the aviation industry.\\n\\n A New Chapter for India’s Aviation Sector\\n\\nThe liquidation of Jet Airways and the merger of Air India and Vistara are both transformative events in the Indian aviation industry. While the Jet Airways liquidation removes a major competitor, the combined force of Air India and Vistara presents a unique opportunity to reshape the airline market, offering better service, more extensive networks, and improved loyalty benefits for passengers.\\n\\nFrequent flyers can look forward to the benefits of tier retention, the extended validity of their points, and the potential for upgrades. However, the industry will need to watch how the integration process unfolds, as operational challenges, regulatory scrutiny, and financial considerations continue to shape the future of India’s aviation sector. In the end, if the merger is successful, it could pave the way for India to have one of the world’s most competitive and customer-centric airlines.\\n\\nRead More : Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors', 'summary': 'The recent Supreme Court ruling to liquidate Jet Airways has profound consequences for India’s aviation landscape, particularly in the context of the ongoing merger between Air India and Vistara.\\n\\n\\nThe post Impact Of Jet Airways Liquidation On Air India-Vistara Merger appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/impact-of-jet-airways-liquidation-on-air-india-vistara-merger/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Air-India-Vistara-Merger.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 09:42:39', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.144}, {'id': 263274044, 'title': 'Supreme Court orders liquidation of Jet Airways', 'text': 'New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered liquidation of cash-strapped Jet Airways, saying that the resolution plan, approved five years ago, is no longer capable of implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bench, headed by CJI D.Y.

Another similar liquidation of airlines took place on November 7, 2024. The Supreme Court of India on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, highlighting the ongoing struggles in the Indian aviation market. This marks the culmination of an intense period of financial instability, fierce competition, and operational challenges.\\n\\nThe Jet Airways Liquidation\\n\\nThe recent decision by the Supreme Court to liquidate Jet Airways is a significant moment in the country’s aviation history. Jet Airways, which once held a dominant position in the Indian airline industry, ceased operations in April 2019 after struggling with mounting debts, poor financial health, and intense competition from low-cost carriers. Despite efforts to revive the airline under a new management consortium, the process encountered numerous setbacks. This led to the latest Supreme Court judgment in November 2024, which pointed out that the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had not adhered to earlier rulings by the top court. Jet Airways’ closure has now been confirmed as a permanent shutdown, ending a historic chapter in Indian aviation\\u200b.\\n\\nThe Decline of Indian Airlines: A Pattern of Struggles\\n\\nJet Airways is far from the only major airline in India to succumb to financial failure. The timeline of Indian airline collapses reveals a pattern of operational challenges, mounting debts, high fuel prices, and market mismanagement, often exacerbated by fierce competition and a low-cost pricing war.\\n\\n1. Kingfisher Airlines (2005–2012)\\n\\nFounded by businessman Vijay Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines once promised to revolutionize the Indian aviation industry with its luxury offerings. However, Kingfisher quickly became a symbol of airline failure. The airline’s high operating costs, massive debt, and unsuccessful merger with Air Deccan in 2007 led to its eventual closure in 2012. Despite enjoying a large market share at its peak, the airline was unable to recover from continuous financial losses\\u200b.\\n\\n2. Paramount Airways (2005–2010)\\n\\nParamount Airways, a regional carrier operating out of Chennai, aimed to serve business travelers with its fleet of new-generation Embraer aircraft. However, the airline struggled with high operational costs and an unsustainable business model. Despite initial success, Paramount shut down in 2010 due to mounting debts and an inability to expand its fleet\\u200b.\\n\\n3. Air Deccan (2003–2007)\\n\\nAir Deccan, India’s first low-cost carrier, revolutionized air travel by making it affordable for the masses. However, its rapid expansion led to operational inefficiencies, and the airline was unable to generate consistent profits. In 2007, it merged with Kingfisher Airlines, but the combined entity continued to face financial difficulties, leading to the eventual downfall of both\\u200b.\\n\\n4. Air India and Indian Airlines Merger (2007)\\n\\nAir India and Indian Airlines were merged in 2007, but the consolidation did not bring the expected financial stability. While Air India continued to operate, its combined operations were plagued with inefficiency, mismanagement, and rising operational costs. In recent years, Air India was privatized under Tata Group, signaling a new era for the carrier, though the merger of Indian Airlines remains a classic example of how consolidation doesn’t always guarantee success\\u200b.\\n\\n5. GoFirst (2023)\\n\\nGoFirst (formerly GoAir), owned by the Wadia Group, filed for bankruptcy in May 2023 due to mounting debts and the grounding of half its fleet, which was caused by delays in engine deliveries from Pratt and Whitney. Despite a strong customer base and a considerable share in the low-cost segment, GoFirst struggled to remain profitable amid the volatile aviation market and high operating costs\\u200b.\\n\\n6. Other Regional Airlines\\n\\nA number of regional airlines have also shut down in recent years, including:\\n\\nAir Mantra (2012-2013), which ceased operations after a short stint due to low passenger bookings\\u200b.\\nAir Pegasus (2015-2016), which collapsed under financial strain despite initially operating in regional markets\\u200b.\\nAir Costa (2013-2017), which also faced operational difficulties leading to its shutdown after four years of operation\\u200b.\\nAir Carnival (2016-2017), which halted services after facing financial turmoil\\u200b.\\n\\nWhy Do So Many Airlines Fail in India?\\n\\nThe frequent collapse of airlines in India can be attributed to several interconnected factors:\\n\\n1. High Operational Costs\\n\\nFuel prices, taxes, and maintenance costs have always been major issues for Indian airlines. The volatility in fuel prices, especially during periods of global instability, has a disproportionate impact on airline economics. Airlines like GoFirst, which were grounded due to engine delays, also face high maintenance and leasing costs that can break the bank\\u200b.\\n\\n2. Intense Competition\\n\\nIndia’s aviation market is fiercely competitive, with numerous low-cost carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet, and AirAsia India providing low fares. This has led to price wars that make it difficult for legacy airlines to maintain profitability\\u200b.\\n\\n3. Debt and Mismanagement\\n\\nMany airlines, especially the older ones like Kingfisher, Jet Airways, and Air India, accumulated massive debts over time. Poor financial management and lack of strategic planning often led to their downfall\\u200b.\\n\\n4. Economic Instability\\n\\nIndian airlines are also vulnerable to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, changes in government policy, and fluctuating currency exchange rates. The falling value of the rupee, for example, increases the cost of importing aircraft and spare parts\\u200b\\n\\nA Grim Future or Room for Recovery?\\n\\nDespite the numerous collapses, India’s aviation market remains one of the fastest-growing in the world. However, with intense competition, high costs, and frequent financial struggles, only those airlines with robust business models and efficient management seem to survive. The collapse of major carriers like Jet Airways and Kingfisher serves as a cautionary tale for those looking to enter the aviation sector, particularly in a market that is still developing despite its vast potential\\u200b\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Indian aviation sector has experienced significant turbulence over the past 15 years, with over a dozen airlines collapsing due to a mix of financial mismanagement, stiff competition, and operational challenges. Whether new carriers can avoid the mistakes of the past remains to be seen, but for now, it’s clear that only the fittest survive in India’s skies.', 'summary': 'The Supreme Court of India on Thursday ordered the liquidation of Jet Airways, highlighting the ongoing struggles in the Indian aviation market\\n\\n\\nThe post SC Orders Liquidation Of Jet Airways; How Many Indian Airlines Have Collapsed in the Past 15 Years?

According to the notification, farmers having an area of land of less than two acres will pay an environmental compensation of Rs 5,000.\\nHowever, the penalty has been increased to Rs 10,000 for farmers having an area of land of two acres or more but less than five acres, and to Rs 30,000 for farmers having an area of land of more than five acres.

Majority of cases were reported from Punjab (5041), followed by Haryana (888), Uttar Pradesh (1544), Delhi (12), Rajasthan (1332) and Madhya Pradesh (3697).

The violence disrupted a consular event that was co-organized by the Indian Consulate and the temple, further escalating tensions in the community. The incident at the temple has been described as another example of rising religious intolerance in Canada, with Hindu establishments increasingly becoming targets of violent protests and threats linked to Khalistani activism.\\n\\nOn November 4, the Indian government expressed its ongoing concern for the safety of Indian nationals in Canada, particularly in light of these recent violent incidents.

Another consular camp in Brampton was targeted by anti-India protesters, causing significant disturbances. Despite these challenges, over 1,000 life certificates were successfully issued to applicants, indicating the Consulate’s determination to continue its services to the Indian community.\\n\\nSimilar anti-India disruptions were also reported at consular camps in Vancouver and Surrey on November 2 and 3, underscoring the persistent efforts to obstruct routine consular work. These incidents are part of a broader pattern of rising hostility against India and its representatives in Canada, particularly in relation to the growing influence of Khalistani extremism.\\n\\nAlarm Over the Growing Threat of Khalistani Extremism\\n\\nThe increasing frequency of such violent disruptions has alarmed many within Canada’s Hindu community. In response, prominent Hindu organizations, including the Canadian National Council of Hindus (CNCH), the Hindu Federation, and leaders from local temples, have issued a directive calling for greater accountability from Canadian politicians. The directive explicitly prohibits the use of temple facilities for political purposes unless those politicians demonstrate “concrete efforts” to address the rising threat posed by Khalistani extremism in the country.\\n\\nThe directive reflects a growing sense of insecurity within Canada’s Hindu community, which feels increasingly vulnerable in light of the rise of Khalistani separatist activities and the growing influence of extremist elements. The organizations have called on politicians to take a more proactive stance in tackling these issues, rather than allowing religious intolerance and violence to proliferate.\\n\\nThere is also mounting frustration with the Canadian government’s handling of the issue. Critics argue that under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s leadership, Canada has failed to adequately address the growing threat posed by Khalistani separatism and its violent manifestations. The issue has been a point of contention between India and Canada, with India repeatedly raising concerns about the safety of its citizens and the protection of its cultural institutions in Canada.\\n\\nIndia’s Continued Advocacy for Its Citizens’ Safety\\n\\nDespite the ongoing security challenges, India has remained steadfast in its commitment to ensuring the safety of its nationals in Canada. Both the Consulate General of India in Toronto and the High Commission of India in Ottawa have emphasized their determination to continue offering consular services, including life certificates and other essential documentation, to the Indian community, regardless of the ongoing threats. The Indian government has called on Canadian authorities to take stronger action against the perpetrators of these violent acts and to provide greater protection to places of worship and community centers.\\n\\nThe violence and disruption at consular camps are symptomatic of a larger issue that has been growing in Canada: the increasing radicalization and influence of Khalistani extremism. As incidents like these continue to occur, India’s concerns about the safety of its citizens in Canada are expected to grow. Indian officials are likely to continue pressing the Canadian government for stronger action to curb these acts of violence and ensure the protection of Hindu religious institutions and individuals.\\n\\nRising Tensions Amid Political and Religious Divisions\\n\\nThe ongoing disturbances in Canada have sparked significant debate about the role of Khalistani extremism in the country and its impact on the broader Indian diaspora. As tensions rise, the relationship between India and Canada continues to be tested. The Indian government has made it clear that it will continue to advocate for the safety and security of its citizens, even as the situation in Canada becomes more complex.\\n\\nThe issue is not only one of security but also one of political and religious divisions, with certain segments of Canada’s Sikh population supporting the Khalistani cause while others, including the broader Hindu community, express concern over the increasing radicalization. The growing divide underscores the challenges faced by the Canadian government in balancing religious freedom with national security concerns.\\n\\nAs this situation continues to unfold, the Indian government will likely continue to urge its Canadian counterparts to take a stronger stance against Khalistani extremism and work towards a safer and more secure environment for all communities, particularly the Hindu and Indian diaspora in Canada.', 'summary': 'The Consulate General of India in Toronto has made the decision to cancel several consular camps that were previously scheduled to issue life certificates to Indian pensioners.\\n\\n\\nThe post Indian Consulate In Toronto Cancels Consular Camps Over Security Threats appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/indian-consulate-in-toronto-cancels-consular-camps-over-security-threats/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Indo-Canada.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 08:22:04', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.186}, {'id': 263268390, 'title': 'Inability to provide minimum security: India cancels consular camps in Toronto', 'text': 'The Consulate General of India in Toronto has cancelled several consular camps, initially planned to issue life certificates to Indian pensioners, due to security agencies\\' inability to provide minimum protection amid recent violence by Khalistani extremists. \"In view of the security agencies conveying their inability to provide minimum security protection to the community camp organisers, the Consulate has decided to cancel some of the scheduled consular camps,\" read a statement from the Consulate General on X. This decision follows clashes between protesters bearing Khalistani flags and people at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton. The clashes disrupted a consular event co-organised by the temple authorities and the Indian Consulate, marking yet another violent episode against Hindu establishments. On November 4, India voiced its ongoing concern about the safety of its nationals in Canada, following these incidents. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned the violence at the Hindu Sabha Temple, calling on the Canadian government to protect places of worship from attacks and to prosecute those responsible. \"We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada. The outreach of our Consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike will not be deterred by intimidation, harassment, and violence,\" Jaiswal stressed. Similarly, the High Commission of India in Ottawa expressed disappointment over anti-India disruptions at another consular camp in Brampton. \"It is deeply disappointing to see such disruptions allowed for routine consular work,\" the statement noted, highlighting that despite the disruptions, over 1,000 life certificates were successfully issued to applicants. Anti-India disruptions were also attempted at consular camps in Vancouver and Surrey on November 2 and 3.

In a recent interview, Ali spoke about how parenthood has filled a void in his life he never knew existed. “Having a baby fills a void that you weren’t even aware existed. That part never ceases to amaze me. It’s freakin’ hard to work now. I have serious anxiety when I leave home because I just want to see the baby all the time and be around Richa and her,” Ali told Vogue. \\nAli also spoke about how fatherhood has deeply impacted his work and personal life. He explained that having a child has shifted his perspective in ways he didn’t expect, particularly when it comes to emotional expression. “The way I’ll approach subjects in the future, the stories I’ll tell—I can imagine there being a significant shift. We’ve become superheroes because our reflexes go full throttle. This has also brought Richa and me closer. I listen more intently, and now, I’m always aware of two people and their needs,” he said.\\nIn the same interview, Richa shared her personal approach to parenting where she explained how she deliberately avoided overwhelming herself with too much advice which she feels can hinder one’s “natural response.” “When you work on instinct, you take a few hits and misses, but eventually, you figure it out,” she added.\\nWhile she acknowledged that nurses teach the basics, she also pointed out how much parents inherently know when it comes to caring for their newborn. “So I never question the intelligence of nature and try not to interfere with it.

Speaking at the inaugural session of the Anti-Terror Conference-2024 in New Delhi, Shah underscored the importance of collaboration between central and state agencies to effectively combat the growing threat of terrorism.\\n\\nUnified Approach to Combat Terrorism\\n\\nShah emphasized the need for a synchronized effort to combat “terrorism, terrorists, and their ecosystem,” highlighting the role of all law enforcement and intelligence agencies in this united front. Addressing an audience that included police chiefs, senior security officers, and central agency officials, the Home Minister stated, “We need to work together to fight terrorism, terrorists, and their ecosystem. That’s why we are bringing a new national counter-terrorism policy and strategy in which you all will play a key role.”\\n\\nThe new policy, he explained, would bring together state and central agencies in a joint effort to tackle terrorism more effectively, while ensuring that states retain their rights and responsibilities. “This does not reduce the rights of states,” Shah clarified, adding that the strategy aims to build a more unified security framework across India.\\n\\nModel Anti-Terror Squads and Special Task Forces\\n\\nIn line with the government’s counter-terrorism vision, Shah revealed that the government has prepared documents for the establishment of model Anti-Terrorism Squads (ATS) and Special Task Forces (STF) for states and union territories. These model squads and task forces will operate under standardized procedures designed to provide a consistent and effective approach to fighting terrorism across the country.\\n\\nShah explained that while the model SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are being shared with state governments, each state can modify them according to its specific security requirements. This move, Shah stressed, is designed to enhance coordination between state and central authorities, thereby strengthening India’s counter-terrorism capacity without infringing on the powers of individual states.\\n\\nThe Minister also noted that the new national counter-terrorism policy is part of India’s broader security vision, particularly the goal of making India a developed nation by 2047, as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “To make India developed by 2047, we need to deal with all security challenges and have a unified terror-fighting ecosystem,” Shah added.\\n\\nEnhanced Collaboration with Multi-Agency Centre (MAC)\\n\\nA key part of the new counter-terrorism strategy includes the creation of a Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), a platform for real-time intelligence sharing among various agencies and state/UT police forces. This collaborative platform will enhance coordination and improve India’s ability to respond more swiftly and effectively to emerging security threats.\\n\\nThe MAC, Shah explained, will allow for the seamless exchange of information, fostering quicker decision-making and more efficient responses to potential terrorist activities. “The need of the hour is to strengthen coordination and enhance intelligence-sharing to ensure we are ahead of any terrorist plot,” he said.\\n\\nAnti-Terror Conference-2024: Building Synergies\\n\\nThe Anti-Terror Conference-2024, organized by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), is designed to bring together top law enforcement and intelligence officials from across India, as well as experts in law, technology, and forensics, to discuss strategies for combating terrorism. This two-day event serves as a platform for cross-agency collaboration and sharing best practices, ultimately helping to shape future counter-terrorism policies.\\n\\nThe central focus of the conference is to create synergies among various stakeholders involved in national security, with an emphasis on the “whole of government” approach. In addition to the challenges of combating terrorism, topics discussed at the conference include evolving legal frameworks for counter-terrorism investigations, the role of emerging technologies in countering terrorist activities, international legal cooperation, and strategies to dismantle terror networks.\\n\\nKey Attendees and Collaborative Efforts\\n\\nThe conference sees participation from key stakeholders in national security, including 21 Director Generals of Police (DGPs), officials from several central investigative and intelligence agencies such as the CBI, ED, NIA, DRI, NCB, IB, and R&AW, as well as experts from the fields of law, technology, and forensics. These high-level discussions are aimed at improving operational strategies, enhancing coordination between central and state agencies, and ensuring that the country is equipped to handle emerging security challenges.\\n\\nShah concluded his address by emphasizing the importance of ongoing collaboration in strengthening India’s counter-terrorism framework. The government’s unified approach, he said, will be crucial in countering the evolving threat of terrorism and ensuring the safety and security of the nation. Through such initiatives, India is set to build a stronger and more resilient security apparatus that is better equipped to tackle terrorism in all its forms.\\n\\nRead More : Mumbai Police Recieve Message Threatning Shah Rukh Khan', 'summary': 'Amit Shah underscored the importance of collaboration between central and state agencies to effectively combat the growing threat of terrorism.\\n\\n\\nThe post National Counter-Terrorism Policy and Strategy to Be Unveiled Soon : Amit Shah appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/national-counter-terrorism-policy-and-strategy-to-be-unveiled-soon-amit-shah/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/River-Of-Corruption-Cleaned-By-Modi-Says-Amit-Shah-In-JK.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 09:19:16', 'author': 'anirudh,Prime Minister Narendra', 'authors': ['anirudh', 'Prime Minister Narendra'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.248}, {'id': 263266674, 'title': 'National anti-terror policy, strategy to be unveiled soon: HM Shah', 'text': 'New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) The Union government will soon release a national policy and strategy to counter terrorism, that will help demolish the entire terror ecosystem, said Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday, reiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan of “zero tolerance for terrorism”.\\n\\nSpeaking at the ‘Anti-Terror Conference-2024’ organised here, HM Shah said the National Counter-terrorism Policy and Strategy will soon be ready for circulation among all states as they have to lead the fight against “terrorism, terrorists and the terror ecosystem.”\\n\\nHighlighting the importance of infusing technology and training officers in using technology, HM Shah urged state police forces to join hands with Central agencies like the NIA and use federal forensic facilities to demolish the terror ecosystem.\\n\\nHe also paid tributes to 36,468 policemen who laid down their lives for national security and in the fight against terror, claiming that there has been a drop of 70 per cent in terror activities in the country since 2014.\\n\\nHe highlighted the new provisions in the three criminal laws that, for the first time in 76 years after Independence, define terrorism and allow security agencies to pursue trials in absentia against terrorists and financial criminals.\\n\\nTo become a developed nation, the country also needs to upgrade its security system and put in place a unified anti-terrorism ecosystem, he said.\\n\\n“A strong ecosystem against terror can be built only if all states implement the ATS structure, STF structure and training module suggested by the Central agencies,” he said.\\n\\nStressing on the need for information sharing in the battle against terror, HM Shah appreciated the progress made by the Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), under the Intelligence Bureau.

Trudeau’s message echoed sentiments shared by India, which also denounced the attack and expressed concern for the safety of Indian nationals living in Canada.\\n\\nIndia’s Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement highlighting the urgency of ensuring the safety and security of Indian nationals, especially given the recent rise in tensions between the two countries.\\n\\nRising Tensions in Brampton Spark Widespread Concern\\n\\nTensions have remained elevated in Brampton following the violent confrontation at the Hindu Sabha Mandir. Videos circulated on social media captured chaotic scenes, with protesters wielding Khalistani flags and scuffles breaking out as individuals clashed with poles and physical strikes on the temple grounds. The incident underscores a larger pattern of strain in India-Canada relations, following allegations from Prime Minister Trudeau regarding the involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year—claims India firmly rejected as “absurd.”\\n\\nCommunity Leaders Call for Peace and Unity\\n\\nCommunity leaders from both the Sikh and Hindu groups in the Greater Toronto Area have voiced their opposition to the recent violence, emphasizing the need for peace and discouraging divisive actions. Many have echoed Brown’s call for restraint, stressing that mutual respect and adherence to the rule of law are foundational to Canada’s diverse society.\\n\\nWith both local and international leaders condemning the recent altercation, calls for peace and unity continue to resonate, as officials urge both communities to uphold harmony and to allow law enforcement to handle any future tensions with fairness and integrity.', 'summary': 'The Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton has taken action in response to a recent violent altercation on its grounds, suspending its temple priest.\\n\\n\\nThe post Brampton: Hindu Temple Suspends Priest Amid Allegations of Violent Rhetoric in Community Clash appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/world/brampton-hindu-temple-suspends-priest-amid-allegations-of-violent-rhetoric-in-community-clash/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Brampton.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 09:00:13', 'author': 'Khalistani Extremists,Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Khalistani Extremists', 'Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.305}, {'id': 263204018, 'title': 'Biden Calls Trump To Congratulate Him On His Victory, Invites Him To White House', 'text': 'US President Joe Biden on Thursday made a phone call to president-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him on his victory, the White House said.\\nBiden also spoke over the phone with Vice President Kamala Harris and congratulated her on her historic campaign, the White House said.

On X, Rahul Gandhi urged Indians to \"Choose your India: Play-Fair or Monopoly? Jobs or Oligarchies? Competence or Connections? Innovation or Intimidation? Wealth for many or the few?\" In an opinion piece published in a leading daily newspaper, Rahul Gandhi wrote, \"India was silenced by the East India Company, and it was silenced not by its business prowess, but by its chokehold. The Company choked India by partnering with, bribing, and threatening more pliant maharajas and nawabs.\" \"It controlled our banking, bureaucratic, and information networks.

A new breed of monopolists has taken its place. They have amassed colossal wealth, even as India has become far more unequal and unfair for everybody else. Our institutions no longer belong to our people, they do the bidding of monopolists. Lakhs of businesses have been decimated, and India is unable to generate jobs for her youth. Bharat Mata is mother to all her children. The monopolisation of her resources and power, this blatant denial of the many for the sake of a chosen few, has wounded her,\" Rahul Gandhi wrote. The opinion piece further read: \"I know that hundreds of India\\'s brilliant and dynamic business leaders are scared of the monopolists. Are you one of them? Scared to talk on the phone? Scared of the monopolists colluding with the state to enter your sector and crush you? Scared of I-T, CBI or ED raids forcing you to sell your business to them?

Trump, 78, clinched Tuesday's election after a polarizing and dizzying campaign marked by two attempts on his life and Kamala Harris' late entry into the race following President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal. In a concession speech at her alma mater Howard University on Wednesday afternoon, Harris sought to console the voters who had hoped she would become the first woman to win the White House. To everyone who is watching, do not despair, she said. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. Harris said she had called Trump to congratulate him and promised to aid his transition. But she was not prepared to embrace his vision for the country. While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign, she said, as some supporters in the crowd shed tears. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people. Biden planned to address the nation on Thursday. Trump's resounding victory underscored how disenchanted Americans had become with the economy, border security and the direction of the country and its culture. Voters demanded a change, even if the agent of change was a convicted felon twice impeached and no longer the Washington outsider he was in his 2016 campaign. Trump has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal and has vowed to use federal law enforcement agencies to investigate or prosecute perceived enemies, including political rivals. Trump and his incoming vice president, U.S. Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. He promised roles in his administration to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a prominent Trump donor, and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The outcome defied polls that showed a razor-close race ahead of Tuesday's Election Day. Trump prevailed in at least five of the seven battleground states to push him over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency and was leading in the remaining two, Arizona and Nevada, where votes were still being tallied. Trump was also on track to become the first Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote since George W. Bush two decades ago. His fellow Republicans wrested control of the U.S. Senate from Democrats and had added to their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, though the outcome there may not be known for several days with dozens of races still uncalled. It was a hell of a good day, said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate Republican leader. Unified Republican control on Capitol Hill would clear the way for major portions of Trump's legislative agenda, as it did in the first two years of his 2017-2021 presidency when Republicans whipped a major tax-cut bill through Congress that mainly benefited the wealthy. America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate, Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida. Major stock markets around the world rallied following Trump's victory, and the dollar was set for its biggest one-day jump since 2020. OVERCOMING ODDS Trump was elected despite persistently low approval ratings, four criminal indictments and a civil judgment against him for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime when a New York jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star. Trump's political career appeared over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat. His efforts to reverse his defeat led to two separate indictments, though all the criminal cases against him are expected to end after his victory. Trump swept away challengers inside his party and then beat Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed falsely was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration. Trump's win will have major implications for U.S. trade and climate change policies, Americans' taxes and immigration, and U.S. foreign policy, including in the Middle East and Ukraine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump, and they discussed the Iranian threat and the need to work together for Israel's security, Netanyahu's office said. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, called for an end to the blind support for Israel from the United States. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed Trump's commitment to peace through strength, while the Kremlin said it would wait and see if his victory could help end the war in Ukraine more quickly. Trump had said he could end the war in 24 hours but has not offered a detailed plan. Trump's tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and U.S. allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon U.S. debt, economists say. A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as immigration, race, gender and reproductive rights. Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally. Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel the victory. Trump's support among women, whose backing Democrats had counted on, improved from four years ago. And his loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force, according to Edison Research exit polls. Meanwhile, many Democratic-leaning voters appear to have stayed home this year. The number of votes cast in counties that supported Trump in 2020 and where nearly all ballots have been tallied grew by almost 2% this year, while votes cast in counties that supported Biden four years ago dropped almost 5%.\", 'summary': \"Defying all odds and overcoming multiple controversies, Donald Trump has been re-elected as the President of the United States.

According to reports, the ED was conducting a pan-India search against subsidiaries and sellers of leading e-commerce players. Nearly 24 such seller locations were being raided by the regulator in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. As per sources, the ED investigation was underway related to alleged Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations. The ED raids aim to find evidence related to alleged money laundering activities that may have been facilitated through online e-commerce platforms. The regulator or e-commerce players did not immediately comment. Amazon and Flipkart have previously faced scrutiny in the country regarding their business practices. In September, a probe by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) reportedly found that Amazon and Flipkart breached local competition laws by favouring specific sellers on their platforms. Meanwhile, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, is also examining numerous complaints related to the use of \"dark patterns\" and planning a crackdown on online e-commerce companies violating consumer protection laws. The use of \"dark patterns\" by online platforms has created controversy in India. These deceptive techniques mislead people into doing something they do not wish to do, such as paying for items or services they did not intend to buy. The Indian government recently released draft guidelines to curb \"dark patterns\" used by big online platforms. The Digital India Act is also equipped to regulate \"dark patterns\" on the internet through user safety provisions. Aiming to guard customers from fake online reviews of products, the government has also issued a comprehensive set of guidelines.

Academic highflyer and successful lawyer Usha Vance, the child of Indian immigrants, is the wife of Trump\\'s running mate J.D. Vance. While 38-year-old Usha Vance was born and brought up in suburban San Diego, those in the village of her paternal ancestors in India\\'s southern Andhra Pradesh state prayed that historic ties would bring improvements to their land. \"We feel happy,\" said Srinivasa Raju, 53, a resident of Vadluru, a village of white-washed homes scattered amongst palm trees, more than 13,450 (8,360 miles) from the White House in Washington. \"We support Trump.\" Villagers had offered prayers for a Trump win, and Hindu priest Appaji said he hoped Usha Vance would do something in return. \"We expect her to help our village,\" the 43-year-old priest said, dressed in flowing saffron robes, after lighting a candle at the idol of Hindu elephant-headed deity Ganesh for Trump. \"If she can recognise her roots and do something good for this village, then that would be great.\" \\'Very fine\\' Usha Vance\\'s great-grandfather moved out of Vadluru and her father Chilukuri Radhakrishnan -- a PhD holder -- was brought up in the Indian city of Chennai, before going on to study in the United States. \"Every Indian -- not just myself, every Indian -- we feel proud of Usha, because she is of Indian origin,\" said 70-year-old Venkata Ramanayy. \"We hope she will develop our village.\" She has never visited the village, but the priest said her father came around three years ago and checked on the temple\\'s condition. \"We have already seen the governance of Trump -- very good,\" Ramanayy said. \"Indian and American relations were very fine during the presidency of Trump.\" Little is known about Radhakrishnan\\'s initial years in the United States, but the film of J.D. Vance\\'s memoirs, Hillbilly Elegy, refers to him coming to the country with \"nothing\". Millions of Indians have made similar journeys as the Chilukuris, and according to the most recent US census, Indians have become the country\\'s second-largest Asian ethnicity, growing 50 percent to 4.8 million in the decade to 2020.

The court specified that when vacancies exist, authorities cannot unreasonably deny appointments to qualified candidates within the consideration list.\"Recruiting bodies subject to the extant rules may devise appropriate procedure for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end provided the procedure so adopted is transparent, non-discriminatory, non-arbitrary and has a rationale nexus to the object sought to be achieved,\" Justice Mishra said.The ruling also addressed a question about government job appointment criteria, which a three-judge bench had referred to in March 2013. The earlier bench had referenced a 1965 verdict emphasising the principle against state altering the \\'rules of the game\\'.\"Whether such a principle should be applied in the context of the \\'rules of the game\\' stipulating the procedure for selection more particularly when the change sought is to impose a more rigorous scrutiny for selection requires an authoritative pronouncement of a larger bench of this court,\" the three-judge bench had said.In other significant rulings during the day, the apex court ordered the liquidation of all assets belonging to the Jet Airways airline operator, setting aside the NCLAT verdict approving transfer of grounded air carrier Jet Airways to Jalan Kalrock Consortium.Read more: SC sets aside NCLAT decision, orders liquidation of Jet Airways\\' assets', 'summary': 'The Supreme Court ruled that public sector job criteria cannot be changed mid-recruitment unless rules permit, emphasizing transparency.

He will be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, which will be his second term in this post.Earlier, Donald Trump was the President of the United States from 2016 to 2020. He had to face defeat in the election field for his second consecutive term from Democratic candidate Joe Biden. A few months before the US presidential election, Joe Biden withdrew from contesting for a second term, after which the Democratic Party declared Kamala Harris as its candidate.This will be only the second instance of a president serving two non-consecutive terms in the White House, the first in over 100 years. Grover Cleveland served as a non-consecutive president in 1884 and 1892. Trump had earlier served as US President from 2016 to 2020.Aiyar also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rapport with Trump. “I also recognize that there is a special rapport at a personal level between PM Modi and Trump, which I think reflects very badly on PM Modi and his personal preferences,” said Aiyar.Aiyar has been known for his candid and sometimes provocative opinions, which have sparked debates and discussions in Indian politics. The relationship between PM Modi and Donald Trump has been a subject of interest for many. While PM Modi has been known to maintain a diplomatic stance, his rapport with Trump has raised eyebrows. During Trump’s presidency, PM Modi invited him to the “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston in 2019, where a crowd of 50,000 attendees impressed Trump. This was followed by Trump’s visit to India in 2020, where he was welcomed with the “Namaste Trump” rally, organized by PM Modi in Ahmedabad, with 100,000 people in attendance.However, it’s worth noting that PM Modi has also been cautious in his interactions with Trump, particularly during the 2024 US presidential elections. Despite Trump’s claims of a potential meeting, PM Modi avoided engaging with either Trump or Kamala Harris during his US visit in September 2024. This decision was likely made to maintain a neutral stance and avoid any perceived endorsement of either candidate. Aiyar also expressed grief over Kamala Harris’s defeat. He said that Kamala Harris, who would have won, would have been the first woman and the first politician from India to become president. This would have been a historic and positive step.“As for Kamala Harris, she was given a very short time. She came up from behind. She was performing extremely well.

Despite Mr. Trump’s claims of a potential meeting, PM Modi avoided engaging with both presidential candidates during his U.S. visit in September 2024. \\n\\nMr. Aiyar also expressed grief over Kamala Harris’s defeat. He said that Kamala Harris, who would have won, would have been the first woman and the first politician from India to become President.\\n\\n“This would have been a historic and positive step. As for Kamala Harris, she was given a very short time. She came up from behind. She was performing extremely well. But it seems that very deep fault lines in American society ultimately coalesced against her, and she lost in this race,” said Mr. Aiyar.', 'summary': 'The former diplomat criticises Donald Trump’s character and expresses disappointment over his victory in U.S. presidential election', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-man-of-such-doubtful-character-says-ex-diplomat-mani-shankar-aiyar-on-donald-trumps-win/article68840012.ece', 'image': 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/kerala/ji8xcq/article67496932.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/vbk-Mani%20Shankar%20Aiyar.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 07:26:58', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.084}, {'id': 263231732, 'title': 'Trump Preps Team, Gets Biden Invite to White House to Discuss Transition', 'text': 'President Joe Biden extended an invitation to President-elect Donald Trump to discuss the transition of power, after Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to support a peaceful transition.Vice President Kamala Harris delivered an impassioned concession speech last night, confirming that she had congratulated Trump on his victory and assured him of her commitment to an orderly transfer of authority. \"We must accept the results of this election,\" she told supporters. \"We owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution.\"According to the Washington Post, President-elect Trump has already begun preparing his administration, with advisors reportedly narrowing down candidates for key Cabinet roles.

Our institutions no longer belong to our people, they do the bidding of monopolists. Lakhs of businesses have been decimated, and India is unable to generate jobs for her youth. Bharat Mata is mother to all her children. The monopolisation of her resources and power, this blatant denial of the many for the sake of a chosen few, has wounded her,” Rahul Gandhi wrote.\\n\\nThe opinion piece further read: “I know that hundreds of India’s brilliant and dynamic business leaders are scared of the monopolists. Are you one of them? Scared to talk on the phone? Scared of the monopolists colluding with the state to enter your sector and crush you?

The study, conducted by Osaka University, suggests that HSPs – an estimated 26% of the adult population – are more susceptible to stress due to their heightened sensitivity to emotional and physical stimuli, such as noise, light and other environmental stressors.\\nLed by Tomohiro Ioku, the research, published in the Japanese Journal of Applied Psychology, analysed responses from 270 Japanese workers. The findings indicated that HSPs reported significantly higher levels of stress and a tendency to feel alienated in workplace settings. \\nIoku commented on the unexpected prevalence of stress among HSPs in the workforce, saying, “Our study found that HSPs in the workplace tend to feel more stress and approximately 26% of working adults could be classified as HSPs. This is surprising because it suggests a substantial portion of the workforce might be experiencing higher levels of stress.”\\nThe concept of Highly Sensitive Persons was first introduced by psychologist Elaine Aron, who defined them as individuals with sensory processing sensitivity (SPS). According to Aron, HSPs not only respond intensely to physical surroundings but are also more affected by emotional stimuli, often feeling overwhelmed by bright lights, loud sounds or emotionally charged social environments. This can create unique challenges in typical work environments where overstimulation and high demands are common.\\nDespite the stress-related challenges, the study also identified some potential advantages for HSPs, particularly in their elevated levels of empathy. Senior researcher Eiichiro Watamura pointed out that this heightened empathy can be a valuable asset in professions requiring strong interpersonal skills, saying, “Our findings indicate that while HSPs are more susceptible to stress, their high levels of empathy can be a valuable asset to organisations, particularly in roles that require strong interpersonal skills.”\\nWatamura also noted that companies that recognise and adapt to the needs of HSPs could see improvements in employee satisfaction and reduced turnover. By fostering a supportive work environment, organisations can better accommodate HSPs while also benefiting from their unique strengths.\\nLead researcher Ioku suggested that understanding the traits of HSPs could help companies enhance employee retention and overall workplace wellbeing. “Considering the needs of HSPs could ultimately foster a more harmonious and productive workplace environment,” he said.', 'summary': 'The research analysed responses from 270 Japanese workers.', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/viral/this-group-of-people-faces-higher-stress-levels-in-workplace-study-9112582.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/untitled-design-2024-11-07t175357.356-2024-11-5c5a3a7084502545ee91ee761e1c380c-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 12:28:20', 'author': 'News18,Sahas', 'authors': ['News18', 'Sahas'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.139}, {'id': 263307714, 'title': 'First Character Poster Of Seetha Payanam Reveals Arjun Sarja As Giri', 'text': 'Arjun Sarja, known as the action star of South cinema is returning to the big screens with another exciting project titled Seetha Payanam.

In an order passed on November 5, a bench headed by Justice Rekha Palli observed that the petition, which was pending since 2019, was therefore infructuous and the petitioner would be be entitled to take all actions in respect of the book as available in law. The Centre banned the import of the Booker Prize-winning author's The Satanic Verses for law-and-order reasons in 1988, after Muslims across the world viewed it as blasphemous. Petitioner Sandipan Khan had argued in court that he was unable to import the book on account of a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on October 5, 1988, banning its import into the country in accordance with the Customs Act, but the same was neither available on any official website nor with any of the authorities concerned. What emerges is that none of the respondents could produce the said notification dated 05.10.1988 with which the petitioner is purportedly aggrieved and, in fact, the purported author of the said notification has also shown his helplessness in producing a copy of the said notification during the pendency of the present writ petition since its filing way back in 2019, the bench, also comprising Justice Saurabh Banerjee, observed. In the light of the aforesaid circumstances, we have no other option except to presume that no such notification exists, and therefore, we cannot examine the validity thereof and dispose of the writ petition as infructuous, it concluded. Besides assailing the ban notification, the petitioner had sought to set aside other related directions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1988. The petition had also sought directions to enable him to import the book from its publisher or international e-commerce websites.

This is the lowest pace of growth in at least the last eight years with the exception of the Covid year (FY21).The sales slowdown last fiscal is primarily due to the slowing down of cash cow business of smartphones where Samsung’s revenue increased by 1% at Rs 71,283 crore amidst a subdued market and return of the Chinese competition led by Xiaomi and Vivo. In FY23, the business had grown by 27%. As per market tracker Counterpoint Research, India’s smartphone shipments remained flat in 2023.

In fact, in FY23 the company’s net profit had declined by 10%. “Samsung India has clearly mastered their operational playbook -- the 2.3% reduction in expenses, particularly in materials and finance costs, speaks volumes about their supply chain optimization and working capital management,” said Mohit Yadav, founder of business intelligence firm AltInfo. “This is textbook execution in a challenging market when revenue growth was only single digit,” he said.

Unpredictable weather patterns have exposed weaknesses in the models used to price risk as golf ball-sized hailstones on solar panels and lightning strikes on wind turbines have left insurers with much bigger bills than expected. Climate scientists have said violent weather is more likely because of global warming that COP29 climate talks will seek to address in Baku next week. Insurers have learnt the hard way in the last three-to-four years, there have been some devastating claims, Alex Nelson, class underwriter at Lloyd's insurer Chaucer, said, referring to renewable energy insurance. There is an opportunity as well as a cost, especially as insurers pass on their liabilities to clients. They can at the same time fend off some of the pressure from investors to improve their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials. As a result, while some insurers have stopped home insurance in some catastrophe-hit areas, more are offering cover for renewables. It enables them to carry on supporting the energy sector by saying they're supporting the energy transition, Tom Sexton, head of renewables and energy at broker McGill and Partners, said. New entrants into renewable energy insurance in recent months have included global property insurer FM, Fidelis unit Novagen and energy insurer Volt Underwriting. Lloyd's insurer Beazley said it started direct underwriting of renewable energy this year. Major insurers Allianz, Hiscox and Zurich also told Reuters the market was growing. UK commercial insurers outside Lloyd's of London saw their premium income from renewable energy insurance jump 43% in 2023, to 532 million pounds ($690.7 million), the International Underwriting Association said. Lloyd's of London also said its renewable energy sector grew in 2023. The premium hikes for onshore renewable energy installations in areas hit by natural catastrophes contrast sharply with declining rates in most other commercial insurance lines, data from Marsh showed. The risks are nevertheless mounting. Increasingly large infrastructure can also be an issue as the world seeks to speed the transition to low carbon energy and taller offshore wind turbines with longer blades are more vulnerable to lightning strikes. Authorities closed beaches on the south shore of Nantucket Island in Massachusetts after debris washed up from a broken wind turbine in July. Manufacturers competing on price and size...has led to some quality issues, said Steven Munday, natural resources energy leader at broker Willis Towers Watson. Hurricanes Helene and Milton that struck Florida in September and October respectively are also likely to result in catastrophic losses for onshore renewable energy, Penny Seach, group chief underwriting officer at insurer Zurich, said. Zurich said on Thursday its total losses from the hurricanes may come in at just under $360 million. Giant hailstones caused insurance losses totalling $5.5 billion in northern Italy last year, according to the Swiss Re Institute, with solar panels on ageing rooftops considered particularly vulnerable.\", 'summary': 'Renewable energy insurance premiums have surged by 20%-40% as insurers grapple with substantial claims from natural disasters.

He leveraged a technicality in New York’s housing laws, and when the hotel’s owners, the Unification Church, missed a critical hearing, he argued that they could not legally evict him despite not paying rent.The New Yorker Hotel, an iconic Art Deco building from 1930, is known for its large red sign and historical ties to famous personalities. Muhammad Ali and other boxers used to stay there when they had bouts in the nearby Madison Square Garden. Famous inventor Nikola Tesla also said to stay in one of the rooms of the hotel for over a decade. The hotel closed in 1972 and served church purposes until part of it reopened in 1994.In February, Barreto was charged with 24 counts, including felony fraud and criminal contempt, after allegedly forging a deed that falsely transferred ownership of the hotel to himself. Barreto reportedly attempted to collect rent from a hotel tenant and even sought control of the hotel's bank accounts.However, Barreto has since been found unfit to stand trial. Doctors determined he was not mentally competent to face the charges, and prosecutors confirmed this assessment during a court hearing. Judge Cori Weston has given Barreto until November 13 to secure inpatient psychiatric care.

With key wins in several swing states, Trump amassed enough electoral votes to reclaim the presidency, becoming the first president since Grover Cleveland to serve nonconsecutive terms.\\n\\nTrump Declares ‘Magnificent Victory’\\n\\nCBS News projected that Trump’s win in Wisconsin pushed him over the required 270 electoral votes, giving him a total of 291 after clinching Michigan. Early projections also showed Trump winning the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.\\n\\n“I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,” Trump said during his victory speech at his election headquarters in Florida, flanked by his family and running mate, Senator J.D. Vance. “Every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family, and for your future. Every single day, I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body.”\\n\\nAt 78, Trump will become the oldest president to assume office. His victory speech emphasized unity and a commitment to all Americans, signaling his intent to address the nation’s challenges head-on.\\n\\nHigh Voter Turnout Surpasses Previous Elections\\n\\nEarly estimates indicate that voter turnout in the 2024 election may have surpassed the record levels seen in 2020, where approximately 66 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. States like Georgia and Michigan reported exceptionally high participation.\\n\\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger anticipated more than 5 million votes, exceeding the state’s 2020 numbers. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson expressed hope for breaking previous turnout records, noting the clear enthusiasm among voters.\\n\\nKey Demographic Shifts Favor Trump\\n\\nExit polls revealed significant shifts in voter demographics favoring Trump, particularly among Latino voters. A national exit poll conducted by Edison Research showed that 45 percent of Latino respondents voted for Trump, a 13-point increase from his performance in 2020.\\n\\nIn crucial battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, Trump made substantial gains with Latino voters. Notably, in Nevada – a state where one-third of the population identifies as Latino. Trump and Harris each secured 47 percent of the Latino vote.\\n\\nHarris Concedes, Urges Supporters to Stay Engaged\\n\\nVice President Kamala Harris did not make a public appearance on Election Night, canceling her planned event at Howard University. On Wednesday afternoon, she addressed a gathering of supporters and students at the university.\\n\\n“Do not despair,” Harris urged the emotional crowd. “This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.”\\n\\nRepublicans Regain Control of the Senate\\n\\nIn addition to the presidential victory, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate. CBS News projects the GOP will have a majority in the upper chamber after flipping seats in Ohio and West Virginia.\\n\\nOhio: Three-term incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown (D) lost to Republican businessman Bernie Moreno by four percentage points. Brown was the last Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio.West Virginia: Governor Jim Justice (R) won the open seat vacated by retiring Senator Joe Manchin (I).\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer acknowledged the shift in power, calling for continued bipartisanship. “As I’ve said time and again, in both the majority and the minority, the only way to get things done in the Senate is through bipartisan legislation while maintaining our principles – and the next two years will be no different,” Schumer stated.\\n\\nControl of the House Remains Uncertain\\n\\nWhile Republicans celebrated victories in the presidential race and the Senate, control of the U.S. House of Representatives remains undetermined.

I anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security.”Former Vice President Mike Pence offered his “sincere congratulations” to Trump, despite having declined to endorse him during the campaign.Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extended their congratulations to Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, emphasizing the importance of respecting democratic processes and the peaceful transfer of power.\\n\\nVoter Decisions on Ballot Measures\\n\\nVoters across several states made crucial decisions on ballot measures:\\n\\nAbortion Rights:Approved: Colorado, Maryland, and New York voters passed measures to enshrine abortion access in their state constitutions.Rejected: In conservative South Dakota, a proposal to establish abortion access was soundly defeated. In Florida, an amendment to protect abortion rights failed to reach the required 60 percent majority, marking a significant victory for pro-life advocates.Marijuana Legalization:Florida: A measure to legalize recreational marijuana did not achieve the necessary majority for adoption.Nebraska: Voters approved measures to legalize medicinal marijuana and established a commission to regulate the industry.Criminal Justice Reform:California: Proposition 36 passed, increasing penalties for fentanyl dealers and repeat shoplifters. The measure reverses part of a 2014 initiative that had relaxed penalties for nonviolent drug and property crimes.\\n\\nLooking Ahead\\n\\nWith the presidential and Senate races concluded, attention now turns to the final results in the House and the implications for the nation’s political landscape. The incoming administration faces a country marked by high voter engagement and shifting demographic support.\\n\\nCalls for unity and bipartisan cooperation have emerged from leaders across the political spectrum. As President-elect Trump prepares to assume office, the nation awaits his policy agenda and the strategies he will employ to address pressing issues such as the economy, healthcare, and foreign relations.\\n\\nControl of the House will play a pivotal role in shaping the legislative path forward. Both parties acknowledge the challenges ahead and the necessity of working together to achieve common goals.\\n\\nWhat Americans Rejected\\n\\nAmericans rejected the Democrat presidential coup, the installation of the worst possible candidate by the elites, constant lawfare, kangaroo courts, open borders, profligate spending, spiraling crime, stupid dehumanization, the never-Trump republicans, and political and media lies and coverups, plus much more.\\n\\nThe establishment Democrats, establishment Republicans and corporate media are expected to learn nothing from this.\\n\\nToday, MAGA Americans and the non MAGA voters who saw through the anti-Trump rhetoric are saying “God bless Donald Trump,” and “God bless America.” Donald Trump has four years to make good on his promises and to bring the country together.

The Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to cut interest rates to 4.75% from 5%, a stronger majority than expectations in a Reuters poll for a 7-2 vote in favour of a cut. Catherine Mann dissented, preferring to keep rates on hold. We need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can't cut interest rates too quickly or by too much, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said in a statement. But if the economy evolves as we expect it's likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here, he added, broadly echoing his language after September's meeting. The BoE predicted that finance minister Rachel Reeves' budget last week - which entails big increases in tax, spending and borrowing - would boost the size of Britain's economy by around 0.75% next year but barely improve annual growth rates in two or three years' time. Her plan was likely to add just under half of a percentage point to the rate of inflation at its peak in just over two years' time, the BoE said, causing inflation to take a year longer to return sustainably to its 2% target. The BoE's cautious language on the future interest rate cuts was similar to previous months, in keeping with investors' view that it is likely to cut interest rates more slowly than the European Central Bank. The BoE did not refer to Donald Trump's U.S. election victory, which has prompted a big reduction in bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates aggressively. Financial markets on Wednesday were pricing between two and three interest rate cuts from the BoE in 2025 - down from around four before the budget. The BoE said inflation was likely to rise to around 2.5% by the end of this year from 1.7% in September and hit 2.7% by the end of next year, before falling gradually below its 2% target by the end of the three-year forecast. Government decisions to raise the cap on bus fares, hike value-added tax on private school fees and increase employers' social security contributions were likely to boost inflation. With the latter measure combining with a 6.7% hike in the national minimum wage, the BoE said employers faced rising costs - although it could not be certain of the overall effect on inflation as employers might respond by sacking staff or accepting lower profits. While the BoE downgraded its forecast for average economic growth this year to 1% from 1.25%, reflecting recent revisions to past growth, it raised its forecast for 2025 to 1.5% from 1%. This reflects the stronger, and relatively front-loaded, paths for government consumption and investment more than offsetting the impact on growth of higher taxes, the BoE said. While the BoE's forecasts for growth and inflation include the impact of higher spending and taxes, they do not include the effect of a big rise in market borrowing costs since the budget as it set those assumptions beforehand and did not update them. If the now higher market interest rates were factored in, the outlook for inflation and growth would likely be a bit lower. The BoE repeated its message that monetary policy would need to stay restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target.\", 'summary': 'The Bank of England has reduced interest rates to 4.75%, marking its second cut since 2020.

The state has introduced the nation’s strictest anti-cheating, anti-conversion, and anti-riot laws. In a campaign against land encroachment, over 5,000 acres of government land have been reclaimed,” CM Dhami said.He also mentioned the development of a dedicated website to provide migrants with information about Uttarakhand and to address their concerns.The Chief Minister urged all migrants to visit their villages and ancestral homes at least once a year and contribute to their area’s development based on their expertise.NRI Uttarakhandi and Secretary of Commerce in the Government of India, Sunil Barthwal, applauded the initiative encouraging migrants to engage with their native villages. He pledged his support for Uttarakhand’s development and noted the potential for growth in organic products in the state', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/our-migrants-promoting-their-language-culture-uttarakhand-cm-dhami-at-pravasi-uttarakhandi-sammelan/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/our-migrants-promoting-their-language-culture-uttarakhand-cm-dhami-at-pravasi-uttarakhandi-sammelan.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 12:19:36', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.461}, {'id': 263310078, 'title': 'Trump’s Big Victory Energises Global Right In Europe And Latin America', 'text': \"TCF vendors\\n\\nExponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: Non-precise location data, IP addresses, Probabilistic identifiers, Device identifiers, Privacy choices, Browsing and interaction data, Users’ profilesmoreCookie duration resets each session.

However, director Allison Jones recently shared an intriguing revelation about the early stages of the show’s casting process. She disclosed that NBC producers, alongside Greg Daniels, who adapted the American version of the series, initially considered several high-profile actors, including Oscar winners Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti, for the role of Regional Manager at Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton branch. Despite these suggestions, Jones explained that the idea never progressed, as she felt these renowned actors might not be inclined to join a TV series at the time.\\nWhile appearing on Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey’s The Office Ladies Podcast, Allison recalled, “I remember vividly the first meeting we had with the network when he had a list of names and they were like, Let’s try Philip Seymour Hoffman. And then, you know, let’s go for Paul Giamatti or whatever. And I’m so jaded. I’m like, ‘They’re never going to do.’ In those days, nobody did TV. Comedy was the bottom of the barrel. So it was the bottom of the barrel.”\\nJenna Fischer, who played the receptionist, Pam Beesly added, “Some networks always had to attach a big name. I recall CBS always wanted to attach a big name to get anything going. NBC was more into standups at the time and having a deal with it. They always made deals with certain stand up comedians and develop roles for. In fact, Steve Carell at the time was under contract to a show for one of the stand ups. They had done a deal with and did a probably a nine episode.”\\nAllison Jones explained that the casting process for The Office was a bit tricky at first. Steve Carell was busy with another project, so they had to wait for him to finish before NBC could approach him. However, Nancy Perkins, who was in charge of casting at NBC Universal, always believed Steve would be the perfect choice for Michael Scott. While they couldn’t get him right away, the team didn’t stop searching. During that time, they kept auditioning other talented actors, including Patton Oswalt and Bob Odenkirk, who played Michael Scott in their unique ways.', 'summary': 'Initially The Office creators considered prominent actors, like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti, to play Michael Scott’s role.', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/movies/the-office-casting-director-had-these-2-choices-for-michael-scotts-role-before-steve-carell-9112579.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/untitled-design-2024-11-07t175447.874-2024-11-71973c01c64931be43a0dfde675d92ff-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 12:28:56', 'author': 'Kashvi Raj Singh,News18,Sahas', 'authors': ['Kashvi Raj Singh', 'News18', 'Sahas'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.441}, {'id': 263307962, 'title': 'WPL 2025 Retention: Gujarat Giants Retain 14 Players; Sneh Rana And Veda Krishnamurthy Among 6 Released', 'text': 'Gujarat Giants (GG) have retained 14 players and released 6 players ahead of the 2025 Women’s Premier League (WPL) auctions.\\nGG’s Retained Players List –\\n\\nBeth Mooney\\nAshleigh Gardner\\nLaura Wolvaardt\\nDayalan Hemalatha\\nTanuja Kanwer\\nShabnam Shakil\\nPhoebe Litchfield\\nPriya Mishra\\nTrisha Poojitha\\nMannat Kashyap\\nMeghna Singh\\n\\nGG’s Released Players List – \\n\\nKathryn Bryce\\nVeda Krishnamurthy\\nTarannum Pathan\\n\\nGG’s Remaining Purse For WPL Auction\\n4.4 Crore INR\\nWhere GG Finished In WPL 2024\\nGujarat Giants finished last in the points table having won just two games in the entire season.', 'summary': 'Gujarat Giants Player Retention Update: Check out the full list of retained players announced by GG ahead of the WPL 2025 auction.', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/cricket/wpl-2025-retention-gujarat-giants-retain-14-players-sneh-rana-and-veda-krishnamurthy-among-6-released-9112480.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/gujarat-giants_harleen-deol-2024-11-21249a2552f5aeed1eba596799f7849b-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 12:29:57', 'author': 'News18,Ritayan Basu', 'authors': ['News18', 'Ritayan Basu'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.186}, {'id': 263310058, 'title': 'Israel signs 5.2-bln-USD deal to purchase 25 F-15 fighter jets', 'text': 'JERUSALEM, Nov 7:\\nThe Israeli Defense Ministry announced Thursday that it has signed a 5.2-billion-U.S. dollar deal with U.S.-based Boeing to acquire 25 advanced F-15 fighter jets.\\nThe ministry said in a statement that the deal is part of a broader aid package approved by the U.S. administration and Congress earlier this year.

In a statement released shortly after Trump’s electoral victory, Hamas called on the new administration to prioritize an immediate cessation of hostilities in Gaza, signaling the group’s hope that Trump would address the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict with renewed urgency.\\n\\nHamas Responds to Trump’s Election Win\\n\\nFollowing the announcement of Donald Trump’s win over Vice President Kamala Harris, Hamas quickly responded to the election results, urging the president-elect to act on public calls for an end to the violence. In their statement, Hamas emphasized the ongoing “Israeli aggression” in Gaza, underscoring the importance of halting what they describe as a “war of genocide and aggression” against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.\\n\\n“The U.S. public has raised their voices for over a year, demanding action on the aggression in Gaza,” Hamas said in their statement. The group urged Trump to listen to these calls and work toward peace in the region, specifically calling on him to end U.S. support for Israel’s military operations.\\n\\nTrump’s Advice to Netanyahu: End the Conflict Before January 20\\n\\nThe statement from Hamas comes amid reports that Trump had already shared his views on the conflict with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to the Times of Israel, Trump, during a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago estate in July, urged Netanyahu to bring the military conflict to an end before his inauguration on January 20. This aligns with the broader international push for a ceasefire in Gaza, which has seen escalating violence in recent months.\\n\\nHamas’s call for a ceasefire is framed not just as a demand to stop hostilities but as part of a larger request for a shift in U.S. policy under Trump. They emphasized the need for the U.S. to cease its “military support and political cover” for what they term the “Zionist entity,” referring to Israel. The group’s statement also included a call for the Trump administration to recognize what they described as the “legitimate rights” of Palestinians.\\n\\nHamas Demands from the U.S. Government\\n\\nIn their official statement, Hamas laid out a series of specific demands aimed at the incoming Trump administration. These demands included a cessation of U.S. military assistance to Israel, an end to the perceived aggression against Lebanon, and an active effort to stop the “genocide” and military aggression against Palestinians. Hamas further reiterated its stance on Palestinian sovereignty, reaffirming its commitment to a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\\n\\n“The legitimate rights of our people must be recognized,” the group declared, reaffirming its longstanding opposition to any peace solution that would compromise Palestinians’ right to “freedom, independence, self-determination,” and the creation of an independent state.\\n\\nHamas’s Commitment to Resistance\\n\\nHamas also emphasized its unwavering resistance to what it views as the “hateful Israeli occupation.” The group’s stance remains firm: it will not accept any solutions that involve compromising on Palestinian rights or accepting the continued presence of Israel in Palestinian territories.\\n\\nThis call for a hardline approach to the Israeli occupation fits within the broader context of Hamas’s long-standing opposition to Israel’s existence as a state. The group’s ideology and policy, as seen in its statements, remain grounded in the idea that Palestine should be free from Israeli control, with Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\\n\\nContrast with the Biden Administration’s Policy\\n\\nThe Trump administration’s stance on Israel has been a subject of global debate. While President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris have maintained a generally pro-Israel approach, there have been occasional calls for restraint. For example, in October, President Biden urged a ceasefire just before Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) operations commenced in Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Hamas statement, however, represents a clear call for a policy shift away from the United States’ historical support for Israel’s military actions. As Trump prepares to take office, the international community will closely monitor whether the U.S. will heed Hamas’s request or continue its tradition of supporting Israel’s right to self-defense.\\n\\nWill Trump Respond to Hamas’s Plea?\\n\\nAs Trump’s inauguration approaches, the world will be watching to see whether his administration will take up Hamas’s demands and push for a resolution to the conflict in Gaza. With tensions in the region remaining high, the future of U.S. involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains uncertain. Whether Trump’s policies will align more closely with the demands of groups like Hamas or continue the status quo of unwavering support for Israel is a question that will likely define his Middle East approach in the coming years.', 'summary': 'The Palestinian militant group Hamas has issued a direct plea to the future leader of the United States as Trump prepares for his second term.\\n\\n\\nThe post Hamas Urges Donald Trump to End Gaza Conflict After US Election Result appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/us-elections-2024/hamas-urges-donald-trump-to-end-gaza-conflict-after-us-election-result/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Donald-Trump-13.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-07 12:33:26', 'author': 'Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.142}, {'id': 263309430, 'title': 'Why Are Americans Stockpiling Abortion Pills And Hormones After Trump Win?', 'text': 'On Wednesday, the news of Donald Trump’s presidential election win sent a wave of anxiety across the United States, particularly among those seeking reproductive and trans health services. Rebecca Gomperts, the founder of Aid Access—the country’s largest provider of abortion pills by mail—was in Paris with her team, ready for action. Despite the team’s usual remote operations, they had convened in person to prepare for potential surges in requests. Their preparations proved accurate as the outcome of the election sparked an overwhelming demand for services.\\n\\nUnprecedented Demand for Abortion Pills\\n\\nFollowing Trump’s victory, Aid Access saw an unprecedented spike in demand for abortion pills, with more than 5,000 requests within just 12 hours—far surpassing even the surge seen after the fall of Roe v. Wade. Gomperts noted that the influx was unlike anything they had experienced before. As she monitored requests, she observed a rapid increase in inquiries, confirming the heightened urgency among those seeking access to abortion services. “We’ve never seen this before,” she said.\\n\\nThis surge was not isolated to Aid Access; other healthcare providers also faced similar pressures. Wisp, a telehealth service for women’s health, reported a 300% rise in requests for emergency contraception, while Plan C, a site dedicated to locating abortion pills, saw its traffic skyrocket by 625%. Elisa Wells, the co-founder of Plan C, remarked that these spikes indicated that many individuals were bracing for what they anticipated would be a “reproductive apocalypse” under a Trump administration.\\n\\nPrepared for a New Reality\\n\\nFor Gomperts and her team at Aid Access, the surge in demand wasn’t entirely surprising. Having expanded their international abortion pill service to the U.S. during Trump’s first term, they had long anticipated the potential challenges ahead. The service, which connects physicians in states where abortion is legal with patients in more restrictive states, had grown to a team of eight physicians operating across four states, supported by a round-the-clock help desk. Despite their preparedness, Gomperts acknowledged that the volume of requests on Wednesday was five times greater than a typical day.\\n\\nWidespread Panic and Stockpiling of Abortion Pills\\n\\nThe fear surrounding reproductive rights extended beyond abortion pills. Wisp, a prominent online health provider, reported tripling its sales of emergency contraception by mid-morning on Wednesday, with bulk orders of Plan B rising sharply. Similarly, other women’s health services saw a dramatic increase in demand, with Winx, for example, selling six times more Plan B doses than it had in the previous week. Cynthia Plotch, co-founder of Winx, reflected on the growing awareness, stating, “Women are smart… We see what is coming, and we are protecting ourselves.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dr. Crystal Beal, who operates QueerDoc—a service that provides hormone treatments to trans individuals—faced an overwhelming number of inquiries. Trans patients, concerned about losing access to hormones and gender-affirming care under a second Trump administration, reached out to Beal’s service in unprecedented numbers. By Wednesday afternoon, QueerDoc had received more messages than it typically handles in an entire week. Beal shared that many patients were considering stocking up on hormones or altering their legal documents to protect themselves, though she emphasized the personal nature of such decisions.\\n\\n Standing Strong Amid Uncertainty\\n\\nDespite the mounting uncertainty, the providers spoke to the resilience and determination of their patients. Beal reassured her clients that, regardless of the legal landscape, “trans people have always been here, and we will continue to persist.” Similarly, Wells, from Plan C, received a donation with a note of encouragement: “Don’t let the bastards get you down.” All the health providers emphasized their commitment to continuing services as long as they were legally able, with some even vowing to resist, should the law change.\\n\\nIn the face of a potentially hostile administration, the message from healthcare providers like Gomperts, Wells, Beal, and others is clear: they will not back down, and they will continue to fight for access to vital healthcare services, no matter the political landscape.\\n\\nWith inputs from online reports\\n\\nRead More: What Would Trump’s Return Mean For Abortion Rights In US', 'summary': \"In the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, healthcare providers faced a surge in demand for reproductive and trans health services as Americans scrambled to secure access before potential policy changes.

In the Tiktok ban announcement, the government said it would “act decisively when investments threaten our national security.”\\n\\nEarlier in March, in the Policy Statement on Foreign Investment Review in the Interactive Digital Media Sector, the government underlined that “hostile state-sponsored or influenced actors may seek to leverage foreign investments in the interactive digital media sector to propagate disinformation or manipulate information in a manner that is injurious to Canada’s national security.”\\n\\nCanada considers the following factors while assessing a platform’s threat to national security\\n\\nthe reach and audience of the product’s content;\\n\\nwhether the products have online elements (such as in-game chat logs, in-game purchases, microphone/camera access)\\n\\nthe nature and extent of the investor’s ties to a foreign government\\n\\nwhether the Canadian business is likely to be used as a vehicle by a foreign state to propagate disinformation or censor information in a manner that is inconsistent with Canadian rights and values through the investment\\n\\nthe composition of the board of directors of the Canadian business\\n\\nthe degree of control or influence the investor would likely exert on the Canadian business, including its products’ content\\n\\nIt is worth noting that under Chinese law, ByteDance must report to an internal committee composed of Chinese Communist Party members. The Chinese government holds a 1% stake in ByteDance’s subsidiary, Beijing Douyin Information Service. Under Chinese national laws, companies must share all information they collect in the People’s Republic of China with the Chinese intelligence services.\\n\\nSimilar ban in the US\\n\\nCanada has joined the US in its action against TikTok for threats to national security.\\n\\nOn March 5, the US introduced a bill to penalize app stores in the country from listing TikTok. The ban included any other application developed or provided by TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance. The bill, called “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” classifies ByteDance as a foreign adversary.

The company emphasised that it wasn’t under any sort of tax investigation in India and that it has “always paid all taxes due in India and all regions where it operates.”\\n\\nThe tax authorities have intimated an investigation into Truecaller to check its adherence to transfer pricing regulations, according to a report by Business Today. Transfer pricing is a practice where one division of a company charges another division for goods and services. This practice allows companies to save on taxes. Addressing concerns around potential transfer regulation violations, the company said that its transfer pricing policy for its intra-group transactions is consistent with the internationally accepted arm’s length standard. “The purpose is to ensure that Truecaller pays tax in a way that is correct from the perspective of both the Swedish and the Indian tax authorities,” the company explained, adding that it’s policy is continuously reviewed to ensure compliance with tax laws in both countries. \\n\\nPrevious concerns raised against Truecaller’s tax policies:\\n\\nIn 2022, financial investigative research group Viceroy Research came out with a research report on Truecaller stating that the company had failed to adhere to transfer pricing principles and was avoiding larger tax rates in India. “When the taxman comes knocking, Truecaller is a loud and proud Swedish company. Truecaller bills almost exclusively from Sweden from advertising customers/agents despite substantially all operations being in India,” the report said. \\n\\nIt explained that as of 2021, almost 80% of Truecaller revenues and over 70% of daily active users came from the Indian market. In the financial year ending in March 2021, the company reported a loss in India, despite posting large consolidated profits at the same time. \\n\\nBetween July and September 2024, the company accrued a tax of SEK 40. 3 million ($3.73 million).

One can expect other telcos to follow suit, especially considering the fact that in June last year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) instructed telecom companies to deploy AI/ML-based spam solutions.\\n\\nWhen MediaNama asked Zarringhalam about this in an interview, he explained that Truecaller would continue to stand out as a service because it has a solution that is customised to users and their preferences with respect to things such as caller IDs, caller blocking, etc. The company has since expanded its view about the subject. In a recent submission to TRAI, Truecaller suggests that not all telcos have the resources to create their own AI/ML spam solutions. As such, it urges the regulator to allow telcos to integrate with third-party applications and services that specialize in AI/ML-based spam detection.', 'summary': 'Truecaller&#8217;s Managing Director for India Rishit Jhunjhunwala will take over as the CEO of Truecaller starting January 9, 2025.

At the UN climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, developed nations were urged to at least double their adaptation funding for developing countries from about USD 19 billion in 2019 by 2025. The UN climate summit in Dubai in December 2023 repeated this call, asking developed countries to report progress in 2024. The Adaptation Gap Report 2024: Come Hell and High Water from the United Nations Environment Programme on Thursday said even achieving the Glasgow Climate Pact goal would only reduce the adaptation finance gap, estimated at USD 187-359 billion per year, by around 5 per cent. 114835801Earlier in the day, European climate change agency Copernicus said it is almost certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first with an average temperature at least 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, following the second-warmest October in history. UNEP's Emissions Gap Report, released last month, said the world is on course for a catastrophic temperature rise of 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius this century without immediate and major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. Global average temperature rise is still below 1.5 degrees Celsius, yet climate change is already hitting communities across the world hard, particularly the most poor and vulnerable. And it will get much worse... So, it is for good reason that UNEP's Adaptation Gap Report 2024 calls on nations to dramatically increase efforts to adapt to climate change, starting with a commitment to act ambitiously on adaptation finance at COP 29, UNEP's Executive Director Inger Andersen said. 114882674She said the enormous gap between adaptation finance needs and flows means that the world is failing to adapt to current impacts - with adaptation planning slowing and implementation falling behind. According to the report, 171 countries now have at least one national adaptation policy, strategy, or plan in place. Of these, 51 per cent have a second, and 20 per cent have a third. The report emphasized that adaptation financing needs to shift from reactive, incremental, and project-based actions to more anticipatory, strategic, and transformational adaptation; otherwise, it will not deliver the scale or types of adaptation needed. However, it said, this requires action in areas that are harder to finance: to support this, there is a need to use available international public finance much more strategically. Also, the question of who pays for adaptation is not being adequately addressed. In many financing arrangements, the ultimate costs of adaptation are borne by developing countries; this may help bridge the finance gap, but it is not in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities or with the polluter pays principle, the UNEP said.\", 'summary': 'International funding to aid developing nations in adapting to climate change rose to USD 28 billion in 2022. However, a significant shortfall persists between the required funding and the actual amount provided.

For the grains industry, the challenge is that this could fragment the WTO and flare up the persisting US-China tensions.\\n\\nGrainGrowers Chief Executive Officer Shona Gawel urged the Australian industry and the government to be proactive in supporting trade diversification measures and increasing engagement with South-East Asian markets.\\n\\nAustralia’s success\\n\\nThe report pointed out how Australia succeeded in exporting barley to countries such as Mexico after China imposed tariffs. It has called for increasing Australia’s Agricultural Counsellor Network which helps expand market access and address non-tariff barriers in South-East Asia. \\n\\nOn the other hand, a recent webinar organised by the Council of Food, Agricultural and Economic Resources (C-FARE) expressed concern over the US-China relationships. \\n\\nPolitical tensions between the two countries have increased affecting trade.

Her revelation left Archana Puran Singh and the audience in stitches. Kapil then said that she could’ve simply chosen not to invite them. Kajol explained her reasoning, saying, “Kyunki mujhe pata tha ki agar main nahi batati unko toh woh kahin na kahin se pata lagate ki shaadi kahan pe hai. Toh agar maine unko galat address de diya toh dhundhte hi nahi na (Because I knew that if I didn’t give them any details, they would find out the wedding location somehow.

The BJP attacked the Congress for distributing blank-page copies of the \\'Constitution of India\\' at a Rahul Gandhi event. Amid all this political war of words, the question arises who really publishes the Constitution.The latest controversy started after Rahul Gandhi\\'s Samvidhan Samman Sammelan convention in Nagpur. A video posted by the Maharashtra BJP on social media went viral after it showed books with the \\'Constitution of India\\' written on the front but containing only blank pages except for the preamble on the front page. The Congress was also accused of destroying the original Constitution, which had pictures of Lord Ram, Lord Krishna, and Chhatrapati Shivaji, apart from handing out copies of \\'Constitution\\' with blank pages. \"This said Constitution copy was distributed at Rahul Gandhi\\'s rallymeeting. It turns out to be as blank as Congress’ guarantees. Justice like Nakli Gandhi, this is Nakli. It is an insult to Sanvidhan and Babasaheb Ambedkar by Congress. They will be punished for this by people,\" said BJP spokesperson, Shehzad Poonawalla on X.The Congress has said that it was a notepad.

Albanese and Communications Minister Michelle Rowland on Thursday pledged to legislate a minimum age limit of 16 years for social media access. The Prime Minister had previously announced an intention to introduce legislation to parliament for the age limit before the end of 2024 but had not committed to a specific cut-off age. He said on Thursday that the legislation would take responsibility for enforcing the minimum age limit on social media platforms, Xinhua news agency reported. \"Social media is doing harm to our kids, and I\\'m calling time on it,\" Albanese told reporters in Canberra. \"It\\'s something of enormous concern, and we know the social harm that can be caused, and we know the consequences here.\" Under the government\\'s plan, online platforms that fail to restrict access to children will face penalties. Neither users under 16 who manage to access social media nor their parents or guardians will be penalised. The ban will come into effect 12 months after the legislation passes parliament and will be enforced by the office of the government\\'s Safety Commissioner. \"This is world-leading legislation, and we want to make sure we\\'ve got it right. We think there will be some, of course, exclusions and exemptions as well for this, to make sure that there aren\\'t unintended consequences, but we think this is absolutely the right thing,\" Albanese said. Albanese said he would discuss the proposal with state and territory leaders at a special meeting on Friday. The federal budget for 2024-25 included funding to trial potential age-assurance technology options. Albanese and Rowland said on Thursday that the results of the trial would inform how the new age limit is imposed. The federal opposition Coalition earlier in 2024 announced it would support a minimum age limit of 16. With the support of the Coalition, Albanese\\'s governing Labor Party would have the requisite votes to pass the legislation through both houses of parliament.

Greg wanted to change the entire system, the entire thinking, and the selection process,\" Patil elaborated.\"He introduced flexibility in the Indian team, and he spoiled things for Rahul Dravid, who took over from Ganguly as captain. Irfan (Pathan) was asked to move up the order. Seniors don\\'t like to change numbers, whether it is Sachin Tendulkar, Dravid, or Virender Sehwag.\"The other issue in the Greg Chappell saga was the presence of Ian Fraser as Assistant Coach. Most players didn\\'t like his presence.\"Patil said Chappell was in a hurry to introduce the Australian culture in the Indian system.\"Greg wanted to introduce the Australian culture, the Australian way of playing cricket, and the Australian way of thinking. He could\\'ve done it, but he didn\\'t bide his time. That\\'s where I think the rift started, and he was against a few seniors who were not toeing the line.\"Sourav is not a guy who will get up and start running and doing stretches. You need to give him time. I think Greg rubbed seniors the wrong way, though a few seniors didn\\'t speak openly about him - some like Kumble still haven\\'t. It\\'s the same with Dravid. Ironically, Ganguly got him in, but was instrumental in his exit,\" he wrote.Patil felt Gary Kirsten turned out to be the most successful Indian coach because of his closeness with the players.\"Gary Kirsten was very successful - you could say most successful, because his squad won the 2011 World Cup. Gary, again, was well-respected and soft-spoken. He had played against the same players and got runs. This counts, in a way.\"Having played in India, he knew what to expect.
