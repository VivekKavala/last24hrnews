                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Aortic Aneurysm

An aortic aneurysm is a condition where there is a balloon-like bulge that usually occurs due to weakening of the muscles in the aorta wall.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The aorta is the largest and most important blood vessel in the human body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Its function is to distribute oxygenated blood from the heart to all parts of the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The aorta has thick walls so it can maintain its shape even though the blood pressure inside it is relatively high.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This wall is actually strong and thick.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, in this condition, the wall becomes weak so that it is unable to withstand blood pressure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

As a result, the wall will start to enlarge.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If the wall is torn or broken, this condition can cause bleeding, and can even be fatal.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Symptoms of Aortic Aneurysm

Symptoms of an aortic aneurysm can vary depending on its location.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For example, in the abdominal aorta, chest (thoracic) or both (thoraco-abdominal).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common than thoracic or both locations.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In some conditions, aneurysms with small swelling or bulging usually do not show any symptoms.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, if it gets bigger, then the sufferer will start to feel many symptoms depending on its location.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For abdominal aneurysm sufferers, the symptoms that appear are:

Prolonged pain in the inner or side of the abdomen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Pain in the back.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
It feels like a throbbing sensation around the navel.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, the symptoms that appear if you experience a thoracic or chest aneurysm include:

Breath becomes short.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Frequent coughing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The voice becomes hoarse.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Feeling pressure and pain in the chest.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Pain in the back.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Furthermore, symptoms that may appear if the aortic aneurysm tears or ruptures (dissection), namely:

Severe pain that occurs suddenly in the back, chest, and abdomen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Difficulty breathing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The body feels very weak.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
My head felt like it was spinning.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The heart beats very fast.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Make sure a ruptured aortic aneurysm is treated immediately.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Otherwise, it can cause severe bleeding which can be fatal.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Risk Factors for Aortic Aneurysm

It is important to know the risk factors for aortic aneurysm, as this condition often appears during examinations for other conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Well, here are the various risk factors:

The risk of aortic aneurysm tends to increase with age.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Older people have a greater chance of developing an aortic aneurysm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Men are at higher risk than women.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, women who have a family history of aortic aneurysm or other risk factors are also at higher risk.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Smoking is a major risk factor for developing an aortic aneurysm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the artery walls and weaken them.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Family history

If a family member has had an aortic aneurysm, your risk of having one may increase because there are genetic factors involved.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Hypertension and heart disease

High blood pressure can damage artery walls and increase the risk of this disease.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Some congenital heart defects or medical conditions that affect blood flow in the body can also increase the risk of an aortic aneurysm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

History of infection and injury

Infections in the wall of the aorta, such as endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), can cause inflammation and damage the artery wall.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Injury to the chest or abdomen, such as in a car accident or other traumatic event, can cause damage to the aortic wall and trigger the formation of an aneurysm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Connective tissue disease

Some diseases that affect connective tissue, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, or other connective tissue diseases, can weaken the artery walls and increase the risk of aneurysm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This condition can increase pressure on the arteries and worsen the risk of aneurysm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In addition, doctors usually recommend that someone with the following criteria undergo screening:

Causes of Aortic Aneurysm

The cause of an aortic aneurysm is the weakening of one part of the blood vessel, resulting in a lump that is at risk of rupturing at any time.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The exact cause of this weakening of the blood vessels can vary from person to person, ranging from blood vessel disease, injury, to uncertain conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This condition is divided into two types, namely:

An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs along the abdominal aorta.</p>

Aortic Aneurysm Treatment

The main goal of aortic aneurysm therapy or treatment is to prevent the blood vessel from rupturing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The doctor will look at the size and other possible risk factors in the sufferer to determine the type of therapy.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>5 centimeters or more: size in the large category, usually requires surgery to prevent further enlargement or rupture of the aneurysm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In addition to regular check-ups, doctors also prescribe medication to prevent or reduce the risk of a ruptured or torn aorta.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Some types of drugs include:

Statin drugs are used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of aortic blockage due to atherosclerosis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Beta-blockers are a group of drugs that help lower blood pressure by slowing the heart rate.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Angiotensin 2 receptor blocker (ARB) drugs are used to lower blood pressure if beta blocker drugs do not provide optimal results.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Thoracic Aneurysm

Meanwhile, in thoracic aortic aneurysm, doctors provide treatment based on the size of the aneurysm, the severity of the symptoms that appear, and the risk of surgery.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Thoracic aortic aneurysm therapy includes:

Routine monitoring

This type of therapy is a therapeutic option for small aneurysms that are not at risk of rupture.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Usually, the doctor will recommend a routine CT scan or MRI every 6 months (depending on the size of the aneurysm) to see if the aneurysm is enlarged.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Because it is potentially fatal, you also need to know what first aid is like when experiencing this condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Conventional surgery

Doctors will recommend this procedure in cases where the aneurysm is large and at risk of rupture.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Conventional surgery is performed using general anesthesia and the installation of a special device (graft) to prevent blood flow from pressing on the aneurysm further.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Endovascular surgery

It is a less invasive surgical procedure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This method uses a special tool that is inserted into the aorta through a small tear or through a catheter inserted into a leg vein.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

After the surgical procedure, the doctor will usually ask the patient to be disciplined in adopting a healthy lifestyle and diet.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Not only does this habit help speed up the healing process, it also helps reduce the risk of aortic aneurysm rupture.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Also ask your doctor if you have high risk factors for this disease, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, genetics, or the bad habit of smoking.</p>
