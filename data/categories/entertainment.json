The incident sparked nationwide outrage, with several voices stressing the need to raise boys better instead of restricting girls.\n\n\"It starts at home, it starts for boys at a very tender age of 4-5 years when they start understanding the difference between a boy and a girl... how a girl should be respected... it is for mothers to understand and tell their little boys. This conversation is important to have with your child, however uncomfortable, they must be told, they must be shown the way,\" said Ms Kapoor Khan, mother to Taimur (7) and Jeh (3). She is married to actor Saif Ali Khan.\n\nThe actor said children understand actions more than words. \"If they also see their mother doing (work) things... Taimur understands now, I have told him that I am speaking at a very important event, so he is excited, he's like 'What are you gonna talk about?' When I go home, he might ask me. So we will talk about different things that I said... These conversations are important,\" she said.\n\nEarlier, while responding to a question about her son Jeh, Ms Kapoor Khan said she would want him to grow up into someone who would always stand by the truth. \"He (Jeh) has a brother, but that does not mean he does not have a (duty) to protect other girls, he will be somebody's father, husband someday so I hope he values what his mother has done for him because he sees his mother and father go to work. So he understands that it is important for women to be safe to go to work, to feel happy. These are things that he is watching every day. I want him to grow up knowing and normalising that women are equal to men and they can also be frontrunners,\" she said.",

Anna Durai gave his voice, Karunanidhi gave his voice and I told the same. They've added what I didn't say and lied. Now cases have been filed not just in Tamil Nadu but in many places across India. They asked me to apologise in the court. I said what I said is said. I am Karunanidhi's grandson and will not apologise for anything\", he said.\n\nThis is the first time Udhayanidhi Stalin has commented on this after becoming the Deputy Chief Minister.\n\nIn March he had said 'Sanatan Dharma' ought to be \"annihilated like mosquitos causing malaria and dengue.\n\nAlthough courts had made strong observations on the issue, his legal team argues that in Tamil Nadu and southern states, 'Sanatan Dharma' has always been seen through the prism of untouchability and discrimination on the basis of castes and that his comments ought to be seen in that context. They claim that had no intention to hurt any Hindu sentiment.\n\nLargely focussing on women empowerment and the ruling DMK's contribution to the cause over the years including legislation for property rights for women and monthly assistance of thousand rupees, he took on Governor RN Ravi as well on the recent issue of skipping a line from the Tamil Nadu anthem which had the word Dravida at a function he presided over.\n\nChief Minister MK Stalin elevated Udhayanidhi Stalin as Deputy Chief Minister superseding several senior ministers triggering opposition criticism of family politics and dynasty.

        "text": "A new genus and snake species discovered in the Himalayas has been named after the Academy Award-winning Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio - the \"Titanic\" star who is also a passionate environmentalist, officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe newly described snake species, \u2018Anguiculus dicaprioi' is distributed from central Nepal to Chamba district in Himachal Pradesh, whereas \u2018Anguiculus rappii' is distributed in Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThese snakes are mostly active from late May to August and are not found at other times of the year, nothing is known about the biology of the two species, and \u2018Anguiculus rappii' is rare and has not been recorded in the last couple of decades.\n\nThe snake was first found by Virender Bhardwaj in the backyard of his home in the western Himalayas during the Covid-19 Pandemic lockdown.\n\nHe posted its pictures on social media, leading to a sensation - and a three-year-long investigation coupled with laborious research - to identify the snake which resembled \u2018Liopeltis rappi', a species known to be distributed in the eastern Himalayas.\n\nHowever, the population from Himachal Pradesh differed from the true \u2018Liopeltis rappi' found in Sikkim in many aspects like the scales on the head and general colour patterns -- which was confirmed by examining specimens from natural history museums across Europe, the US and even India.\n\nBesides, the DNA sequences generated for this snake did not match any genus and the team included DNA and morphological data for other related species from all over Asia.\n\nThe complication of the molecular and morphological data suggested that the snake from HP is related to \u2018Liopeltis rappi' but differed in many aspects, to be called a new species, and both these belong to a new genus that is endemic to the Himalayas region.\n\nA research paper was authored by Zeeshan A. Mirza of Max Planck Institute for Biology at Tubingen (Germany); Virender K. Bhardwaj and H. T. Lalremsanga of Mizoram University (India); Saunak Pal of the Newcastle University (UK); Gernot Vogel of the Society for Southeast Asian Herpetology(Germany); Patrick D. Cambell of the Natural History Museum (UK) and Harshil Patel of the Thackeray Wildlife Foundation (Mumbai, India).\n\nThe research paper was submitted early this year and published recently by Scientific Reports, an international peer-reviewed journal.\n\nDiCaprio has been actively involved in creating awareness about global climate change, increased biodiversity losses and the impact of pollution on human health plus related issues.\n\n\"The specific epithet 'dicaprioi' is a patronym honouring Leonardo DiCaprio, an American actor, film producer, and environmentalist who has been actively involved in creating awareness about global climate change, increased biodiversity loss, and human health issues through pollution,\" the report explained.\n\n\"The work not only resolved the status of the Himalayan species but also resolved a taxonomic confusion regarding the genera Liopeltis and Gongylosoma that lasted 180 years. The work provides a newly revised classification of these two genera that are distributed across Asia,\" said a statement here.\n\nThe members of the genus Anguiculus are small and are currently known by two species and these snakes are found at elevations above 1500 meters across the Himalayas.\n\nThe authors said that the description of a new snake genus and species from Himachal Pradesh highlights the poor herpetofauna documentation of the western Himalayas.\n\nPreliminary field surveys across Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand suggest that the region's biodiversity has been grossly underestimated, and along with Jammu & Kashmir, remain the least explored for the herpetofauna biota they host.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The discussions are at a preliminary stage and there is no proposal before the Board of the company or its insurance subsidiaries in this regard, said Bajaj Finserv.\u201cAllianz has indicated to Bajaj that given its strategic priorities, it is actively considering an exit from the life and general insurance joint ventures. It has indicated that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market but will not speculate on alternatives,\u201d said Bajaj Finserv.Bajaj Finserv holds a 74 per cent stake each in two JVs Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. while Allianz owns the remaining.Allianz plans to exit because Bajaj Group isn\u2019t allowing the German insurer to raise its stakes at a discounted price. It also isn\u2019t given a say in strategic decisions, according to a Bloomberg report.As per a 2001 joint venture agreement, the German company had a call option to increase its stake in the life insurance joint venture to 74 per cent from 26 per cent at a predetermined price if allowed under laws and subject to regulatory approvals. If the option is exercised by July 30, 2016, the pre-determined price will be Rs 5.42 per share, plus interest at 16 per cent per annum from July 31, 2001, to the date of payment. After 2016, Allianz would have to pay the market price.Allianz is instead now looking to buy stakes in newly established insurance firms to retain a presence in the fast-growing South Asian country, said the news report.Allianz, in case it exits the joint venture, has committed full support to Bajaj in ensuring a smooth transition to the Bajaj brand keeping in mind the interest of policyholders, business partners, employees and other stakeholders of the insurance companies, the statement further said.The Bajaj Allianz general insurer is the third-largest in the country by gross written premiums, while the Bajaj Allianz life insurer is one of the fastest-growing with assets under management of Rs one lakh crore as of March 31, 2024.",

Honouring the washing stones on the Muthalakkulam ground in Kozhikode city, which are forced to suffer the beating of dhobis in the daytime and the long and tedious speeches of politicians in the evenings was one such act. When the Miss World competition was held in Bengaluru to choose the most beautiful woman in the world, Vaidyar conducted a \u2018Viroopa Rani\u2019 and \u2018Viroopa Raja\u2019 competition in Kozhikode to select the most ugly-looking people,\u201d Mr. Leelakrishnan said. He was also the first to give a \u201clife-long pension\u201d to his wife.\n\nVaidyar, an Ayurvedic medical practitioner by profession, was more famous for his social criticism and friendship with eminent writers of his time. Nilgiris, the private lodge he ran near the railway station, was a haven for many writers, Mr. Leelakrishnan recalled.\n\nHe pointed out that Malayalis were often found to preach something and practise something else. Mere criticism would not help address this attitude, and Vaidyar knew it very well. That was why he resorted to his quirky acts, Mr. Leelakrishnan said. Thus, Vaidyar became part of the great tradition of satirists in Malayalam such as Kunchan Nambiar, E.V. Krishna Pillai, Sanjayan, and VKN, he added. \n\nCalicut Press Club president E.P. Mohammed and senior journalists A. Sajeevan and Kamal Varadoor, among others, were present.",

        "text": "Megastar Amitabh Bachchan often shares sneak peeks into his daily routine on social media, along with wonderful anecdotes, while hosting the 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' show. In the latest episode of the show's 16th season, the actor engaged in foodie conversations with contestant Harsha Upadhyay and revealed his favourite dish, which is a popular street snack in Mumbai. After a food-related question, contestant Harsha Upadhyay, an arts, crafts, and music teacher from Gujarat, asks Amitabh Bachchan if he enjoys churma, reported IANS. Big B chuckles and reveals that while he may not know all the dishes, he does have a favourite snack - Vada Pav.\n\nAlso Read:Not Just Deepika Padukone, Prabhas Has Also Treated These Stars To Yummy Food\n\nTalking about his love for Vada Pav, the KBC host says, \"Usse badhkar koi cheez nahi hai, chhota sa hai par lekin itna badiya hai... har jagah milta hai - sirf desh mein hi nahi, par videsh mein bhi. [There's nothing better than Vada Pav, it is small but full of amazing flavours... you can find it everywhere - not just in India, but abroad too.]\"\n\nAlso Read:\"Biryani, Of Course, I Am A Kapoor\": Kareena Kapoor Shares Top Delhi Eats\n\nPreviously, Amitabh Bachchan revealed his favourite dessert.

It's the humble lapsi! Made with broken wheat (or dalia), lapsi is a popular sweet dish from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Further, on his 80th birthday, his wife and actor, Jaya Bachchan, was also seen treating Amitabh Bachchan with lapsi instead of cake on the sets of his reality show.",

        "text": "Mitchell Starc has started to peak just before the Border Gavaskar Trophy against India as shown by his scorching spell at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) during Sheffield Shield. While featuring for the New South Wales, Starc was a force to be reckoned with across both innings. Ahead of the highly-anticipated BGT series, where skills and patience will be tested, Starc is getting primed at the right time. He took 1/35 and 6/81 in 36.5 overs across the match. On both occasions, Starc removed Marcus Harris, one of the players in contention to open for Australia in the BGT.He took seven wickets in the match by putting his experience and skillset to optimum use. But even after his valiant display, New South Wales tasted a 141-run defeat against Victoria. NSW coach Greg Shipperd believes India could find themselves in a tough spot if the conditions are similar to the one they played in. \u201cHis pace, his rhythm, all of those things that go to engineering the sort of pace he was dealing with. He changed the game once he decided to go short and really change the dynamic of the match. And the second innings again, we thought perhaps he\u2019d done enough, but he kept coming. And so that\u2019s a good sign for Australia and troubles ahead, perhaps, on the right wicket for India,\u201d Greg said as quoted from ESPNcricinfo. On the fourth day of the match, Victoria stood victorious before lunch. Right-arm pacer Sam Elliot picked the final four scalps to end NSW\u2019s agony. He broke the stubborn partnership 63-run between Josh Philippe and Starc. Philippe scored 88. Starc was next to follow after top-edging the ball while attempting a pull. Nathan Lyon departed similarly after miscuing his pull shot, which was taken at the square leg. Elliot cleaned up Jackson Bird moments later to seal the game in Victoria\u2019s favour. (ANI)",

        "text": "Mumbai: Actress Akansha Ranjan Kapoor has recently shared her excitement about teaming up with filmmaker Vasan Bala for the film \u2018Jigra.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe film featured Akansha in a cameo alongside Alia Bhatt. The actress expressed deep appreciation for Bala, calling him as a significant guiding force in her career. Reflecting on her decision to join the film, Akansha recounted how, upon receiving Vasan\u2019s call, she didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment before agreeing to take part. The \u2018Guilty\u2019 star shared, \u201cI had an absolute blast working with Vasan Sir again. Whenever he calls me, it's a no-brainer for me to say yes, and it was the same with Jigra. I remember he called me one fine day and told me that I had a one-day shoot, and I immediately signed up for it. He\u2019s always been a guiding force in my career. The fact that this short scene is getting so much love from the audience, and that people are tagging me everywhere, feels amazing.\u201d In \u2018Jigra\u2019, Akansha portrayed a quirky air hostess who brings a much-needed dose of levity to the story. Clad in a sharp uniform, she makes a striking impression. Her standout moment comes in a scene with Alia Bhatt, where she serves food to Bhatt\u2019s character.\r\n\r\nThe film, produced by Karan Johar, also starred Vedang Raina in a pivotal role. The film was released on October 11. In terms of work, Akansha is known for her impressive performances in the films like \u2018Guilty\u2019, \u2018Ray\u2019, and \u2018Monica, O My Darling.\u2019 Jigra marked the actress\u2019 fourth collaboration with Vasan Bala. Kapoor is all set to make her South debut with the upcoming film \u2018Maaya One\u2019 alongside Sundeep Kishan.\r\n\r\nIn the film, which is also said to be Akanksha\u2019s first appearance on the silver screen, Kishan reprises his role as crime inspector, Kumaran. She also has many exciting OTT projects in her kitty.",

        "text": "Former Australian speedster Brett Lee has described the Indian team as a \"powerhouse that don't want to bow down\" to anyone, cautioning his compatriots who will take on the Asian giants in an upcoming five-match Test series. Lee's remarks came after India's eight-wicket defeat to New Zealand in the Bengaluru Test earlier this week. India, aiming to qualify for their third successive final in the World Test Championship, will be travelling to Australia next month to defend the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"This day and age, India is a powerhouse that don't want to bow down. They know how to win, and they know they can beat Australia; they know they can beat the Kiwis. They know they can beat anyone on any given day,\" Lee told 'Fox Cricket'.Commenting on India's outing in the Bengaluru Test against the Kiwis, Lee felt that they might have got influenced by 'Bazball', leading to playing some loose shots.\"India just didn't go into their shell. Maybe it's Bazball brushing off on other cricketers around the world,\" he noted.\"I know that India won't be proud of the way they played. They played some pretty loose shots.\" India's decision to bat first in overcast conditions raised eyebrows, as the team was bowled out for 46 in the first innings of the opening Test, its lowest Test score at home.Lee said the side needs to \"weigh up the risk factor\" and added the Indians should have judged the conditions better.\"But, you've got to weigh up the risk factor as well. There are times when you've got to go, 'Okay, well, maybe the big shots aren't working today'.\"Maybe, just rein it in a little bit. I don't think they sort of summed up the conditions as quickly as what they should have done,\" Lee said.India play two more Tests against New Zealand -- Pune (October 24-28) and Mumbai (November 1-5) -- before leaving for Australia.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Americans have a strong fascination with live sports, leading to the term \"WAGs\" for the wives and girlfriends of professional athletes. Taylor Swift began a relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce during her Eras Tour. The relationship was confirmed when Swift attended Chiefs games with Kelce's mom and Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany Mahomes. The National Football League quickly recognized the value of Swift's presence at games, making the Kansas City Chiefs and Swift almost synonymous, despite longtime football fans' disdain. However there also have been some controversies.

The Daily Mail reported that several fans found the video 'ridiculous', questioning whether it was a blunder or joke.The romance was part of a predetermined planA leaked document claiming a \"Comprehensive Media Plan\" for the 'Love Story' couple has gone viral, causing concern among Swift's followers. The leaked document claimed the couple's romance was part of a predetermined plan, with a planned breakup date of September 28th. However, Full Scope, the company for Kelce, denied the rumor, stating the document was entirely made up and had nothing to do with the company. \"These documents are entirely false and fabricated and were not created, issued or authorized by this agency,\" the rep for Kelce team claimed. \"We have engaged our legal team to initiate proceedings against the individuals or entities responsible for the unlawful and injurious forgery of documents,\" the rep added, hinting at a full-blown legal battle against those spreading false news.Also Read: \u201cHe can fall asleep at a f***ing rock concert\u201d: Travis Kelce hilariously blames his dad for his and Jason Kelce's sleeping habit",

        "text": "Boman Irani recently took to Instagram to share a special post for his wife Zenobia Irani, who celebrates her birthday on October 23. To accompany a carousel of photos, he penned a long, heartfelt caption filled with candid musings and wishes for his spouse. He mentioned how his wife has \"ghar ka khanna\" taste buds, which makes it difficult for them to find spots for eating out that she would like. In the post, Boman Irani hinted at their shared love for chai too. He explained that, while travelling out of the country, his wife's pet peeve is being rather disappointed with specific tea offerings. She often tends to feel that drinks that are labelled chai abroad don't actually deserve to be called that. He finds himself in agreement with her on this point.\n\nAlso Read:\"I Truly Believe In This\" - Boman Irani's Latest Reel Is All About Bonding Over Food\n\nBoman Irani's note also includes several other glimpses into their life together. He has lovingly described her habits and complimented her personality. Here's the complete caption: \"It is impossible to find a restaurant to please your \"Ghar Ka Khana\" tastebuds. Impossible. You always repeat instructions a minimum of 84 times. Like, \"Check the passport, or let's leave 4 hours early for the airport, or let's go to the gate, 2 hours before the gate opens. When you see a dog... you snap your finger and instruct me to take a photograph like I'm on your payroll. When I'm abroad, you wake me up in the middle of the night to ask if I've taken my medication. Then wonder why I'm sounding sleepy. When in town you give me my medication yourself, and 5 minutes later you ask if you've given me my medication. You hate to speak in public but somehow love to speak (a lot) in private. When abroad, your pet peeve phrase is, \"How dare they call this CHAI??\" (This, I agree, actually.). I wouldn't mind being on your staff; that's where one gets treated the best.I love to grumble about you like this. Because saying nice things is somehow boring. But today I am going to say just one nice thing. Why not... I have yet to find a person who has a single bad thing to say about you. Said it. Only because it's your birthday. Happy birthday, Zen!\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nBefore this, Boman Irani had posted about his experience dining at Chef Vikas Khanna's New York restaurant. He posted a reel that captured Chef Khanna's hospitality and the lip-smacking dishes served during the meal. Boman said that it was an \"unforgettable celebration\".

        "text": "Former MLC quits BJP to join Congress, likely to contest Channapatna by-polls\n\nBengaluru: In a big shocker for the opposition BJP and JD(S) alliance, former Minister C.P. Yogeshwar tendered his resignation to the primary membership of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to join the Congress party, here this morning. Yogeshwar sent his resignation to BJP State President B.Y. Vijayendra through a WhatsApp message. It may be remembered that Yogeshwar, who was nominated to the Legislative Council by BJP, had resigned as MLC on Monday.\n\nThe former BJP MLC joined the Congress party in presence of KPCC President and Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, Ministers N. Cheluvarayaswamy, B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan and R. Ramalinga Reddy, former MP D.K. Suresh among others including party MLAs from Mandya and Ramanagara districts at KPCC Office on Queen\u2019s Road.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Yogeshwar said he had joined the Congress party unconditionally. However, sources said that Congress is likely to field Yogeshwar in Channapatna bypoll.\n\nMeanwhile, D.K. Shivakumar said that All India Congress Committee (AICC) would announce the candidate for Channapatna by-election this evening following which the nomination papers will be filed tomorrow.\n\nYogeshwar, who aspired to contest the upcoming Channapatna by-poll on a BJP ticket, was denied the ticket by party high command which forced the former Minister to join the Congress party. Yogeshwar\u2019s move comes amid JD(S) State President and Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy informing the party workers about BJP National President J.P. Nadda and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi calling to him to enquire the possibility of Yogeshwar contesting the Channapatna by-polls on a JD(S) ticket.\n\nIt may be recalled, H.D. Kumaraswamy had defeated C.P. Yogeshwar by a margin of 15,195 votes in the Assembly polls held last year.\n\nAccording to sources, Yogeshwar had given BJP High Command a deadline till Oct. 22 evening to decide on the ticket. With party unable to take a decision, the former Minister decided on rejoining the Congress party. Yogeshwar\u2019s return will not only be a boost to the Congress Party in Channapatna but will also strengthen the party in Bengaluru Rural and old Mysuru region.\n\nThe prominent Vokkaliga leader, also a five-time MLA from Channapatna, had played a crucial role for the victory of BJP candidate Dr. C.N. Manjunath, brother-in-law of H.D. Kumaraswamy, from Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha Constituency in 2024 elections against the then sitting Congress MP D.K. Suresh, younger brother of D.K. Shivakumar, by a margin of 2,69, 647 votes.\n\nSources also said that Yogeshwar was also in touch with Samajwadi Party leaders to secure a \u2018B\u2019 Form to contest the upcoming by-poll from Channapatna. However, in the last minute he decided to rejoin the Congress Party as he saw better chances of winning and bright political prospects in the future. \n\nThe by-poll to Channapatna Assembly Constituency has been necessitated following the resignation of H.D. Kumaraswamy as MLA after him getting elected to Lok Sabha from Mandya during the general elections held early this year.\n\nThe last date for filing of nomination papers is Oct. 25 while the polling will take place on Nov.13 and the results will be announced on Nov. 23.\n\nC.P. Yogeshwar\u2019s electoral career in Channapatna Assembly Constituency\n\n1999: He won as an independent candidate by a margin of 18,828 against Congress party\u2019s Sadath Ali Khan.\n\n2004: Contested on a Congress ticket and defeated M.C. Ashwath of JD(S) by a margin of 16,169 votes.\n\n2008: Contested again from Congress and defeated M.C. Ashwath of JD(S) by a margin of 4,930 votes.\n\n2009 (By-election): Joined BJP and lost to H.D. Kumaraswamy (JD-S) by a margin of 20,254 votes.\n\n2011 (By-election): Contested on BJP ticket and won against S.I. Nagaraju of JD(S) by a margin of 17,803 votes.\n\n2013: Contested on a Samajwadi Party ticket and won against Anitha Kumaraswamy (JD-S) by a margin of 6,464 votes.\n\n2018: Contested from BJP and lost to H.D. Kumaraswamy by a margin of 21,530 votes.\n\n2022: Nominated as MLC by the BJP State Government under artiste quota as he was also a Kannada actor.\n\n2023: Contested from BJP and lost to H.D. Kumaraswamy by a margin of 15,195 votes.",

        "text": "Like every year, fashion designer Manish Malhotra hosted a Diwali party on Tuesday night. The star-studded event was attended by who's who of Bollywood, including Shraddha Kapoor. The actress looked stunning in a silver tissue saree, which she paired with a heart-shaped purse. Later in the night, the actress tried to make a quiet exit from the party but was enveloped by a crowd of paparazzi. In a shrewd attempt to divert the shutterbugs' attention, the actress pointed in the other direction and mentioned Shah Rukh Khan's name, believing that the paps would hurry to get a picture of the star, allowing her to make a quick exit. In between all this, Shraddha approached the wrong car and attempted to change the subject by bringing up Salman Khan's name. Unfazed, the paparazzi maintained their focus on her by pointing out that Salman wasn't there. Shraddha was accompanied by Raveena Tandon's daughter Rasha Thadani. See the video here: (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");View this post on InstagramA post shared by Varinder Chawla (@varindertchawla)On the work front, Shraddha Kapoor was last seen in Stree 2. The film also featured Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Banerjee and Aparshakti Khurana in key roles. Directed by Amar Kaushik, Stree 2 is the sequel to the 2018 horror comedy Stree. After the immense success of the first two parts, the makers are now all set to work on the third instalment of the franchise. At a recent media event, Shraddha confirmed that Stree 3 is in the works. The actress revealed that director Amar Kaushik already has a story ready for the next movie. She said, \"When Amar sir told me he had a story for Stree 3, I got very excited because I know it's going to be something amazing. I can't wait to hear what it's about.\u201d Talking about the success of the first two movies, Shraddha Kapoor said, \"The kind of love and accolades the first part received were immense. It all started there. Hats off to the director, writer and producer for cracking a sequel. It's important not to make a sequel just for the sake of it - you need substance to bring people to theatres and earn genuine appreciation. They stayed true to how a sequel should be made and cracked the story of Stree 2. It had all the entertainment factors, brilliant actors and really entertaining dialogues. I believe it was a fabulous team effort. It was pure cinematic joy.\"Apart from the Stree franchise, Shraddha Kapoor is also expected to be featured in a dance number in Pushpa 2: The Rule.

In the teaser, Prabhas is seen checking his appearance in a car's side mirror, admiring his reflection. He makes a spectacular entry riding on a bike with a bouquet of flowers. The fascinating background score by Thaman S enhances the teaser by combining aspects of romance and horror. Director Maruthi Dasari expressed his excitement about collaborating with Prabhas and said, \u201cThe Raja Saab stands as one of my most ambitious projects to date. Collaborating with Prabhas and People Media Factory is both an honour and exciting for me as a filmmaker. We are geared up to offer our audiences a grand horror experience. Having Prabhas on board is particularly special as his electrifying screen presence infused with our horror narrative is sure to leave audiences amazed.\u201dApart from Prabhas, The Raja Saab also features Malavika Mohanan, Nidhi Agerwal, Riddhi Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, Anupam Kher, Murali Sharma, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Jisshu Sengupta, Brahmanandam and Yogi Babu in key roles.

It has less than two years to complete preparations and the organisers said they have tried to ensure that financial and operational risks are reduced by their conservative approach.While India would lose out on a lot of medals, Usha backed the idea of reduced cost and lower environmental impact due to a pruned schedule of 10 events to be conducted at four venues within an eight-mile radius.\"The approach aims to reduce costs, lower environmental impact, and increase social benefits, such progressive and sustainable model is very exciting as it will enable more countries to host the Games in future,\" she explained.\"Given the limited time-frame and financial constraints, focus of CGF has been to deliver a high-quality Games in a financially responsible way, with emphasis on minimising risks and prioritising athletes and sports,\" said one of India's greatest athlete.Usha said CWG grew from being a 10-sport event up until 1998 and can go back to expanding itself in future once a stable model of hosting the event is figured going forward.\"Historically, CWG featured around 10 sports and since 1998, programme has expanded to include 15 to 20 sports, and flexibility in future will be crucial for hosts,\" she added.\"I have had discussion with CGF president and he has assured me that exclusion of certain sports from the 2026 programme doesn't set a precedent for future games, and all CWG sports remain important to CGF, with opportunity to return in future editions,\" she said.The sports programme will include Athletics and Para Athletics (Track & Field), Swimming and Para Swimming, Artistic Gymnastics, Track Cycling and Para Track Cycling, Netball, Weightlifting and Para Powerlifting, Boxing, Judo, Bowls and Para Bowls, and 3x3 Basketball and 3x3 Wheelchair Basketball.",

        "text": "Royal author and former editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair Tina Brown has shredded Meghan Markle to pieces in a no-holds-barred attack in which she analyzed Prince Harry and Meghan's character and their exit from the Royal family and what followed after that. According to Brown, Harry is good at being Prince Harry and is the most talented member of the royal family but he became the sacrificial lamb in Meghan Markle's scheme of things and Meghan is always wrong.Brown said Meghan is a perfectionist but about getting it all wrong. She had the worst judgement in the world and she's flawless at getting it wrong. The attack comes at a time when Meghan and Harry are manoeuvering a lot of things -- their divorce speculations, their new house in Portugal, their individual career path etc. Just before that, a report in the US media called Meghan a dictator in high heels -- citing Meghan's former staff. While all this combined delivered a blow to Meghan's PR, Tina Brown said Meghan has a lot of people, she asks them their opinion and then doesn't follow it. \"She does what she wants to do. And all of her ideas are total crap, unfortunately.\"The royal author, who was Princess Diana's biographer and the author of the Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor -- The Truth and the Turmoil, decribed Prince Harry as the naive persone who does not know the ways of the world -- a person who has probably not ever booked a table in a restaurant. \"The army was great for him, and he was extremely good and competent in there. That really helped turn him into a real person.\"Since his marriage to Meghan, Harry has been the lamb to the slaughter. When Harry met Meghan, he was terribly impressed by her, the savvy Hollywood wheeler-dealer. \"He was terribly impressed by Meghan. He thought that she knew all, she persuaded him that she was the savvy Hollywood wheeler-dealer who could come in and make them stars and all the rest of it. And he just sort of blindly followed her like a child, really.\"But Harry has a road to come back as he would always be Prince Harry, Brown said. Being Harsh to Meghan, she said she's kind of run out of road. Both of them are, however, addicted to drama, Brown said .",

        "title": "Return Of Luxe Craftsmanship",
        "text": "In recent years, the fashion industry has seen a notable resurgence of craftsmanship in the luxury sector. This return to artisanal traditions highlights a growing appreciation for the artistry, dedication, and heritage embedded in fashion\u2019s finest creations. Fast fashion, while accessible and affordable, often comes with significant ethical and environmental costs. Consumers are becoming conscious of these downsides. They are seeking clothes with aesthetic appeal, ethical integrity and longevity. Enter the renewed focus on craftsmanship in the fashion industry. Meaningful Fashion\u201cTimeless artistry is precious. It is indeed a fragile and intricate process \u2014 the weaving of Banarasi fabric, which demands patience and dedication. With our artisans, we focus on authenticity and the skill that goes into creating the craft. There's a push for a significant level of speed, yet the collections show how we devote time and thought to each piece,\u201d says Khushi Shah, owner of Shanti Banaras.For luxury fashion houses, the return to craftsmanship is more than a reactionary move. It is a reclamation of the heritage. Craftsman-ship, after all, is what has long set luxury fashion apart from the fast fashion world. These brands have always been synonymous with meticulous attention to detail, quality fabrics, and timeless designs. Consumers are seeking more from their wardrobes \u2014 durability, and authenticity. Luxury houses are refocusing on ancient craftsmanship and their roots.Archana Jaju, owner, Archana Jaju says that they use old techniques like hand embroidery, Kalam-kari, and Zardozi in creating their designs. \u201cAll these methods not only become a means of storytelling in each product but also symbolize the rich cultural heritage of India. Details and patterns and how they come together are not merely aesthetic choices but reflections of olden traditions, and so each garment is a bridge between the past and the present,\" says Archana.Handcrafted vs Mass ProductionOne of the driving forces behind this shift is the desire for uniqueness. In a market saturated with identical, machine-made garments, handcrafted pieces represent something special. Every stitch, fold, and detail tells a story of human hands and techniques passed down through generations, and of the cultural traditions that inspire fashion's finest creations. \u201cBanarasi handloom weaving is the core of our designs. Through generations of weavers from Varanasi, each piece that we make is a testament to this rich legacy. Storytelling within our collections comes through in the intricacies of motifs and patterns, each of which holds cultural significance and makes our contemporary pieces part of a tradition spanning centuries,\u201d says Khushi.This return to artisanal craftsmanship can be seen in the revival of techniques such as hand embroidery, tailoring, and textile creation. Intricate beading, once reserved for haute couture, is making its way back into collections, offering consumers the chance to wear something genuinely unique. Brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci, among others, are increasingly leaning on their ateliers and skilled artisans to create one-of-a-kind pieces that stand in stark contrast to the ubiquity of fast fashion.Sustainability & CraftsmanshipAnother key factor driving this renewed focus on craftsmanship is the growing emphasis on sustainability in fashion. Fast fashion industry\u2019s negative environmental impact has been under scrutiny. In contrast, the artisanal approach encourages slower, more mindful production, often using higher quality, sustainably sourced materials that result in garments with longer life spans.\u201cThis craft allows the wearer to wear creations that might be passed down for generations. Handwoven fabrics and natural fibres breathe life into clothes meant to last decades. These pieces aren\u2019t just a fashion item; they\u2019re a part of family heirlooms sewn together with the quality-of-care mass-produced goods cannot. All of this leads to slow fashion, waste reduction, and intimacy with what one wears,\u201d adds Khushi. By embracing craftsmanship, fashion houses are creating garments meant to be treasured and worn for years, not just for a single season. This shift represents a broader trend towards slow fashion \u2014 a movement that prioritizes quality, sustainability, and the ethical treatment of workers.Behind the ScenesAt the heart of this shift are the artisans whose skills are now being championed and celebrated. Historically, these craftsmen and craftswomen have often remained in the shadows, with little recognition for their contributions to the industry. As the demand for handcrafted pieces grows, so too does the visibility of the artisans behind them.\u201cCraftsmanship will always be at the heart of luxury fashion. Though technology may bring efficiency, the soul in luxury is human touch and attention to detail. The customers will be targeting handcrafted pieces that they will see as authentic and connected; thus, there will be a stay...",

        "title": "Bollywood actresses expand brand with big-ticket Telugu films",
        "text": "After a break, it looks like Bollywood actresses are having a good time in Tollywood by being part of some big-ticket movies to expand their brand equity. Top league actress Deepika Padukone showcased her acting prowess in \u2018Kalki 2898 AD,\u2019 and held on her own, despite the presence of legends like Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan. She is going to hog more limelight in 'Kalki sequel' as well since the sci-fi thriller revolves around her and a divine child. Her colleague Kiara Advani is romancing Ram Charan in \u2018Game Changer,\u2019 while Mrunal Thakur proved her acting mettle in films like \u2018Sita Ramam\u2019 and \u2018Hi Nanna\u2019. However,Janhvi Kapoor turned out to be find of the season and created a lot of buzz with her maiden Telugu film \u2018Devara\u2019 opposite Jr NTR and also signed up another film with Ram Charan in a big film being directed by Buchi Babu Sana. \u201cWe felt that Janhvi Kapoor would be apt for this female lead role in our film with a big star Ram Charan. Even director Buchi Babu felt the same since he has etched a significant role. In fact, Ram Charan and Janvhi pairing would be a refreshing jodi on big screen,\u2019 says ace producer Ravi Shankar Yellamanchilli.Similarly, Raveena Tandon is in talks to do a pivotal role in Telugu film 'Jatadhara', while Norah Fatehi has done a key role in her Telugu film \u2018Matka\u2019 with Varun Tej and would be showcasing a new avatar. \u201cIt is true that some Bollywood actresses are headlining Telugu films these days, and they come as a breath of fresh air,\u201d says producer Vishnu Vardhan Induri, who brought in Kangana Ranaut for \u2018Thalaavi\u2019 and Vidya Balan for \u2018NTR Kathanayakudu\u201d.\u201cIt all depends on the massive scale and reach of their pet projects. If they are looking for a pan-India appeal, a top-rung Hindi actress would be a big value addition. For instance, if I am watching a Malayalam film, I would watch it with more interest, if I find a familiar Telugu actor in it. Hence, to make North viewers own our movies, Telugu filmmakers are signing up Hindi actresses. Their popularity is bound to give a fillip to our big-ticket movies,\u201d he adds. However, young director Hanu Raghuvapudi introduced B-town diva Mrunal Thakur in his Telugu blockbuster \u2018Sita Ramam\u2019 since he was looking for a girl who fits into the role of a princess. \u201cI was looking for a gorgeous looking girl who is also a good performer, so I found Mrunal Thakur ideal for the role. She matched strides with ace performer Dulquer Salmaan and proved my choice right with a sterling performance. I am quite happy that she is doing more Telugu films now,\u201d says director Hanu Raghavapudi who introduced non-Telugu girls like Lavanya Tripathi and Mehreen Pirzada in his movies like \u2018Andala Rakshasi\u2019 and \u2018Krishnagadi Veera Prema Gaadha\u2019 respectively. On strict demands put up by few Bollywood divas like traveling with their 7 to 8 member team like chef, trainer along with stylist and designer, producer A M Ratham, explains, \u201c'We have to be transparent while making agreements with them. If both actor-producers follow the terms, there will be no issues. More Bollywood actresses will come to town in the days to come, since Telugu films have turned multilingual.\"",

It makes me feel like part of him is still here \u2013 and I need that \u2013 and the world needs that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy greatest comfort is knowing that my dad is with my momma and my brother.

        "text": "Actor Jennifer Garner had a warning for a crowd of \"Moms for Harris\" gathered at a tearoom in Tucson, Arizona: Be prepared to see more Hollywood stars visiting your state to talk about the November 5 election.\"Jessica Alba, Kerry Washington - my colleagues and friends - will be here tomorrow. We're all just going to barnstorm you and drive you nuts,\" Garner said with a smile.\"I'm sure everything is a nightmare. You don't even want to turn on the TV,\" Garner said to laughter. \"That being said, it really is that important.\"The \"Alias\" star was acknowledging the text messages, TV ads, canvassing and other efforts in one of the seven battleground states that will decide whether Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump becomes the next US president.Celebrity endorsers such as Garner are part of the down-to-the-wire blitz to mobilize voters ahead of Election Day on November 5. A week after her Arizona stop, Garner stumped for Vice President Harris in Pennsylvania and had plans to visit Nevada.When stars want to campaign, political strategists urge them to visit places where they have a personal connection and to talk about issues they have worked on. They also are pairing them with political heavyweights.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In Garner's case, she joined former policy adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice, and the actor talked about how her parents met in Arizona. A board member for Save the Children, Garner touted Harris' support for child tax credits and higher pay for child-care workers.Julia Roberts, meanwhile, visited her home state of Georgia and was introduced by former state Representative Stacey Abrams.Actor Jane Fonda, an advocate for action on climate change, knocked on doors in Michigan to tout Harris and other \"climate champions.\" The Oscar winner and longtime political activist said she had never campaigned door-to-door for a president before.\"I'm doing everything I can,\" Fonda told one potential voter. \"We have to get them elected.\"While Hollywood has a reputation for being liberal, some stars are working to turn out the vote for former President Trump. Dennis Quaid, who starred in a recent movie as Republican icon Ronald Reagan, spoke at a Trump rally in California.\"I'm here to tell you that it's time to pick a side,\" Quaid said to applause.Other Trump supporters from the entertainment world include musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, and wrestler Hulk Hogan, who spoke at this summer's Republican National Convention.HELPING OR HURTING?Will Garner, Quaid or any other movie star make a difference?Celebrity appearances do amplify messages about voting, said Christian Grose, a political science professor and academic director at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute.If a non-famous person knocks on a door, it affects only that voter. When a celebrity does, it generates media coverage and social media posts that reach beyond that home, Grose said.Whether that translates into higher turnout depends on the celebrity and the circumstances.Megastars such as Oprah Winfrey can make a meaningful impact. Winfrey's 2007 endorsement of Barack Obama was credited with driving 1 million votes during the Democratic primary.And pop megastar Taylor Swift stimulated thousands of new voter registrations with a nonpartisan call for people to register in 2023, according to the nonprofit group Vote.org.This September, Swift went a step further and endorsed Harris via an Instagram post, which has now received more than 11 million likes.While the Harris campaign welcomed Swift's support, it may not turn out to be a blessing, according to Mark Harvey, author of \"Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy,\" published in 2018.Harvey and other researchers surveyed 1,000 people in August, before Swift's endorsement. Half were shown a photo of Swift with a generic message urging people to vote and half were shown the same image urging votes for Democrats.In the study, the singer was most influential with undecided voters who were Swift fans. Swifties who saw the general message reported a high likelihood of heading to the polls. The intent to vote declined, however, among the Swift fans who saw the singer calling for ballots for Democrats.\"I think there are a lot people who don't want to mix their entertainment with their politics,\" said Harvey, an associate professor at the University of Saint Mary in Kansas.And outside of the elite sphere of the biggest celebrities, studies suggest celebrity endorsements have \"no effect to marginal effect\" on turnout, Grose said.Still, it is possible that the presidential race, and some races for the U.S. Congress could be decided by hundreds or thousands of votes.\"I wouldn't put it up there as the most critical part of the campaign,\" Grose said, \"but you certainly can mobilize people with enthusiasm and excitement and a little bit of Hollywood pizzazz showing up in places you wouldn't expect.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Australia batter Steve Smith said that Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne \"hated\" him at the top order and wanted him to return back to his original batting position - No. 4 - but he is happy to bat wherever the team wants him to. Australia head coach Andrew McDonald confirmed last week that he and captain Pat Cummins have decided to shift Smith back to No. 4 batting spot in Test cricket following a brief stint at the opening role.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Smith stated that he was asked by McDonald to tell his preferred batting position to which he replied 'four' but he never requested the management to put him back in the middle order.\"I got asked where I'd prefer to bat, and I said four. I didn't ask (to move) though. I also said I'm happy batting wherever. I'm not really too fussed. I got asked where my preference would be, and I said four. I saw a few things last week saying that I've requested to bat at four. That wasn't the case. I said I'm happy to bat wherever you'd like me to bat but, yeah, four would be my ideal position,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted Smith as saying.He added that his teammates Labuschagne and Khawaja in particular were not happy to see him bat in the top order and with all-rounder Cameron Green being ruled out of the India Test series, it became evident to shift him back to No. 4.\"Obviously there's a spot there now with Greeny (Cameron Green) out. And I think just conversations we had after New Zealand with particularly Marnus and Uzi, they hated me up top, to be honest. They wanted me behind them. They just like the...they call it security behind them, in a way. They were pretty strong on me not batting there. So that was a big part of it. And then obviously, I've got a decent record at four,\" he added.On his brief opening stint, Smith feels that he would have excelled if given more opportunities. \"It was good fun having a crack at something new, batting up top. I still feel like I could do a job there for sure. It was a pretty small sample size. But I've done pretty well at four for a number of years now. I feel like it's probably where I can have my best input for this team at the moment.\"After replacing retired David Warner as Khawaja's opening partner, Smith scored 171 runs at an average of 28.50 in four Tests. His numbers were not that bad as no opener averaged more than 32 after four Tests.\"Honestly, I'm not that fussed. I said it when I took that job, I'm not really fussed where I bat. The conversations I had with the other guys, they didn't like it at all. They wanted some security, I suppose, behind them, where I've done really well for a number of years, and I can understand that as well. So it is what it is and I'm not going to be opening this summer. That's it,\" Smith said.The 35-year-old feels Nic Maddison is one of the potential candidates, along with Cameron Bancroft and others, to fill the void created after Warner's departure. \"There's a few really good candidates, guys, that have done really well the last few years. (Cameron) Bancroft and the usual suspects that have been talked about. Maddo I think is also another really good candidate. He's had a good couple of years. If you're looking for someone similar to a Davey replacement, he gets after the ball and can score really quickly,\" Smith said.\"So he's someone who probably hasn't been spoken about a great deal from all you guys in the last little bit, but I think he's someone that could definitely play test cricket and have a similar impact to what Davey sort of had at the top, the way he plays. So plenty of options. We'll wait and see,\" he added.--IANSab/bc(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The idea that a society\u2019s well-being is influenced by its economic institutions dates back to Adam Smith. This year, the Economics Nobel was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (AJR) for their research demonstrating the link between economic and societal institutions and the level of prosperity. By institutions, the laureates refer to the broad set of rules and norms that govern the economic behaviour of businesses and society or a nation.\n\nAn example of the impact of institutional differences can be seen in the high income disparity between Nogales, Arizona, US, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, despite sharing the same geography, climate, and culture across the US-Mexico border. A similar contrast exists between South Korea and North Korea. These obvious intra-community inequality is explained by AJR in terms of differences in their political and economic institutional framework.\n\nAn example of a successful social institution is the Marwari community. Despite operating within the same geographical area with common economic and political institutions as other Indian communities, the Marwaris have achieved remarkable economic prosperity.\n\nTrust-based credit\n\nA key factor for this lies in their informal institutional framework, which enabled them to leverage trade credit effectively. Trust is the cornerstone of trade credit. Intra-community extension of trade credit relied on extended family ties and relationship, acquaintances, and referrals by respected and distinguished business and community figures.\n\nThis trust-based credit network helped them in establishing and expanding their businesses when banking was absent or inaccessible. Such familial business relationships not only provide credit but extend advice and strategic partnerships. It minimises credit risks and maximise opportunities.\n\nHistorically, trust in B2B credit relationships was reinforced by a strong social and business stigma against default and bankruptcy. Within tightly-knit communities, the fear of reputational damages and social boycotts \u2014 such as avoiding marriage alliances with bankrupt families \u2014 created strong pressure to honour financial commitments. These factors acted as powerful deterrents to defaults.\n\nWith changing social values and weakened societal bonds, and events like demonetisation and the Covid-19 pandemic, the trade credit ecosystem has been disrupted, eroding the willingness to honour financial commitments. Intense competition and the loosening of close-knit social ties have diminished the effectiveness of fear of reputational damages leading to widespread delays and defaults. These undermine payment culture - once key to business prosperity.\n\nBusinesses thrive on reputation, which is deeply tied to credit discipline. To operationalise this, real-time tracking of payment defaults and delays, along with the digital dissemination of this information to stakeholders, can foster a trade credit ecosystem.\n\nThe writer is former DGM, SIDBI",

        "text": "Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE. The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year. Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain. By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.\"I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today,\" Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.\"There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level,\" the Portuguese boss added.On Monday, Hilal took the lead on 26 minutes, when former Newcastle United and Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic played in Lodi down the left, and the ex-Atletico Madrid full-back drilled a low shot past Khalid Essa in the Al Ain goal.However, Hernan Crespo's side drew level six minutes before half-time, Morocco international Soufiane Rahimi sliding home a cross. Rahimi was the star of Al Ain's Asian Champions League success last season, finishing top scorer and named player of the tournament.In first-half stoppage-time, Hilal seemed to take the contest away from their UAE rivals. First, Joao Cancelo, a summer signing from Manchester City, crossed for Milinkovic-Savic to head home unmarked from six years. Moments later, reigning Asian Player of the Year Al Dawsari raced cleared of the Al Ain defence, skipped around the onrushing Essa and curled home superbly on the angle.Al Ain reduced the deficit just after the hour, through substitute Mateo Sanabria, only for Al Dawsari to flick home his second of the night from a Milinkovic-Savic centre. Minutes later, Rahimi notched his double as a see-saw clash took another swing. Al Dawsari then restored Hilal's two-goal advantage with a sublime strike from range.Not long into 12 minutes of the allotted injury-time, and with Hilal reduced to 10 men after defender Ali Al Bulaihi was sent off for an intentional handball, Rahimi won and converted a penalty to secure his hat-trick and give Al Ain hope, but the Saudi champions hung on to claim the win.Neymar had little time to truly impact the game, although he did flash wide an effort in the dying moments of normal time. Hilal sit top of the Western region group, with three victories from three while Al Ain have picked up a solitary point.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Lidia Thorpe, an Independent Australian senator, has accused King Charles of committing genocide of Indigenous people and shouted, \"You're not my king.\" The 51-year-old interrupted King Charles's parliamentary reception on Monday, saying, \"You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people.\" A video of Ms Thorpe's remarks before she was whisked away by security personnel went viral on social media.Who is Lidia Thorpe?Born in 1973 in Carlton, in the state of Victoria, Lidia Thorpe belongs to the Gunnai, Gunditjmara, and Djab Wurrung peoples and has been a prominent figure in politics and advocacy for Aboriginal causes.She has a Diploma in Community Development from Swinburne University of Technology and a graduate certificate in public sector management. Ms Thorpe is known for her strong opposition to monarchy and advocacy for Indigenous rights.Lidia Thorpe's political careerLidia Thorpe was first elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly from the Northcote seat in a 2017 by-election. She received over 45 percent primary votes. In December 2018, she lost her seat to Labour candidate Kat Theophanous.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In 2020, Victorian Greens members preselected Lidia Thorpe for the federal Senate seat, which fell vacant after the resignation of Richard Di Natale. Her election to the Senate also made her the first Aboriginal woman to represent Victoria in the Senate. She is also the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian from the Greens.After her re-election in May 2022, the Greens party room elected Lidia Thorpe as the party's deputy leader in the Senate. She quit the Greens in February 2023 after the party threw its weight behind the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum, a reform Ms Thorpe and some of her supporters did not approve of, The Guardian reported.Why did Lidia Thorpe confront King Charles?After her outburst at King Charles, Lidia Thorpe was escorted out of the venue. While the parliamentary reception continued, she later told the BBC that her goal was to send \"a clear message\" to Charles, stressing that \"to be sovereign you have to be of the land. He is not of this land.\"What are Lidia Thorpe's views on the British monarchy?Lidia Thorpe has long been critical of the British monarchy, calling King Charles \"not the legitimate sovereign of these lands\" and accusing the institution of committing genocide against Indigenous Australians.\"How can he stand up there and say he's the King of our country - he's stolen so much wealth from our people and from our land and he needs to give that back. And he needs to entertain a conversation for a peace treaty in this country,\" she told the BBC.She advocates for a treaty between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to address historical wrongs. Ms Thorpe believes that moving towards a republic through a treaty process can help resolve \"unfinished business.\"She has been involved in Indigenous activism for many years, even before entering politics. She has campaigned for justice system reform, environmental issues, and Indigenous land rights. Lidia Thorpe's activism is deeply rooted in her upbringing. \"I had no choice in being influenced by black activists and the black struggle of my people...I was born into it and I don't know anything else,\" she said in 2022.Lidia Thorpe has a history of high-profile protests. In 2020, during her swearing-in ceremony as a senator, she raised a black power salute while wearing a traditional possum-skin cloak and holding an Aboriginal message stick. The stick bore 441 marks to symbolise Aboriginal deaths in custody following a royal commission in 1991. In 2022, after being re-elected, she referred to the late Queen Elizabeth II as \"the colonising Her Majesty\" during her oath, for which she was required to repeat the correct wording.",

Cheer from Miami's Stadium and the Chiefs' Unbeaten StreakOn that day, Travis was playing for the Kansas City Chiefs in Santa Clara, California, against the San Francisco 49ers while the pop star performed the third and final show of her Miami run on 20 October. The Chiefs beat the 49ers, retaining their record-breaking win streak.A Sweet Tradition of Altered LyricsAlthough Taylor never mentioned the name Travis while performing, she gave a gesture that undoubtedly acknowledged his success. Whenever Travis came out to watch her performances earlier, she changed the lyrics of the song \"Karma\" to include a funny twist: \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me.\" The change in lyrics becomes a sweet tradition whenever he comes out to support her at a concert.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest\u2014 JustJared (@JustJared) Show of Support Despite His AbsenceInterestingly, while Travis was off on Sunday, Taylor still performed those modified lyrics, which will showcase her relationship with him and excitement over the win for the team. This subtle tribute was not only about her love for Travis but also the bond they share for each other amidst a distance as far apart as between the sun and the moon. Such a moment was undoubtedly missed by no one in the concert who attended her. It showed her love for him and her passion for her craft.The Mystique of the RelationshipIt's quite apparent that with the Chiefs' streak this season, Taylor is cheering for them in her own way all mixed into her career and personal life for the sake of engagement with her public. Well, their affair still remains a subject of fascination. Moments like these keep sparking more interest about the couple.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL",

        "text": "Actor Jennifer Garner had a warning for a crowd of \"Moms for Harris\" gathered at a tearoom in Tucson, Arizona: Be prepared to see more Hollywood stars visiting your state to talk about the November 5 election.\"Jessica Alba, Kerry Washington - my colleagues and friends - will be here tomorrow. We're all just going to barnstorm you and drive you nuts,\" Garner said with a smile.\"I'm sure everything is a nightmare. You don't even want to turn on the TV,\" Garner said to laughter. \"That being said, it really is that important.\"The \"Alias\" star was acknowledging the text messages, TV ads, canvassing and other efforts in one of the seven battleground states that will decide whether Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump becomes the next US president.Celebrity endorsers such as Garner are part of the down-to-the-wire blitz to mobilize voters ahead of Election Day on November 5. A week after her Arizona stop, Garner stumped for Vice President Harris in Pennsylvania and had plans to visit Nevada.When stars want to campaign, political strategists urge them to visit places where they have a personal connection and to talk about issues they have worked on. They also are pairing them with political heavyweights.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In Garner's case, she joined former policy adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice, and the actor talked about how her parents met in Arizona. A board member for Save the Children, Garner touted Harris' support for child tax credits and higher pay for child-care workers.Julia Roberts, meanwhile, visited her home state of Georgia and was introduced by former state Representative Stacey Abrams.Actor Jane Fonda, an advocate for action on climate change, knocked on doors in Michigan to tout Harris and other \"climate champions.\" The Oscar winner and longtime political activist said she had never campaigned door-to-door for a president before.\"I'm doing everything I can,\" Fonda told one potential voter. \"We have to get them elected.\"While Hollywood has a reputation for being liberal, some stars are working to turn out the vote for former President Trump. Dennis Quaid, who starred in a recent movie as Republican icon Ronald Reagan, spoke at a Trump rally in California.\"I'm here to tell you that it's time to pick a side,\" Quaid said to applause.Other Trump supporters from the entertainment world include musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, and wrestler Hulk Hogan, who spoke at this summer's Republican National Convention.HELPING OR HURTING?Will Garner, Quaid or any other movie star make a difference?Celebrity appearances do amplify messages about voting, said Christian Grose, a political science professor and academic director at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute.If a non-famous person knocks on a door, it affects only that voter. When a celebrity does, it generates media coverage and social media posts that reach beyond that home, Grose said.Whether that translates into higher turnout depends on the celebrity and the circumstances.Megastars such as Oprah Winfrey can make a meaningful impact. Winfrey's 2007 endorsement of Barack Obama was credited with driving 1 million votes during the Democratic primary.And pop megastar Taylor Swift stimulated thousands of new voter registrations with a nonpartisan call for people to register in 2023, according to the nonprofit group Vote.org.This September, Swift went a step further and endorsed Harris via an Instagram post, which has now received more than 11 million likes.While the Harris campaign welcomed Swift's support, it may not turn out to be a blessing, according to Mark Harvey, author of \"Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy,\" published in 2018.Harvey and other researchers surveyed 1,000 people in August, before Swift's endorsement. Half were shown a photo of Swift with a generic message urging people to vote and half were shown the same image urging votes for Democrats.In the study, the singer was most influential with undecided voters who were Swift fans. Swifties who saw the general message reported a high likelihood of heading to the polls. The intent to vote declined, however, among the Swift fans who saw the singer calling for ballots for Democrats.\"I think there are a lot people who don't want to mix their entertainment with their politics,\" said Harvey, an associate professor at the University of Saint Mary in Kansas.And outside of the elite sphere of the biggest celebrities, studies suggest celebrity endorsements have \"no effect to marginal effect\" on turnout, Grose said.Still, it is possible that the presidential race, and some races for the U.S. Congress could be decided by hundreds or thousands of votes.\"I wouldn't put it up there as the most critical part of the campaign,\" Grose said, \"but you certainly can mobilize people with enthusiasm and excitement and a little bit of Hollywood pizzazz showing up in places you wouldn't expect.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Australia batter Steve Smith said that Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne \"hated\" him at the top order and wanted him to return back to his original batting position - No. 4 - but he is happy to bat wherever the team wants him to. Australia head coach Andrew McDonald confirmed last week that he and captain Pat Cummins have decided to shift Smith back to No. 4 batting spot in Test cricket following a brief stint at the opening role.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Smith stated that he was asked by McDonald to tell his preferred batting position to which he replied 'four' but he never requested the management to put him back in the middle order.\"I got asked where I'd prefer to bat, and I said four. I didn't ask (to move) though. I also said I'm happy batting wherever. I'm not really too fussed. I got asked where my preference would be, and I said four. I saw a few things last week saying that I've requested to bat at four. That wasn't the case. I said I'm happy to bat wherever you'd like me to bat but, yeah, four would be my ideal position,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted Smith as saying.He added that his teammates Labuschagne and Khawaja in particular were not happy to see him bat in the top order and with all-rounder Cameron Green being ruled out of the India Test series, it became evident to shift him back to No. 4.\"Obviously there's a spot there now with Greeny (Cameron Green) out. And I think just conversations we had after New Zealand with particularly Marnus and Uzi, they hated me up top, to be honest. They wanted me behind them. They just like the...they call it security behind them, in a way. They were pretty strong on me not batting there. So that was a big part of it. And then obviously, I've got a decent record at four,\" he added.On his brief opening stint, Smith feels that he would have excelled if given more opportunities. \"It was good fun having a crack at something new, batting up top. I still feel like I could do a job there for sure. It was a pretty small sample size. But I've done pretty well at four for a number of years now. I feel like it's probably where I can have my best input for this team at the moment.\"After replacing retired David Warner as Khawaja's opening partner, Smith scored 171 runs at an average of 28.50 in four Tests. His numbers were not that bad as no opener averaged more than 32 after four Tests.\"Honestly, I'm not that fussed. I said it when I took that job, I'm not really fussed where I bat. The conversations I had with the other guys, they didn't like it at all. They wanted some security, I suppose, behind them, where I've done really well for a number of years, and I can understand that as well. So it is what it is and I'm not going to be opening this summer. That's it,\" Smith said.The 35-year-old feels Nic Maddison is one of the potential candidates, along with Cameron Bancroft and others, to fill the void created after Warner's departure. \"There's a few really good candidates, guys, that have done really well the last few years. (Cameron) Bancroft and the usual suspects that have been talked about. Maddo I think is also another really good candidate. He's had a good couple of years. If you're looking for someone similar to a Davey replacement, he gets after the ball and can score really quickly,\" Smith said.\"So he's someone who probably hasn't been spoken about a great deal from all you guys in the last little bit, but I think he's someone that could definitely play test cricket and have a similar impact to what Davey sort of had at the top, the way he plays. So plenty of options. We'll wait and see,\" he added.--IANSab/bc(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The idea that a society\u2019s well-being is influenced by its economic institutions dates back to Adam Smith. This year, the Economics Nobel was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (AJR) for their research demonstrating the link between economic and societal institutions and the level of prosperity. By institutions, the laureates refer to the broad set of rules and norms that govern the economic behaviour of businesses and society or a nation.\n\nAn example of the impact of institutional differences can be seen in the high income disparity between Nogales, Arizona, US, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, despite sharing the same geography, climate, and culture across the US-Mexico border. A similar contrast exists between South Korea and North Korea. These obvious intra-community inequality is explained by AJR in terms of differences in their political and economic institutional framework.\n\nAn example of a successful social institution is the Marwari community. Despite operating within the same geographical area with common economic and political institutions as other Indian communities, the Marwaris have achieved remarkable economic prosperity.\n\nTrust-based credit\n\nA key factor for this lies in their informal institutional framework, which enabled them to leverage trade credit effectively. Trust is the cornerstone of trade credit. Intra-community extension of trade credit relied on extended family ties and relationship, acquaintances, and referrals by respected and distinguished business and community figures.\n\nThis trust-based credit network helped them in establishing and expanding their businesses when banking was absent or inaccessible. Such familial business relationships not only provide credit but extend advice and strategic partnerships. It minimises credit risks and maximise opportunities.\n\nHistorically, trust in B2B credit relationships was reinforced by a strong social and business stigma against default and bankruptcy. Within tightly-knit communities, the fear of reputational damages and social boycotts \u2014 such as avoiding marriage alliances with bankrupt families \u2014 created strong pressure to honour financial commitments. These factors acted as powerful deterrents to defaults.\n\nWith changing social values and weakened societal bonds, and events like demonetisation and the Covid-19 pandemic, the trade credit ecosystem has been disrupted, eroding the willingness to honour financial commitments. Intense competition and the loosening of close-knit social ties have diminished the effectiveness of fear of reputational damages leading to widespread delays and defaults. These undermine payment culture - once key to business prosperity.\n\nBusinesses thrive on reputation, which is deeply tied to credit discipline. To operationalise this, real-time tracking of payment defaults and delays, along with the digital dissemination of this information to stakeholders, can foster a trade credit ecosystem.\n\nThe writer is former DGM, SIDBI",

        "text": "Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE. The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year. Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain. By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.\"I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today,\" Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.\"There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level,\" the Portuguese boss added.On Monday, Hilal took the lead on 26 minutes, when former Newcastle United and Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic played in Lodi down the left, and the ex-Atletico Madrid full-back drilled a low shot past Khalid Essa in the Al Ain goal.However, Hernan Crespo's side drew level six minutes before half-time, Morocco international Soufiane Rahimi sliding home a cross. Rahimi was the star of Al Ain's Asian Champions League success last season, finishing top scorer and named player of the tournament.In first-half stoppage-time, Hilal seemed to take the contest away from their UAE rivals. First, Joao Cancelo, a summer signing from Manchester City, crossed for Milinkovic-Savic to head home unmarked from six years. Moments later, reigning Asian Player of the Year Al Dawsari raced cleared of the Al Ain defence, skipped around the onrushing Essa and curled home superbly on the angle.Al Ain reduced the deficit just after the hour, through substitute Mateo Sanabria, only for Al Dawsari to flick home his second of the night from a Milinkovic-Savic centre. Minutes later, Rahimi notched his double as a see-saw clash took another swing. Al Dawsari then restored Hilal's two-goal advantage with a sublime strike from range.Not long into 12 minutes of the allotted injury-time, and with Hilal reduced to 10 men after defender Ali Al Bulaihi was sent off for an intentional handball, Rahimi won and converted a penalty to secure his hat-trick and give Al Ain hope, but the Saudi champions hung on to claim the win.Neymar had little time to truly impact the game, although he did flash wide an effort in the dying moments of normal time. Hilal sit top of the Western region group, with three victories from three while Al Ain have picked up a solitary point.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Lidia Thorpe, an Independent Australian senator, has accused King Charles of committing genocide of Indigenous people and shouted, \"You're not my king.\" The 51-year-old interrupted King Charles's parliamentary reception on Monday, saying, \"You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people.\" A video of Ms Thorpe's remarks before she was whisked away by security personnel went viral on social media.Who is Lidia Thorpe?Born in 1973 in Carlton, in the state of Victoria, Lidia Thorpe belongs to the Gunnai, Gunditjmara, and Djab Wurrung peoples and has been a prominent figure in politics and advocacy for Aboriginal causes.She has a Diploma in Community Development from Swinburne University of Technology and a graduate certificate in public sector management. Ms Thorpe is known for her strong opposition to monarchy and advocacy for Indigenous rights.Lidia Thorpe's political careerLidia Thorpe was first elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly from the Northcote seat in a 2017 by-election. She received over 45 percent primary votes. In December 2018, she lost her seat to Labour candidate Kat Theophanous.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In 2020, Victorian Greens members preselected Lidia Thorpe for the federal Senate seat, which fell vacant after the resignation of Richard Di Natale. Her election to the Senate also made her the first Aboriginal woman to represent Victoria in the Senate. She is also the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian from the Greens.After her re-election in May 2022, the Greens party room elected Lidia Thorpe as the party's deputy leader in the Senate. She quit the Greens in February 2023 after the party threw its weight behind the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum, a reform Ms Thorpe and some of her supporters did not approve of, The Guardian reported.Why did Lidia Thorpe confront King Charles?After her outburst at King Charles, Lidia Thorpe was escorted out of the venue. While the parliamentary reception continued, she later told the BBC that her goal was to send \"a clear message\" to Charles, stressing that \"to be sovereign you have to be of the land. He is not of this land.\"What are Lidia Thorpe's views on the British monarchy?Lidia Thorpe has long been critical of the British monarchy, calling King Charles \"not the legitimate sovereign of these lands\" and accusing the institution of committing genocide against Indigenous Australians.\"How can he stand up there and say he's the King of our country - he's stolen so much wealth from our people and from our land and he needs to give that back. And he needs to entertain a conversation for a peace treaty in this country,\" she told the BBC.She advocates for a treaty between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to address historical wrongs. Ms Thorpe believes that moving towards a republic through a treaty process can help resolve \"unfinished business.\"She has been involved in Indigenous activism for many years, even before entering politics. She has campaigned for justice system reform, environmental issues, and Indigenous land rights. Lidia Thorpe's activism is deeply rooted in her upbringing. \"I had no choice in being influenced by black activists and the black struggle of my people...I was born into it and I don't know anything else,\" she said in 2022.Lidia Thorpe has a history of high-profile protests. In 2020, during her swearing-in ceremony as a senator, she raised a black power salute while wearing a traditional possum-skin cloak and holding an Aboriginal message stick. The stick bore 441 marks to symbolise Aboriginal deaths in custody following a royal commission in 1991. In 2022, after being re-elected, she referred to the late Queen Elizabeth II as \"the colonising Her Majesty\" during her oath, for which she was required to repeat the correct wording.",

        "text": "Ananya Panday's film CTRL debuted on Netflix today (October 4). Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, the movie also stars Vihaan Samat in a key role. In a recent interview, Ananya revealed that she gets her \u201cnazar\u201d taken out every week to ward off negativity. \u201cI take out my nazar every week. The help at my house does the mirchi thing. You know the Mirchi thing? So, if it smells a lot, it means you have nazar. If the mirchi burns a lot, you have nazar. I don't know the science behind it,\u201d Ananya said in a video shared on Netflix India's YouTube channel. The actress also mentioned that her mother, Bhavana Panday, often puts \u201ckaala teeka\u201d behind her ear to shield her from the evil eye. She said, \u201cMy mom put two black dots behind my ear before I came here. Everyone thinks I don't shower or have something dirty behind my ear, but my mom keeps putting it again and again.\u201d(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Last month, Netflix dropped the trailer for CTRL. The story follows Ananya Panday's character Nella and her seemingly perfect life. She stumbles onto Control Your Life, an AI-based program. Her life changes after logging into the app. Nella's relationship with her boyfriend Joe (Vihaan Samat) comes to an end after he cheats on her but everyone blames her. In resentment, Nella says to CTRL, \u201cI just want to erase my ex.\u201d While Nella wants to take away her suffering, the app has different ideas. Soon after, Joe's presence in the real world starts fading along with his social media blueprint. After a phone conversation, Nella learns that Joe has gone missing. \"But isn't that what you wanted?\" an AI-generated character asks Nella in the last few seconds of the trailer.Sharing her thoughts on playing Nella, Ananya Panday said in a statement, \u201cMy character Nella is like any of us. She's caught up in a world dominated by technology and social media. CTRL explores how we navigate the fine line between our online presence and who we are in real life. Working with Vikram sir and Nikhil sir has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait for you to watch it on Netflix and uncover the connection between Nella and Allen,\u201d reported News18. CTRL is produced by Nikhil Dwivedi and Arya Menon under Saffron and Andolan Films.",

While the story takes a thrilling turn with AI going out of control, Ananya shared how she handles breakups in real life.Speaking to ANI, Ananya revealed that, unlike her character Nella, she leans on her \u201creal friends\u201d when going through tough times, especially breakups.\u201cI lean on my real-life friends only. As Nella proved in the film, it\u2019s not the best thing to rely on AI and all these digital things.

Sometimes I\u2019m able to deal with stuff better, and some days it affects me a lot more.

        "text": "The media is buzzing with tales of a whopping Rs 50 crore heist from a retired IAS officer\u2019s high residence in the tranquil hills of Uttarakhand. What\u2019s drawing attention is not just the theft, but also the great question\u2014how did such a hefty sum of money get there in the first place? The babu, once a powerful figure in a nearby state government and still considered very close to the Chief Minister there, has now become the focus of suspicion on social media, where rumours are spreading quickly. What makes this case even more intriguing is the fact that no formal FIR has been lodged, despite the scale of the theft. Some media outlets have meanwhile received notices, we\u2019re hearing. Neither the authorities nor anyone associated with the officer appears prepared to speak out, adding to the mystery. A Lucknow-based daily broke the story, alleging ties to a powerful ex-bureaucrat but not naming any names. As expected, the story has since gone viral, with social media users spreading the word and speculating about the officer\u2019s identity. Many people question why the authorities are so tight-lipped. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the officer\u2019s wife was emotionally affected by the occurrence, adding another layer of personal drama to an already sensational case. What\u2019s really going on here? Some argue that this is yet another example of how certain public officials stash illicit wealth in cash to avoid detection by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Cash is harder to trace, making it a convenient way to fly under the radar of anti-corruption bodies. If the stolen money is found, experts warn that any attempt by the officer to reclaim it could trigger a new legal firestorm under the Prevention of Corruption Act. For now, the silence around the case only seems to intensify public curiosity. The lack of an official statement, whispers about who the officer might be, and the staggering amount of money involved have everyone waiting for more details to surface. The case may even impact the prevailing tensions between the Centre and the state chief minister. Watch this space for updates. Delhi DMs get more powers, ruffle feathers The Delhi government\u2019s recent move to form \u2018working groups\u2019 of District Magistrates (DMs) to assess and improve the functioning of various departments has raised eyebrows, especially among senior babus. These groups are tasked with reviewing departmental operations and submitting actionable recommendations by October 5. They\u2019ve also been empowered to hold meetings with concerned officials\u2014which is the tricky part. Many in the administration are questioning the practicality of junior DMs overseeing and advising more experienced senior officials. Some see this as an unusual situation, with younger IAS officers from recent batches being asked to recommend improvements to departments headed by officials with decades of experience. This bold move comes at a time of transition for Delhi, with newly appointed Chief Minister Atishi stepping into the shoes of Arvind Kejriwal. Known for her focus on education reforms, Atishi now faces the challenge of managing the city\u2019s broader governance issues. This initiative is likely part of her broader strategy to improve inter-departmental synergy and bring fresh perspectives to long-standing administrative processes. A senior official explained that this initiative aligns with Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena\u2019s vision of making DMs more active and dynamic. Take that with a pinch of salt! The order coincides with a renewed push for cohesion between Atishi, AAP ministers, and senior babus, aiming for better coordination across key departments like transport, health, and education. Whether this approach will foster the intended inter-departmental synergy or cause further friction remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly a shake-up in Delhi\u2019s administrative corridors. Why merging DIPAM and DPE makes sense The government is once again considering the merger of two important departments: the Department of Investment & Public Asset Management (DIPAM) and the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). Both play crucial roles in managing Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and if all goes according to plan, they could soon be working together under the Ministry of Finance. The idea behind the merger is to create more synergy and liquidity for the NDA government\u2019s ambitious investment projects, particularly as it prepares for major reforms aimed at boosting growth and employment. This proposal isn\u2019t entirely new. It was first floated during the NaMo 2.0 era but didn\u2019t materialize for various reasons. The project was revived again in the list of \u201c100 days programme\u201d conceived by the Modi sarkar before the May 2024 Lok Sabha polls. So why merge these two departments? DIPAM deals with investment and disinvestment in CPSUs, while DPE focuses on the management and performance of these enterprises. When a CPSU is up for closure or divestment, DIPAM initiates the process, and DPE handles the final closure. A merger could streamline this process and make things more efficient. It seems the government is banking on this move to bring much-needed agility to its public sector investment strategy ahead of 2024. By Dilip Cherian",

Hathaway will also produce under her Somewhere Pictures banner. Naia Cucukov, Lim's producing partner at 100 Tigers, will executive produce the film alongside Melissa Stack. Princess Diaries 3 has been in development since 2022 and, last year, Hathaway shared an update about the long-awaited movie's progress in an interview with V Magazine. \"We're in a good place,\" Hathaway teased. \"There's nothing to announce yet. But we're in a good place,\" she had said. Flora Greeson is writing the script. Plot details haven't been confirmed, but the threequel is expected to continue the story in 2001's The Princess Diaries and the 2004 sequel Royal Engagement rather than rebooting the series. Lim is best known for penning the mega-hit movie Crazy Rich Asians, which grossed $174 million domestically for Warner Bros.",

        "text": "Many people wonder whether street vendors earn more than many white-collar professionals. A vlogger has now highlighted the impressive monthly income of a vada pav seller, leaving the internet stunned. Sarthak Sachdeva shared a video on Instagram where he joined a local vendor and worked on his cart. The clip begins with the content creator saying, \u201cAaj mai dekhunga ek din mein vadapav bechke mai kitne paise kama sakta hu. Subah ki shuruyaat dekhke aur seekhke kiya, phir garam garam vada pav banake. Ek ke baad ek customer aane laage. [Today, I will see how much money I can earn by selling vada pav in a day. I started the morning by observing and learning, then made hot vada pavs. Soon, one customer after another began to arrive.]\u201d The content creator was even heard telling a customer, \"Aaj mera pehla din hai thele pe [Today is my first day on the food cart].\" Then, he said, \u201cEk vada pav 15 rupae ka tha. Ek ke baad ek customer thele pe aa rahe the aur pata chal raha tha ki subhe subhe vada pav ki kitni demand hoti hai. Aur 2.5 ghante mein kareeb 200 vadapav bik chuke the. [One vada pav costs Rs 15.

        "title": "Heritage Circles or Hoardings ?",
        "text": "This year\u2019s Dasara illumination is mediocre but the Circles are worse. Mysuru has turned into \u2018flexuru\u2019, thanks to the Government\u2019s decision to hand over key Circles to private players. What used to be iconic landmarks are now little more than giant hoardings. Interestingly, according to sources, most of these companies were not interested to take over the Circles as they did not have enough time to create aesthetic designs but agreed to sponsor so as to not \u2018upset\u2019 the administration. But here\u2019s the burning question: If the Government is intent on selling off our public spaces to the highest bidder, then why did they bother increasing the Dasara budget? And they did this while creatively sidestepping public tenders by invoking the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act. For those not in the know, the KTPP Act allows the Government to bypass open bidding when it claims it \u2018ran out of time.\u2019 How convenient. So, we\u2019re left wondering \u2014 was the whole Dasara preparation process conveniently delayed just to activate this loophole and handpick the \u2018right\u2019 contractors? Here\u2019s where it gets truly puzzling: The Dasara budget ballooned from Rs. 29 crore last year to Rs. 40 crore this year. That\u2019s a whopping Rs. 11 crore more, and yet, somehow, they still felt the need to hand over our beautiful Circles to private companies. Now, instead of historic monuments, we\u2019re greeted by enormous sponsor logos and political banners. The District Administration appears to have forgotten that Mysuru is not just any city; it is a heritage city, where even a traffic Circle has historical significance, whether in its name, its design, or its location, which is meant to reflect the unique character of the city. But now, under a barrage of gaudy lights, sponsor logos and political banners, these once-distinguished Circles are telling a different story \u2014 a story of administrative neglect, lack of imagination, and unbridled greed. It is truly disheartening that the first impression tourists arriving from Bengaluru by road receive is no longer one of beauty or history, but of consumer products and political personalities. This unregulated give-away of public spaces without the establishment of any proper guidelines has led to what can only be described as a visual assault. Seeking sponsorship to improve public spaces isn\u2019t inherently a bad idea. Done right, it can be a win-win situation \u2014 enhancing the city\u2019s beauty while also attracting investment. But the way it\u2019s been executed here is anything but right. To begin with, the administration did not give sponsors enough time to plan and design their campaign. Next, if public spaces like Circles or medians are to be leased to sponsors, there must be clear and enforceable ground rules, which we don\u2019t have. Other countries have stringent design approval committees for such purposes, often comprising experts from renowned advertising agencies or design institutions. Why can\u2019t Mysuru do the same? We could have a \u2018Dasara Public Space Design\u2019 Approval Committee which MUST comprise people from reputed design firms and schools such as the National Institute of Design or Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. Such a Committee would ensure that sponsors adhere to basic aesthetic principles, like limiting the sponsor\u2019s logo to no more than 20 percent of the space and ensuring that the advertisement blends harmoniously with the theme of Dasara and surrounding architecture. Additionally, it could enforce rules that protect the physical structure of these heritage sites, ensuring that nothing is permanently damaged. What we have now, however, is a chaotic free-for-all, where anyone with a banner can turn our historical Circles into personal billboards. For years now, the city\u2019s once-pristine Circles have been turned into medieval town squares, plastered with garish posters announcing everything from elections to festivals to, morbidly, even deaths. But MCC does nothing to stop this vandalism. Way back in 2006, the MCC proposed to declare K.R. Circle, Five-Lights Circle, Ramaswamy Circle etc., as \u2018hoarding-free\u2019 zones and ban commercial hoardings within 100 metres of heritage sites. What happened? Nothing. In 2009, MCC started an \u2018illegal hoarding drive\u2019, what happened? Nothing. In 2011, MCC Commissioner K.S. Raikar made a grand announcement: \u201cWe held discussions with the City Police Commissioner and cases will be filed against those violating the MCC directive on flex boards.\u201d What happened? Nothing. Earlier this year, in 2024 the MCC Commissioner said that they have issued notices and asked the Zonal Commissioners to clear out the flex\u2026 what happened? Nothing. Today, flex posters not only remain all around heritage Circles and buildings, but they have also now become part of the structure and with that part of Dasara too! What a sad reflection of incompetence, of a District Administration, of a Royal Heritage City, one that hosts a world-famous festival! Unless the MCC really flexes its muscles against flex, our city will become \u2018Flex City\u2019 and unless they make rules for sponsors of Circles during Dasara, then Historic Circles will end up as \u2018Billboards.\u2019 At this rate of callousness, myopic vision and greed, Mysore Palace may be the next big Dasara hoarding with sponsors\u2019 logo adorning the Palace domes. We are doomed. e-mail: [email protected]",

Since his retirement from the ring, he has contributed greatly to the development of wrestling in India, and continues to be an iconic presence in the industry.\u2014 WrestlingWCC (@WrestlingWCC) Like many wrestling stars, The Great Khali too has an incredible car collection. Without further adieu, here are all the amazing cars decking up his garage.Toyota Land Cruiser\u2014 jessicaray0 (@jessicaray0) An impressive inclusion in the collection, the mighty Toyota Land Cruiser is a popular choice in both national and international markets.

It delivers a top speed of 190 kmph. The Land Cruiser is the most expensive car in this list. Toyota Fortuner\u2014 cars_pixels (@cars_pixels) Another beauty from Toyota that can be found in The Great Khali\u2019s garage, is the Fortuner.

PEOPLE reported that things are rocky between Cheryl Hines and Kennedy Jr and they have barely spoken. 'She's embarrassed because he got caught,\" a source told PEOPLE. Hines has been in Europe since shortly after the news broke.Olivia Nuzzi was placed on leave after she acknowledged that her relationship with Kennedy Jr (she didn't name him) turned personal. Kennedy camp vehemently rejected it and asserted that he only met Nuzzi once during the interview last year. But the two camps did not let things be. Kennedy camp claimed Olivia Nuzzi bombarded him with her nudes while Nuzzi camp claimed Kennedy Jr grabbed her arm during the interview in a very creepy way. Nuzzi accused her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza of playing a role in leaking the allegations and Lizza denied those. In a court filing, Nuzzi said Lizza explicitly threatened to make public personal information about her to destroy her life, career and reputation. Amid this controversy, three more women claimed that they have been romantically involved with Kennedy Jr over the past year. According to reports, these three women came in contact with Kennedy Jr through Children's Health Defense -- the advocacy group founded by Kennedy. \u201cThere are a number of women in the \u2018health freedom\u2019 movement who thought of themselves as Bobby\u2019s only one, and I\u2019m quite sure they are angry and shocked to find out they weren\u2019t,\u201d a source told Mediaite. \u201cAfter talking to some of these women, I think what he does is just love bombs them. He makes them feel important, even tells them he loves them, and so they all feel special and wanted.\u201dKennedy's spokesperson did not comment on the fresh allegations. As Kennedy is facing storms one after another, Hines has been in Europe attending several shows during Milan Fashion Week.

        "text": "Pain and disappointment writ large in his face, Sunil, 40, sat down to narrate his story at a lodge on Anna Salai in Chennai. Hailing from Malappuram, he began driving an autorickshaw at his hometown after completing Class X. Since he was struggling to make ends meet, and inspired by tales of people from his district going abroad, he began dreaming of a better life in a foreign country. He was directed to an agent at Palavakkam in Chennai. In the very first meeting, the agent claimed that he had successfully sent many abroad for jobs, and Sunil was quickly convinced. He paid \u20b940,000 to him in processing fees for a job in Israel. However, thereafter, there was no progress at all for months. Sunil met the agent frequently to push his case. Every time, the agent collected more money, and altogether Sunil ended up paying \u20b97 lakh, which he mopped up by mortgaging his house, pledging his wife\u2019s jewellery, and borrowing from relatives. The agent claimed he had tied up with a tour operator in Israel for sending 46 men and women en masse as tourists. Tickets for onward and return journeys and hotel rooms were booked in their names. The plan was that they would travel like tourists and on reaching a famous church in Jerusalem, would disappear amid the crowd. Later, they would stay in the houses of relatives or friends who had already settled down as migrant workers and seek jobs. A plan fraught with danger and rejection, but Sunil went ahead because he was desperate to \u201cgo abroad\u201d. However, the visa was rejected. Neither could he leave Chennai nor was his money repaid. The agent advised him to stay back and wait for another opportunity, promising this time a job in Canada. He demanded a further \u20b98 lakh, and Sunil coughed it up too, borrowing from every one he knew. Forged ID cards On May 1, the agent sent Sunil forged ID cards and documents identifying him as a senior scientist in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) attending a conference of scientists in Canada. This time the visa came through, but as Sunil tried to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the authorities came to know that there was no such conference happening and stopped him. \u201cMy dreams are gone. I had to come back and begged the agent to return the money. Instead of returning the money, he threatened me. I am staying at a cheap lodge for five months now, and I\u2019ve been starving. If I go back home, all the people who lent me money will be at my door. So I am hiding in Chennai. My aged father is down with a terminal illness and my wife is unable to bear this life any more.\u201d Later, investigation revealed that his agent was running an office as a registered bus travel operator. His modus operandi was the same: sending people abroad with forged documents and ID cards as scientists from prestigious research institutions. But Sunil is far from alone in his predicament. The police say there has been a huge increase in the number of overseas job-seekers being cheated by unscrupulous recruitment agents. Once Gulf countries were the most sought-after, but the pattern of migration by unskilled and semi-skilled aspirants indicates that eastern European nations, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, Lithuania and Armenia, are popular. South Korea, Israel, and Canada have also come into the picture. Recently, it came to light that job-seekers from several districts, especially from South India, were recruited through illegal manpower agencies and sent to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar on tourist visas. Victims are then held captive in Cambodia or Laos for work in harsh and restrictive conditions. They are forced to commit online cyber frauds, which is known as \u201ccyber slavery\u201d. These agents do not have a licence from the Ministry of External Affairs, which is mandatory to be involved in any recruitment for work abroad. Typically, they target job-seekers through advertisements posted on social media platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. In 2023, G. Mohan, an engineer from Erode, saw an advertisement on Facebook. Out of curiosity, he clicked the link and entered all details sought. Immediately, he received a call from an agent offering a job in Canada and even permanent residentship. They first collected \u20b950,000 for processing papers, and subsequently, he had to pay \u20b94.5 lakh. Later, they called him, informing there was some delay in getting a visa owing to the India-Canada diplomatic row. \u201cThey asked me to go to any European country and work for some time there. It would be easier to migrate to Canada then. They told me that they would arrange a visa from the Slovakian embassy. Days went by, but there was no progress towards travelling to any country or obtaining a visa. They said they would get a visa for another country and demanded more money. The money I paid has still not been returned,\u201d he recounted. The police later discovered that Akil, 25, of Ernakulam, and S. Veeraragavan, 29, of Tindivanam, also had similar experiences. Irrespective of whom they approached, the police found that some traits were similar. Tutoring the applicants These unregistered agents run their illegal operation from outlets such as browsing centres, tea shops, or petty shops, while some of them have swanky offices, creating the impression of a travel agency. They also tutored applicants on how to approach visa officers in embassies, besides supplying forged documents to them. They even tutored them on how to seek asylum in a foreign country, if they managed to get there. Many of those who were cheated did not file complaints because they were hoping to get their money back. Then how could the police zero in on this racket? Only if the forgery was detected at the processing stage. In September, last year, Mohammed Irfan Khan of Andhra Pradesh appeared with documents before the visa processing staff in the U.S. Consulate in Chennai and claimed that he was a medical professional and wanted a visa to attend a medical expo. All his documents were found to be fake. In November, Rusheekesh Reddy and Dhivakar Reddy of Andhra Pradesh were caught when they produced fake documents for visa processing for Kallem Sai Ram Reddy. Following this trail, the police found out that all fake certificates were generated at a centre at Villivakkam in Chennai, run by Mohammed Riyas and Mageshwaran since 2019. Thirumurthy, 30, of Thanjavur, was one of the victims rescued by Indian authorities recently. He recounted, \u201cWe paid \u20b94.5 lakh to the middleman who arranged this job for a salary of $2,000 a month. Eight of us were taken to Sihanoukville, Cambodia, by road from Bangkok. Our passports were collected by them. Only after landing at the workplace did we realise that it was a scam. We were detained in wire-fenced buildings. When we refused to do their bidding, they would beat us up and even give electric shocks.\u201d He adds, \u201cOur phone and WhatsApp conversations were scrutinised by them constantly. At last, we managed to send a mail to family members. With the help of a native lawyer, we sought the assistance of the Indian High Commission, and were rescued.\u201d R. Viswanathan, vice-president of the Tamil Association in Cambodia, said that based on a series of complaints from the affected persons, the Indian authorities, with the help of local officials, rescued the workers, and were trying to put an end to the illegal recruitment and confinement camps. Recently, the CB-CID registered nine cases and arrested 10 illegal recruitment agents. Similarly, the Greater Chennai Police, along with the Emigration Department, raided 10 locations, registered nine cases, and arrested five persons who operated without licence. The Emigration Department has also identified certain districts as hotspots where people try to go abroad through illegal means. These include Tiruchi, Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Sivaganga, Madurai, Tiruvannamalai, Perambalur, and Thiruvarur. \u2018File complaints\u2019 Greater Chennai Police Commissioner A. Arun has advised people to be wary of fake advertisements of foreign employment. Anyone who has been cheated by unauthorised companies should file a complaint, he has said. Surender, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Job Racket Wing, says no individual or agency can recruit Indian citizens for overseas employment without a valid licence. \u201cHowever, job aspirants get connected to the agents under the radar. We are working on 60 cases of job rackets.\u201d The Emigration Department advises those seeking jobs overseas to engage only with licensed agents. Licensed agents are required to maintain a bank guarantee with the government, and their operations are monitored and regulated by the offices of Protector of Emigrants (PoE). These agents undergo stringent inspections and document verification before they are licensed. A valid job offer comes along with an employment contract duly signed by the foreign employer, recruitment agent, and the worker. The contract must mention the terms and conditions of the job and the salary and other emoluments. Valid offers must allow the worker to emigrate on the strength of employment or work visa or other similar visas, not on a tourist visa. As per the Emigration Act, 1983, no recruiting agent shall collect from the prospective emigrant service charges of more than \u20b930,000 plus GST (18%) for services, excluding airfare and other charges. A receipt has to be issued. M. Rajkumar, Protector of Emigrants, Chennai, says, \u201cWe have 200-odd licensed agents registered with us. People can see the list of licensed agents on www.emigrate.gov.in and check whether their agents are licensed or not. We have also opened a column called job opportunities as of now for ECR (Emigration Clearance Required) countries. Wherever the licensed agents conduct the interviews, it will be posted here.\u201d He adds that aspirants would be safe when they go through licensed agents. \u201cWhen ECR passport-holders go to ECR countries, we verify everything for them and give them emigration clearance.\u201d Job-seekers can dial the PoE helpline 9042149222 for more information.",

        "text": "As Prince Harry is on a solo trip and rumors of Harry-Meghan divorce are rife, it has now come to be reported that Harry did not spend the night of his 40th birthday with Meghan though he was in the US at that time. While many reports call it the \"latest blow to their marriage\", their friends claim that it was actually a gift from Meghan and the couple are not separating -- they are professionally choosing different paths. Meghan was last seen before Harry's birthday. The Duchess of Sussex reportedly booked the trip for Harry so that he could spend the night of his 40th birthday doing a hike on the Montecito peak -- which is part of the Cold Spring Trail in California. It is near Harry-Meghan's mansion.Soon after Harry's birthday, he started his solo tour which has now been extended by a few days and Harry has scheduled some secret meetings. Reports claimed Harry and Meghan have been staying apart and Harry was found moping around by himself at a local cafe. It was when reports of his longing to be back to the Royal Family emerged. It was reported that Harry was feeling homesick as Meghan was busy with her Hollywood and entrepreneurial projects. Sources close to the couple who emphasize that they are not splitting claimed that the phase of Harry moping is over and now he has immersed himself in work according to his liking. Meghan was supposed to accompany him on his tour to New York but she was unwell. From New York, Harry flew to the UK and it was obvious that Meghan would not accompany him there. From UK, Harry went to Africa for a charity event but now Harry has extended his solo trip. Harry was initially scheduled to be back in California this weekend, UK Express reported. But he has chosen to prolong his solo trip. The Duke will likely head to Johannesburg and Cape Town for \"private time\" with family and friends. Another secret visit is also planned but it has been kept out of his official diary, the report said.",

        "title": "Hamas confirms Yahya Sinwar\u2019s death",
        "text": "Jerusalem: Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar , was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza, and the militant group reiterated its stance that hostages taken from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. \u201cThose prisoners will not return to you before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza,\u201d said Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar's Qatar-based deputy and headed up the grou's delegation during several rounds of cease-fire negotiations mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. In a statement, Hamas heralded Sinwar as a hero who \u201cascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.\u201d The statement appeared to refer to a video the Israeli military circulated of Sinwar\u2019s apparent last moments in which a man sits on a chair in severely damaged building, badly wounded and covered in dust. In the video, the man raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli drone. Sinwar\u2019s killing, in what appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, could shift the dynamics of the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas war began. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran , which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be him, half-buried in rubble and with a gaping wound in his head. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that \u201cour war is not yet ended.\u201d But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar\u2019s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar\u2019s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. \u201cWe are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,\u201d Ronen Neutra, father of the Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra, said in a video statement. \u201cSinwar, who was described as a major obstacle to a deal, is no longer alive.\" Netanyahu was planning to convene a special meeting Friday to discuss hostage negotiations, an Israeli official with knowledge of the negotiations said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the their former enemy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. \u201cWhen U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield \u2014 in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy \u2014 the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.\u201d More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza erupted in October last year, issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. Hezbollah's statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel\u2019s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it would activate an additional reserve brigade to the north of its country to support troops battling in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to \u201cplans prepared in advance\u201d to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced...",

        "title": "Sakshi Malik\u2019s memoir \u2018Witness\u2019: The wrestler sees an unsparing image of herself in her own mirror",
        "text": "\u201cIt is indisputable,\u201d reads a line in the autobiography of an Indian cricket icon co-written by a journalist, \u201cthat my parents were very supportive.\u201d\n\nThere is a reason (auto)biographies of Indian sportspersons are almost uniformly inane \u2013 a reason explained by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and memoirist JR Moehringer in a May 2023 piece in The New Yorker.\n\nMoehringer, whose own coming-of-age story The Tender Bar ranks as a classic of the memoirist\u2019s art, and who has co-written the bestselling autobiographies of tennis legend Andre Agassi, Nike founder Phil Knight, and England\u2019s estranged Prince Harry, recounts a conversation he had with the latter during a pre-writing session that did not end well.\n\nA story, carved from a life\n\nAfter a long discussion with Harry, Moehringer refused the offer to co-write the book. Why? \u201cBecause, I told him, everything you just said is about you. You want the world to know that you did a good job, that you were smart. But, strange as it may seem, a memoir isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s not even the story of your life. It\u2019s a story carved from your life, a particular series of events chosen because they have the greatest resonance for the widest range of people\u2026\u201d\n\nThe art of memoir, encapsulated in six words: A story, carved from a life.\n\nThat is the problem with autobiographies of Indian sportspersons \u2013 they tend, more often than not, to be a highlights reel of their careers as they lived it \u2013 or, often, as they want you to think they lived it. What you get is a one-dimensional portrait \u2013 scorecards and career graphs rendered in prose and wallpapered with a litany of clich\u00e9s; what you don\u2019t get is insight into the living, breathing human being behind those accomplishments; the stories carved from their lives.\n\nThere are exceptions. A Shot At History by Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, co-authored by Rohit Brijnath, is one; the more recent I Have The Streets by India\u2019s ace off-spinner R Ashwin, written with Sidharth Monga, is another. To that sparse canon add Witness, the autobiography of champion wrestler Sakshi Malik co-written with veteran sports journalist Jonathan Selvaraj.\n\nWhen the book hits the shelves, the large-type headlines and the buzz in the social media echo chamber will be about Malik\u2019s first up-close experience of sexual harassment and her ongoing battle to bring BJP politician and former Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to book for the serial sexual abuses he is accused of. And that will be a pity, because there is so much more to Malik\u2019s story as both a champion wrestler and an insurgent fighting injustice.\n\nThe battle against Brij Bhushan and his backers in politics \u2013 and, by extension, against the strong arm of the police force \u2013 bookends the story of Malik as an insecure girl from a small village in Haryana; her early, occasionally risible forays into various sports; her discovery of wrestling as the career she always wanted and never knew it till her wandering footsteps led her to the mat.\n\nThe book is hung on the tick-tock timeline of her life and times, both in the ring and out of it, and it is a story of stark contrasts. There is the self-assured sportsperson juxtaposed with the awkward, unsure woman in the throes of a first, and lasting, love. She is the ace wrestler, proud of the painfully acquired strength of thighs and biceps, but also the woman who hates how those same biceps look when she is forced to wear high fashion. She is the gawky village girl who leans heavily on parental support and encouragement in a rigidly patriarchal environment that frowns on women \u201cdisplaying\u201d themselves in skimpy sports costumes but equally, the mature woman battling the realisation that the love of even the most supportive of parents can be subsumed by the lure of the money their accomplished daughter brings in\u2026\n\nSakshi Malik, the person\n\nMalik\u2019s story is layered; it lends what we know of her life a larger frame and a deeper context. Through the pages of Witness, a Sakshi Malik emerges who is no longer just a champion wrestler, or a leader in an ongoing battle against a political strongman and accused sexual abuser \u2013 she is a human being in the true sense of the word, with all the fears and uncertainties, the faults and the foibles that being human entails.\n\nAnd it is all down to a clear-eyed awareness of her own self, abetted by honesty as unsparing of herself as it is of everyone in her orbit. Thus, if she is open about her parents\u2019 unconditional love turning into unbridled greed as the money begins to pour in, or about the politicking of farmer leader Naresh Tikait who insinuated himself into the wrestlers\u2019 protests for his own ends, or about her disenchantment with what she sees as the self-interest of her comrades-in-arms Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, she is equally forthright about her own early forays into petty theft and, more startlingly, about her deepest insecurities.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Moehringer said in an interview where he discussed the art of the memoir, \u201cin order to tell the truth, you simply cannot avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings. It goes down easier if you are equally unsparing of yourself.\u201d\n\nParts of Witness will hurt. Parents, siblings, former opponents, and present comrades will all find reflections of themselves that they would far rather have hidden from the world \u2013 but there is no part of the book that cuts as deep, and is as unsparing, as the image Malik sees in her own mirror.\n\nIn an early chapter, she talks of the paralysing dread that envelops her before every bout, and about how she has \u201cnever enjoyed the actual act of confrontation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany wrestlers have a little bit of nervousness before their bout starts, which helps them get focused for the contest,\u201d Malik writes. \u201cI have come across contestants who tell me they are excited before a bout. They enjoy that feeling of getting into a fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that. I\u2019ve always been afraid, sometimes almost sick with worry.\u201d\n\nWho knew? As one accustomed to reading, and listening to, sportspersons natter on about \u201cembracing the challenge\u201d, \u201csoaking up the pressure\u201d and suchlike inanities, it came as a refreshing change to read an elite sportsperson \u2013 a practitioner of one of the most physically confrontational of all sports \u2013 talk with such openness about the crippling grip of fear that she had to confront, even before she confronted her opponent on the mat, right through her career.\n\nIf being honest \u2013 with oneself first, and then with the reader \u2013 is hard for sportspersons, it is equally difficult for them to talk in an accessible fashion about the nuances of their sport. And there is a reason for this: in her formative years, the sportsperson practices the mechanics of her sport for countless hours until it becomes part of muscle memory. In the heat of competition, she instinctively does what all that practice has prepared her for. Asking her to relieve a bout, to explain the mechanics of a takedown, is akin to asking a pilot how she flies a plane, or a writer how she organises her material and engages her reader.\n\nHere, again, Malik scores \u2013 a favourite section, one that I went back to after a first read-through of the entire book, is chapter ten where Malik delves into the arcana of \u201cweight cutting\u201d, a phrase that entered the public consciousness thanks to the fiasco of Vinesh Phogat failing, by 100 grams \u2013 one third the weight of an adult human heart \u2013 to qualify for the final of the 50kg wrestling competition in the Paris Olympics.\n\nElsewhere, there are illuminating details about the mechanics of various forms of takedowns, insights into how a wrestler reads and counters an opponent\u2019s strategy \u2013 a wealth of detail, told in accessible form, that made me go back to YouTube videos of her various bouts, including the Rio Olympics bronze medal match in the 58-kg category that made her India\u2019s first woman Olympic medallist in wrestling, with a new awareness and appreciation of the sport.\n\nWe consume sport in boxes \u2013 the playing field, the wrestling ring, the boundaries of our television screens. And yet the real story, unseen by us, lies outside these boundaries, in what ace sportswriter Gary Smith calls \u201cthe psyche of the sporting spirit.\u201d\n\nWriting an energising memoir\n\nThe likes of Andre Agassi, Phil Knight and Prince Harry needed a Moehringer to go outside those boxes, to delve into and unearth the stories hidden behind those medals, the fame, the public persona. Malik finds the ideal amanuensis in Jonathan Selvaraj, a veteran sportswriter who has spent decades covering those sports, including wrestling, that play out in the nearly impenetrable shadow cast by cricket.\n\nOn the evidence of this book, Selvaraj has mastered sprezzatura, the ability to conceal art. Selvaraj brings to the book the art and the craft of a skilled storyteller \u2013 a mastery of narrative arc and of pacing, the ability to focus on what is important, the minute attention to the telling detail. Rather than chisel and sand and buff and polish the story to death, Selvaraj helps Malik embrace the volatility, the insecurities, integral to the human condition.\n\nWhere Selvaraj really excels though is in his ability to step back and let Malik\u2019s natural voice, with which we have become familiar through the many press conferences and interviews she has given in the course of her battle against Brij Bhushan, shine through. It is Selvaraj who writes, but it is Malik we hear.\n\nMalik\u2019s lived experiences and refreshing honesty combine seamlessly with Selvaraj\u2019s self-effacing pen to produce a sports biography that is energising, and compellingly readable.\n\nWitness, Sakshi Malik with Jonathan Selvaraj, Juggernaut.",

The two cases, though separate, have brought attention to growing criminal activities in the region, prompting swift action from local law enforcement.\n\nThe first case involves a 52-year-old mushroom trader from Tanda Rajpur, Palampur. He lodged a complaint against four individuals\u2014two women and two men\u2014accusing them of extortion and blackmail. According to the victim, the incident began when he received a call from a woman in Ram Chowk, Palampur, asking to purchase mushrooms. Upon arriving at her house, he found two women inside. They gave him water, locked the door, and then engaged in obscene acts. Shortly after, two men entered the room, assaulted him, and forcibly filmed an obscene video.\n\nThe victim claimed the group demanded \u20b91.5 lakh, threatening to release the video if he didn\u2019t pay. Terrified, he approached the Palampur police station, where a formal case was registered. Station in-charge Bhupendra Singh Thakur confirmed that an investigation is underway, with the accused currently being tracked by the police.\n\nMeanwhile, in Manali, local police exposed a gang involved in prostitution-related fraud after receiving a complaint from Pradeep Bagati, a resident of Jharkhand. Bagati reported that he was tricked by a woman at the Manali bus stand, who promised him a room at a cheap rate. When he followed her to Aleu, she demanded \u20b92000 for engaging in sexual activity. As soon as he undressed, she took photographs and summoned her accomplices. A second woman and two men then entered, robbing him of \u20b95000 in cash, taking his ATM card, and withdrawing \u20b910,000.\n\nThe gang threatened Bagati, demanding an additional \u20b950,000 to ensure his release. Bagati managed to escape and alerted the Manali police. Acting swiftly, the police arrested the suspects and recovered 12 mobile phones, ATM cards, and cash. The arrested individuals were identified as Vishal from Shimla, Deepak from Chandigarh, and two women from Kullu and Manimajra.\n\nManali police station in-charge Manish Sharma stated that this gang had been operating for over two years, targeting unsuspecting individuals. The gang\u2019s network is now under further investigation, with more arrests likely.\n\nThese two cases underline the growing concern over extortion and organized fraud in Himachal Pradesh, as police intensify efforts to combat such criminal activities.",

Meanwhile, Dhoni is keeping fans and pundits guessing about his future with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction. With five IPL titles under his belt, Dhoni\u2019s IPL future will play a crucial role in shaping the franchise\u2019s strategy for the next season.Interestingly, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) recently introduced a new rule allowing players who have not represented India for over five years to be classified as 'uncapped'.

        "text": "Air pollution is back to haunt the national capital with the onset of winter and early morning and late-night fog. \nOn Saturday, Delhi\u2019s Anand Vihar reported PM 2.5 of 326 and PM 10 levels of 654, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to activate Stage 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan from October 15. GRAP includes measures to control dust, waste management, and ensure vehicular restrictions, with mist-spraying drones to monitor and tackle pollution hotspots.\nThe Delhi government on Monday also imposed a blanket ban on the sale and use of firecrackers till January 1, 2025, in view of the likely deterioration of air quality in the city during the winter.\nTo further understand the effects of the deteriorating air quality, LocalCircles conducted a survey which revealed that 36 per cent Delhi-NCR families have one or more members with sore throat, cough and breathing difficulty/asthma due to rising levels of pollution, while 27 per cent have someone with a runny nose/congestion.\nThe survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. A total of 61 per cent respondents were men while 39 per cent were women.\nThe survey also sought to know the steps Delhiites were taking or planning to take to combat the issue of air pollution. While only 18 per cent citizens of Delhi-NCR said they will use air purifiers to reduce the impact of pollution, a large majority said they would just live with it by increasing the intake of immunity foods and drinks. A total of 22 per cent respondents are planning to travel for some part of the next one month. It is also likely that many have planned travels for Diwali which also allows them to get away from peak pollution days in Delhi-NCR when AQI has touched 1000 in the past.\nYear after year for the last decade, AQI levels in the region have been touching 500-1000 between October 15 and December 1, causing devastating long-term impact on the health of residents and no concrete solutions have been implemented to address this at a structural, policy and enforcement level.\nEmissions from transportation account for approximately 19.2 per cent of Delhi\u2019s air pollution, according to the Centre\u2019s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management in Delhi.\nAnother major contributor to the worsening air quality is stubble burning in neighbouring states. Satellite data on Wednesday reported 99 fire incidents in Punjab, 14 in Haryana, 59 in Uttar Pradesh, and one in Delhi.\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered \u201cgood\u201d, 51 and 100 \u201csatisfactory\u201d, 101 and 200 \u201cmoderate\u201d, 201 and 300 \u201cpoor\u201d, 301 and 400 \u201cvery poor\u201d, and 401 and 500 \u201csevere\u201d.",

Eight were found alive on Wednesday after being reported missing after an avalanche on Sunday, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nAn avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, such as a hill or mountain. Avalanches can be triggered spontaneously, by factors such as increased precipitation or snowpack weakening, or by external means such as humans, other animals, and earthquakes.\n\nPrimarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches have the capability to capture and move ice, rocks, and trees.\n\nAvalanches occur in two general forms, or combinations of slab avalanches made of tightly packed snow, triggered by a collapse of an underlying weak snow layer, and loose snow avalanches made of looser snow.\n\nAfter being set off, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they capture more snow. If an avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air, forming a powder snow avalanche.\n\nThough they appear to share similarities, avalanches are distinct from slush flows, mudslides, rock slides, and serac collapses. They are also different from large-scale movements of ice.\n\nAvalanches can happen in any mountain range that has an enduring snowpack. They are most frequent in winter or spring but may occur at any time of the year. In mountainous areas, avalanches are among the most serious natural hazards to life and property, so great efforts are made in avalanche control.",

Four years down the line, their Montecito neighbors are not very happy about the royals settling at their place.

The residents are expressing frustration that the coastline is now becoming exclusive to wealthy property owners. UK Express reported that restricting access to public beaches was illegal in Portugal until recently but new regulations now allow local councils and government agencies to designate certain beaches as \"private\". \"Worst thing to happen to the Portuguese coast, typical greed situation. Taking land and property from locals who have been enjoying it for years,\" one wrote. \"I am very upset by this massive piece of Portuguese land destroyed for the rich, removed from the average local that had been creating memories in this place for generations and generations,\" another said. \"I have been going to this place for years, camped there several times and, because of this company, this is no longer possible,\" another said. Reports said Harry and Meghan chose Portugal to be close to Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank who own a home at the Costa Terra Gold and Ocean Club in Melides. Harry and Meghan will not be shifting out of the US and their Portuguese resort will be more like a holiday home for them. Reports said the resort is on a picturesque and unexplored beach in the Algarve and has become a popular holiday destination. Once completed, the resort is set to have 300 homes, with prices starting at a whopping \u00a33.6million.The news has put speculations over Harry-Meghan divorce to sleep following their individual engagements.

The British monarch arrived in Sydney late on Friday evening for their 9-day Australia tour.Later, Charles will address the New South Wales state parliament and visit the Admiralty House for a series of private meetings with top officials.Royal watchers will have another opportunity to see the king on Monday when he arrives in Canberra with Queen Camilla for the busiest portion of his streamlined schedule.In the past, visiting British royals would undertake extended tours, drawing large crowds of excited, flag-waving supporters.

        "text": "After a disaster like \u2018Jigra\u2019 featuring Alia Bhatt, some Telugu distributors are wary about distributing another Bollywood actress film in the two Telugu states. \u201cWomen centric movies are not fetching even bare minimums openings and it would be difficult for Kangana to release her film \u2018Emergency\u2019 without much fuss,\u201d says a distributor. \u201cProbably, she has to tour Hyderabad and promote her political thriller by hosting big events, only then it could create some buzz in trade circles,\" he adds. Earlier, Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut's much-anticipated film \u2018Emergency\u2019 has cleared a significant hurdle as it recently received certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The film, which portrays the controversial political period of the 1975 Emergency in India, has been under scrutiny for its depiction of historical events and figures, particularly former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who is portrayed by Ranaut. Of course, Bollywood teams are reportedly in discussions with Telugu distributors but no agreements have been finalized for the film to hit theaters. \u201cKangana's recent films \"Chandramukhi 2\" and \"Dhakkad,\" had underperformed in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In all likelihood \"Emergency\" would be released on a commission basis. In which, the film would release in theatres. Then all the collections are garnered and given back to makers, after deducting theatre rentals and 8 to 10% commission,\u201d he informs. He believes the film would attract more viewers in Telangana, particularly in the Nizam region, compared to Andhra Pradesh, where Hindi films generally receive less patronage.",

Earlier, comedy kings like Brahmanandam, M S Narayana, and Vennela Kishore managed to draw more applause than heroes in some of their movies. Now, it is the turn of young comedian Satya to make his presence felt in his latest release 'Mathu Vadalara 2'. \"No doubt, Satya stole the show with his comic one-liners and unique mannerisms and has become the flavor of the season,\" adds the source. He claims that Satya would be roped in by other producers since few distributors are insisting for his comedy and few ongoing films could have his comedy track to cash in on his popularity. \"He will be doing comedy in another big star movie and discussions are underway, \" he adds. He also claims that probably by now, few producers would have reached him to cast him as a \u2018hero\u2019 in the films since the laugh-riot has set cash registers ringing in two Telugu states. \u201cHe may soon turn a protagonist and is surely grabbing plum comic roles too,\u201d he concludes.",

The streets buzzed with excitement as women prepared for this special day dedicated to the well-being and long life of their husbands. Various organisations and local communities came together to organise programmes and gatherings for the cultural celebrations. Women dressed in vibrant, traditional attire were the centre of attraction of the festival. Their hands were adorned with intricate mehndi designs, symbolising love and devotion.\n\nFrom dawn, the women observed a day-long fast, refraining from food and water. This fast is a key ritual of Karva Chauth and is kept until the moon appears in the night sky. The day began with Sargi, a pre-dawn meal given by mothers-in-law to their daughters-in-law, symbolising the bond between them. As the day progressed, groups of women gathered in homes or community centres, sharing stories and songs related to the significance of the festival. They passed the Karva (a clay pot) around in a circle, singing traditional songs of marital bliss.\n\nKarwa Chauth Moon Rise Timings In MP: Moon Will Be First Seen In Bhopal Followed By Indore; Check...\n\nIn the evening, as twilight fell, the anticipation grew. Women sat in beautifully decorated spaces, their thalis prepared with diya, rice and sweets, waiting for the moon to rise. Once the moon appeared, they gathered on rooftops or terraces, gazing at it through a sieve, symbolising the filtering of negativity. They then offered water to the moon, seeking its blessings before breaking their fast by sipping water and eating a sweet from their husband's hands. Throughout the city, the sounds of laughter, music and blessings filled the air, as families gathered to celebrate the bond of love and the strength of relationships, making the night of Karva Chauth a truly magical and heart-warming experience.\n\nOne unique programme took place in the Pashupatinath Porwal Social Group. They celebrated the Karva Chauth festival at The Meera Garden, Rajiv Gandhi Square, Indore. Over 250 people participated in the event and passed a message to observe No Car Day once a week. The males of the group were seen holding placards and they also took a pledge to keep the environment safe.\n\nMaharashtra: NCP-Ajit Pawar Faction Appoints Ashish Damle As Chairman Of New Brahmin Economic Development Body\n\nMumbai: Doctor Dupes Colleague Of \u20b934.97 Lakh In Medical Camp Scam\n\nMumbai: Peon Arrested For Sexually Assaulting Minor At School Premises\n\nMaharashtra: ACB Files 26 Disproportionate Assets Cases Involving \u20b929 Crore\n\nFollow us on",

A recent video showing a snake effortlessly swallowing an egg significantly larger than its head has left viewers speechless. The video, captured in a single motion, opens to show an egg resting in a human hand. The serpent then proceeds to devour the oversized egg, as its jaws expand to accommodate its food. The staggering size difference between the egg and the snake's head has ignited widespread fascination, leaving many wondering how this remarkable act is physiologically possible.\n\n''Snake gulping an entire egg bigger than its head,'' the video was captioned on X page 'Nature is Amazing.'\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nSnake gulping an entire egg bigger than its head pic.twitter.com/YN2TwWLaVd\u2014 Nature is Amazing \u2618\ufe0f (@AMAZlNGNATURE) October 18, 2024\n\nThe jaw-dropping footage has sparked both fascination and concern. Since being shared the video has amassed more than 6 lakh views and close to 300 comments. \n\nOne user explained, ''A snake swallowing an entire egg larger than its head is a remarkable example of its unique anatomy and feeding capability. Snakes have flexible jaws, which are not rigidly attached like in many other animals. This flexibility allows them to stretch their jaws wide open to accommodate prey much larger than their head. In the case of an egg, the snake carefully manoeuvres it into its mouth and gradually swallows it whole. Once inside, special muscles in the snake's bodywork to break the egg's shell, after which the contents are digested, and the shell is later regurgitated. This incredible ability showcases the snake's evolutionary adaptations for survival.''\n\nAnother said, ''That's a remarkable sight! Snakes have the ability to stretch their jaws to consume prey much larger than their heads, thanks to their unique jaw structure. It's a fascinating example of nature's adaptability.''\n\nA third said, ''Incredible sight! Nature is fascinating.'' A fourth added, ''Omg this is really shocking.'' A fourth added, ''Creatures are so different that every single creature has its own uniqueness.''\n\n''That sounds wild! Snakes are fascinating when they eat something that seems too big for them.

Recalling the event, she said, \"We go to Sunita Kapoor's house, Anil Kapoor's wife. So all of us go there and break the fast together. We have to go to the terrace to see the moon. So all of us go together. So we got the channi (strainer) and placed the diyas there. I told Chunky to hold his position because we were waiting to eat.\" Bhavana then complained how Chunky Pandey's old habits landed her in an awkward situation. \"Chunky has this old habit. I prepared everything and the moment I turned around he was gone. I don't know whether he got a call or something else happened, and the channi landed straight on the face of Boney Kapoor! I instantly turned around and yelled, 'Chunky, where are you?' He came back and took his position. Then I did the ritual properly,\" she concluded. This made everyone burst into laughter, leading Kapil to a witty comeback. He joked that Boney Kapoor must have been wondering why Sridevi (his late wife) looked so different that day.
