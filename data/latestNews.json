Then he took a flight back to London that evening and then returned to India after two days,\u201d alleged Ambedkar, the grandson of the Chief Architect of the Indian Constitution B. R. Ambedkar.\n\nRejecting the claims, NCP (SP) National Spokesperson Clyde Crasto said that it is clear that Ambedkar is attempting to create a \u2018fake narrative\u2019 ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear\u2026 He is speaking on behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2026 He is just trying to float a narrative with the state assembly polls coming up soon,\u201d said Crasto dismissively.\n\nOn the purported trip around 35 years ago, Ambedkar questioned that as Pawar was the Chief Minister then did he get the permission of the Central government before travelling abroad.\n\n\u201cDid the Centre allow him to travel and attend the meetings in California then? If yes, then was he also permitted to go and meet Dawood in Dubai? Were those meetings official or unofficial and reported to the central government or not,\u201d demanded Ambedkar.\n\nWhen pointed out, the VBA chief said that he was raising it as it\u2019s (Assembly) election time and he wanted to caution the people to choose the party which they vote for carefully, in view of the current political situation in the world, and attacks like the killing of MahaYuti ally Nationalist Congress Party leader Baba Ziauddin Siddique on October 12.\n\nHe called upon the NCP (SP), and the Central government to come clean on this and provide an explanation on all this, why the meetings were held since the country had faced a series of bomb blasts and terror strikes in the 1990s, and a similar situation unfolding now for which we must be on alert. \n\n\u201cI am not making any allegations, but merely putting forth certain facts, and demand that the NCP (SP) and the (current) government should give an explanation. Moreover, the current international situation is disturbing and India\u2019s relations are getting damaged with the USA, Canada, and in the Middle East,\u201d contended Ambedkar.",

People have a right to know what is in the report,\u201d he said. \n\nHe added that implementing the caste census is a different matter, but the information from the report must be made public first. \n\nResponding to questions about the reservation for Panchamasali Lingayats in 2A Category, internal reservations, and the caste census report, he said: \u201cThe state government and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah are fully capable of handling all these issues. We will have discussions and make decisions on how to address the concerns of various communities.\u201d\n\nHe added that there is a directive that reservations should not exceed 50 per cent. \n\n\u201cIn some states, they have exceeded this limit. Tamil Nadu has legally implemented 69 per cent reservation by adding it to Schedule 9 of the Constitution. In our state too, various communities are asking for increased reservation, which will require exceeding the 50 per cent limit,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that Siddaramaiah has announced that the caste census report prepared during his first tenure will be tabled in the Cabinet.",

I am an Indian and would respect the national flag and chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai,\u201d he said.\n\nKhan said he had raised anti-national slogans for a video, but at that time he didn\u2019t realise the mistake may take him to jail. \u201cNow, I would request all my friends not to raise anti-national slogans or disrespect the national flag. I would not make this mistake again ever in my life,\u201d he added.\n\nMisrod police station in-charge said a video of Khan saluting the national flag and chanting \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 has been recorded, which will be produced before the high court. Notably, the court has also directed the Bhopal Police Commissioner to ensure compliance with this condition for bail.\n\nOn October 15, the court of Justice Dinesh Kumal Paliwal while hearing Faizan\u2019s bail application had said, \u201cTill the trial of the case is underway, the accused (Faizal Khan) will have to visit Misrod Police Station in Bhopal on every 1st and 4th Tuesday of the month and salute the national flag at the police station building.\u201d\n\nFaizal Khan, a resident of Raisen district, was arrested by Madhya Pradesh Police in May for allegedly raising anti-national slogans \u2014 \u2018Pakistan Zindabad, Hindustan Murdabad\u2019 in Bhopal.\n\nKhan moved the high court seeking bail claiming that he had been falsely implicated in the case. However, during the hearing, his counsel accepted that his client was seen shouting the anti-national slogan. Therefore, the advocate requested he should be released on bail by imposing some stringent conditions.\n\nAfter hearing the argument, Justice Paliwal noted that undoubtedly, the applicant has a criminal background of 13 criminal cases and in the video, he is seen shouting the slogan as aforementioned. \u201cI am of the view that applicant may be released on bail by imposing some conditions which may enthuse in him the sense of responsibility and a pride for the country in which he is born and living,\u201d Justice Paliwal had said.",

The QIP received bids of approximately six times of the base deal size from a diverse group of investors.\n\nAdani Energy Solutions reported an increase in its project pipeline from Rs 17,000 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal to Rs 27,300 crore in the second quarter (Q2). The transmission network was at 23,269 circuit kilometres (ckm) in the July-September period, compared to 19,862 ckm in the same period of the previous year.\n\nAdani Energy Solutions saw robust growth of 69 per cent in total income, driven by the contribution from the recently commissioned Kharghar-Vikhroli, Warora-Kurnool, Khavda-Bhuj lines, acquired Mahan-Sipat line, higher energy sales in Mumbai and Mundra utilities and contribution from smart metering.\n\nThe company also secured three new transmission projects \u2014 NES in Jamnagar Gujarat, NES in Navinal (Mundra), and Khavda Phase IVA, thereby adding 2,059 ckm to under construction network.\n\n\u201cThe leverage position is healthy, with net debt to EBITDA metric at 3.1 times in H1 FY25,\u201d said the company. The capex as of H1 FY25 was Rs 4,400 crore, as against Rs 2,622 crore in H1 FY24.\n\n\u201cOur credible steps of successfully divesting the Dahanu thermal plant in line with our commitment and achieving an all-time high share of 39 per cent renewable power penetration in Mumbai strengthens our position as true energy transition leader in India,\u201d Patel said.",

However, the filmmaker is quite active on his Instagram.\r\n\r\nEarlier, a war of words ensued between Divya and KJo as the former accused KJo\u2019s prodigy Alia Bhatt of buying the tickets to \u2018Jigra\u2019.\r\n\r\nWhile Karan took to the Stories section of his Instagram, and wrote, \u201cSilence is the best speech you will ever give to fools\u201d. Divya replied by sharing a quote on her Instagram Stories, \u201cTruth will always offend Fools opposed to it\u201d.\r\n\r\nWhen she felt that she hadn\u2019t made her point, and her voice wasn\u2019t heard enough, she uploaded another Story. She wrote, \u201cWhen you are shamelessly accustomed to stealing what rightfully belongs to others, you will always seek shelter in silence. You will have no voice no spine\u201d.\r\n\r\nDivya seemed in no mood to buy the collections as she felt that the collections of the film are inflated at the behest of the production house which is considered one of the premier film studios in Hindi cinema. Interestingly, Divya\u2019s \u2018Savi\u2019 is said to follow the same basic premise of a jail break story as that of Alia\u2019s \u2018Jigra\u2019 (the difference being in \u2018Savi\u2019, the titular character played by Divya carries out prison break of her husband, and in \u2018Jigra\u2019, Alia takes her brother out of the prison).\r\n\r\nWhile \u2018Savi\u2019 managed to make only Rs. 7.83 crore in two weeks of its theatrical run before it was ousted from cinemas for a more lucrative and financially rewarding \u2018Chandu Champion\u2019, Alia\u2019s \u2018Jigra\u2019 earned Rs. 4.5 crore on its opening day.\r\n\r\nFollowing the box-office debacle of 'Jigra' KJo also sold 50% of stakes of his Dharma Productions to Adar Poonawalla.",
