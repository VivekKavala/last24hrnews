This comes after nearly eight decades of work done by UNRWA in Palestine to provide refugees with essential humanitarian aid.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The absence of UNRWA activity in Palestine is expected to further restrict humanitarian access in the nation, leaving millions to fend for themselves amid the ongoing hostilities and the upcoming harsh winter.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> UNRWA has actively supported Palestinians since 1948, distributing essential resources including food, water and shelter, and providing critical public services such as healthcare and education.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

UNRWA and the United Nations (UN) have responded to the bills and denounced Israel's actions towards the people of Palestine.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> "The implementation of the laws could have devastating consequences for Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is unacceptable," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini issued a statement to X (formerly known as Twitter) saying, "These bills will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It ⁠will deprive over 650,000 girls & boys there from education, putting at risk an entire generation of children.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These bills increase the suffering of the Palestinians and are nothing less than collective punishment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>"

Israeli authorities doubled down on their stance on the bills, accusing UNRWA of promoting terrorism and antisemitism.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Yulia Malinovsky, a member of the Knesset, told reporters that UNRWA does not deserve legal immunity from Israeli retaliation, saying that aid personnel should no longer receive "five star treatment" in Israel.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Malinovsky also opined that UNRWA colluded with Hamas.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

"UNRWA chose to make itself an inseparable component of Hamas' mechanism – and now is the time to detach ourselves entirely from it," said former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued a joint statement to Israeli authorities, warning that the newly passed bills "would devastate the humanitarian response in Gaza at this critical moment and deny essential educational and social services to tens of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem".</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This is particularly concerning to humanitarian organizations as almost all of Gaza's population depends on aid to survive.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> At this moment, humanitarian aid is more crucial than ever as Gaza grapples with the high risk of a polio outbreak, the destruction of critical infrastructure, and dwindling resources.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

"Israel has bombed Palestinians to death, maimed them, starved them, and is now ridding them of their biggest lifeline of aid.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Piece by piece, Israel is systematically dismantling Gaza as a land that is autonomous and livable for Palestinians.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The banning of UNRWA today is condemnable and another step in this crime," says Sally Abi Khalil, Oxfam Regional Director in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

UNRWA and its partners, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), began the second round of polio vaccinations in Gaza on October 14.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Although initially successful, continued bombardments halted the campaign from reaching northern Gaza, home to approximately 120,000 unimmunized children.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The deadline to provide these children with the crucial second dose falls in mid-November, after which, chances of full immunization significantly decline.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

"This is a risk not just to the 120,000 children who remain in northern Gaza, children aged ten, and below that is, but also to children in the larger region.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And that's why we are so incredibly worried and pressing for this second round to happen by the beginning of November," says Rosalia Bollen, UNICEF's Communication Specialist in Gaza.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Bollen adds that the polio outbreak, continued hostilities, and the lack of humanitarian aid have taken a severe toll on children's education, describing Gaza's children as "a lost generation".</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> UNRWA hosts a variety of social services in Palestine, including over 183 schools in Gaza.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These schools are set to shut down due to the two newly passed bills.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

As the bills were being passed by the Knesset, Israel continued its aerial campaign in Gaza.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> On the morning of October 29, Israel launched another airstrike on a displacement shelter in Beit Lahiya, causing at least 109 civilian casualties and leveling a five-storey residential building.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Gaza's health ministry has reported that a series of bombardments in densely populated districts in northern Gaza has resulted in over 800 deaths in a three week aerial campaign.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Additionally, intense bombardments have halted humanitarian aid, essentially cutting off the flow of supplies for millions of Palestinians.</p>

In early October of this year, a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned that approximately 96 percent of Gaza will face severe food insecurity, with almost half a million people facing "catastrophic levels" of hunger.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Dujarric also noted that due to UNRWA's removal from Palestine, Israel has an obligation to meet the needs of the millions of people residing in their sovereignties.</p>
