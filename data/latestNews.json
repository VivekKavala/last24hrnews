        "text": "Congress has increased its attack on BRS working president K.T. Rama Rao by squarely blaming him for the Lagacharla village incident, where the Vikarabad Collector and other officials were attacked recently.\n\nWhile addressing the media on Friday, Tourism Corporation Chairman Patel Ramesh Reddy, Roads Development Corporation Chairman Malreddy Ramreddy and MBC Corporation Chairman Jaipal alleged that it was part of \u201cKTR\u2019s plan to destabilise the government\u201d.\n\nThey said people were fed up with the \u2018hate politics\u2019 being spread by KTR and were wondering why the BRS has stooped to such low-level politics. While the Chief Minister is focussing on providing jobs to youngsters, Mr. Rama Rao\u2019s only job seems to be to defame the government at any cost and stall development.\n\nMr. Patel Ramesh Reddy reminded how violent acquisition of land for various projects during the BRS rule was. In both cases, BRS was behind the attacks, he said.\n\nMr. Ramreddy said that Telangana has never witnessed such attacks on officials. Congress fought democratically despite the BRS government clamping down on protests. He argued that BRS leaders were worried about their scams being unearthed and huge debts they had left behind, being exposed. BRS government sold land and looted the State, he alleged.\n\nMr. Jaipal said that the concern being shown by BRS on land acquisition was fake and wondered whether they had any answer for the lakhs of acres that were fraudulently snatched away from farmers using the Dharani portal. Congress is only concerned about bringing industries to the State and not loot land, like the BRS, he said.",

He said that he had held discussions on the quality of the works completed under Smart City Scheme and handing over the same to the municipal corporation and another meeting would be held next month.\n\nMr. Lad said that efforts were required to encourage patients to get treated at ESI Hospitals by providing advanced treatment. There were around 40 lakh ESI beneficiaries and there was need for hi-tech medical equipment and quality treatment at ESI hospitals. A plea for additional grants had been submitted to the Union government, he said.\n\nMr. Lad expressed confidence that guarantee schemes would help the ruling party win the bypolls in the State. The BJP, which had expertise in Operation Lotus had been trying hard for the last 16 months to topple the government but had failed, he said.\n\nTaking a dig at the BJP, he sought to know where were the 100 smart cities that BJP had promised. The roads laid and airports built during BJP regime had suffered damages within no time. Buildings built by the BJP governments were collapsing in 10-11 years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should answer the public on these issues, he said.\n\nTaking exception to Union Minister Pralhad Joshi\u2019s comment on Justice John Michael D\u2019Cunha, he sought to know whether someone could make such disparaging remarks against judges and judiciary.",

        "text": "A study conducted by the Center for Study of Science, Technology, and Policy (CSTEP), a Bengaluru-based think tank, shows that in order to meet the growing demand of electric vehicles (EVs), the city would require more than 36,000 public EV charging guns (25 times more than the number in 2023) and 400 more charging stations by 2030.\n\nBy using the stock projection method, the study, which is called the \u201cBengaluru 2030: EV charging demand and infrastructure\u201d, finds that Bengaluru will have more than 23 lakh EVs on the road by 2030. To help this transition, around 141 acres of land (equivalent of having 700 petrol pumps) would be required to set up the charging stations.\n\nIt has also identified 400 potential spots for setting up the stations. They include IT parks, metro stations, fuel stations, shopping malls, and in nine Regional Transport Office (RTO) zones.\n\nPotential impact on grid\n\nThe study further looks at the potential impact the EV demand could have on the electricity grid and estimates that by 2030, the energy demand would be around 3.3 - 4.1 Billion Units (BU), which would account for around 7% to 9% of the city\u2019s annual energy demand. While the peak load from EV charging was 0.096 gigawatts (GW) in 2023, it is expected to touch around 1.2 GW by 2030.\n\nThe assessment of business viability for charge point operators indicate that the charger utilisation rates would be 25%\u201350% in 2030, and the corresponding tariffs for various types of charger guns could be capped at \u20b911\u201315/kWh. \n\nThe study also administered detailed survey questionnaires to over 1,000 existing and potential EV users (personal and commercial) and found that over 56% of potential buyers prefer electric vehicles over conventional vehicles. More than 55% of the EV owners (both two-wheelers and four-wheelers) responded that they charged their vehicles either at their residence or workplace, while 40% of the commercial two-wheeler EV users preferred to use public charging stations. Commercial three-wheeler and four-wheeler EV users preferred company-provided charging stations.\n\nThe study says that overnight home-charging would cause the least strain on the electricity grid. \u201cTwo extreme charging scenarios were considered - 90% of EV users charging at home and 90% at public charging stations. The scenario wherein 90% of EV users charge at public stations could lead to a peak power demand of 1.4 GW, which is 16% of the city\u2019s projected peak power demand. On the contrary, the peak power demand when 90% of EV users charge at home would be 1.1 GW (~7% lower than the 1.2 GW projection for 2030), resulting in relatively lower stress on the grid,\u201d it says. \n\nHowever, promoting daytime charging at workplaces or public charging stations, through policy measures, may be beneficial for increasing the share of renewable energy used for EV charging.\u201d",

The United Democratic Front (UDF) members will raise a strong protest against it in Parliament,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNobody has asked for aid from the BJP. What the State asked was for special financial assistance from the Centre. What Wayanad requires now is not the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The Union government has revealed its true colours by denying aid for Wayanad,\u201d he said, adding that the BJP government did not say a word about it until polling in Wayanad was over.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition challenged the Centre to say if the State had not given the estimates for the Wayanad disaster. \u201cBJP State president K. Surendran does not have to say that the State had not given the estimates. The State has sought the Central aid, and not the BJP\u2019s aid.\u201d\n\nIllegal votes\n\nMr. Satheesan lashed out at the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the BJP for illegally enrolling votes ahead of the byelection. He said it was the municipality ruled by the BJP that gave false residence certificate to Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate P. Sarin to enrol his vote in Palakkad.\n\n\u201cThe rule says that one should be a resident of a place for at least six months to enrol his/her vote. Dr. Sarin has not been living in Palakkad for the past six months. He shifted to Palakkad recently. Then how did he get a residence certificate of more than six months stay?\u201d Mr. Satheesan asked.\n\nHe said that CPI(M) district secretary E.N. Suresh Babu and Minister for Local Self-Government M.B. Rajesh were under duress within their party. He said Mr. Suresh Babu had failed as a district head of the party, and that was why he was protesting when he found that the UDF had worked systematically by enrolling 5,500 votes.\n\n\u201cElectoral officers are responsible for enrolment of fake voters. They should be taken to task if anyone is found to be a fake voter,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Satheesan said that the CPI(M) had made party central committee member and senior leader E.P. Jayarajan a scapegoat. The party insulted Mr. Jayarajan by making him read out a scripted speech in favour of Dr. Sarin in Palakkad on Thursday evening, he said. \u201cWas it a felicitation meeting, or a condolence meeting in Palakkad? Even the candidate would have laughed. It\u2019s a joke that Kerala\u2019s political annals should limn.\u201d\n\nMr. Satheesan said that the UDF would examine the reasons for the slump in voting in Wayanad.\n\nMunambam issue\n\nIt was the State government and the Waqf Board that took antagonistic stand towards the people of Munambam, he said. The Leader of the Opposition accused the CPI(M) of playing a dirty game by planting news that could instigate communities in the Waqf issue on the eve of the elections.",

However, this principle is not being upheld. \u201cInstead of fostering a culture of scientific temper, efforts are being made to peddle superstitions and false beliefs.
