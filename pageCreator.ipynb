Earlier today, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday that the disengagement process in LAC (Line of Actual Control) in eastern Ladakh is nearly complete.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, while speaking during the inauguration ceremony of Bob Khathing Museum in Assam’s Tezpur, said, “At some areas along the LAC, discussions have been ongoing between India and China at both diplomatic and military levels to resolve conflicts.”“Following recent talks, there has been a broad consensus to restore the ground situation. This consensus has developed on the basis of equal and mutual security. Based on this consensus, the disengagement process is nearly complete. We will strive to move beyond just disengagement, but for that, we will need to wait a little longer,” Defence Minister Singh added. On Wednesday, Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said that it is natural for India and China to have differences as neighbouring countries but the important thing is how to handle and solve these differences.

This period will be filled with honouring his remarkable achievements, and national unity will be reflected in every initiative and mission of the government. When India gained independence, some people in the world estimated that India would disintegrate. They had no hope that a united India could be created by uniting hundreds of princely states, but Sardar Sahib did it. This was possible because Sardar Sahib was a realist in his behaviour, truthful in his resolve, humanitarian in his action, and nationalist in his aim,” the PM said.On ‘Rashtriya Ekta Diwas,’ PM Modi also spoke about how the fulfilment of a unified nation and constitution is his biggest tribute to Sardar Patel. The PM added, “Today the whole country is happy that after seven decades of independence, the resolution of one country and one constitution has been fulfilled. This is my biggest tribute to Sardar Saheb. For 70 years, Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s Constitution was not implemented in the entire country.

Just a couple of hours from the flatlands of Jammu airport lies the stunning Sanget Valley-Patnitop region, a world apart. Riding through the Himalayan foothills might've made for some killer Instagram posts, but let me tell you, it was a workout for my legs! After a long day, I made my way back to Skyview by Empyrean, my cosy weekend getaway, with a massive appetite. Luckily, the culinary team had a delicious surprise waiting for me.\\n\\nNot too far from Udhampur, the Sanget Valley boasts its own culinary gems. While Jammu often takes a backseat to the more famous dishes from Kashmir, one dish has been stealing the spotlight: Khatta Meat from the Dogra community. Thanks to a growing interest in regional cuisines in our post-pandemic world, this unique dish has gained quite the fanbase-especially on chilly mountain days. And the view from the Banana Leaf restaurant at Skyview by Empyrean made for the perfect backdrop as I indulged.\\n\\nAccording to the culinary team (see recipe), it's the signature hot charcoal smoking technique that gives this dish its one-of-a-kind flavour. But Khatta Meat is more than just smoky goodness. There are two standout steps in the recipe-finishing it with dry mango powder and pomegranate seeds and garnishing it with fresh coriander and green chillies - that create a burst of flavour with every bite.\\n\\nThe secret to nailing this dish is smoking those tender mutton chunks with hot charcoal soaked in desi ghee. This happens both during and after cooking. The dish combines a mix of ground and whole spices, red onion, special Kashmiri masala, and mutton cooked in mustard oil. The result? Meat so tender it practically melts in your mouth! While you can pair it with rice or rotis, in the Jammu region, it's often served with Dogri Gheur, a traditional welcome dish for brides or special guests. Don't be fooled by the seemingly complex smoking process; making Khatta Meat is surprisingly easy and totally worth the effort for its mouthwatering blend of tangy and smoky flavours.\\n\\nKhatta Meat Recipe | How To Make Khatta Meat\\n\\nRecipe courtesy - Skyview by Empyrean\\n\\nIngredients\\n\\nMutton: 500 gmOnion (fried): 250 gmGinger Garlic Paste: 15 gmTurmeric Powder: 5 gmKasoori Methi: 20 gmRed Chili Powder: 5 gmGreen Chilli: 4 nos.Salt: To tasteAmchur: 10 gmFennel Seeds Powder: 15 gmMustard Oil: 60 mlCharcoal for smoking\\n\\nFor Garam Masala\\n\\nCumin Seeds: 15 gmCoriander Seeds: 10 gmBlack Cardamom: 2 nos.Green Cardamom: 2 nos.Cloves: 5 nos.Cinnamon Stick: 2 sticks\\n\\nMethod To Make Khatta Meat\\n\\nRoast cumin seeds and coriander seeds in a pan.Grind roasted seeds along with black and green cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon to make fresh garam masala powder.Marinate mutton with ginger garlic paste, salt, chilli powder, turmeric powder, amchur powder, garam masala, mustard oil, and yogurt; set aside for an hour.Heat mustard oil in a heavy-bottomed pan until smoking, add cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, then saute.

The toll will rise because \"there are many missing people\", territorial policy minister Angel Victor Torres predicted late Wednesday.Up to a year\\'s rain fell in a few hours on the eastern city of Valencia and surrounding region on Tuesday sending torrents of water and mud through towns and cities.Authorities said Paiporta, in the Valencia suburbs, had been devastated with about 40 people dead, including a mother and baby swept away by a torrent.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Rescuers have scrambled to get survivors off roofs with helicopters while others have searched houses some with water up to their necks. As dawn rose Thursday, tens of thousands of homes were still without electricity and drinking water and many roads were blocked by the carcasses of hundreds of cars and trucks swept away in sudden torrents. Emergency services carried out 200 rescues on the ground and 70 aerial evacuations on Wednesday, said Valencia regional government chief Carlos Mazon.Valencia\\'s emergency services announced a provisional death toll of 92, adding that bodies were still being recovered. Two people died in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and another victim was reported in Andalusia in the south, officials said.A sea of piled-up cars and mud swamped streets in Sedavi, a suburb of the Mediterranean city of Valencia, AFP journalists saw.Stunned residents battled to clear sludge and water from their homes. \\'Spain weeps\\'In Ribarroja del Turia on the outskirts of Valencia city, town councillor Esther Gomez said workers were stuck overnight in an industrial estate \"without a chance of rescuing them\" as streams overflowed.\"It had been a long time since this happened and we\\'re scared,\" she told AFP.According to Spain\\'s weather service AEMET, Chiva, west of Valencia, recorded 491 mm of rain in just eight hours on Tuesday -- almost equalling a year\\'s worth.\"All of Spain weeps with all of you... We won\\'t abandon you,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told victims and their families in a televised address.Sanchez was to head for Valencia on Thursday.The disaster could not be considered over and \"we will deploy all the necessary resources for as long as necessary so that we can recover from this tragedy,\" he added.King Felipe VI said he was \"devastated\" by the disaster and offered \"heartfelt condolences\" to families of the victims.Damage to telephone networks and flooded roads hampered efforts to reach stricken communities but rescuers\\' access to all urban hubs was restored by Wednesday evening, Mazon said.Some 155,000 homes were without electricity in Valencia region due to the storm, energy company Iberdrola said.The European Union activated its Copernicus satellite system to help coordinate Spanish rescue teams, EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in Brussels.The bloc has also offered to use its civil protection mechanism to send further reinforcements, she said.Warning system scrutinisedOfficials in the Valencia region announced survivors were being sheltered in temporary accommodation such as fire stations.Rail and air transport remained severely disrupted. The high-speed line between Valencia and Madrid will be suspended for at least four days, the Adif rail infrastructure authority announced.The flood toll is Spain\\'s deadliest since 1973 when at least 150 people were estimated to have died in the southeastern provinces of Granada, Murcia and Almeria.Scientists have warned that extreme weather events such as the storm that hit Valencia are becoming more intense, last longer and occur more frequently as a result of human-induced climate change.Such extremes \"can overwhelm the ability of existing defences and contingency plans to cope, even in a relatively wealthy country like Spain\", said Leslie Mabon, senior lecturer in environmental systems at Britain\\'s Open University.The heavy death toll came after warnings for extreme rainfall, suggesting Valencia\\'s flood alert system failed, said Hannah Cloke, hydrology professor at the University of Reading.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff

The duo, identified as Umakant Mishra and his son Uday Mishra, reportedly used a plastic track to manipulate ATM machines and withdraw cash fraudulently. Police recovered Rs 3,500 cash from them, along with the plastic device used in their scheme. Their modus operandi, reliance on cash transactions, and unexpected wealth left locals stunned.\\nThe incident unfolded when Riyaz, a resident of Mahmoodabad, attempted to withdraw Rs 5,000 from an ATM near the Fauji Restaurant on the Mahmoodabad-Lucknow Road. Though the transaction appeared successful on the ATM screen, and Rs 5,000 was deducted from his account, the machine failed to dispense any cash. Frustrated, Riyaz exited the ATM booth, intending to contact the helpline.\\nAt this point, Umakant and Uday Mishra, who had been loitering outside the ATM, seized the opportunity. They entered the booth and used a plastic track to access the stuck cash. Suspicious of their actions, Riyaz confronted them, leading to an argument. His cries for help attracted the attention of bystanders, who quickly alerted the police. Upon arriving at the scene, Kotwali police detained the father-son duo.\\nCO Dinesh Shukla, who is handling the investigation, explained the method behind their fraud. “They would insert a plastic track at the ATM’s cash dispenser. When a user faced a technical issue, they would assume the cash was stuck and leave. Then, the accused would remove the track and take the cash,” he said. He also noted that both men had multiple cases against them and had recently been released from jail.\\nUpon questioning, the accused admitted to using this tactic to withdraw Rs 3,500 on this occasion and Rs 1,800 during an earlier attempt. Despite their arrest, neither Umakant nor Uday appeared concerned, hinting at their familiarity with the criminal justice system.\\nInterestingly, the father and son adhered strictly to cash transactions. They carried Rs 500 notes, paid only in cash, and flaunted a lifestyle far beyond what one might expect.

This amendment was part of a broader set of 273 recommendations made to Congress by the Hoover Commission, established by President Harry S. Truman to overhaul and improve the federal government. The formal proposal was presented to Congress on March 24, 1947, and the amendment received ratification on February 27, 1951.This amendment was initiated following President Franklin D. Roosevelt\\'s unprecedented election to four terms, during which he served for 12 years until his death in 1945. In response, Congress proposed the 22nd Amendment to formalise presidential term limits.What The 22nd Amendment saysSection 1 of the 22nd Amendment: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.”Section 2 of the 22nd Amendment: “This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.”What are The 22nd Amendment\\'s main takeawaysA US president can only serve for a maximum of 10 years.No one is eligible to serve as president more than twice.A person is only eligible to be elected president once if they have held the office for more than two years (for instance, a vice president who becomes president).Nevertheless, the discussion surrounding term limits continued. According to a report in the New York Times, in 1987, then-President Ronald Reagan expressed a desire to initiate a movement aimed at repealing the constitutional amendment that restricts presidents to two terms. If successful, this could have enabled Reagan — then in his late 70s and a few years away from an official Alzheimer\\'s diagnosis — to seek re-election.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\")', 'summary': \"The 22nd Amendment was initiated following President Franklin D.

But a small number of crucial swing states are key to deciding the next US President.Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump are zeroing in on these battlegrounds, where the outcomes remain uncertain.What Are Swing States?Swing states, often referred to as battlegrounds, are instrumental in presidential elections. They are characterised by a nearly equal level of support for both major political parties, in this case, Democrats and Republicans, making them key to a candidate\\'s electoral strategy.In 2024, the seven swing states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. These regions have shown fluctuating voter preferences in recent elections.ArizonaIn Arizona, where US President Joe Biden won narrowly by just 10,000 votes in 2020, immigration remains a hot-button issue. With a lengthy border with Mexico, the state\\'s voters are concerned about immigration policies, a topic Trump has vehemently criticised Harris for. Abortion rights have also been a bone contention, as Republicans attempted to reinstate a nearly total ban on abortions.GeorgiaGeorgia, another state where Biden registered a victory by a slander margin of 13,000 votes, is not just a swing state but also a legal battlefield for Donald Trump, who faces allegations of election interference. The state is home to a diverse demographic, with a significant African-American population crucial to Democratic strategies. Harris\\'s campaign aims to engage this demographic amid reports of growing disillusionment with the Biden administration.MichiganIn Michigan, where Biden won by 1,50,000 votes, the landscape is complicated by significant discontent among key voter groups. President Biden has faced criticism for his foreign policy, particularly on US military aid to Israel, which has bombarded Gaza for over a year. Michigan has the largest proportion of Arab-American residents in the US, and their support for Biden has become increasingly tenuous. Harris has shifted her tone vis-a-vis Israel, aiming to reassure voters who feel sidelined by the administration\\'s policies while Trump keeps firm his stance on rapid military action.NevadaNevada, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, shows signs of a tightening race, with recent polls suggesting a shift in favour of Republicans. Both campaigns are actively courting Nevada\\'s substantial Latino population, crucial to any candidate\\'s success in the state. The economic recovery post-COVID has been sluggish in Nevada compared to the rest of the country, making it a big concern. The high unemployment rate and cost-of-living pressures are also key issues for voters in this state.North CarolinaIn North Carolina, Donald Trump\\'s narrow victory margin in 2020 (by 74,000 votes) has made this state a toss-up for 2024. With demographics and issues mirroring those of neighbouring Georgia and Arizona, both candidates are pouring resources into North Carolina. Trump recently held a rally here, promising to end inflation, stop the influx of criminals into the country and restore the American dream.PennsylvaniaPennsylvania holds 19 electoral votes and is a critical target for both candidates. Biden\\'s roots in Scranton give him a personal connection to voters in this working-class state. The economic landscape has shifted dramatically since Biden took office, with inflation affecting household budgets. Recent statistics show that grocery prices in Pennsylvania have risen faster than in any other state, leading to significant cost-of-living pressures among residents. Both campaigns are acutely aware that economic issues could sway undecided voters, particularly in counties like Erie, where food insecurity is a growing concern.WisconsinFinally, Wisconsin has historically been a bellwether state, having backed the winning candidate in the last two elections. After a victory with just over 21,000 votes for Biden in 2020, the state is crucial for both the candidates. There is a growing concern about third-party candidates potentially syphoning votes away from the main candidates. Independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr suspended his campaign in late August and endorsed Trump, which could alter the dynamics in this tightly contested state. Democrats are also facing challenges with Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose inclusion on the ballot has been contested. Trump has stressed Wisconsin\\'s significance, declaring that winning the state could clinch the election.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\")', 'summary': 'This year, seven states are in the spotlight  Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.', 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/the-seven-swing-states-that-could-shape-the-2024-presidential-race-6913487', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/oh3m2dlg_donald-trump-kamala-harris_625x300_31_October_24.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-31 06:30:04', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.263}, {'id': 261765660, 'title': 'Tech stocks drag markets lower; Cipla, L&T buck trend', 'text': 'Indian equity benchmarks extended their morning losses in afternoon trading on Thursday, with technology stocks leading the decline amid continued foreign investor selling and mixed global cues. \\r\\n\\nThe BSE Sensex fell 471.85 points or 0.59 per cent to 79,470.33, while the NSE Nifty declined 113.25 points or 0.47 per cent to 24,227.60 as of 12:32 pm.

Metallic powders such as aluminium often serve as the fuel, and ammonium perchlorate, which is the salt of perchloric acid and ammonia, is the most common oxidiser.\\n\\nThe fuel and oxidiser are bound together by a hard rubbery material and packed into a metal casing.\\n\\nWhen solid propellant burns, oxygen from the ammonium perchlorate combines with aluminium to generate enormous amounts of energy and temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius), creating thrust and lifting the missile from the launch pad.\\n\\nWHO HAS THAT TECHNOLOGY?\\n\\nSolid fuel dates back to fireworks developed by the Chinese centuries ago, but made dramatic progress in the mid-20th century, when the U.S. developed more powerful propellants.\\n\\nNorth Korea uses solid fuel in a range of small, shorter-range ballistic missiles, as well as in its new Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile.\\n\\nThe Soviet Union fielded its first solid-fuel ICBM, the RT-2, in the early 1970s, followed by France\\'s development of its S3, also known as SSBS, a medium-range ballistic missile.\\n\\nChina started testing solid-fuel ICBMs in the late 1990s.\\n\\nSouth Korea has also said it has secured \"efficient and advanced\" solid-propellant ballistic missile technology, though in much smaller rockets so far.\\n\\nSOLID VS LIQUID\\n\\nLiquid propellants provide greater propulsive thrust and power, but require more complex technology and extra weight.\\n\\nSolid fuel is dense and burns quite quickly, generating thrust over a short time. Solid fuel can remain in storage for an extended period without degrading or breaking down - a common issue with liquid fuel.\\n\\nNorth Korea said the development of its solid-fuel Hwasong-18 would \"radically promote\" its nuclear counterattack capability.\\n\\nAfter the first launch last year, South Korea\\'s defence ministry sought to downplay the testing, saying the North would need \"extra time and effort\" to master the technology.', 'summary': 'Solid-fuel missiles, easier to store and faster to launch than liquid-fuel counterparts, represent a strategic leap for Pyongyang’s defence capabilities\\xa0', 'url': 'https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/what-are-solid-fuel-missiles-and-why-is-north-korea-developing-them/article68817290.ece', 'image': 'https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/omoxzg/article68817301.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-10-31T062143Z_123644003_RC2605A7S26V_RTRMADP_3_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES-SOLID-FUEL.JPG', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-31 07:23:10', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.188}, {'id': 261768208, 'title': 'Gold Stocks On Diwali 2024: 24-Carat Gold Price Hits ₹8,134/gm; Titan, Kalyan, Senco Shares Decline', 'text': 'The precious yellow metal, 24-carat gold price surged Rs 8,134.3 per gram, an rise of Rs 710 from previous rates, while 22-carat gold also saw a price jump, climbing to Rs 7,458.3 per gram, up by Rs 650.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/gold-stocks-on-diwali-2024-24-carat-gold-price-hits-8134gm-titan-kalyan-senco-shares-decline', 'image': 'https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-10-31/qtgx1jj5/Screenshot-2024-10-31-132504.png', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-31 08:18:00', 'author': 'Oliviya Kunjumon', 'authors': ['Oliviya Kunjumon'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 1.0}, {'id': 261768542, 'title': 'Indian, Chinese troops exchange sweets at several border points on Diwali', 'text': '“Troops of India and China exchanged sweets at several border points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the occasion of Diwali on Thursday (October 31, 2024),” Army sources said.\\n\\nThe traditional practice was observed a day after both countries completed the disengagement at two friction points at Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh, bringing a fresh thaw in the Sino-Indian ties.\\n\\n“The exchange of sweets between members of the troops of India and China took place at several border points along the LAC on the occasion of Diwali,” an Army source told PTI.\\n\\n“The exchange took place at five Border Personnel Meeting (BPM) points along the LAC,” the sources added.\\n\\nOn Wednesday (October 30, 2024), an Army source said that troops of both sides had completed the disengagement at the two friction points and patrolling would commence soon at these points.\\n\\n“The verification process after the disengagement was in progress and patrolling modalities were to be decided between ground commanders,” the source said then.\\n\\n\"Talks will continue at the local commander level,\" the Army source added.\\n\\nForeign Secretary Vikram Misri said on October 21 in Delhi that an agreement was finalised between India and China following negotiations over the past several weeks and that it would lead to a resolution of the issues that arose in 2020.\\n\\nThe agreement was firmed up on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff.', 'summary': 'Troops of India and China exchange sweets at border points, signaling thaw in Sino-Indian ties post-disengagement', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-chinese-troops-exchange-sweets-at-several-border-points-on-diwali/article68817333.ece', 'image': 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/9vvar4/article68817351.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_INDIA-CHINA-CONFLICT_2_1_5QB5AODS.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-31 08:04:49', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.013}, {'id': 261768540, 'title': 'Suresh Gopi admits that he used ambulance to reach Thrissur Pooram venue\\xa0', 'text': 'Union Minister Suresh Gopi has admitted using an ambulance to reach the Thrissur Pooram venue due to health issues. “I had difficulty walking through the crowd because of my leg pain.

We need to keep telling people the importance of defence and we are working hard on it and we will see results in future.\" Asked about the Wankhede Stadium pitch around which there has been a lot of speculation, he said, \"It is just a good wicket. Very difficult for anyone to judge before both teams have batted on it.\" On his journey at the helm of affairs so far, Gambhir said, \"I never expected a very easy run for me. I know that we lost in Sri Lanka and against NZ and it is not a good place to be. All we can do is keep working hard and we will try winning every game that we play to represent the country.\" He stressed on the need for some empathy while dealing with players under pressure.\"I realise its a complete different thing when you were playing and now as a coach, need to put your arm around the players.\"', 'summary': \"India head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn't want to blame the batters only for the debacle against the visiting New Zealand side, saying that every player has the responsibility towards the team.\", 'url': 'https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/not-going-to-sugarcoat-gautam-gambhirs-hurting-message-ahead-of-3rd-test-vs-new-zealand-6913587', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/955shpj_gautam-gambhir-bcci_625x300_30_October_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-31 07:44:23', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.333}, {'id': 261768696, 'title': \"Samsung's One UI 7 Update Will Reportedly Arrive With These New Features\", 'text': 'One UI 7 — Samsung\\'s upcoming Android 15-based software update for eligible smartphone and tablet models — was briefly teased by the company at its annual developer conference, and details of the sent major version of One UI have now surfaced online.

I am confident that the good work we have done for the common people, for the general category, and the development that has taken place there–where I have nurtured it with great dedication over the years–will resonate with the people. I believe that people have great hopes, and the next generation, including my daughter, is well-trained, sensible, and educated. In the future, this region will join the vision of a developed India.”Chavan also addressed the expectations and responsibilities that come with his political legacy, acknowledging the work it requires to maintain it.He credited his family’s long-standing connection to the people and his efforts to nurture the constituency over the years. “In terms of legacy, maintaining and furthering it requires even more hard work,” he said, adding that his bond with his constituents will continue through his daughter’s involvement.Discussing the BJP’s performance, Chavan said that elections depend on multiple factors beyond any one individual. ” An election doesn’t depend on just one individual. Many factors play a role, especially in a national election. Perhaps certain areas fell short, but now with the elections coming again, we hope this time BJP will succeed. Our workers are still there; we take ownership. We never claimed that Nanded is our property; it’s a developing district and doesn’t depend solely on one individual.” he added.He then recalled a past time when his relationship with Ashok Gehlot was strained, and he had considered joining the BJP. Eventually, he decided to remain, and he now views his switch to a new party as a fresh start. “Everyone goes through these ups and downs,” he said. “I realized it was better to make a fresh start at a new party.”On Maratha reservation issues, Chavan acknowledged lingering resentment, but he highlighted the progress made. “Many improvements have happened that perhaps people are unaware of, like the 10 percent reservation that has created job opportunities and allowed people to receive certificates they previously couldn’t. Numerous positive things have been achieved, which need to be communicated to people. With that explanation, the dissatisfaction has somewhat been addressed. The remaining issues can be resolved through further dialogue.”When asked if Bhokar would finally support the BJP, Chavan expressed hope that the people’s respect for him and support for his new party would yield positive results.” Hope things will go well this time”, he added', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/atmosphere-is-good-bjps-ashok-chavan-ahead-of-daughters-election-bid/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/atmosphere-is-good-bjps-ashok-chavan-ahead-of-daughters-election-bid.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-31 08:03:34', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.27}, {'id': 261768864, 'title': \"'Will strive to move beyond disengagement': Rajnath on India-China LAC pact\", 'text': 'NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that disengagement efforts along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh are nearing completion but efforts are being made to move ‘beyond just disengagement’ and build a stable foundation for long-term peace with China.

India head coach Gautam Gambhir wasn\\'t willing to go that far, but he did highlight a decline in defensive skills as a result of widespread T20 cricket.\"Sometimes you\\'ve got to give it to the opposition as well,\" he said on Thursday, a day before the third Test in Mumbai. \"I think Mitchell Santner was outstanding in the last game, but yes, we\\'ll keep working hard. We\\'ll keep getting better. That\\'s about it. Guys are putting a lot of hard yards in the nets. Yes, ultimately it\\'s the results that matter when you\\'re playing international cricket, but I don\\'t think so that our skill against spin has actually gone down.\"India have suffered collapses in every innings of this series. Forty-six all out happened in highly unusual conditions in Bengaluru, but from there, they have lost 7 for 54, 6 for 73 and 5 for 40, which has forced them to work on how to bat time in tough conditions.\"Test cricket is about playing sessions,\" Gambhir said. \"I think if we can start to learn how to play sessions, and the kind of quality we have in our batting line-up, I think if we end up playing four to four-and-a-half sessions, we\\'ll have a lot of runs on the board.\"The inability to meet this fundamental demand has highlighted the challenge that modern-day batters face in the era of T20 cricket. \"We need to defend better,\" Gambhir said. \"I think that is something which is important. And especially on a turning track. Because if you\\'ve got confidence on your defence, a lot of things can be sorted. And that is something which we need to keep getting better, keep working on.\"Because, again, I\\'ll keep going back to the same answer that a lot has to do with limited over-cricket and T20 cricket as well that when you\\'re so used to muscling the ball, that you end up forgetting the soft hands and all that stuff, which probably used to happen eight or 10 years back. So that is something, that is why I said that a complete cricketer is a cricketer who plays T20 format really successfully and also the Test cricket really successfully. He can adapt his game. And that is what growth is.\"Growth is not only going about hitting the ball in the stands. It\\'s also about batting sessions on a turning track, where you know that you will not be able to hit in the stands, but you will be able to rotate better. For that, I think the foundation is very, very important.\"\"If we can bat sessions, we know that we\\'ve got the bowling attack to take 20 wickets\"Gautam GambhirThe Mumbai Test is likely to be played in conditions that should help the spinners as well. At the end of India\\'s practice session on Thursday morning, the captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli took a good, long look at the pitch with assistant coach Abhishek Nayar. Kohli then left, but Gambhir and bowling coach Morne Morkel joined Rohit and Nayar and the four of them were involved in a discussion that lasted about 20 minutes. A little while later, the groundstaff began to brush away whatever grass that had managed to cling to the surface. Batters may have to unlearn the skills that help them succeed in T20s to do well here. But is that possible? Can a coach help them make that switch?\"To a certain extent, yes,\" Gambhir said, \"To a certain extent, it has to come from the individual as well. That how much value does he end up giving it in defending the ball? That is something which is very important. And especially on a turning track. Because I\\'ve always believed that the best players and the most successful players in this format, or be it any format, always had solid defense. So that is something which we keep talking about. And it is not the overnight thing that we\\'re going to talk about it today and people will start getting better tomorrow. But it\\'s a continuous process. We need to keep working on it. We need to keep telling people the importance of defense.\"Could India end up facing a situation where they have to look at a separate set of players more suited to Test cricket? Gambhir couldn\\'t commit to a hypothetical question but he did admit that \"going forward, obviously, we will have to identify players who are solid red-ball cricketers. Because ultimately, to get the results, you will have to work really hard for three or four days or five days to be honest. So sometimes, as I just mentioned, it\\'s important. If we can bat sessions, we know that we\\'ve got the bowling attack to take 20 wickets.

There has been concerns regarding the workload of Indian pacers in the last few years as many of them have broken down even during a series.Bumrah has a history with injuries and thus there was hope that the team management would like to keep him fresh ahead of the Australia series. But Nayar said the team management is aware of his workload but feels that the seasoned pacer from Gujarat has not bowled too many overs in two Tests, which incidently ended prematurely, thus giving him some extra rest days.\"I think in the two Test matches he\\'s (Bumrah) bowled around 20, 25 overs. So he\\'s not bowled a lot. Yes, there\\'ll always be a thought process about his workload. Also, we played two games where we not at 5k cricket, it\\'s been more three, three-and-a-half days, so he could have rest. But Booms is very important to us and the workload will always be something on our mind,\" Nayar said in a pre-match press conference at the wankhede Stadium here on Wednesday.Another reason for the team management opting against resting Bumrah is that the Wankhede pitch is expected to help seamers in the first hour or so every day.\"I always believe that Wankhede will always give pace a chance no matter what, especially when Mumbai winter doesn\\'t feel like it. But in the morning there will be a bit of moisture, there will be a bit of dew around. So you will expect the first sessions to have a bit of swing. I\\'m not sure of the pitche yet because it\\'s covered, but if the pitch is hard, then there will be a bit of swing as well. But at Wankhede, you will always see fast bowlers with a bit of a smile on their face in the morning,\" said Nayar.He said the Indian team needs do some self-reflection after losing a home series in more than a decade.\"Firstly, I will start with giving a lot of credit to New Zealand for the way they played and countered spin in the two Test matches. I feel that though the conditions will be different with a red-soil pitch. The last time we played on a red soil, which was in Chennai, a lot of the guys have been a lot of local cricketers and they understand what these conditions are and how the pitch is going to pan out.
