                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Trump’s first presidency (2017-2021) had shaken up the India-US economic relationship in four major areas.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> First, the US had terminated India’s preferential trade access as a developing country, making hundreds of Indian exports subject to higher non-concessional tariffs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Second, the US had come close to designating India as a currency manipulator.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Third, Visa rules were significantly changed and quotas reduced, resulting in a reduced number of immigrant visas to Indians, although the condition of higher salaries attached to jobs benefitted Indians, specifically in getting high-value visas.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Fourth, the US walked out of the Paris Agreement and terminated its official aid for climate finance vehicles like the Green Growth Fund (GGF), targeting India prominently for being the largest free-loader beneficiary of the GGF.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> How is the United States under Trump 2.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>0 likely to deal with these and new economic issues that have developed in the last four years under the Biden administration?Trump's Foreign Policy is Highly Personalised.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> So What About Israel and Ukraine?I wrote a piece after Trump called India the biggest charger of tariffs during his presidential campaign.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Was it all rhetoric? A lot has changed in the US since the beginning of his first term in 2017.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Before the beginning of his first term, Trump had been massively upset by the closure of coal mines and shift of the production of big industrial goods like steel and automobiles out of America.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> During his first-term campaign, he had vehemently pitched for bringing manufacturing back again to the US to "Make America Great Again".</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He had to act to deliver his campaign promises which had struck a high emotional chord with the American "boomers".</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Unfortunately for him, his policies could not achieve any real gains in making the US a manufacturing powerhouse.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Ground realities have changed a lot since he lost the election in 2020, at least in the case of coal and renewables.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Battery-supported stable thermal electricity generation was cheaper than solar power generation during his first term.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It is no longer the case.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Advancement in solar, wind, and hydrogen power production in last few years have made thermal power generation an increasingly non-competitive proposition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Efforts to shift steel production back to US using high tariffs under the guise of security did not succeed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The coal industry stands virtually dismantled in the US.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It is unlikely that the US businesses will be incentivised enough by tariff hikes to invest in coal or steel businesses.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There was a perceptible shift in Latino and Black voters in favour of Trump, which made all the difference in his re-election.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> His ‘dovish’ remark to let immigrants come in legally in his first post re-election address underlines the likelihood of a hugely less strident policy for making American manufacturing great again for blue collar workers who had lost jobs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There are other factors as well.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Trump may hate China but he has a soft corner for Putin, and the China-Russia economic relationship has broadened and deepened massively in the last four years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In view of all this, it seems quite certain that, while there might still be a lot of sound and fury, there may not be any drastic actions on tariff front.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> India has been verbally abused by Trump on account of ungainly high tariffs on some trophy products like automobiles.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Most US exports to India actually do not suffer heavy tariff incidence.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Again, there may be some symbolic noise against India’s tariff regime but any tough action seems unlikely.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> India and the US have been talking about a trade agreement for many years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There are massive differences in their positions and there has not been any progress.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Though there might be efforts to revive the stalled negotiations, it is unlikely that there will be any headway given the irreconcilable differences in their respective positions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Trump 2.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>0: China Will Be Concerned About the Two TsThe US authorities found India meeting two (trade surplus with US exceeding $20 billion and India’s central bank buying foreign currency in excess of two percent of GDP) out of three specified criteria (third being current account surplus exceeding two percent of GDP) in 2017-18, and so the Trump administration put India on the monitoring list.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Countries like China, which met all the three criteria during Trump 1.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Placing India on the monitoring list generated quite some concern in India.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, very soon, the RBI stopped buying foreign exchange more than two percent of GDP.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In 2018-19, the RBI actually overall sold more foreign currencies than it bought.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> India was duly taken out of the monitoring list.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The big fuss over currency designations of China and India in Trump’s first term was partly motivated by the intention to force the depreciation of the US dollar to improve US export competitiveness.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The Biden administration, on the other hand, did not use the currency designation tool during its term.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> With the principal objective of shifting manufacturing back to America losing its stridency, the Trump 2.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Curiously, US dollar strengthened after Trump's victory.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Both the Chinese yuan and the rupee depreciated.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This might as well be indicative of the direction of the currency winds during Trump 2.</p>
