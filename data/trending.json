        "text": "New Delhi: The air quality deteriorated in the national capital on Sunday, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) being recorded at 352, in the 'very poor' category, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). This is worse than the average AQI recorded at 255 on Saturday, categorized as 'poor'.Moreover, AQI in Anand Vihar area crossed the 400 mark, being recorded as 405 at 7 AM, categorized as 'severe', worse than the AQI of 367 recorded on Saturday.AQI at the Akshardham Temple deteriorated 261, whereas IGI airport recorded an AQI of 324, both categorized as 'very poor.'A layer of thick smog enveloped certain parts of the city.Himanshu, a visitor to the national capital said that the increasing pollution feels 'suffocating.'\"It feels suffocating due to pollution...The govt should look into what can be done to reduce pollution,\" he told ANI.Moreover, a cyclist in the city told ANI that they are facing a lot of problems with breathing.\"We are from Delhi and we (the cyclist group) cycle daily here, but this situation of air pollution since the last few days we are facing a lot of problems. We can't breathe properly, we get tired faster due to the pollution. We take precautions like wearing a bandana but nothing is working because the pollution is increasing a lot,\" he said.He further said that the measures taken by the government don't seem effective enough, and the government should encourage the people to use public transport more.\"The government did some work like stopping construction and implementing odd-even but it doesn't seem like it is working as this is increasing day by day. There should be constructive measures to encourage people to use public transport and carpooling,\" he added.As the festival of lights nears, the Delhi government has also banned firecrackers till January 1 amid efforts to curb pollution levels.Moreover, toxic foam on the Yamuna river in the Kalindi Kunj area persisted. Earlier the pollution in the river became a topic of hot political debate between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with BJP leader Shazia Ilmi criticizing the Delhi government for its handling of the city's worsening pollution crisis, highlighting the alarming presence of toxic foam in the River Yamuna and the resulting breathing difficulties for residents.\"BJP leader Virendraa Sachdeva has fallen ill. Two days ago he took a dip in the Yamuna river. Today he is admitted to the hospital...This is an issue connected to the health of the public of Delhi. Where have the Rs 3000 crore meant for the public of Delhi and Yamuna river?... The public of Delhi is not able to breathe...Toxic foam is floating on the Yamuna River,\" Ilmi told ANI.Notably, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai criticsed the BJP, accusing it of contributing to the increasing pollution in the national capital.\"The BJP is the party that creates pollution and seems to believe that only drama can solve it. I think all governments and parties need to work together. I wish them good health, but stopping these theatrics alone won't reduce pollution. This reflects the BJP leaders' level of understanding. When I was preparing the winter action plan, I had written to the BJP President, but no response or suggestions have come so far,\" he told ANI.",

People asked me to address this in Mann Ki Baat, as everyone needs to understand. The first step involves collecting your personal information. Step two is creating an atmosphere of fear, instilling so much anxiety that you can\u2019t think clearly. Step three is applying time pressure\u2026 Victims of digital arrest come from all backgrounds and ages. Many have lost substantial sums of their hard-earned money. If you ever receive such a call, don\u2019t be afraid. Be aware that no investigative agency conducts such interrogations over the phone or video call. The three steps to digital security are: stop, think, and act. If possible, take a screenshot or record the call. No government agency issues threats over the phone or demands money,\u201d PM Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat address.He further stated that investigative agencies are working in partnership with state governments to combat the scam being carried out in the name of digital arrest.\u201cThere is no legal system called digital arrest; it\u2019s purely fraud, deceit, a criminal enterprise by those who are enemies of society. Various investigative agencies, in collaboration with state governments, are actively working to address this scam. The National Cyber Coordination Centre has been established to foster coordination among these agencies,\u201d he said.PM Modi also encouraged schools and colleges to engage students in the campaign against cyber scams. \u201cWe can only fight this challenge through collective efforts in society,\u201d he added",

He further stressed that the country must not repeat the mistakes of the past and India should take a stance against terrorism.The remarks by Jaishankar came while addressing a press conference in Mumbai.Addressing the reporters, Jaishankar said, \u201cMumbai is a symbol of counter-terrorism for India and the world. When we were a member of the UNSC, we were president of the counter-terrorism committee. We held the security council meeting for the first time in the hotel where a terrorist attack took place, in Mumbai.

That is not good for us\u2026\u201dHe added, \u201cWhen we talk of zero tolerance against terror, it is clear that when somebody does something, there will be a response. We also have to expose. It is not acceptable that you are doing business during the daytime and indulging in terror during the night and I have to pretend that everything is okay. This India will not accept it. This is what has changed. We are very clear, we need to expose terrorism.\u201d Jaishankar has been vocal about India\u2019s stance on terrorism, emphasising the need for zero tolerance. At the 16th BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, he reaffirmed India\u2019s commitment to combating terrorism.He had said, \u201cAddressing conflicts and tensions effectively is a particular need of the day. Prime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception. And there should be zero tolerance for terrorism.\u201dNotably, at least 174 people, including 20 security force personnel and 26 foreigners, were killed and more than 300 injured in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.Ten Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists came to Mumbai via the sea route from Pakistan and carried out a series of coordinated attacks on India\u2019s financial capital.",

        "title": "Delhi HC issues notice to Centre on plea seeking norms to regulate re-sale of concert tickets, banning of illegal sites",
        "text": "The Delhi High Court on Thursday issued a notice to the Centre and three private entities regarding a plea that seeks the establishment of norms to regulate the resale of concert tickets and to block illegal ticket-selling websites. The division bench, led by Chief Justice Manmohan, while seeking the response of all respondents, including Union ministries of information and broadcasting and electronics and information technology, tagged the matter with ongoing PIL and recently moved against ticket scalping, which is listed for hearing on February 18, 2025.The plea, prompted by recent concerts featuring Coldplay, Diljit Dosanjh, etc.The petition stated that the resellers have also acted in violation of the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, as the resellers do not carry out any verification of the tickets being sold on their platform, nor they require any undertaking from the sellers, as is also evident from their terms and conditions. Thus, an individual with no ticket can also advertise via Resellers and secure unjust and unlawful benefits. Moreover, the resellers have no effective grievance redressal mechanism in place which may protect the interests of the purchasers if the seller fails to abide by its contractual obligations. Moreover, in the absence of a ticket or non-delivery of a legal ticket, it is the resellers who are to gain, as they further charge 25 euros per issue from the seller as \u2018administrative fees\u2019 for resolution of any issue raised by the purchaser. Such fees are independent of any successful resolution, and no compensation is provided to the buyer.It is further stated that Section 112 of BNS was also introduced with a similar aim to curb the practice of black-marketing and unauthorised dealing of tickets. The legislature intended to safeguard the public interest by outlawing any transactions for the sale of tickets that were without the express authority of the authorised ticketing platform or organiser. Prior to BNS, the state legislatures had prohibited such black-marketing activities via state legislation, as it deprived the state of a substantial amount of tax revenue and also resulted in the innocent public being cheated by the criminal elements. Thus, Section 112 of Bharatiya Nagarik Sanhita, 2023 [\u2018BNS\u2019] aimed to protect the public by curbing the said acts of black-marketing with a severe punishment of imprisonment extending up to 7 years and imposition of fine. On October 9, the Delhi High Court sought the response of all respondents authorities against the practice of \u201cticket scalping,\u201d which involves reselling event tickets at inflated prices.The plea filed in the Delhi High Court challenges the illegal practice of ticket scalping, where event tickets are resold at inflated prices for profit, harming the general public.The petition also claims that scalping contributes to a black market for counterfeit tickets, further victimising consumers. Additionally, it argued that these transactions, often unregulated, evade the official tax system, resulting in lost government revenue. This situation fosters a shadow economy that deprives the state of funds that could support public services and infrastructure.The petitioner called for a comprehensive legal framework, effective enforcement, and technological solutions to mitigate the negative impacts of ticket scalping. The goal is to promote fair ticketing practices, ensure consumer protection, and integrate revenue from ticket sales into the formal economy",
