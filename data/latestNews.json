        "text": "Ahead of the highly-anticipated five-match Test series against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, starting on November 22 at Perth, former South Africa cricketer Paul Adams, expressed his belief that pacer Mohammed Shami\u2019s absence will be a significant blow to India\u2019s chances on the fast and bouncy Australian pitches.\nAdams, who acknowledged Shami\u2019s ability to make an impact in all conditions, emphasised, \u201cI think he (Mohammad Shami) will be a major miss for India against Australia eyeing the conditions. The pace and bouncy wickets in Australia would have helped India in gaining an upper hand if Shami had been in the squad but that\u2019s not in the selector\u2019s hand as he is recovering, but I think he will be missed,\u201d Adams told IANS in a virtual interaction arranged by SA20.\nShami\u2019s contributions to India\u2019s first-ever Test series win in Australia during the 2018/19 tour are well-documented. Over the course of four matches, he picked up 16 wickets at an average of 26.18, showcasing his skill in extracting bounce and seam movement.\nThough injuries have disrupted his career at key moments, Shami has remained one of India\u2019s most formidable pace bowlers. His absence on the 2020/21 tour due to a fractured right forearm was felt, though India famously triumphed 2-1.\nALSO READ | Mohammed Shami Is Back! Star Pacer Set To Play For Bengal In Ranji Trophy\nAdams pointed out that Shami\u2019s absence places additional pressure on Jasprit Bumrah, the Indian vice-captain, and the rest of the pace unit. \u201cWe all saw what he did in the ODI World Cup 2023, he single-handedly carried the Indian pace attack and he is someone who has the ability to extract from any pitches around the world despite the conditions. The seam position and the length are just extraordinary. The pressure will be on vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah and other pacers but I believe it will be all-rounders who will play a huge role for India, especially Ravindra Jadeja,\u201d he added.\nShami, who has taken 229 wickets in 64 Tests, last played for India in the ODI World Cup final in November 2023 in Ahmedabad. He emerged as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament, with 24 wickets at an impressive average of 10.70, despite not featuring in India\u2019s initial matches. His ability to generate reverse swing and extract movement from any pitch stood out, further cementing his reputation as one of the world\u2019s premier fast bowlers.\nShami has been sidelined for over a year due to an Achilles tendon injury, which required surgery in February 2024 in London. Since then, he has been undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, focusing on a gradual return to bowling. Shami recently confirmed during a promotional event that he is now 100% pain-free and expressed a strong desire to play a few domestic matches before making a full-fledged comeback.\nShami is set to make his competitive return for Bengal against Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group C match in Indore. This opportunity will allow him to gain match fitness and test his form against quality domestic opposition. However, despite his recovery, the BCCI did not name Shami in the five-Test squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, opting for a cautious approach.",

        "text": "Tamil actor Suriya is all set to return to the big screen after a hiatus of almost two years. The actor is gearing up for the release of Kanguva which is one of the most-anticipated releases of 2024. Ahead of the release of the film, the actor shared major details about his future collaboration with Vikram and what holds in the future for the Kanguva franchise.\nSpeaking exclusively to News18 at a press conference for Kanguva, Suriya talked about the possible crossover and collaboration between him and Vikram. He talked about whether there could be a collaboration between him and Vikram\u2019s Thangalaan. The actor said, \u201cThese are two different times and eras. I don\u2019t think they look at the same timeline. We go a little pre-civilization than you have seen the British in Thangalaan. This is (Kanguva), kind of, almost a thousand years back pre-civilization. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a completely different idea and different thought.\u201d\nIn the same conversation, the actor also talked about Kanguva 2. The makers had previously announced that the movie would consist of two parts. Suriya shed more light on the sequel and said, \u201cWe also have Kanguva 2 in line. We leave you with a lot of questions in the climax of Kanguva 1. It will have a lot of questions and a lot of surprises. So Kanguva 2 is what I am looking forward to.\u201d\nDirected by Siva, Kanguva will star Suriya in a dual role. Along with Suriya, the movie will also star Bobby Deol and Disha Patani in key roles. This film will mark their Tamil debut. Reports mention that the movie revolves around a warrior who died in the 1600s due to an illness. The movie has been produced by K. E. Gnanavel Raja, V. Vamsi Krishna Reddy, and Pramod Uppalapati.\nThe epic fantasy action film is all set to release in cinemas on November 14.",

        "text": "Maharashtra deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s `ek hai to safe hai\u2019 slogan, but opposed Yogi Adityanath\u2019s refrain `batenge to katenge\u2019, terming it alien to Maharashtra\u2019s ideological heritage.\nSpeaking to PTI amid the campaign for the November 20 state assembly elections, he also claimed that his nephew and now rival candidate Yugendra Pawar is not interested in politics, and does not even like to stay in Baramati.\nSupporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cek hai to safe hai\u2019, he said India will be safe if it remained united.\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with that (slogan), I don\u2019t see any issue here. If we stay together, everyone will prosper,\u201d he added.\nHowever, he expressed disapproval about the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister\u2019s refrain that \u201cdivided we will get cut down\u201d.\n\u201cThe remark `batenge to katenge\u2019 is inappropriate. People\u2019s thinking in UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh is different, but such statements don\u2019t work here. Using such words holds no significance in Maharashtra, in my opinion. Maharashtra is the state of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Shivaji Maharaj. People of Maharashtra are different, and they think differently. If anyone leaves the ideology of Shahu, Shivaji, Phule and Ambedkar, then Maharashtra will not spare them,\u201d Ajit added.\nOn Yugendra Pawar, the son of his brother, being fielded by the Sharad Pawar-led NCP against him on the family turf of Baramati, Ajit said his mother urged the senior Pawar to avoid a contest within the family.\n\u201cI made (wife) Sunetra Pawar contest against Supriya Sule in the Lok Sabha elections. This has badly hurt (Sharad Pawar), that is why they made Yugendra Pawar contest against me,\u201d the NCP chief said.\n\u201cYugendra has no interest in politics\u2026..he does not like to come to Baramati. He likes to stay abroad,\u201d Ajit Pawar said, adding \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to him.\u201d In the Lok Sabha elections, Ajit\u2019s cousin Supriya Sule defeated his wife Sunetra in a high-octane battle in Baramati.\n\u201cMy mother told Pawar saheb there should not be a contest within the Pawar family, but they fielded a candidate. Sharad Pawar is a big leader. I don\u2019t want to speak about it. But despite messages from my mother, he took such a decision,\u201d the NCP chief added.\nHe expressed confidence that he would retain the Baramati assembly seat.\n\u201cPeople there know that several people were involved in the development of Baramati, but I have put in the most efforts, and Baramati knows that. I have worked there, and my work speaks for itself,\u201d Ajit said.\nAbout a recent report regarding the influx of illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants in Maharashtra, he said it was a \u201cvery serious observation\u201d, and all the senior leaders must sit together and take a decision on how to tackle the issue.\nAsked if the NCP led by him will return to the Opposition\u2019s Maha Vikas Aghadi if the elections delivered a fractured mandate, he ruled out the possibility.\n\u201cNo, I am not thinking of it now, because my aim is to win 175 seats for Mahayuti (ruling alliance of the NCP, BJP and Shiv Sena),\u201d he said.\nThe Maratha factor will play a vital role in the state elections, he said, conceding that many people listen to Manoj Jarange who is agitating for reservation for the Maratha community, and its effect was seen in the Lok Sabha elections.\nAbout the credit for the `Ladki Bahin Yojana\u2019 for women, which the ruling alliance is hoping will be gamechanger in the elections, Ajit Pawar said it was a government scheme and will benefit all the Mahayuti partners.\nWhen asked for his reaction to Shiv Sena minister Tanaji Sawant\u2019s remark a few weeks ago that he felt like vomiting when sitting next to Ajit Pawar at cabinet meetings, the NCP chief said it was the wrong statement, and \u201cI will speak with Chief Minister Eknath Shinde over it.\u201d\nDefending his party colleague Nawab Malik who is facing probe by the Enforcement Directorate, Ajit said none of the allegations against him have been proven in the court.",

Three people were hurt when unidentified persons opened fire on the group. The attack also caused some damage to Goswami\u2019s car.\n\nReacting to the incident, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma lashed out at Congress party alleging that the opposition party which does photo-op with the Constitution is actually resorting to violence and attacking the BJP workers.\n\nTaking to X, Sarma wrote, \u201cI strongly condemn the attack on Hon\u2019ble MLA Shri Jitu Goswami in Samaguri by @INCAssam supporters. This is the same Congress that proudly holds up the Constitution for the cameras, yet resorts to violence under cover of darkness to intimidate our karyakartas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real question is, why has Congress stooped to such low in this by-election?
