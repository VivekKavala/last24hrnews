The BJP now plans to utilise Paswan as a star campaigner for the Jharkhand elections, hoping to replicate his success in appealing to Dalit voters.\n\nPolling in Jharkhand is scheduled in two stages on November 13 and November 20, with the results to be declared on November 23.",

The candidates demanding the postponement of exams argue that GO 29 will rearrange the prelims list upside down. About 22 cases challenging the GO are pending in the High Court. They say that the GO tweaked the reservation policy and this would limit the chances of candidates from reserved categories.\n\nThe Group-I Main exams to fill 563 posts in various departments are scheduled to be held from October 21 to 27.\n\nGoing ahead with the conduct of the examination, authorities reviewed preparations. Chief Secretary Santhi Kumari held a meeting with officials of various departments and directed them to make fool-proof arrangements. A total of 31,383 candidates will appear in the exam to be conducted at 46 centres in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, and Medchal Malkajgiri districts.\n\nThe candidates qualified for the Group-1 Mains examination out of around 3.02 lakh who appeared for the preliminary examination held in June. The Group-1 prelims have been marred by controversies over paper leaks and legal battles for not following the norms and irregularities in 2022 and 2023. The Chief Secretary directed officials to make necessary security arrangements around the exam centres to prevent any irregularities or untoward incidents. TGSPSC Chairman Mahender Reddy said that since Group-I Mains are being held for the first time since 2011, the officials should take all precautions to ensure smooth conduct of the exam.",

        "text": "Chennai, Oct 24 (IANS) As Deepavali is approaching, firecracker sales are booming in Tamil Nadu while many online sites advertising firecrackers are duping the gullible public. \n\nAccording to the firecracker industry, scammers are exploiting the festive season by offering big discounts, especially on crackers. Industry sources told IANS that several complaints of fraudulent operators cheating people have surfaced. \n\nThe Tamil Nadu Cyber Police has already warned people about online cracker sale fraud, with several dubious websites offering freebies. \n\nPolice said that 17 cases have already been registered on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (www.cybercrime.gov.in). \n\nAccording to the police, scammers create websites that appear genuine. The cybercrime wing of the Tamil Nadu Police has cautioned people about these fraudulent schemes, where dubious websites offer crackers at discounted rates but abscond with the money.\n\nPolice said scammers prey on festive enthusiasm by creating fake social media advertisements on popular platforms.\n\nThese advertisements often promote significant discounts on firecrackers or other festive items, luring unsuspecting buyers. \n\nThe cyber cell also reported that scammers design attractive advertisements promoting discounted crackers. Victims contact scammers via WhatsApp, phone calls, or through fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal money. \n\nAccording to the Tamil Nadu Cyber Cell Police, these fraudulent sites often display authentic-looking product catalogues, prices, and payment options. \n\nThese sites may request payment for crackers at discounted prices, but once payment is made, victims are deceived, and the scammers disappear without delivering the crackers. \n\nThe police also warned that those who attempt to purchase crackers online may compromise their security by sharing personal financial information.\n\nR. Sakthivel, owner of a firecracker manufacturing company based in Virudhunagar, told IANS that there are several fly-by-night operators who dupe the public. \n\n\u201cDeepavali firecrackers are available in all small areas of Tamil Nadu in licensed shops. It is up to the public to decide whether they want genuine firecrackers from these licensed shops or risk being duped by fraudulent operators,\u201d he said. \n\nHe also added that the police and government should conduct proper awareness campaigns to inform the public about these scammers who take advantage of gullible people and steal their money during one of the biggest festivals. \n\nVirudhunagar district in Tamil Nadu has an annual turnover of Rs 6,000 crore, with crackers being supplied across the country.",

Nataraj, representing the UP government, said that demolition was carried out to remove encroachments on footpaths and the plea was filed by a third-party organisation on the basis of newspaper reports.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in an interim order passed on September 17, directed that no demolition will take place anywhere across the country except without its permission after several petitions were filed before the apex court alleging that bulldozer action was taken by various state authorities without sufficient notice. However, the top court clarified that its \u201corder would not be applicable if there is an unauthorised structure in any public place such as road, street, footpath, abutting railway line or any river body or water bodies and also to cases where there is an order for demolition made by a court\u201d.\n\nLast week, the top court refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking direction to recover from administrative authorities the costs of bulldozed houses of individuals accused of criminal activities, riots, or other offences. The Justice Gavai-led Bench said that it could not reopen the issue as it had already reserved its decision on laying down pan-India directives governing demolitions.\n\n\u201cEither you withdraw it, or we will reject it,\u201d it told the PIL litigant.\n\nSensing the disclination of the top court to entertain the matter, the petitioner\u2019s counsel chose to withdraw the plea. The PIL sought direction to make it mandatory to obtain permission from the jurisdictional District Judge before the start of the demolition process of any house, jhuggi or colony, apart from serving notice on the alleged unauthorised or illegal occupant. Further, it sought direction to publish a list of demolished houses district- and state-wise, along with names of DM, SDM, and SP/DCP concerned.",
