                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Sources said, “TRF Chief Sheikh Sajjad Gul, based in Pakistan, is the mastermind of this attack.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> On his instructions, the local module of TRF became active, which for the first time targeted Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri people together.</p>

This is a big change in the strategy of this module, which is simultaneously targeting non-local and local on development projects.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Officials said that the death toll in the terrorist attack on a private company’s labourers’ camp in Gagangir area reached seven after another injured labourer succumbed in hospital.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The attack on innocent civilians engaged in an important infrastructure project that would make Sonamarg tourist destination an all-weather destination, thereby bringing livelihood to hundreds of locals, has received wide condemnation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Union Home Minister, Amit Shah posted on X, “The dastardly terror attack on civilians in Gagangir, J&K, is a despicable act of cowardice.</p>

Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the incident as dastardly and cowardly on the part of the militants.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “The casualty figure from the Gagangir attack is not final as there are a number of injured labourers, both local and non-local.</p>

PDP president, Mehbooba Mufti said, “I unequivocally condemn the attack as being senseless act of violence”.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He said such incidents will vitiate the atmosphere and requested the government to take immediate measures to contain such brutal attacks on innocent people.</p>

CPI-M leader and MLA, Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said, “A deeply troubling report of yet another terrorist attack on migrant labourers has surfaced from Ganderbal.</p>

J&K Peoples’ Conference (JKPC) Chairman, Sajad Gani Lone said, “Strongly condemn the dastardly act of terror wherein two persons have lost their lives in Sonamarg.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Intelligence agencies believe that the act of terrorists killing innocent, unarmed civilians is the result of frustration among their handlers across the border after witnessing a largely people participative and peaceful Lok Sabha and legislative assembly election in J&K.</p>
