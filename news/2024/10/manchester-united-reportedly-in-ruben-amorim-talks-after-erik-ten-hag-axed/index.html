                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Amorim was linked with the manager's role at Liverpool following the departure of Jurgen Klopp this year, but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>The position of Ten Hag, 54, had been repeatedly called into question after United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe retained him following an internal review at the end of last season when the club finished eighth in the league but won the FA Cup with a shock victory over Manchester City.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>However, the wheels came off in his second season as injuries to key players, the lack of a meaningful impact from expensive signings like Brazilian forward Antony and Ten Hag's failure to implement a clear playing style led to a number of embarrassing results.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>United crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage, while Bournemouth, Brighton and Fulham were among the other teams to win at Old Trafford in the 2023/2024 campaign.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>But Ten Hag's surprise victory over Pep Guardiola's City in the FA Cup final led to him receiving a stay of execution.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Yet early hope this season evaporated as Liverpool and Tottenham coasted to 3-0 wins at Old Trafford in September.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>He added: "The fact that they are 14th is unacceptable.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> You can't be in 14th after nine or 10 games with the level of spend that's occurred without being under significant pressure -- and that's what's happened.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>"Ex-England striker Alan Shearer said Ten Hag had been "a dead man walking" as soon as it was revealed United had talked to other potential managers in the summer.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>For all Ten Hag's faults, he oversaw just a small period of United's more general decline since legendary former manager Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Since the Scot's departure, five permanent managers have now been dismissed without United even challenging for the Premier League title -- a trophy they won 13 times under Ferguson.</p>
