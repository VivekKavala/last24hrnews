                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Something unprecedented happened in the New Zealand Parliament on Thursday.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Opposition MPs from the Māori indigenous community performed a traditional war dance to demonstrate their anger and fear over a bill that will redefine their rights.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
When the speaker asked Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, how her party would vote on the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill, the 22-year-old MP stood up, tore the copy of the bill and started performing the traditional Haka dance in Parliament.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
She was joined in the Haka by other opposition leaders on the floor.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Speaker Gerry Brownlee temporarily stopped the session.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Maipi-Clarke, who was elected last year, was suspended for her protest, which Brownlee described as disrespectful.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Who Are The Māori In New Zealand?
The Māori belong to the indigenous tribe of New Zealand for centuries.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The Māori arrived on large ocean-faring canoes and settled throughout Polynesia and New Zealand.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Their culture reflects a deep connection to the land and ancestral spirits.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The Māori language, known as Te Reo Maori, is an important part of their identity and is still spoken by many Maori people today.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The Māori have a deep spiritual connection with nature and the land.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They call themselves ‘kaitiaki’ (guardians) of the natural resources.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They believe in the concept of ‘whakapapa’, which means everything in the world is interconnected and has a genealogical link.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Ancestors play a significant role in Māori culture, and their stories and traditions are passed down through generations.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Māori make up roughly 20% of New Zealand’s 5.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>3 million people.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They experience material hardship, have worse health indicators and are incarcerated at much higher rates than the population at large.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
There are six major ethnic groups in New Zealand: European, Māori, Pacific peoples, Asian, MELAA (Middle Eastern / Latin American / African), and ‘Other ethnicity’, according to a 2018 census.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
What Is The Iconic Haka Dance?
The war dance holds immense cultural significance.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The haka is performed with powerful synchronised movements, vocal chants, and intense facial expressions, and it is used to express emotions, convey messages, and welcome visitors, according to tribes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>world.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The dance is a symbol of unity, strength, and resilience for the Maori tribe.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Despite facing challenges throughout history including colonization and cultural assimilation, the Maori are an integral part of New Zealand’s society.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
What Is Treaty Of Waitangi That Maori Are Fighting For?
The treaty was signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Māori chiefs, and is considered the founding document of New Zealand.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It set out the terms of governance between the two parties.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Its clauses continue to influence New Zealand’s laws and policies today.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The bill, introduced last week by a political party known as ‘Act’, a junior partner in the centre-right coalition government, said it wanted equal rights for all, thus, undermining the Treaty’s principles.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The party argues that non-Māori citizens are being disadvantaged by policies designed to promote Māori rights and governance.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This has already stoked racial tension in the country.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Although the bill passed its first reading with support from the National Party and New Zealand First, both coalition partners have said they will not back it in subsequent readings, making it unlikely to become law.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Protests Over The Bill
Around 10,000 protesters marched through Rotorua, about 450 km north of the capital, with some wearing traditional attire as part of a nine-day hikoi (march).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They were met by crowds waving the Māori flag and chanting in support.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Thousands of people participated in the hikoi moving towards Wellington this week to protest against a controversial bill that seeks to reinterpret the country’s 184-year-old founding document.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The Treaty Principles Bill, which passed its first reading in parliament, will now proceed to a public submission process before the next vote.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Its author, David Seymour, leader of the ACT party, argues that the proposal seeks to provide clarity on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Who is Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke?
Maipi-Clarke sees herself as the protector of the Maori people and represents the voice of younger generation of voters in New Zealand.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
She first gained attention after her election in 2023, where she performed the traditional Haka dance during her maiden parliamentary speech.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Both Maipi-Clarke and her father were considered candidates to represent Te Pati Maori in the elections.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Eventually, she was chosen for her “youthful perspective.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”
Notably, Maipi-Clarke has been quite vocal in her criticism of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and his conservative government, which has faced allegations of ripping apart Maori rights.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Maipi-Clarke also supports incorporating Indigenous knowledge and practices in tackling climate change.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Her activism is inspired by her grandfather, Taitimu Maipi, a member of the Maori activist group Nga Tamatoa.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Maipi-Clarke is from Huntly, a small town located between Auckland and Hamilton.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>.</p>
