                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Tara gets home and makes herself a large pot of coffee.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> With a deep breath, she opens the Word doc on her Mac, and pops a piece of nicotine gum into her mouth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She chews rabidly, ignoring the chaos in her rented Vasant Kunj apartment a la “A Hovel of One’s Own”.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Plants lifelessly droop in their unwatered pots, which double up as dustbins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She sits on her unmade bed, using a pillow and a balled-up blanket as an impromptu desk.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A pile of her unsold books is stacked against one of the ugly mustard-coloured walls, while the other has a pin-up board that’s plastered with covers of Victorian bodice rippers – a shrine to all the dysfunctional romances that have shaped her writing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Each features a variation of the same archetype: the Bewitching Rake, the Wandering Wolf, the Philandering Count, the Reckless Viscount – shirtless and clutching catatonic semi-clad women on the brink of orgasm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Tara can’t seem to conjure up any words today.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She silently stares at her laptop until the screen goes dark, shuddering at her own reflection – spotty, dark-circled, hair like a bird’s nest – staring back at her.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

She can’t help but recall Ahana’s worried words from last night, and her own disturbing dream of the beast taunting her.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It chuckles in her head now, Just give up, Tara.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> You’re not just a talentless hack, but an emotionally damaged one at that.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Shaking off the negativity, Tara finishes her coffee and reawakens her laptop.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

“Chapter 1”.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The desolate words mock her from the screen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Tara glares back at them till they blur into foggy squiggles.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Minutes later, hypnotized by her own lack of productivity, she finds herself on Twitter, masochistically curious to see what the trolls are saying today.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

She’s been tagged over a hundred times in a bizarre article titled “Russian Tourist’s Tragic Death Gets Plot Twist With Werewolf Killer Theory”.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

She clicks on it to find a cheerful photograph of the twenty-three-year-old blond woman named Oksana Petrova, who was visiting Goa for a yoga teacher training course, next to the beach where her body was discovered.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The article adds that she was found washed up on the shore with her throat ripped out.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The Goa police initially thought a wild animal had attacked her because of the bite marks on her body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, at least five eyewitnesses had sworn to have seen a strange “wolf-like” creature on the beach the same night, walking on two legs – just like a man.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

This wasn’t the first such incident; three months prior, the body of an Israeli woman, Sofiya Galil, who also came down to Goa to learn yoga, was found underneath a cliff on the same beach, impaled on a rock, carrying similar wounds to the other victim.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Scrolling down, Tara sees they’ve even included a sketch of said perpetrator – a black Hound of the Baskervilles-like creature standing on its hind legs, with blazing yellow eyes piercing through the page.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

She glances through the comments accompanying the article:

“This murderer is right out of a @TaraT novel.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

“Hey @TaraT, come and get yo boy, Waris!”

“The Goan police have to be smoking the same stuff as @TaraT!”

As she mutes and blocks each of the commenters, Tara can feel the beginnings of an idea form in her brain.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Instead of channelling her demons, like Herpes had said, maybe it’s time she exorcizes herself.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

She knows what she needs to do.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Start afresh.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Tara begins untacking all the romance posters from her pin-up board, gathering them into a pile on the balcony.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There, she lights a cigarette, taking a deep, dramatic drag before flicking it onto the heap.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She watches as the fire licks at her heroes and heroines, distorting their conjoined groins, before making its way to their perfect abs, swelling breasts and faces frozen in half-moans, slowly reducing them all to ash.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

By evening, the board is transformed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A printout of the Hound of the Baskervilles creature has taken centre stage, flanked by headshots of its two victims, a sticky note detailing their backgrounds and all the clues related to the murder.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The beast visits her again in her dreams that night.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

They’re alone in a cave, somewhere dark and deep.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> All Tara can see are its yellow eyes, shining in mid-air.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Its growls, low and guttural, echo off the walls.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Slowly but surely, her eyes make out the shape of the terrifying creature crawling towards her.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There’s a hyena-like grin on its face now, both ferocious and mocking.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

“Let me take a bite of you,” the beast teases and implores, as its mouth drips drool, its eyes glittering with hunger.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

A hunger…for Tara.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Despite the fear slowly paralysing every inch of her body, Tara can’t help but be drawn to the beast.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It looks at her like no other man has ever looked at her before.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> As though, despite all her flaws, it wants to possess her in a way no one else has ever wanted to.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Like it wants to claim her flesh and tendons and bones and soul for itself.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

And Tara’s so grateful it does.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She wants to give herself up to it, so badly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

But she’s afraid.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Not about the fact that it will hurt, but that the beast won’t like how she tastes.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Tara feels a desperate urge to season herself before the beast does whatever it plans to do with her.</p>

But the creature looks like it’s in no mood to wait, so she ends up offering her arm to it, nervously.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

“You taste exquisite,” the beast whispers, moaning in satisfaction.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And Tara feels her heart dance in her ribcage.</p>

Those words make Tara’s head and body explode into white, hot streaks of pleasure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She trembles uncontrollably with the knowledge that it’s going to rip her apart.</p>
