In the past few years, we brought champion bulls including Yuvraj, Dara and Shehenshah\u201d.\r\n\r\nGolu-2, which has a special pool to bath daily for at least two hours, after taking a massage with mustard oil, has a very specific workout regimen of 5K walk on a daily basis. The Murrah Bull has already won multiple awards across the Country.\r\n\r\n\"We feed the bull various types of grains, dry fruits, liters of milk and bananas per day. We also take it to five-kilometre morning walks daily. Apart from this, the bull is also thoroughly given oil massage two times a day,\" says Bhupesh Yadav, the caretaker of the bull.\r\n\r\nNaveen Singh, a farmer from Panipat in Haryana is the owner of this huge and popular buffalo. While Gholu-2\u2019s grandfather\u2019s name is Golu-1, his father\u2019s name is PC-483. Born and raised in Panipat, the buffalo bull eats around 30 kgs of green and dry fodder every day. Besides this, he eats around 7.5 kg mixture made of wheat and grams.\r\n\r\nHaribabu Yadav said every year, Gholu-2, produces huge amount of semen needed to inseminate over 10,000 buffaloes. In contrast, a normal male buffalo can hardly inseminate 1,000 buffaloes in a year.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis owner earns in lakhs from selling the semen. Every month this buffalo earns about Rs. Rs 10 lakh to Rs 15 lakh, in which about Rs 3 lakh are spent in its diet and maintenance,\u201d Haribabu said, adding that it took about a week to bring Gholu -2 to Hyderabad with stopping enroute from Haryana.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Manchester United have finally made the bold move, dismissing Erik ten Hag following a 2-1 defeat at West Ham as the club feels stranded in 14th place in the Premier League points table.The Dutch coach, appointed in 2022, initially brought hope by securing the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in consecutive seasons. However, inconsistent performances, a disappointing 8th-place finish last season, and a sluggish start to the current campaign left United with little choice but to make yet another managerial change.The departure of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013 marked the beginning of a turbulent era for United, with the club struggling to find a successor capable of replicating his success. David Moyes, handpicked by Ferguson, was sacked after just 10 months (295 days), failing to bring stability or results. Club legend Ryan Giggs briefly took over as caretaker and continued to hold the fort for 68 days, offering a temporary fix before the arrival of Louis van Gaal.The Dutchman won an FA Cup but failed to implement his \u201cphilosophy,\u201d leading to his dismissal after 679 days at the job. In 2016, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s appointment was seen as a chance to re-establish United\u2019s dominance. Despite delivering trophies, including the Europa League and League Cup, his tenure was marked by tension and inconsistency, ultimately ending in a fractured relationship with the club after 900 days.Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, another club icon, brought excitement back with his attacking style and a memorable Champions League comeback against PSG. However, his inability to deliver silverware or consistent league form led to his exit in 2021 after 969 days as full-time boss at the club.Interim stints from Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick failed to stabilize the team, leaving ten Hag to rebuild a squad still reeling from years of upheaval.Initially hailed as the solution, Ten Hag\u2019s early success faded as the team faltered. \u2014 ManUtd (@ManUtd) With Manchester United underperforming again this season, and with INEOS\u2019s potential takeover looming, the club felt compelled to act swiftly, limiting the Dutchman's tenure to 850 days.Managers at Manchester United since Alex Ferguson left (matches managed):David Moyes (51)Ryan Giggs (4)Louis van Gaal (103)Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (144)Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (19) - in interim roleOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r (149)Michael Carrick (3)Ralf Rangnick (29)Erik ten Hag (128)The search for yet another manager is now underway, but the question remains: can anyone finally revive United\u2019s fortunes and bring them back to the top of English football?",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: In a historic moment for Spanish football, Manchester City midfielder Rodri was crowned the winner of the prestigious Ballon d'Or award on Monday. The 28-year-old Madrid native beat out strong contenders Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham, both of Real Madrid, to claim the coveted prize. Rodri's exceptional performances were crucial in Manchester City's unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title triumph last season. Additionally, he was named the best player at this year's European Championship, where Spain clinched a record-extending fourth title.Rodri's victory marks a significant milestone, as he becomes the first defensive midfielder to win the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990 and only the third Spaniard to receive the honor, following in the footsteps of Alfredo Di Stefano (1957 and 1959) and Luis Suarez (1960). \u2014 ballondor (@ballondor) Despite Spain's \"golden generation\" winning the 2010 World Cup and the 2008 and 2012 Euros, no Spaniard had claimed the award in over 60 years. \u2014 ballondor (@ballondor) Rodri's unique skillset has been instrumental in Manchester City's dominance in England and Spain's resurgence on the European stage, earning him high praise from his coach, Pep Guardiola, who hailed him as \"the best midfielder in the world.\"\u2014 ChampionsLeague (@ChampionsLeague) In his acceptance speech, Rodri emphasized that his victory was not just a personal achievement but a triumph for Spanish football and the often-overlooked role of midfielders. \"Today is not a victory for me, it is for Spanish football, for so many players who have not won it and have deserved it, like (Andres) Iniesta, Xavi (Hernandez), Iker (Casillas), Sergio Busquets, so many others. It is for Spanish football and for the figure of the midfielder,\" Rodri said on stage at the ceremony.\u2014 ballondor (@ballondor) \"Today many friends have written to me and have told me that football has won, for giving visibility to so many midfielders who have a job in the shadows and today it is coming to light.\"I'm a regular guy with values, who studies, who tries to do things right and doesn't try to follow the stereotypes and even so I have been able to get to the top, and it is thanks to all of you.\"\u2014 ballondor (@ballondor) NO MESSI OR RONALDORodri's win is particularly notable as he becomes only the third player not named Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to claim the award since 2008.

        "text": "Loss to Kiwis has made India's task to qualify for WTC Final tougher; Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka all close inMUMBAI: India skipper Rohit Sharma said after the series defeat against New Zealand in Pune that the team isn't thinking about the WTC final yet. But with their lead over second placed Australia trimmed to decimals and other teams closing in, they will have a lot to play for - read 12 WTC points for a win - when they square off against the Black Caps in the third Test from Friday at the Wankhede Stadium. They also need a minimum of three wins in the five-Test series against Australia Down Under. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONhShEKpZokWith plenty of Tests to be played across the world in the next couple of months, here's a look at how top five teams are placed in the WTC standings and the road ahead in their quest to reach the final at Lord's in June 2025.INDIAWTC RANK: 1 (62.82 %points)TESTS REMAINING: 6 (1 home vs New Zealand, 5 away vs Australia)India were expected to win all five home Tests this season, which would have made their task of qualifying for the final a bit easier. They started with two convincing wins over Bangladesh but two defeats against New Zealand have upset their plans. Now, they must win the third Test against the visitors and then face a tough task of toppling the Aussies on their home turf. A 3-2 result in their favour will be an ideal scenario but say if they end up winning just two Tests of the five then they will have to depend on other teams' results to help them qualify for the final.MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE POINTS THEY CAN REACH: 74.56.WITH THREE WINS: 58.8AUSTRALIAWTC RANK: 2 (62.50)TESTS REMAINING: 7 (5 home vs India, 2 away vs Sri Lanka)Australia will play the most Tests among the teams that have a chance of qualifying for the final. Up first is the five-game series against India. They lost the last two series (four-game) against them but with a full squad at their disposal, they will be eager to avenge those defeats. The two-Test series against Sri Lanka may be a potential banana skin for them as they have lost four of the last five Tests in the Island nation.MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE POINTS THEY CAN REACH: 76.3.WITH THREE WINS: 55.3SRI LANKAWTC RANK: 3 (55.56)TESTS REMAINING: 4 (2 away vs South Africa, 2 home vs Australia)It remains to be seen which Sri Lanka turns up during the two-Test away series against South Africa-one that upset the odds to win the series 2-0 in 2018-19 or the one which lost by the same margin in 2020-21 the last time they visited. One suspects, the Islanders will be more comfortable when they will be back on home turf against the Australians, who they have dominated in the past.MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE POINTS THEY CAN REACH: 69.2.WITH THREE WINS: 61.5NEW ZEALANDWTC RANK: 4 (50)TESTS REMAINING: 4 (1 away vs India, 3 home vs England)The two wins against India have put them in the fray for the final and they will look to carry on that good work in the Mumbai Test. How they perform in the three-Test home series against England will determine how their challenge develops. England's last three series in New Zealand have resulted in two 1-0 wins for the hosts and the last one ended in a thrilling 1-1 draw.MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE POINTS THEY CAN REACH: 64.3.WITH THREE WINS: 57.1SOUTH AFRICAWTC RANK: 5 (47.62)TESTS REMAINING: 5 (1 away vs Bangladesh 4, home-2 each vs Sri Lanka and Pakistan)Bangladesh are expected to dish out a rank turner in the second Test against South Africa at Chattogram, so how the latter fares on it remains to be seen. If the Proteas end up losing that Test, they will look to win their remaining four home games to put themselves in the top two spots. The last time they hosted Sri Lanka and Pakistan, they won 2-0 and 3-0.MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE POINTS THEY CAN REACH: 69.4.WITH THREE WINS: 52.8",
        "summary": "India's WTC final qualification becomes tougher after a series defeat against New Zealand, narrowing their lead over Australia. With six tests remaining, including a challenging series in Australia, they need minimum three wins from five Australia tests. All top five teams remain closely contested in the WTC standings. Australia will play the most Tests among the teams that have a chance of qualifying for the final.",

        "text": "Manchester United are reportedly in talks with Portuguese coach Ruben Amorim to become their next manager after sacking Erik ten Hag on Monday following a disastrous start to the season. Time finally ran out for Dutchman Ten Hag with United sitting a lowly 14th in the Premier League table after they suffered a fourth defeat in nine league games at West Ham on Sunday. Despite substantial dealings in the transfer market before this season, one of the world's wealthiest clubs have won only one of their last eight games in all competitions.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, a member of Ten Hag's coaching staff, was named interim boss.According to multiple British media reports, United want to turn to Amorim, the 39-year-old Sporting Lisbon manager who is considered one of Europe's leading young coaches.Sky Sports reported United had held discussions with Amorim and are prepared to pay his release clause.Amorim was linked with the manager's role at Liverpool following the departure of Jurgen Klopp this year, but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.The position of Ten Hag, 54, had been repeatedly called into question after United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe retained him following an internal review at the end of last season when the club finished eighth in the league but won the FA Cup with a shock victory over Manchester City.Ten Hag was even rewarded with a one-year contract extension to June 2026.But United have shown little improvement this season and the 2-1 loss at West Ham was the final straw.A club statement said: \"Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men's first-team manager.\"Defended his recordUnited said Van Nistelrooy would take over on a temporary basis.Former Ajax coach Ten Hag, who joined United in May 2022, had fiercely defended his record in recent weeks after winning two trophies in his two full seasons in charge.United ended a six-year wait for silverware by beating Newcastle in the 2023 League Cup final.The Red Devils also reached the FA Cup final and finished third in the Premier League in an encouraging debut season for Ten Hag.However, the wheels came off in his second season as injuries to key players, the lack of a meaningful impact from expensive signings like Brazilian forward Antony and Ten Hag's failure to implement a clear playing style led to a number of embarrassing results.United crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage, while Bournemouth, Brighton and Fulham were among the other teams to win at Old Trafford in the 2023/2024 campaign.The implementation of a new sporting structure at United, spearheaded by Ratcliffe, saw widespread change over recent months off the field.But Ten Hag's surprise victory over Pep Guardiola's City in the FA Cup final led to him receiving a stay of execution.He was further backed in the transfer market with the signings of Joshua Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, taking the total spent in his reign to over 600 million pounds ($778 million), nearly half of which went on former Ajax players.Yet early hope this season evaporated as Liverpool and Tottenham coasted to 3-0 wins at Old Trafford in September.'Unacceptable'Former United captain Gary Neville said Ten Hag had paid the price for an \"unacceptable\" league position.\"The big shock for me is how bad they've been with the new signings that have come in,\" Neville told Sky Sports.He added: \"The fact that they are 14th is unacceptable. You can't be in 14th after nine or 10 games with the level of spend that's occurred without being under significant pressure -- and that's what's happened.\"Ex-England striker Alan Shearer said Ten Hag had been \"a dead man walking\" as soon as it was revealed United had talked to other potential managers in the summer.For all Ten Hag's faults, he oversaw just a small period of United's more general decline since legendary former manager Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.Since the Scot's departure, five permanent managers have now been dismissed without United even challenging for the Premier League title -- a trophy they won 13 times under Ferguson.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

In the second Test, NZ opted to bat first and half-centuries from Devon Conway (76) and Rachin Ravindra (65) helped the Kiwis reach 259 after Washington Sundar (7/59) delivered an incredible comeback spell to destroy the Kiwi middle order. In their first innings, India posted just 156 runs, with spinner Mitchell Santner taking 7/53 and Ravindra Jadeja top-scoring with 38 runs. In their second innings, with the help of skipper Tom Latham's 86, NZ posted 255/10, with Washington picking four wickets and Ravindra Jadeja getting three.

        "text": "NEW DELHI: The inglorious end of India's proud home record has left the cricket-mad nation grappling with the reality it has long been dreading - that ageing stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma might be approaching the end of the road.Through three World Cup titles, two World Test Championship (WTC) finals, and a 12-year Test series winning streak on home soil, Kohli and Sharma, often together, have been integral to every major Indian success of the last 17 years. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONhShEKpZokBoth quit T20 internationals after winning the World Cup in West Indies earlier this year and their diminishing returns in Test cricket is a huge concern ahead of India's trip to Australia for a bumper five-Test series.India will be hoping to avert a rare whitewash in the third Test against New Zealand starting on Friday with fans hoping skipper Rohit and batting mainstay Kohli will produce some runs before they fly off to Australia.Opener Rohit, at his peak a free-scoring and elegant batter who helped India to their first two series triumphs in Australia in 2018-19 and 2020-21, has six single-digit returns and just one fifty from his last eight Test innings.Kohli, widely considered one of the batting greats of the modern game, has managed just two centuries in the last five years and only two fifties in his last 12 innings in the longest format.The right-hander's average has dropped to 48.31 and his struggles against left-arm spin -- he fell to New Zealand's Mitchell Santner in both innings of the second Test -- has been conspicuous.\"Virat Kohli's Test record in the last two-three years has not been great against spin,\" his former India team mate Dinesh Karthik told Cricbuzz.Kohli looked crestfallen after being bowled by a juicy full toss from Santner in the first innings in Pune, as if recalling how, in his prime, he would have sent the delivery racing to the boundary.\"It's obviously a recurring pattern where (left-arm) spinners have troubled him, and I think he will go and figure out what he needs to do to come out stronger,\" Karthik said.\"He is a man who is searching for answers.\"It is not just Rohit and Kohli who have come up short, however, as India's usually strong and deep batting has been a major letdown in the two Tests against New Zealand.Skittled for a dismal 46 in Bengaluru and a paltry 146 in Pune, their failure to put decent scores on the board in first innings meant a comeback in either Test was a tall order. India have a slender lead over Australia in the WTC standings and another defeat in Mumbai would mean they would need to win four of the five Test matches Down Under to reach their third consecutive final.The next couple of months might also determine whether Kohli, who turns 36 next week, and Rohit, who is a year older, can extend their Test careers.",
        "summary": "India's home record decline has sparked concerns over the careers of cricket legends Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. With both players showing declining performances, especially in Test cricket, fans hope they can redeem themselves in the upcoming Test against New Zealand before a crucial Test series in Australia. Their future in Test cricket hangs in the balance.",

        "text": "Celebrating his 53rd birthday on October 29, former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden has predicted a victory for the hosts in the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BG) Down Under, but not without a tough fight from the visiting Indian team led by Rohit Sharma. India, who registered series wins on their last two Test tours of Australia, will defend the BGT over a series of five Tests beginning with the first match in Perth from November 24. \"I say Australia is going to win but I'll also say this: Watch Team India go!\" said Hayden in a Start Sports video. The former opening batsman believes that Australia no longer enjoy a home advantage because of the drop-in pitches utilized by Cricket Australia over the past few years.Of the five venues where this edition of the BGT will be played, three will have drop-in pitches. \u2014 StarSportsIndia (@StarSportsIndia) \"I feel like there's less home advantage given the nature of the drop-in wickets than what had been previously there,\" said Hayden. \"There are three drop-in venues -- Perth, Adelaide, and the MCG (Melbourne).\" Adelaide will host the day-night second Test from December 6, while MCG will be home for the fourth Test, beginning on Boxing Day (December 26). The fifth Test in Sydney will start on January 3, 2025. \"So you've got your two home venues in Brisbane and Sydney; those just happen to be the third and fifth Test match, which is a very different combination to any series that's been played there,\" Hayden added. \"I feel like at the moment there is probably not that much home advantage in the Australian summer anymore due to the wicket conditions.\"Before the start of the series, India will engage in a three-day warm-up match against India A that will be touring Australia at the same time.",

        "text": "Amidst the festive season, Mohun Bagan Super Giant take on Hyderabad FC at the G. M. C. Balayogi Athletic Stadium in Hyderabad in the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 on Wednesday. The defending ISL champions visit the home of the resurgent Hyderabad FC, who come into this encounter on the back of a resounding 4-0 win in Kolkata against Mohammedan SC. With Hyderabad FC\u2019s forward line producing fireworks in the City of Joy, the Mariners will be wary of taking the Thangboi Singto-coached side lightly, as they look to climb the table and catch-up with the higher-placed Bengaluru FC and Jamshedpur FC in the standings. Hyderabad FC had snapped a seven-game-long winless streak by notching the three points against Mohammedan SC in the last match. With that set aside, the team will now be hoping to get back-to-back three points under their belt, having last achieved this feat in a run of five matches from December 2022-February 2023. Sustained success has been a concerning cause for the team, but recent signs have indicated that they have overcome those troubles to really come on their own and perform at par with their potential. Hyderabad FC put on a marvellous goal-scoring show against Mohammedan SC, converting four of their 11 attempted shots into goal. Their conversion rate of 36.4% was the highest that the team has recorded in a single game since netting six times in 10 shots against Odisha FC on December 28, 2021. Hyderabad FC have registered a shot conversion rate of over 30% in consecutive games only once in the ISL (two games in February 2021).Meanwhile, the Mariners have been overcoming Hyderabad FC consistently in the recent past, losing only once in their previous seven matches against the side. They have won four times and drawn twice in the period, keeping a clean sheet in six encounters. The Mariners beat Hyderabad FC in both their fixtures last season. However, a revived home team setup might present a tougher challenge to the Kolkata-based team.Mohun Bagan Super Giant have netted six times from set-pieces in the current campaign \u2013 the highest amongst all teams. Three of these goals have come from corners, showing that the Hyderabad FC backline will have to be extra cautious in their defensive play from such situations. The Mariners\u2019 ability to influence and produce constructive attacking moves from both open plays and set-pieces demonstrates that they are cut from a different cloth when they function cohesively.The two sides have played 12 games in the ISL, with Hyderabad FC winning twice. Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been triumphant on five occasions, whereas five games have resulted in a draw.Hyderabad FC head coach Thangboi Singto has praised his players for following his strategies to perfection. He has appreciated individuals for understanding their roles well and hopes that the trend continues in the coming games too.\u201cDuring the game against Mohammedan SC, I had told the the team that what we did in the first 20-25 minutes against Jamshedpur FC is what we should take forward. They did that very well. Individual roles have been understood, from the forward line to the midfield. One part is understanding and the other is implementing it, and they did the latter very well,\u201d Singto was quoted in a release from ISL as saying.Mohun Bagan Super Giant head coach Jose Molina highlighted a key area that he wants his team to improve upon. He wants them to defend collectively and the intent for that must come from up top.\u201cWe will improve our defence when we will improve our attack. And it\u2019s not only about defending players and attacking players but for me, it\u2019s the whole team working together. 11 players defending and attacking together and that is what we have been watching the last (few) matches,\u201d Molina said.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: Hyderabad FC, fresh off a dominant 4-0 win over Mohammedan SC, are set to face another Kolkata giant Mohun Bagan Super Giant in their Indian Super League 2024-25 (ISL) clash at the GMC Balayogi Athletic Stadium in Gachibowli on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThe resounding victory against Mohammedan marked the end of Hyderabad\u2019s seven-game winless streak, providing a much-needed boost as they prepare to take on one of the league's strongest teams.\r\n\r\nHFC head coach Thangboi Singto expressed satisfaction with his team\u2019s recent performance, highlighting their ability to implement strategies effectively. \u201cThe players showed quality and spirit in the last game. Before facing Mohammedan, I told the team to build on the promising start we had in the first 20-25 minutes against Jamshedpur FC. They delivered well and played with conviction,\u201d Singto noted.\r\n\r\nHe emphasised that the team\u2019s growth is evident across individual roles, from the forward line to the midfield, with players not only understanding their responsibilities but also executing them with greater consistency. However, facing Mohun Bagan presents a bigger challenge. \u201cPlaying against Mohun Bagan is always tough. Their squad is among the best in the league, and it will take a strong effort to win. Mohun Bagan\u2019s lineup boasts several prominent names from the Indian national team but we are prepared for the task, and unafraid to face the high-caliber opponent,\u201d Singto added.\r\n\r\nIn the ISL, the two sides have met 12 times, with Mohun Bagan winning five games, while Hyderabad have secured two victories. The remaining five encounters ended in draws. To change the tide, Hyderabad will rely on key players like striker Allan Paulista, midfielder Cy Goddard, and the centre-back duo of captain Alex Saji and Stefan Savic. Allan has contributed two goals in his four appearances, while Goddard has a goal and an assist to his name, with both players excelling in off-ball movements and creating opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn defense, Savic, who recently scored his first goal for the club with a well-timed header against Mohammedan, will partner with skipper Alex to contain Mohun Bagan\u2019s prolific forwards. Their combined efforts will be critical to stopping the attacking prowess of Jamie Maclaren, Greg Stewart, Dimitri Petratos, Jason Cummings and Manvir Singh, each capable of turning the tide in the Mariners\u2019 favour. Mohun Bagan, last played in their 2-0 victory over East Bengal FC in the Kolkata derby, arrive as favourites, however, Hyderabad FC will look to capitalise on their newfound momentum.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith each day we\u2019re getting better\u201d\r\n\r\nHyderabad left-back Parag Shrivas is optimistic about the team\u2019s upcoming clash with Mohun Bagan, reflecting on the team\u2019s recent improvements. \u201cWith each game, the players are settling in, and day by day, we\u2019re getting better, which is evident on the pitch. We didn\u2019t score in the opening three games, then netted one goal in the fourth against Jamshedpur, and scored four in our last game against Mohammedan. There\u2019s a growing confidence within the group, and we hope to carry this momentum forward,\u201d Parag said.\r\n\r\nParag, who scored his first Indian Super League goal with a stunning long-range strike in the last match, credited the extra training time encouraged by the coaching staff. \u201cAfter every training session, the coach gives us 10 minutes to work on individual skills \u2013 some focus on crosses, others on finishing, and others on different aspects of their game. I\u2019ve been working on my finishing, which paid off in that goal,\u201d the 27-year-old shared.",

        "title": "Forgotten Light Rail Played Key Role in Protecting Hyderabad from Floods",
        "text": "Hyderabad: Hidden in plain sight. That is the story of an elevated aqueduct that once carried not just water but a light railway line in the Nizam era? This fascinating piece of history reveals how infrastructure has shaped Hyderabad over the years.This line was used for transporting construction materials and workers from Hyderabad to Gandipet during the construction of the Osmansagar. This elevated aqueduct passes through Gandipet, Kokapet, Narsingi, Manikonda, Shaikpet and Mehdipatnam, and is visible ni many parts.According to Deccan Archives, before the elevated aqueduct was used for water supply, it served as a light railway line.Dr Satya Narayan, a historian, recounts how the floods of 1908 alarmed the Sixth Nizam Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, prompting him to seek a solution for safeguarding the city. He consulted the renowned engineer Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya for assistance.Under the Nizam\u2019s guidance, a plan was made, but it was only after his death that the project was executed under the Seventh Nizam, Osman Ali Khan. Visvesvaraya, one of India\u2019s leading civil engineers, designed the elevated aqueduct.Along with this, a light railway line was laid on the bridge. Renowned engineer Nawab Zain Yar Jung helped during its construction which was completed in 1922-23.The Deccan Archives also stated that the light railway was planned for construction purposes, for a temporary usage.It was called a light railway line because it was designed to transport construction materials, goods, and workers. Once the work was complete, and the city\u2019s water supply challenges grew, sections of the railway were dismantled to make way for water pipes. This change marked the end of the railway\u2019s operational days, and residents began to take the leftover tracks, selling them off as scrap.Urban development and changes in the infrastructure have also altered the aqueduct along the route, making it difficult to see the elevated aqueduct completely. According to the sources, the elevated aqueduct from Gandipet to Mehdipatnam is not fully visible today. Only parts are visible, some of it is underground, overtaken by layers of civilization. It can be seen completely in Kokapet and Manikonda. Local residents also reported that the children used to climb over it because of which gates have been built over these to ensure the safety of the individuals as well the infrastructure from being damaged. This elevated aqueduct currently is maintained by the HMWS&SB and the GHMC.",

        "title": "Chocolates and cookies hog Diwali sweet spot",
        "text": "Traditionally, Diwali, the Festival of Lights is synonymous with earthen oil lamps, firecrackers and traditional homemade sweets and savoury snacks. They evoke nostalgia and a sense of belonging. From laddoos, ghewar, shankarpali, karanjis, anarse, kaju katli to spicy sev and crispy chaklis. The rich and varied culinary offerings during Diwali represent India\u2019s diverse heritage. However, in recent years, especially in urban areas, with both, husband and wife working, the joy of homemade traditional Diwali mithai is being swapped by shiny plastic boxes of chocolate truffles, dry-fruit cookies, nutri-bars, artisanal tea/coffee hampers. This shift is not merely a passing trend but a reflection of changing consumer habits, driven by convenience, globalisation, and the fast-paced lifestyle of modern India.Traditional Diwali SpreadRecipes passed down from grandmothers to mothers would come alive, and kitchens would be bustling with activity. Anarse, a Maharashtrian delicacy made from rice flour, and karanji, a crisp pastry filled with sweet coconut, would be carefully shaped and fried. In the north, families would prepare besan laddoos and kaju katli, while in Gujarat, homes would be filled with the smell of shankarpali.Rakhee Krishan, a Chef from Mumbai says, \u201cWhile we still have desserts like Kaju Katli and Soan Papdi in the limelight, desserts like Balushahi, Chirote, Gavvalu, Chenna Murki and Khaja are like a lost art. The preparation of these desserts is no less than a family bonding session, everyone, young or old sits down to bring these delicacies together.\u201dConvenience Over CraftHowever, in recent times, this scene has started to change, particularly in bustling urban cities. Today, many urban dwellers find themselves pressed for time, and the art of homemade sweets has, for some, become more of a luxury than a necessity. Enter the world of pre-packaged, sophisticated desserts. Instead of freshly made chiwda or karanji, it\u2019s now common to see high-end confectionery and chocolate boxes occupying space in Diwali gift baskets. Gourmet cakes, designer truffles and even imported cookies have replaced the traditional mithai at many Diwali parties. But why this shift? For many, the answer is simple: convenience. Purchasing a beautifully wrapped box of chocolates or cakes is infinitely easier than devoting hours to making sweets at home.Con(fusion) FoodKokila Om Prakash (65), a Home Chef says, \u201cWhen festival rolls around we don\u2019t look at what type of sweets someone gifted us or whether it\u2019s chocolates or mithais most of the times it\u2019s the thought that\u2019s heartfelt. Indeed, many desserts that I grew up eating aren\u2019t done the authentic way anymore. I remember my grandchildren bringing some type of Rasgulla Tiramisu and it just gave me the ick. Fusion is nice but not necessary with every dessert, maybe it\u2019s because I am old fashioned but I like my rasgulla either soaked in sugar syrup or masala dudh.\u201d Food trends now lean heavily toward fusion, where classic Indian sweets like gulab jamun are reinvented as truffle balls, or laddoo is served as a deconstructed mousse. This blending of traditional and contemporary has blurred the lines between what is considered \u2018authentic\u2019 Diwali fare and what\u2019s simply trendy.Mithai = Cultural MarkersWhile this evolution reflects the changing times, it also comes with its set of concerns. Traditional Diwali sweets and snacks carry the weight of regional histories and familial memories. Kaju katli, chakli, and anarse are more than just sweets; they are cultural markers that connect generations. As urban India embraces convenience, there is a growing fear that these culinary traditions could fade into oblivion, lost to the sands of time.The question remains: are we losing a part of our identity by trading our traditional mithai for a box of Ferrero Rocher? For many, the answer lies in balance. While modern treats offer convenience and global flair, there is a growing desire to preserve the authenticity of Diwali sweets by incorporating both the old and the new. Sanjana Rajan (24) says that, \u201cLife is not as calm and monotonous as it used to be. Even if I want to, I don\u2019t have the luxury to stop and make laddoos. It\u2019s sad because I get a bit sad too when I receive a box of chocolates instead of traditional sweets during festivals but at the end of the day it is what it is.\u201dThe Way Forward In today\u2019s world, where the old and new collide, perhaps the most festive way to celebrate Diwali is through a blend of tradition and modernity. Families can continue making a few special sweets like besan ladoos or karanji, while also indulging in a box of gourmet chocolates. By striking this balance, we honour our culinary heritage while adapting to contemporary lifestyles.",

Nothing worked.Hers is one of many instances in Rajasthan of people being denied pension because of erroneous entries in survival records.Ajmer resident Kanchan Devi, 40, hasn't received her widow pension for 30 months. \"I am supposed to be dead on paper. Panchayat Samiti officials suggested that I open a new pension account, in which case I would forfeit my arrears. I declined,\" she said.Gudia, 22, from Mohalla Narsinghpura in Beawar was shocked when her disability pension was abruptly stopped in Jan 2023 without prior notice. She learnt that her address had been changed in the records to \"out of state\" although she remains a resident of Rajasthan.Her plight worsened when repeated Aadhaar verification attempts to reinstate her name in the pension records failed because of her disability. \"My fingerprints and pupils couldn't be registered. This led to my Aadhaar being deactivated in mid-2024,\" said Gudiya, who lives with her mother.Keli Devi from Biyakheda in Beawer stopped receiving pension after an e-Mitra operator mistakenly linked her Pension Payment Order to another woman's account. She died this March awaiting rectification of the records.The Delhi event where these stories were highlighted was organised by Pension Parishad and Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) to highlight how \"digital exclusion\" impacts lakhs of pensioners across India, based on cases in Rajasthan collated by various organisations. The Rajasthan Minimum Guaranteed Income Act, 2023, entitles all elderly, disabled or widowed women to a minimum pension of Rs 1,000 a month, with an annual increment of 15%.Nikhil Dey of Pension Parishad and MKSS said, \"Govt has effectively made Aadhaar compulsory despite claiming it wouldn't be mandatory, leading to systemic failures that alienate those most in need of support. In Rajasthan, over 1 crore pension beneficiaries face challenges, with around 13 lakh pensions being cancelled annually, often due to delays or data mismatches.\"Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan said responsible officials needed to be penalised and pensions restored immediately for those that were wrongly excluded. He said exclusion caused by glitches in Aadhaar verification was a violation of Supreme Court orders.",
        "summary": "A 69-year-old Rajasthan woman, declared 'deceased' in government records, traveled 565km to Delhi seeking to resolve her pension issue. Similar erroneous entries have cut off pensions for many in Rajasthan. Activists highlight how mandatory Aadhaar linking leads to systemic failures, impacting over 1 crore pensioners. They urge immediate rectification and accountability for officials.",

        "text": "Yellowish or flesh-colored bumps around the eyes are not only a cosmetic problem; sometimes they can be indicators toward health issues such as heart disease. These cholesterol-filled deposits, known medically as xanthelasma, appear around the eyes and act like markers for high cholesterol levels and potential cardiovascular disease.Here's a closer look at how these seemingly harmless skin growths around the eyes are linked to heart health:Do you know about Xanthelasma?Xanthelasma is a soft, yellowish plaque that appears on or around the eyelids. It is most common among middle-aged and older adults and may occur in people with high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglycerides. These lipids, or fatty deposits, collect within the skin and cause these visible lumps. Even though they are painless and usually cause no discomfort in the body, their existence can be an indication of the collection of the same lipids elsewhere in the body, including within the arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, which is the major risk factor for heart diseases.Studies show that xanthelasma is more than just a cosmetic issue. In fact, it is sometimes linked with an increased risk of heart disease. The patient who develops these deposits will more likely have a raised level of cholesterol. In turn, the deposit itself is an early marker for an imbalance of lipid levels. At high lipid levels, the effect on the blood vessels can be felt and observed even in the skin. The formation of plaque can lead to narrowing of the arteries and, consequently, to the limitation of blood supply to the heart, eventually resulting in coronary artery disease, heart attacks, or strokes. \"About 50% of people with xanthelasma have abnormal lipid levels (high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol or high triglyceride levels). Xanthelasma can also be seen in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and inadequately treated hypothyroidism, which could be associated with abnormal lipid levels,\" Dr Sudhir Kumar, had posted on X, few months back. \"Xanthelasma is harmless and does not need treatment,\" he added. \u2014 hyderabaddoctor (@hyderabaddoctor) Xanthelasma is often associated with conditions that affect cholesterol metabolism, such as hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia. Individuals with a family history of xanthelasma or heart disease may view these as red flags for their cardiac health.Yellowish-colored bumps near the eyes is a condition that requires checking by a healthcare provider. High levels of cholesterol should be diagnosed earlier since proper management will prevent possible cardiovascular complications. Apart from cholesterol checks, blood pressure and blood glucose tests should be conducted to determine whether one's cardiovascular health is impaired.\"There are several preventions that can be used to ensure heart health. Cholesterol level screenings, along with screenings for heart rhythm abnormalities, can identify a risk early. A lifestyle of heart health is promoted by a balanced diet in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and the need for regular exercise should be emphasized. Reducing stress and avoiding smoking can further help to reduce cardiovascular risk.,\" says Dr. Parin Sangoi, Consultant Interventional Cardiologist at Wockhardt Hospitals Mumbai Central. Lifestyle changes can greatly reduce cardiovascular risk in people diagnosed with xanthelasma and high cholesterol. Some of these include dietary changes, such as lowering saturated and trans fats and increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which help manage cholesterol levels. Exercise and weight management are also very effective. Cholesterol-lowering medications like statins may be prescribed in some cases. It can also be removed cosmetically by treatments such as laser, cryotherapy, or surgery, and it will likely recur unless cholesterol levels are reduced.Although xanthelasma is benign and harmless in nature, it can be an indicator of cardiovascular risk. High cholesterol must be diagnosed and treated to prevent heart disease. The small, insignificant-looking bumps around the eyes should make people take steps in monitoring and managing their heart health, reducing the risk of worse outcomes like heart attacks or strokes.114498306",

That was an emotional moment,\" Wade, who announced his retirement from international cricket on Tuesday, told cricket.com.au Wade, who generally batted down the order in T20 Internationals, said the arrival of Josh Inglis as a wicketkeeper who could bat top of the order too influenced his decision.\"The time was right for 'Ingo' (Josh Inglis) to come in.

He was certainly ready to come in and take that role.\"They're looking for maybe someone who can bat more top to middle order now as well and that suits him really well.\" The Tasmanian also said he is unlikely to participate in the upcoming IPL mega auction as it will be tough to make himself available for the entire duration of the event.Wade has been a part of Gujarat Titans over the last two seasons.\"I'm doing the ILT20 which will be straight after the BBL. I'm doing the (Abu Dhabi) T10, which leads straight into BBL.\"So, I'm going over to Dubai at the end of this month. I've got some Tassie (Tasmania) one-dayers that I've been playing as well.

        "text": "Bigg Boss Telugu is taking the more controversial road, where the housemates are clashing with each other and tasks have become more difficult. While the girls in the house have shown their crazy and physical attacks in the Prabhavathi 2.0 task in the third week, this week seems to be the boy\u2019s turn to go berserk. Yesterday\u2019s episode had drama, action-filled moments, and verbal spats turning into physical fights. Read on to find out what the highlights of yesterday's episode of Bigg Boss Telugu 8 are:\r\nBut first, Voting Numbers!\r\nThe voting polls are active as the episodes air, showcasing each contestant\u2019s performance. Use your power as the audience and vote for your favourite contestant. Vote through the Disney+ Hotstar app by searching \u2018Bigg Boss Telugu\u2019 or dial the numbers given below:\r\n\r\nYashmi: 7997983714\r\n\r\nGautam: 7997983717\r\n\r\nHariteja: 7997983718\r\n\r\nNayani Pavani: 7997983720\r\n\r\nTasty Teja: 7997983722\r\nBigg Boss Telugu 8: Day 58 Highlights\r\n1. BB Intiki Daredi:\r\n\r\nThe wildcards and the contestants have been competing with each other since the fifth week, in the form of OG and Royals clan. Now the entire house will be one Mega BB clan and who will reach that clan first is the weekly task: BB Intiki Daredi. \r\n\r\nThe housemates were divided into four teams: red, blue, green, and yellow. Each team consisted of a leader and followers. The team and players are:\r\n\r\nRed: Yashmi, Gautam and Prerana\r\n\r\nBlue: Hariteja, Nikhil, Avinash and Gangavva\r\n\r\nYellow: Prithvi, Nayani Pavani and Rohini\r\n\r\nGreen: Nabeel, Vishnu Priya and Teja.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the teams are Yashmi, Hariteja, Prithvi and Nabeel. After winning each challenge, the team will have to roll a pair of dice and advance further in the task. The layout is similar to a popular game, Ludo which is a refreshing concept.\r\n\r\n2. Manchu Manishi:\r\n\r\nThe first challenge for the weekly task is called Manchu Manishi, where the three team players should finish assembling a snowman, using all the parts. The team that won the challenge can roll two dice to move further in the game while gaining another advantage. The winning team leader can give another team member a yellow card. \r\n\r\nIf a team gets two yellow cards, the leader should remove a member from the game. Gangavva was the Sanchalak for the challenge. The challenge required coordination, strategy, and teamwork, which was shown by the blue team, making them the winners of the first challenge.\r\n\r\n3. A Turning Point:\r\n\r\nHariteja and the blue team discussed giving the yellow card to the red team. Yashmi, Prerana, and Gautam talked to Hariteja, Avinash, and Nikhil and asked them to rethink their decision. \r\n\r\nHariteja and Nikhil gave the yellow card to Yashmi and stood strong with their decision. This discussion started a cold war between the two teams, which led to something shocking in the next challenge.\r\n\r\n4. Panipattu Yuddham:\r\n\r\nThe second challenge is called Panipattu Yuddham, where the teams need to conserve water in their water tanks, which have stoppers to stop the water flow. A member from two different teams needs to cross a line to get the opportunity to support their team and eliminate another team by pulling out the stoppers.\r\n\r\nThis task required proper balance, control, and team effort. After the first round, the blue team was excluded from the game and Hariteja was made the Sanchalak.\r\n\r\n5. The Ultimate Trigger:\r\n\r\nIn the second round, Nikhil targeted the red team, pulling Yashmi and Prerana away from the water tank. This evoked a heated verbal spat between Yashmi, Gautam, and Nikhil. Nikhil and Gautam got into a fierce verbal spat about their gameplay, which soon evolved into a physical fight. Avinash, Nabeel, and Prithvi intervened and broke the brawl between the duo. The episode ended on a high, leaving the audience curious as to what happened.\r\nExpectations for today:\r\nThe newly released promo highlights the war between Prithvi and Avinash during the Panipattu task and the breakdown between Nikhil and Yashmi. The promo promises more action-packed and dramatic moments along with emotional outbursts.\r\n\r\nBigg Boss Telugu airs on Disney+ Hotstar and Star Maa daily at 9:30 pm. As we wrap up the highlights wait for the next episode, make sure to use the voting numbers and vote for your favourite Bigg Boss 8 contestant. \r\n\r\nStay tuned to Yo!

        "text": "Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh is likely feeling a sense of satisfaction today as comments he made years ago about Pakistan's batting capability against India seem to have come to fruition. Back in 2011, Harbhajan had warned then India coach Gary Kirsten about Pakistan's vulnerability against Indian spin bowling. His thoughts stemmed from over a decade of experience playing against the arch-rivals.\n\nIn the ongoing T20 World Cup match between India and Pakistan, fans witnessed Harbhajan's words ring true. Opting to bat first after winning the toss, the Pakistani batting order faltered on a spin-friendly track against the Indian tweaker duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel. Lacking fluency against the turns and changes of pace, none of the top six batsmen managed to form impactful partnerships. Cameos from the lower order helped Pakistan set a modest total of 159/8.\n\nHarbhajan's prediction from 2011 highlighted that Pakistani batsmen have traditionally found it difficult to score freely against Indian spinners. While conditions and personnel have changed over the years, his statement highlighted the potential weakness in their game. Today's result indicates that even with experience and talent in their ranks, the Pakistani batting continues to struggle against the turning ball on slow pitches when up against their fiercest rivals.\n\nWith the ongoing competition marking the resumption of India-Pakistan clashes in T20 World Cups after over a decade, fans will view this result through the lens of history and rivalry between the two Asian giants. Though one match does not define a longstanding record, Harbhajan Singh is perhaps entitled to feel a sense of vindication about observations he made over a decade ago.",

Rabada claimed the No.1 spot on the back of strong form for the Proteas during the ongoing ICC World Test Championship, with the right-arm fast bowler taking his 300th Test wicket during South Africa\u2019s recent seven-wicket triumph over Bangladesh in Mirpur in the first Test of the two-match series. The 29-year-old collected nine wickets during that contest to play a major role in the Proteas\u2019 victory and rose three places to jump past Bumrah, Josh Hazlewood and Ravichandran Ashwin in the process to return to the No.1 ranking for Test bowlers for the first time since the start of 2019.Rabada first held the premier ranking in January 2018 and has been consistently sitting inside the top 10 for the bulk of the time since he relinquished the No.1 spot in February 2019.Hazlewood is at the second position in the ICC rankings for Test bowlers as Bumrah (third) and Ashwin (fourth) lose ground, while Pakistan spinner Noman Ali is a new member inside the top 10 after his heroics in the third and final Test of his side\u2019s recent series win against England in Rawalpindi. Noman took nine wickets for the match and was rewarded with an eight-spot jump to ninth overall and a new career-high rating on the list for Test bowlers, while fellow spinner and teammate Sajid Khan also earned the best rating of his career in improving 12 spots to 38th following his 10 scalps from the same contest.New Zealand\u2019s hero from their series-clinching victory over India, Mitchell Santner also earned a new career-high rating for his 13-wicket haul in Pune, with the left-arm spinner rising a whopping 30 rungs to move to 44th overall on the latest list for Test bowlers. Rachin Ravindra (up eight spots to 10th) is among the big movers on the updated rankings for Test batters, with England veteran Joe Root remaining well out in front of this category despite a pair of low scores in the third Test against Pakistan.Joe Root contributed scores of five and 33 during the nine-wicket loss, with India youngster Yashasvi Jaiswal the main beneficiary as he gained one place to move to third on the list for Test batters following contributions of 30 and 77 against the Black Caps.Pakistan left-hander Saud Shakeel entered the top 10 for Test batters as he improves 20 spots to move to seventh overall on the back of his innings of 134 against England, while New Zealand trio Devon Conway (up eight places to 28th), Tom Latham (up six rungs to 34th) and Glenn Phillips (up 16 spots to 45th and South Africa\u2019s Kyle Verreynne (up 14 places to 32nd also make significant gains.India duo Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin maintain a healthy lead at the top of the rankings for Test all-rounders, with Bangladesh star Mehidy Hasan the biggest eye-catcher this week as he gains two places to move to third following solid contributions with both bat and ball against South Africa.

        "text": "As the date for the showdown in the US Presidential Election nears, Kamala Harris delivered a speech Tuesday night that highlighted her stance on reproductive rights and immigration.During her campaign rally on the Ellipse in Washington, DC, Harris said that next week\u2019s election presents a stark choice for voters: \u201cIt is a choice about whether we will have a country rooted in freedom for every America or ruled by chaos and division.\u201d\u201cOne week from today, you will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts your life, the life of your family, and the future of this country we love. And it will probably be the most important vote you ever cast. And this election is more than just a choice between two parties and two different candidates,\u201d she added.According to the recent CNN poll, conducted by SSRS, in Arizona, Harris has 48 per cent support among likely voters, while Trump has 47 per cent. In Nevada, Trump leads slightly with 48 per cent, compared to 47 per cent for Harris, CNN reported.These narrow margins are within the poll\u2019s margin of error, indicating no clear frontrunner in either state.The surveys show that voters\u2019 opinions are largely set regarding which candidate would handle key issues better and neither candidate has significantly swayed a majority of voters on attributes such as caring for their constituents, sharing a vision for the country, or prioritising national interests over personal gain, as per CNN.While the race in Nevada has remained stable since late August, recent results in Arizona indicate a shift towards Harris, especially among core Democratic demographics like women, Latino voters, and younger voters, with women supporting Harris by a 16-point margin, whereas men favour Trump by 14 points.In Nevada, Harris holds a narrower lead among women (51 per cent to 46 per cent), with Trump having a significant advantage among White voters\u2013leading by 15 points among White men and 12 points among White women, CNN reported.Hispanic voters in Nevada are nearly evenly split, while Harris leads significantly among voters under 35.Notably, more than 50.5 million Americans have already cast their ballots in the November election, either by mail or through early in-person voting, as per CNN.At least 66 seasonal workers are being hired to monitor ballot boxes 24/7 in Clark County, Washington State after ballots were destroyed by fires this week in the Pacific Northwest, officials said.In the critical Southwest battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada, Harris and Trump are running near even in the race for the White House, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS. The US presidential polls are scheduled to be held on November 5.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill has decided to take a pay cut and will be the second player retained by the IPL franchise ahead of the October 31 deadline.Gill led Titans for the first time this season and both he and the management are now keen to retain the core group of players. The first retention for the franchise would be star spinner Rashid Khan, followed by Gill, Sai Sudharsan and two uncapped players in Rahul Tewatia and Shahrukh Khan.Titans will also have the option of retaining another squad member via the right to match card at the mega auction next month. Gill is seen a future leader in the Indian cricket setup.\"Gill has decided to take a pay cut to ensure the core players are retained and build a stronger team,\" an IPL source said.Titans had acquired Gill for Rs 8 crore ahead of the 2022 season.Considering that he has agreed for lesser pay ahead of the mega auction, Rashid is set to be the costliest retention of the franchise. Details of their exact pay package are yet to be worked out.As per the IPL retention guidelines released ahead of the mega auction, a team will lose Rs 18 crore from the increased purse of Rs 120 crore for the first player retained, Rs 14 crore for second, Rs 11 crore for the third while for the uncapped players, a team will have to shell out Rs 4 crore each.If a team retains five capped players, they will lose Rs 75 crore from the auction pot.The mega auction is likely to be held overseas in the last week of November. The auction purse has been increased to Rs 120 crore from the Rs 100 crore that the teams had at their disposal at last year's auction.The total salary cap now comprises an auction purse, incremental performance pay and match fees. The match fee, set at Rs 7.5 lakh per game, has been introduced ahead of the next season.The teams can retain up to six players, via retention or right to match, from the existing squad, the highest in IPL history.The 25-year-old Gill has appeared in 103 IPL matches and averages close to 38 with a strike rate of 129.",

        "title": "Opinion: To Play Or Not To Play: Is It The End Of The Line For Novak Djokovic?",
        "text": "For those who live and breathe sport, or follow it closely, it's a microcosm of life itself. Every single emotion that a human being is capable of experiencing can be found on a football pitch, or a tennis court, or a boxing ring, or a cricket field.\n\nOften, when a titan of sport approaches the end of her or his career, this gamut of emotions and experiences is revealed when one dissects the journey and the road travelled. As things stand right now, Novak Djokovic, a modern-day great, may be at the threshold of bringing the curtain down on what has been a phenomenal, history-making career. But he would ideally like to continue playing and being competitive.\n\nSo, why are we talking about this? Is it because the year 2024 was the first since 2017 when Djokovic didn't win a single Grand Slam title? Is it because he is 37? Is it because he has really done it all\u2014won the most singles Slam titles ever for a male player (24) and now also an Olympic gold (which he called \u201cthe greatest success\" of his career)? Is it because the next generation of men's singles players are well and truly pushing him, challenging him at every step? Is it because he doesn't have much left in the tank?\n\nThe honest answer is that it can be any one of these reasons, or all of them.\n\nThe Last Competitive Year For Djokovic?\n\nThe emotional tennis fan in us would of course want Djokovic to continue playing for as long as he truly wants. After all, this man has managed to do what at one time was absolutely unthinkable. When Pete Sampras got to 14 Grand Slam titles, the world was in awe of the achievement. Federer and Nadal bettered that tally and Djokovic has as many as ten Slam titles more than Sampras, four more than Federer and two more than Nadal, currently. Then, there are those who would want to see him wave goodbye on a high and not struggle to compete\u2014something that we saw Rafa go through over the last year or so, which was honestly painful to watch.\n\nSo, are we heading into a year that could be the last competitive one in Novak Djokovic's career? Maybe. Many, of course, might want to take that with a pinch of salt. Retire in 2025? Really?However, there is no doubt that the conversation now has changed from \u201cwill he announce?\u201d to \u201cwhen will he announce?\u201d. And that, as always, rests entirely with the individual. Don't be surprised if it does happen next year.\n\nThe million-dollar question here is, can Djokovic realistically win more Slams? Remember, in 2024, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, two of the biggest flag-bearers of the new generation of men's tennis players, split the four Slams equally between the two of them. They are doing to Djokovic what he did to Federer and Nadal at one time. The aura of invincibility has no doubt been severely dented. The competition is very real and the old warrior is feeling the heat.\n\n'Maybe I'll Change My Mind'\n\nIt's true that Djokovic had the opportunity to go out on a huge high, when he won the one accolade that was missing from his trophy cabinet: the Olympic singles gold, an achievement that saw him clinch a career Golden Slam. The most successful male tennis player of all time and the joint most successful overall (pre- and post-open era) knows that well.\n\nSpeaking to Argentine publication La Nacion, he said, \u201cSome people think I should leave tennis on a high: \u2018You won gold, you won everything, say goodbye'\u2026 Some people think I should keep going as long as I still think I can be the favourite for a Grand Slam. I think more like them.\u201d But then he also added, \u201cMaybe I will change my mind. I don't know.\u201d\n\n2023 Wasn't All That Bad\n\nIn his defence, 2023 was a very good year for him. He won three of the four Slams that year (Australian Open, French Open and US Open) and finished as the number one player in the ATP rankings\u2014the eighth time overall that he was the year-end number one, the most for any male tennis player. That is a telling statistic. So, it's quite plausible that despite not winning a single title in 2024 (at the time of writing this article), barring the Olympic gold, Djokovic thought that he could still dig deep and find the incredible gumption that has been his biggest weapon throughout his stellar career.\n\nEven so, he must have felt that something was off this year. He made only one Slam final this year, which was at SW19, and was well and truly humbled by Alcaraz in straight sets. He was out of the French Open in the quarters, out of the Australian Open in the semis, and couldn't go beyond the third round at the US Open. His win-loss record (as of October 29, 2024) for the year stands at 37-46.\n\nSo how is he feeling\u2014physically and mentally?\n\nDjokovic Can't Just Compete\n\nIn every athlete's life, there comes a time when they realise that they just can't perform at the level they would like. That is always the last straw. No athlete, especially the greats, wants to just compete.Is Djokovic slowing down? Can he feel the end coming closer? The simple answer to that question vis-\u00e0-vis his performances at the Slams would be \u2018yes'. But, having said that, one must remember that his number-one priority will be to recalibrate his game such that he can continue to compete and aim to win. Will he be able to do that?\n\nAlso, for Djokovic, winning matches and titles is an extremely emotional process, a continuous validation of sorts that he well and truly belongs at the highest level. He has had to, through his career, silence many a critic. Every success at the highest level is a reminder of just how far he has come.There is no doubt that he is a very, very special player. And he knows it too. He couldn't garner a fan base as large and as loyal as the ones that Federer and Nadal have, but he has found a way to turn that into motivation, using that as rocket fuel to stoke the fire that burns within him. Imagine being the world number one at 37; no other male player in the history of the sport has been older while at the top of the rankings.\n\nPicking His Battles\n\nBut Djokovic has clearly realised that the time has come to really pick and choose his tournaments, with slams as the big priority. It wasn't really a surprise to see him withdraw from the Paris Masters, where he was the defending champion.\n\nHe still hasn't made the cut for the season-ending ATP Finals at the time of writing this essay. Four of the eight slots have already been filled. Currently, Djokovic is sixth in the race, behind Taylor Fritz. Don't be too surprised if he doesn't get a ticket for Turin.\n\nNonetheless, he will still be hungry. Such hunger is never satiated. It all boils down to where Novak Djokovic is\u2014physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically. He might well be standing at the biggest crossroads of his career.\n\n(The author is a former sports editor and primetime sports news anchor.

Speculation around his exit began after a heated exchange between the franchise owner and Rahul following a heavy defeat to Sunrisers Hyderabad last season.Rumours of Rahul\u2019s departure intensified with recent reports indicating that he may not be in LSG\u2019s plans for retention in IPL 2025. Should Rahul leave, LSG would need a new skipper to take the reins.Saba Karim considers Pooran an ideal candidate for the captaincy, given his leadership experience across various leagues.\u201cWe might see a change in leadership, as Nicholas Pooran has experience leading teams in other leagues. That said, Quinton de Kock also brings a lot to the table,\u201d Karim commented in an exclusive interview on JioCinema.Pooran had an impressive 2024 season with LSG, amassing 499 runs in 14 matches at an average of 62.38 and a strike rate of 178.21. However, his batting feats were not enough to propel LSG into the playoffs. After back-to-back playoff appearances, LSG\u2019s streak ended this season as they finished seventh, with seven wins and 14 points.According to recent reports, the players likely to be retained by LSG are Pooran, Indian stars Mayank Yadav and Ravi Bishnoi, along with the uncapped duo of Mohsin Khan and Ayush Badoni.While the exact retention amounts for these players are unknown, Rs 51 crore will reportedly be deducted from LSG\u2019s purse in line with IPL retention slabs.

        "title": "\u201cVery Confident\u201d: New Zealand coach Gary Stead expects Kane Williamson to return for first Test against England",
        "text": "New Zealand coach Gary Stead is \u201cvery confident\u201d that Kane Williamson will be fit for the first Test of their home summer against England, set to take place at Hagley Oval in Christchurch from November 28 to December 2.According to ESPNcricinfo, the New Zealand team management decided against rushing Williamson back for the Mumbai Test, starting this Friday, opting for a cautious approach to his rehabilitation. Williamson sustained a groin injury during the tour of Sri Lanka last month, just before the start of the three-match Test series in India.\u201cYeah, very confident,\u201d Stead said of Williamson\u2019s availability for the first Test against England, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\u201cAt a push, we could have got him over here [in India] immediately, but given the travel factor and the need for proper recovery, we didn\u2019t feel it was worth the risk. We\u2019re happy with having him ready, and very, very confident he\u2019ll be fit for that first Test versus England,\u201d he added.Despite Williamson\u2019s absence for the entire Test series in India, New Zealand managed to secure their first-ever Test series win in the country. Will Young, stepping in at Williamson\u2019s No. 3 spot, successfully countered bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah and R Ashwin in the challenging conditions of Bengaluru and Pune.\u201cLook, it\u2019s always disappointing when he\u2019s not here with us,\u201d Stead said of Williamson, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo. \u201cHe\u2019s New Zealand\u2019s greatest Test run-scorer for a reason, and any side looks stronger with Kane. But the guys have done really well.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve adapted well in his absence. The best thing for Kane is to get himself fully fit for England, and we\u2019re certainly looking forward to his return and the impact he\u2019ll bring to the Test series,\u201d Stead added.Following the Pune Test, New Zealand made history by clinching their first-ever Test series win in India, leading the series 2-0 and now aiming for a clean sweep. India, on the other hand, will look to end the series positively.In the match, New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat. Half-centuries from Devon Conway (76 off 141 balls, with 11 fours) and Rachin Ravindra (65 off 105 balls, with five fours and a six) put the Kiwis in a strong position at 197/3, with Ravichandran Ashwin (3/41) the only early threat. After Conway\u2019s dismissal, Washington Sundar (7/59) ran through the rest of the lineup, bowling New Zealand out for 259.India then set out to surpass this modest total but struggled after skipper Rohit Sharma fell for a duck. Shubman Gill (30 off 72 balls, with two fours and a six) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (30 off 60 balls, with four boundaries) attempted to stabilise with a 49-run partnership. Gill\u2019s dismissal triggered a collapse, with Mitchell Santner (7/53) and Glenn Phillips (2/26) dismantling the Indian batting on home turf, restricting them to 156 runs. Ravindra Jadeja top-scored with 38 off 46 balls, hitting three fours and two sixes.In their second innings, New Zealand extended their lead with a commanding performance. Skipper Tom Latham scored 86 off 133 balls, with 10 fours, supported by Phillips (48 off 82 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes) and Tom Blundell (41 off 83 balls, with three fours), stretching their 103-run first-innings lead to a formidable 358, eventually being bowled out for 255. Sundar (4/56) again led the bowling, while Jadeja (3/72) and Ashwin (2/97) cleaned up the lower order and tail.Chasing 359, India started well with a solid 62-run opening stand between Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill (23 off 31 balls, with four boundaries). However, after Jaiswal\u2019s dismissal for 77 off 65 balls, featuring nine fours and three sixes, India\u2019s innings crumbled against the Kiwi spinners, eventually being bowled out for 245, losing the Test by 113 runs. This defeat marked India\u2019s first home series loss in 12 years. Santner (6/104) was the star with the ball, claiming 13 wickets in the match, with support from Phillips and Ajaz Patel to wrap up the Test two days early. (ANI)",

        "title": "Battle for playoffs spots heats up as Punjab FC, Chennaiyin FC prepare for exciting clash",
        "text": "The Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 action escalates with Chennaiyin FC visiting the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi to square off against Punjab FC in a clash of two revitalised units looking to rally behind their run of some impressive showing and upside potential this season. Punjab FC are placed fourth in the table after as many matches, securing nine points to their name, whereas Chennaiyin FC are positioned sixth with two victories and draws each in their five encounters thus far. They are arguably two definite contenders for the top-six and hence this fixture carries significant importance for both teams, giving them an opportunity to move up the standings and develop pressure on the higher-ranked opponents. So far, across both seasons, Punjab FC have scored 34 goals in the ISL \u2013 boiling down to 1.30 strikes per game. Impressively though, only once have they gone back-to-back matches without finding the back of the net in the competition, which was a sequence of two clashes in December 2023. Given that they didn\u2019t score in the previous game, Punjab FC run the risk of equalising that record, something that they would want to avoid, especially with the coming game taking place at their home turf. \n\nIn their last home match, Punjab FC held their own against the Hyderabad FC attackers by winning 2-0. Never before in the ISL has Punjab FC managed to keep successive clean sheets at home, though. They have a chance of scaling that feat against a dynamic Chennaiyin FC frontline that has netted eight goals in five games this season.On the other hand, Chennaiyin FC have put forth a unified front in ISL 2024-25, regularly dragging the team back from precarious positions to secure positive outcomes. For instance, they have won seven points from losing situations this season\u2013the joint-most with Kerala Blasters FC. Contrastingly, Punjab FC have claimed no such points so far, highlighting the need of an early lead for the Marina Machans.\n\nThe Owen Coyle-coached side have also emerged as a force to reckon with on the road. They are unbeaten in their last three ISL away games, winning twice and drawing once. The last time Chennaiyin FC registered a longer such streak was for five games from January-February 2020. Interestingly, they had made it all the way to the final that year, under the tutelage of Coyle.Chennaiyin FC and Punjab FC have faced each other twice in the ISL, winning once each. The Marina Machans have scored five goals in this fixture vis-a-vis the two of Punjab FC.Chennaiyin FC have gotten a dependable marksman in Wilmar Jordan Gil and the striker is proving his worth with every passing game. Having struck consecutively in the last two matches, the forward has a chance to equal his previous best streak of netting in three straight matches\u2013something that he has done twice (in December 2022 and March 2024). Gil will be keeping his former team on the toes in Delhi.",

Sweet shops across the city, all decked up, barely had time to breathe as orders came in one after another. \u201cBalaji sweets remain my go-to sweet shop,\u201d noted a shopper. Next to Cherma\u2019s, a row of jewellery stores were seen all decorated and ready to welcome a crowd of customers. Even a brief pause in front of a store invites eager attendants to welcome you in. Speaking on jewellery sales, Rakesh Tiruveedhula, director of RS Brothers and owner of Narayani Jewellers, shared, \u201cThis Diwali, people are more interested in silver especially with the rising gold prices. Sales have been good, and with the wedding season approaching, we expect more business.\u201d At General Bazaar, fairy lights and other Diwali decorations were in full display. Uma D, spotted at Pot Market with a large bag of flowers, shared, \u201cThese are for decorating my place. It\u2019s an important Diwali ritual for us.\u201d More conscious buyers are turning to sustainable options. Eco-friendly gifts are trending on Google and other platforms, with reusable items, plants, and other green gifts gaining popularity. Ferns N Petals, known for its plants, is a go-to for those sending gifts across distances. Nurserylive, offering seeds, and gardening essentials, is another favourite for green gifting. People are also supporting local artisans by choosing indigenous handicrafts. \u201cGifting sustainable products is better than perishable ones. They remain as a memory, a reminder of the giver, and they\u2019re something you can take care of,\u201d says Abhijeet Bose, who lives in Madhapur with his wife who is a keen gardener. Some health-conscious shoppers are choosing dry fruits ove sweets, while others go a step further, gifting gym memberships or health products. \u201cI\u2019m sending healthy gifts to my friends. Especially for my parents, it\u2019s important to consider their health. And if I can\u2019t think of anything else, I go for Alexa,\u201d says an IT professional, chuckling, who claimed that he gifted a gym membership to a friend as a New Year\u2019s gift.",

Swetha (38), her husband Antony (33), and her sister Shivani (30) after they experienced severe symptoms of food poisoning. On October 25, they had consumed a plate of momos from the \u2018Delhi Hot Momos\u2019 stall in Nandi Nagar of Banjara Hills\u2019, which landed them in the emergency room of Apollo Hospitals in Jubilee Hills, where doctors diagnosed them with acute gastritis.\n\nAcute gastritis is an intense inflammation of the stomach lining, often induced by food poisoning, and can cause excruciating abdominal pain along with other gastrointestinal issues. Swetha and her family\u2019s condition worsened rapidly, they experienced severe bouts of diarrhoea, high fever, and symptoms such as dizziness and headache. For two days, their symptoms grew even more severe. \n\nSwetha\u2019s father, Jakati Anjaneyulu, a vegetable vendor, spoke of the financial strain that followed the hospitalisation. One plate of six chicken momos for \u20b940 turned into \u20b940,000 worth of medical bills for the family.\n\nThe momo stall was operated by a vendor based in Khairatabad. In response to nine people falling ill after consuming momos from the same stall, food safety officials launched an investigation, discovering multiple hygiene violations upon inspection.\n\nAnother family affected by food poisoning was that of vegetable seller Munna Yadav. His two young sons, aged 12 and 13, experienced severe vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever after eating momos from the stall. The boys were admitted to Vijay Marie Hospital, where they required days of medical care before being discharged. \u201cWith the festival season upon us, I somehow managed to gather \u20b950,000 for their treatment,\u201d Yadav shared.\n\nIn response to these incidents, the food safety teams of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) conducted inspections of 110 food stalls selling momos across the city. Officials collected 69 samples for laboratory analysis and sensitised food handlers of the importance of hygiene, warning that any stall with severe violations would face charges. \u201cWe have to ensure that food standards are not compromised,\u201d an official from the GHMC stated.",

        "title": "Manchester United Eyeing Ruben Amorim Even As He Says 'Nothing Decided Yet'",
        "text": "Manchester United are reportedly closing in on their top managerial target Ruben Amorim even though the Sporting Lisbon coach said \"nothing is decided yet\" when it came to him replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag. As United prepared on Wednesday to play their first game since they dismissed Ten Hag, facing Leicester in the League Cup at Old Trafford, behind the scenes 39-year-old Amorim appears to be their number one choice to take over the hotseat. United pulled the plug on Ten Hag's two-year reign as manager on Monday after a 2-1 defeat by West Ham left them 14th in the Premier League.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Amorim quickly emerged as the leading contender to succeed the Dutchman and Sporting issued a statement to the Lisbon stock exchange on Tuesday confirming United were willing to meet his 10-million-euro ($10.8 million) release clause.Sky Sports on Wednesday quoted a source at Sporting saying Amorim's move at Old Trafford was a \"done deal\", but the club remained tightlipped.Amorim was guarded when asked after Sporting's League Cup win against Nacional on Tuesday if it was his last match with the club.\"Nobody knows whether this was my farewell match. Nothing is decided yet,\" he said.Despite spending heavily in the transfer market in the summer, Ten Hag paid the price for United's poor start to the season.They have won just one of their last eight games in all competitions.United have appointed Ruud van Nistelrooy as interim boss but Amorim, who is considered one of Europe's leading young coaches, is reportedly the leading contender to take over on a permanent basis.The former Portugal international midfielder has won two Portuguese titles with Sporting since joining the club in March 2020.He was briefly linked with the manager's role at Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp announced he was leaving and went as far as holding talks with West Ham this year, before they appointed former Spain coach Julen Lopetegui.- 'Age doesn't matter' -Amorim would be one of the youngest managers in the Premier League if appointed by United.But Pep Guardiola, who has guided United's UAE-backed neighbours Manchester City to an unprecedented four successive Premier League titles, insisted Amorim's age was not an issue.\"Why is it a problem?\" said City manager Guardiola. \"I started at Barcelona, at 37 years old, coming into the fourth division.\"Knowledge is knowledge. If you are able, it doesn't matter...What's important is talent. If you are good, age doesn't matter,\" the Spaniard added.Van Nistelrooy, who will take charge against Leicester, said in the matchday programme he was \"saddened\" by Ten Hag's departure.The former United forward added it was \"a great honour to manage the club I love for however long I am asked to do so\".Whoever the new United manager is, they will inherit a squad largely built by Ten Hag that includes several players who have proven to be expensive failures.The most glaring example is Antony, the Brazilian forward signed for nearly \u00a390 million from Ten Hag's former club Ajax in 2022, who has scored just 12 goals in 87 appearances.United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe reviewed Ten Hag's progress in the summer after the club finished eighth in the league but won the FA Cup with a shock victory over Manchester City.The club were also believed to have spoken to other potential managers but decided to retain Ten Hag and handed him millions for new players.But Ten Hag was sacked because United, who last won the Premier League in 2013, have shown little improvement this season.The former Ajax coach, who joined United in May 2022, argued in his final days in charge he deserved respect for winning the League Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup a year later.In comments embargoed until Tuesday, Ten Hag said before the Leicester match he thought winning a trophy in his third season would make it a success.\"Definitely, it's about trophies,\" he said. \"If you win a trophy in pro football, that is most important because that is what the fans expect and what we expect.\"Since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after leading United to a record 20th league title, five full-time managers have come and gone at Old Trafford.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Sunrisers Hyderabad to retain Travis Head, Nitish Kumar Reddy ahead of IPL auction",
        "text": "Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) are set to retain Australian batter Travis Head and young Indian all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy as their final two capped players ahead of the IPL auction. According to ESPNcricinfo, Head will be retained for Rs 14 crore, while Reddy will secure a deal worth Rs 6 crore.With these two key retentions, SRH have now finalized their quota of five capped players before the auction, solidifying the core team that propelled them to the IPL 2024 final. The combined value of these retentions will deduct INR 75 crore from their total purse of INR 120 crore. Previously, SRH had confirmed the retention of Heinrich Klaasen (INR 23 crore), Pat Cummins (INR 18 crore), and Abhishek Sharma (INR 14 crore). They are now eligible to use a right-to-match card to potentially re-sign one of their uncapped players during the auction.The deadline for the ten IPL franchises to submit their list of retained players is October 31. Each franchise is allowed to retain up to six players ahead of the mega auction for the 2025 season, with a maximum of five capped internationals and two uncapped players. Although the IPL has established minimum deductions from the auction purse for each retained player, franchises are at liberty to pay more than the stipulated amounts to their retained players.Pat Cummins, who will continue to captain SRH, led the team to the playoffs in 2024 for the first time since 2020, under the guidance of head coach Daniel Vettori.Travis Head, who had a remarkable IPL season in 2024, amassed 567 runs at an impressive strike rate of 191.55, solidifying his position at the top of the order. Despite his underwhelming performance in the IPL final against Kolkata Knight Riders, Head\u2019s overall contributions, including a stellar hundred in the World Test Championship final and the ODI World Cup final in 2023, justified his retention. His value at the 2024 IPL auction was INR 6.8 crore, and although his price has more than doubled, it is likely he would have attracted even higher bids had he entered the auction.Nitish Kumar Reddy, aged 21, has seen a substantial increase in his value from the INR 20 lakh he was initially bought for in 2023. Reddy earned the Emerging Player of the Year title in IPL 2024, scoring 303 runs at a strike rate of 143 and taking three wickets. Despite missing India\u2019s T20I series in Zimbabwe due to injury, Reddy made his international debut in the home T20Is against Bangladesh in October. He is set to travel to Australia with the India A squad for two four-day games starting October 31. (ANI)",

        "title": "Haryana Bulls to Leave a Mark on Hyderabad",
        "text": "Hyderabad: At 7 feet tall, stretching 14-18 feet in length, and weighing nearly 2,000 kg, the Murrah bulls from Haryana are set to be the stars of this year\u2019s Sadar Festival in Hyderabad. Among them are Gholu II, from Super Dairy Farm in Musheerabad, and Bahubali from Dalbir Singh Dairy Farm.Roaming through the Nawabi architecture surrounding the farm, Gholu II exudes a princely presence. True to its pampered status, the bull is fussed over when it eats, preferring mango leaves over apples. Alongside its refined eating habits and imposing stature, the bull\u2019s polished black coat and gleaming horns add to its majestic look.A display board at the Super Dairy Farm features a picture of Gholu II\u2019s owner, Narendra Singh Poonia, receiving the Padma Shri award from President Ram Nath Kovind. Poonia, from Didwari village in Haryana\u2019s Panipat district, was honoured in 2019 for his dedication to raising Gholu II. Sandeep Yadav and Laddu Yadav have brought Bahubali, a bull they proudly call the \"All-Time Animal Husbandry Champion.\" \u201cHe\u2019s the tallest and longest bull,\u201d claims Sandeep Yadav while noting how it is also featured in the Telugu movie, Skanda. Together, these bulls promise to make this year\u2019s Sadar Festival quite a spectacle.Named after the hit film, Bahubali\u2019s daily diet includes 25 litres of milk, 20 eggs, and three kilograms of dry fruits. This diet extends further, with claims that on four Sundays a month, Bahubali drinks a full bottle of Black Label whisky, consumes 20 litres of milk, 19 kg of apples, and enjoys laddu and an air-conditioned stay.These high-maintenance bulls travelled 1,800 km to Hyderabad in air-conditioned containers, arriving in true Nawabi style. Haribabu explained that the journey required meticulous attention: the bulls were given walking breaks, massaged with oil, bathed, and fed a diet rich in dry fruits, apples, pure ghee, and jaggery to ensure they arrived in peak condition. \u201cIt took seven to eight days to bring them here. They even sleep on rubber mats and have an air-conditioned room for comfort,\u201d Haribabu shared. Each bull will be shaved, groomed, and prepped to look their best for Saturday\u2019s event. Last year, the Sadar Festival attracted five lakh visitors from the southern states. This time, organisers expect a turnout of 10 lakh, with visitors likely arriving from North India as well.Now recognised as a state festival, Sadar celebrates these exceptional animals. With an average daily expenditure of Rs 5,000 to 6,000 per bull, the festival\u2019s total cost exceeds Rs 35 lakh. The term \"Sadar,\" derived from Hyderabad\u2019s local dialect, traditionally refers to the community\u2019s elder or leader. Dating back over 100 years, the festival originated as a means to unite the Yadav community. On the second day after Diwali, the community gathers with families dressed in new clothes showcasing their finest bulls. The best bull, selected on the criteria of size, stature, head, age, testicles gets the winning prize. When asked why Ongole bulls from Andhra Pradesh are no longer part of the festival. The organisers explained that this breed, though originally from Andhra Pradesh, is now rarely seen in India. Most of the stock, they explain, have been exported to Brazil.In states such as Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, government initiatives have established semen banks, making breeding more accessible to farmers. Gholu II\u2019s semen alone generates Rs 15\u201320 lakh per month for its owner. Each bull produces 100 doses of semen and thus offers immense breeding opportunities. Haribabu urged the Telangana government to implement similar veterinary services and semen banks to support local farmers. \u201cA normal cow produces 1-2 litres of milk morning and evening, but this breed can yield 6-7 litres, which could greatly benefit farmers.\u201d",

Hyderabad FC, aiming for a second consecutive win, now sit 11th with four points from their six matches.Under the guidance of coach Jose Molina, Mohun Bagan displayed professionalism, scoring a goal in each half and executing a disciplined defensive strategy to neutralise Hyderabad FC\u2019s quick offensive play. The visitors capitalised on their opportunities, showing clinical finishing and playing to their strengths to secure three points.After a cautious opening that included a yellow card for defender Subhasish Bose in the 28th minute, the Kolkata-based side broke the deadlock in the 37th minute with a strike from Manvir Singh. The two teams had been battling for control in midfield when Anirudh Thapa\u2019s creative through ball sliced through Hyderabad\u2019s defence, setting Manvir up perfectly.Already on the move, Manvir faced a curious challenge: he had previously scored four times against Hyderabad FC, his best tally against any ISL opponent, but had also gone seven matches without a goal against them. He ended that streak by expertly controlling the ball, rounding goalkeeper Lalbiakhlua Jongte, and slotting it home from the centre of the box.Mohun Bagan continued to dominate in attack, generating several scoring opportunities. In the 55th minute, they extended their lead when Greg Stewart delivered a perfectly weighted free-kick into the box, which was met by Bose, who powered it home to double the advantage.The Mariners then focused on consolidating their lead, adopting a cautious approach for the remaining 40 minutes to secure another valuable win.",

Hyderabad FC started energetically, with Abdul Rabeeh making an early attempt from the right, only for his shot to miss the target. A free kick soon after presented an attacking chance for Hyderabad, but in a swift transition, Jamie Maclaren raced down the pitch for MBSG, forcing Hyderabad to concede a corner.\r\n\r\nBy the 15th minute, Rabeeh\u2019s pace continued to threaten MBSG\u2019s defence down the right flank. He was fouled by centre-back Alberto Rodriguez, earning Hyderabad a free kick and Rodriguez a yellow card \u2013 the first of the match. Moments later, MBSG\u2019s Manvir tried his luck with a shot to the near post but found only the side netting. Hyderabad aimed to control possession, stifling MBSG\u2019s creative players, especially Sahal Abdul Samad and Greg Stewart.\r\n\r\nIn the 23rd minute, Sahal managed to shake Hyderabad\u2019s defence with his footwork and took a shot from his left foot from inside the box, but his attempt missed the target. Rabeeh continued to be a headache for MBSG on the right, prompting Subhasish Bose to commit a foul just outside the 18-yard box, resulting in a yellow card for the defender.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock was broken in the 37th minute, as MBSG\u2019s Anirudh Thapa launched a precise through ball from the defensive half to Manvir, who held his nerve to score his first goal of the season. Hyderabad, struggling to find their attacking rhythm, couldn\u2019t get the ball to target man Allan Paulista, while Stewart and Sahal created a close chance just before halftime, only for Lalbiakhlua Jongte to deny Stewart\u2019s shot from inside the box.\r\n\r\nMBSG went into the break leading 1-0.In the second half, Hyderabad intensified their efforts, however, MBSG doubled their lead in the 55th minute in a set-piece situation. Stewart sent in a quality cross that found Subhasish, who headed it firmly into the bottom left corner from close range.\r\n\r\nDespite Paulista\u2019s attempt from the centre of the box shortly after, Hyderabad couldn\u2019t mount a comeback. MBSG showed their league strength by controlling the game and coming close to scoring a third goal on multiple occasions, with Hyderabad managing to avoid a larger deficit.

In international matches scheduled during a FIFA window, clubs are mandated to release players for national duty. The Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad had also hosted the three-team Intercontinental Cup tournament last month.\r\n\r\nIndia had played out a goalless draw with Mauritius on September 3 before losing 0-3 to Syria, the eventual champions, on September 9 in that tournament. India then travelled to Vietnam to play an international friendly against the hosts on October 12. The match ended 1-1.\r\n\r\nThe November 18 match will be Marquez's fourth match in charge of the national team and he would be looking for a win against a lower-ranked team, though it will not be an easy one. Malaysia are ranked 133rd in the FIFA chart while India are at 125th. The last time the two teams met was in October 2023 in the Merdeka Cup semifinal. India had lost 2-4. PTI",

        "text": "It's that time of the year when IPL franchises take a call on who to retain or release. With the deadline for 10 teams to submit their list of retained players ending today at 5 pm, TOI takes a look at the rules that have been put in place and how much room teams have to juggle their strategies before the 2025 mega auction...HOW MANY PLAYERS CAN BE RETAINED?To help the teams keep their core intact, IPL has allowed the franchises to retain a maximum of six players of which five can be capped players (Indian or overseas) and two uncapped. For example: A team can pick a combination of five capped players and one uncapped or four capped and two uncapped.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR2I2Ie7qywRs 120 CRORESalary purse each team will have at their disposal. That's a 20 per cent increase from last year's auction. During the last mega auction held for the 2022 edition, the salary cap was Rs 90 crore.HOW MUCH TEAMS CAN SPEND ON RETAINING PLAYERSA team will end up spending Rs 79 crore if they retain five capped players and one uncapped player to fill their quota of six players and they will be left with a purse of Rs 41 crore during the auction.They can divide the purse of Rs 75 crore among the capped players in any proportion if they choose to retain all five. For example: If the first player is retained for Rs 25 crore they will have to convince the fifth player to be retained for Rs 7 crore.If the franchise spends more than Rs 75 crore on retaining capped players, that amount will be deducted from their auction purse.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1YFpPH2HXIHOW DOES RTM COME INTO PLAY?If a team decides to release all its players, they can enter the auction with six Right to Match (RTM) cards. It depends on the team, how many players they want to retain first or buy through RTMs during the auction.In the 2025 auction, the franchise that bids the highest for a particular player will be given another opportunity to raise their bid to keep hold of that player. They will only lose that player if his previous team matches the increased bid to buy him back.114799387WHO IS AN UNCAPPED PLAYER?MS Dhoni falls under this category as he hasn't been a part of the starting XI in an international match in the last five years. Also players who are yet to debut for India fall in this category.The minimum base price for a player will be Rs 30 lakh which is a 50 per cent increase from the last auction when the base price was Rs 20 lakh.REGULATIONS FOR OVERSEAS PLAYERSWe have seen in the past that overseas players have pulled out of the IPL just before the start of it. To address this concern, the BCCI has asked all the overseas players to register for the mega auction if they want to take part in the IPL. If they don't, they can't be part of next season's mini auction.Exceptions will be granted only for medical and injury reasons. If one withdraws post auction, he will be banned for two years.",
        "summary": "With the IPL franchises finalizing their retained player lists by 5 pm today, the maximum retains are six players including five capped and two uncapped. The salary cap stands at Rs 120 crore, a 20% increase from last year. Teams can utilize Right to Match (RTM) cards during the auction for released players.",

        "text": "Mohun Bagan Super Giant head coach Jose Molina expressed delight after securing a 2-0 victory against Hyderabad FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) at the GMC Balayogi Athletic Stadium in Hyderabad on Wednesday, saying that though the opposition wingers put them under pressure, they were able to overcome it and defend really well to score their third successive clean sheet. Manvir Singh and Subhasish Bose scored for the Mariners, stretching their winning run to three consecutive matches. Moreover, the Mariners have now kept cleansheets in the last three back-to-back outings.Despite absorbing the initial pressures posed by the hosts, Mohun Bagan SG found themselves back on track with Singh opening the scoring with his precise footwork inside the opponent\u2019s box in the 37th minute. The Mariners scored another in the second half thanks to captain Bose, who perfectly headed Greg Stewart\u2019s floating cross to register his third goal of the season.With 13 points, four wins, a loss and a draw each, Mohun Bagan is at the second spot. On the other hand, Hyderabad FC is at 11th spot with a win, a draw and four losses, giving them four points. \u201cWell, first of all, I am happy with the result, sure. Third victory in a row and the third consecutive clean sheet, it is really good. We are happy,\u201d Mohun Bagan SG head coach said in the post-match press conference as quoted by an ISL press release. Thangboi Singto\u2019s men generated a couple of offensive moves in the opening half with their speedy wingers Abdul Rabeeh and Ramhlunchhunga.While quizzed about the difficulties posed by Hyderabad FC players, Molina answered, \u201cIt was a tough match because Hyderabad FC started with a lot of pressure, a really intense team. Their wingers put us in some trouble. But finally, we could have a good defense, good organization, and did not concede goals.\u201d\u201cWe took advantage of a good situation for Manvir (Singh) to put the first goal on the scoresheet. And, from there, I think, we were calm. We kept possession more than in the beginning, moving the ball, and having some opportunities. I think we could have scored some more goals during the second half,\u201d the head coach continued sharing how Singh\u2019s goal changed the dimension of the game and resulted in a third consecutive win for the Mariners.Molina was pleased with how his players absorbed Hyderabad FC\u2019s pressure until the final minute to keep the scoreline unchanged and bag all three points from the away fixture.\u201cIt is true that Hyderabad FC fought until the last moment and could have scored any goal too. But I am happy,\u201d he said.\u201cI am happy with the match, with my team\u2019s performance and the result,\u201d Molina signed off.",

These retentions will leave the 2008 champions with two right-to-match (RTM) card options at the upcoming mega auction. All four players mentioned above (Samson, Jaiswal, Parag and Sandeep) had an exceptional season this year as they delivered fine contributions for their side. The Rajasthan skipper, Samson scored 531 runs in 16 matches at an average of 48.27 and at a strike rate of 153.47, with three half-centuries. His best score in the league was 82*. In 16 matches in the 2024 season for RR, Jaiswal has scored 225 runs at an average of 32.14 and a strike rate of 157.34, with a fifty and a century each.In the 17th edition of the cash-rich league, Parag scored 573 runs at an average of 52.09 and a strike rate of 149.22.

Thursday, October 31 is the deadline by which all the franchises are supposed to submit the list of their retained players ahead of the mega auction.

This can be either via retention or by using the Right to Match (RTM) option.The auction purse for the franchises has been set at Rs 120 Crore for IPL 2025. The total salary cap will now consist of an auction purse, incremental performance pay and match fees. Previously in 2024, the total salary cap (auction purse + incremental performance pay) was Rs. 110 Crs which will now be Rs. 146 Crs (2025), Rs. 151 Crs (2026) and Rs. 157 Crs (2027). A match fee has been introduced for the first time in the history of IPL. Each Playing member (Including the Impact Player) will get a match fee of Rs 7.5 Lakhs per match.

        "text": "Ahead of the first ODI against West Indies at North Sound, England stand-in captain Liam Livingstone said he is honoured at being named the skipper for the series and asserted that his best is yet to come as a player.England will kickstart their tour of West Indies with the first ODI of the three-match series at North Sound. Speaking as quoted by Sky Sports ahead of the match, Livingstone said that it is not every day that someone is an England captain. \u201cIt is not every day someone tells you you are going to be England captain. It is an incredibly proud thing for me,\u201d Livingstone, 31, said after being included in the ODI side as a captain following his initial dropping from the ODI side during the home series against Australia. A calf injury to skipper Jos Buttler, who has not played any game since the 2024 T20 World Cup semifinal against India in the Caribbean, paved the way for Liam\u2019s rise to captaincy. It was the T20I series against Australia which led to the all-rounder\u2019s return to ODIs. During the T20Is against Australia, he made scores of 87 and 37 and took five wickets. He was included in the ODI series squad against Australia later, scoring 108 runs in four matches, including a half-century and two wickets. Livingstone said that as an experienced player, it is his duty to make the newer players feel comfortable in the national side environment. \u201cI want the next few games to be a hell of a lot of fun, play some good cricket, win some games and then hand the reins back to Jos,\u201d he added. Livingstone took his omission from the ODI side in a positive way, saying that he had a conversation with the managing director of men\u2019s team Rob Key, and asked him for another opportunity to prove everyone doubting his place wrong.\u201cIn the series against Australia, I certainly felt I did that. I am in a very different place to where I was six or 12 months ago, I feel like a kid, like I am almost at the start of a new career.\u201d\u201cI feel like the best of me is still to come,\u201d he concluded his point. Only twice in his 30 ODI career, Livingstone has batted above number six or faced above 50 deliveries. He feels that he is good enough to play for the ODI side but needed more responsibility as a player, which he was not getting down the order. \u201cIf you are batting seven and only bowling a couple of overs a game it becomes quite a difficult role for someone who wants to be involved.\u201d\u201cI feel I have worked a few things out with my batting and had a really good end to the summer. Now I am excited to get a bat back in my hand and prove that I am a better player than someone who bats at seven. I believe I can do more damage if I face 60 balls rather than 20,\u201d he concluded.

The report claimed that LSG have finalised Pooran as their first retention pick and he can become one of the costliest retentions in the history of the competition. Several media reports have already claimed that LSG will not be retaining KL Rahul but that does not make Pooran the automatic captaincy choice.

The agreement between the two parties was reached in two minutes after consultation with mentor Zaheer Khan and coach Justin Langer,\" IPL sources said.The report added that fast bowler Mayank Yadav and spinner Ravi Bishnoi are the other guaranteed retentions apart from Pooran.\"There is a chance that Lucknow will spend Rs 40 crore on retaining overseas and capped players like Pooran, Mayank and Bishnoi. Uncapped players like Ayush Badoni and Mohsin Khan will be paid as per understanding with the players and the franchise,\" sources said.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) are set to retain Australian batter Travis Head and young Indian all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy as their final two capped players ahead of the IPL auction.According to ESPNcricinfo, Head will be retained for Rs 14 crore, while Reddy will secure a deal worth Rs 6 crore.With these two key retentions, SRH have now finalized their quota of five capped players before the auction, solidifying the core team that propelled them to the IPL 2024 final.(With ANI inputs)",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir said that every player has a duty to the team and does not want to place the entire blame for the defeat against the visiting New Zealand squad on the batters. After losing the second Test by 113 runs in Pune on October 26, India fell to their first Test series loss at home in 12 years. In Bengaluru, the hosts lost by eight wickets in the first Test match. With batters battling against both swing and spin, the team totals in three of the four innings were 46, 156, and 245.\"Everyone has the responsibility, I cannot say just the batters have let us down,\" Gambhir said at the press conference ahead of the third Test in Mumbai from Friday.Additionally, Gambhir said he would not be adding any players for the final Test.\"We are not in a situation where can think of that (giving chance to players who have not played),\" Gambhir doused the speculations of an imminent debut being handed to Harshit Rana as reported in some quarters.\"Harshit Rana is not part of the squad. He has just come here to prepare for the Australia tour, Abhishek (Nayar) made it clear yesterday. IPL retention has nothing to be spoken about, we have a Test match here.\"Everyone is available for selection, we will take a call tomorrow.\"\u2014 BCCI (@BCCI) Although Gambhir acknowledged that the squad was hurt by the Test series loss, he stated it should motivate them to do better in the future.\"I am not going to sugarcoat that it is hurting. It should hurt and that will make us better. What is wrong in being in this position?\"I am sure this will push the youngsters to be better cricketers. If we have results like Kanpur, might as well have results like this and keep moving forward,\" said Gambhir.According to him, batter should be able to adjust their performance to the game's circumstances.\"Test cricket should be played like Test cricket. If we have to get 400 runs inside a day's play we should be able to get it. For me it is about playing the sessions as well. If we play 4.5 sessions we will have a lot of runs on board.\"A complete cricketer is one who can adapt successfully. Not just being able to hit the stands but also rotate strike successfully,\" he said.Talking about the defensive technique of batters being impacted by T20 cricket, Gambhir said, \"The more the T20 cricket is played (around the world), the more the people will struggle in defending.\"But the most successful players irrespective of the formats always had strong defence. We need to keep telling people the importance of defence and we are working hard on it and we will see results in future.\"Asked about the Wankhede Stadium pitch around which there has been a lot of speculation, he said, \"It is just a good wicket. Very difficult for anyone to judge before both teams have batted on it.\"On his journey at the helm of affairs so far, Gambhir said, \"I never expected a very easy run for me. I know that we lost in Sri Lanka and against NZ and it is not a good place to be. All we can do is keep working hard and we will try winning every game that we play to represent the country.\"He emphasized the importance of having some empathy while working with players who are under strain.\"I realise it's a complete different thing when you were playing and now as a coach, need to put your arm around the players.\"",
        "summary": "Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir emphasizes collective responsibility for the team's recent Test series defeat against New Zealand. Despite the setbacks, Gambhir believes the losses will motivate young players to improve.

        "title": "Ind vs NZ \u2013 Coach Gautam Gambhir says India batters\u2019 skill against spin hasn\u2019t gone down",
        "text": "A series defeat at home to New Zealand, sealed by a pair of spinners who had come on this tour with a combined two first-class five-fors, has led to questions about whether there has been a decline in India's ability to play the turning ball on turning tracks. India head coach Gautam Gambhir wasn't willing to go that far, but he did highlight a decline in defensive skills as a result of widespread T20 cricket.\"Sometimes you've got to give it to the opposition as well,\" he said on Thursday, a day before the third Test in Mumbai. \"I think Mitchell Santner was outstanding in the last game, but yes, we'll keep working hard. We'll keep getting better. That's about it. Guys are putting a lot of hard yards in the nets. Yes, ultimately it's the results that matter when you're playing international cricket, but I don't think so that our skill against spin has actually gone down.\"India have suffered collapses in every innings of this series. Forty-six all out happened in highly unusual conditions in Bengaluru, but from there, they have lost 7 for 54, 6 for 73 and 5 for 40, which has forced them to work on how to bat time in tough conditions.\"Test cricket is about playing sessions,\" Gambhir said. \"I think if we can start to learn how to play sessions, and the kind of quality we have in our batting line-up, I think if we end up playing four to four-and-a-half sessions, we'll have a lot of runs on the board.\"The inability to meet this fundamental demand has highlighted the challenge that modern-day batters face in the era of T20 cricket. \"We need to defend better,\" Gambhir said. \"I think that is something which is important. And especially on a turning track. Because if you've got confidence on your defence, a lot of things can be sorted. And that is something which we need to keep getting better, keep working on.\"Because, again, I'll keep going back to the same answer that a lot has to do with limited over-cricket and T20 cricket as well that when you're so used to muscling the ball, that you end up forgetting the soft hands and all that stuff, which probably used to happen eight or 10 years back. So that is something, that is why I said that a complete cricketer is a cricketer who plays T20 format really successfully and also the Test cricket really successfully. He can adapt his game. And that is what growth is.\"Growth is not only going about hitting the ball in the stands. It's also about batting sessions on a turning track, where you know that you will not be able to hit in the stands, but you will be able to rotate better. For that, I think the foundation is very, very important.\"\"If we can bat sessions, we know that we've got the bowling attack to take 20 wickets\"Gautam GambhirThe Mumbai Test is likely to be played in conditions that should help the spinners as well. At the end of India's practice session on Thursday morning, the captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli took a good, long look at the pitch with assistant coach Abhishek Nayar. Kohli then left, but Gambhir and bowling coach Morne Morkel joined Rohit and Nayar and the four of them were involved in a discussion that lasted about 20 minutes. A little while later, the groundstaff began to brush away whatever grass that had managed to cling to the surface. Batters may have to unlearn the skills that help them succeed in T20s to do well here. But is that possible? Can a coach help them make that switch?\"To a certain extent, yes,\" Gambhir said, \"To a certain extent, it has to come from the individual as well. That how much value does he end up giving it in defending the ball? That is something which is very important. And especially on a turning track. Because I've always believed that the best players and the most successful players in this format, or be it any format, always had solid defense. So that is something which we keep talking about. And it is not the overnight thing that we're going to talk about it today and people will start getting better tomorrow. But it's a continuous process. We need to keep working on it. We need to keep telling people the importance of defense.\"Could India end up facing a situation where they have to look at a separate set of players more suited to Test cricket? Gambhir couldn't commit to a hypothetical question but he did admit that \"going forward, obviously, we will have to identify players who are solid red-ball cricketers. Because ultimately, to get the results, you will have to work really hard for three or four days or five days to be honest. So sometimes, as I just mentioned, it's important. If we can bat sessions, we know that we've got the bowling attack to take 20 wickets. At the moment, it's difficult to answer.\"Alagappan Muthu is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo\r\n\r\nSource link",

The former India cricketer asserted that the team should have to take responsibility as a whole and not in a bit of pieces (Batters or bowlers). \u201cWe are trying to iron out everything. I am not going to say batters or bowlers have been let down. We win together and lose together. It is about scoring runs and getting wickets. Everyone should take the responsibility.

Further, the 43-year-old stated that a player needs a lot of mental ability in order to become a Test cricketer. \u201cTest cricket needs to be played like Test cricket. We need to adapt well. We need to get 400 runs in a day or bat for two days if needed. This is what growth and Tests are all about. Tests are all about adaptability. If you can learn to play session by session, we have quality in our batting line-up, and we will have a lot of runs on the board. We will have to look at the situations and play. Test cricket tests you in every way. You need a lot of mental ability to become a Test cricketer,\u201d the head coach added.

I have to also say that we had some luck as well. Two posts and it comes to Casemiro\u2019s feet and Bruno\u2019s free-kick is deflected and it\u2019s in, but it\u2019s the first one for him after a long time so I\u2019m so happy for him that he\u2019s on the scoresheet twice.

Further, Leicester City manager Steve Cooper also expressed his feelings following his team\u2019s loss. \u201cI just said to the guys we can\u2019t make mistakes like we did. There were lots of phases in the game we were completely dominant. United are a counter-attacking team, they have really good players and we gave them too many moments to hurt us. You look at the second half we were absolutely dominant. United did not get in our half and then we gave away a goal,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI know this season is going to be a little bit like tonight \u2013 you do some really good things but then you have setbacks and mistakes. But we have to make sure we really focus on getting the good moments and good results. It\u2019s always about looking forward,\u201d the Leicester coach added.

Tamil Thalaivas' raiding duo of Narender Kandola and Sachin Tanwar, along with Bengaluru Bulls' Ajinkya Pawar, visited the Shri Kotla Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy Stadium to witness the Under-14 boys and girls' finals in Hyderabad on Saturday, according to a PKL press release. The presence of these PKL stars highlighted the growing importance of grassroots development in kabaddi.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Reflecting on the sport's evolution, Sachin Tanwar shared, \"This is a significant movement from the beginning. When I was in school, we used to play in such tournaments too. Initially, only 200-250 people would come to watch, but now the popularity of kabaddi has grown tremendously, encouraging more participation. The scope of the game has expanded significantly, and this is evident now.\"Ajinkya Pawar emphasized the importance of balancing academics with sports.\"The most important thing is that these young players need to maintain a balance - they should focus on both their studies and sports. Education remains equally important as sports,\" he advised the aspiring athletes.Drawing from personal experience, Narender Kandola emphasized the crucial role of school-level competitions.\"Kabaddi's growth starts from the grassroots level, and school games play a crucial role in developing the sport. My own journey is testament to this - I started with casual games in my village, moved on to school competitions, and eventually made my way to the world stage. This is where it all begins,\" he said, hoping to inspire the kabaddi winners of the ongoing SFA Championships.",

        "text": "Former India head coach Ravi Shastri came out in support of the current Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir after the side conceded the ongoing Test series to New Zealand. India, captained by Rohit Sharma, marking their first Test series loss at home in 12 years. Shastri explained that since Gautam Gambhir is in the early phase of his coaching stint with the national team, there is still enough time on hand. Indian batters got the taste of their own medicine as the Kiwi spin attack led by Mitchell Santner, who took 13 wickets in the match, trapped the hosts in their own spin trap and defeated India by 113 runs to secure the series 2-0 with a game to go.\r\n\r\nwindow._rrCode = window._rrCode || [];_rrCode.push(function(){ (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\"); });\"New Zealand have beaten them (India) handsomely in both the Test matches. It's food for thought (on series loss). He (Gambhir) has just taken over the job. It is never easy being coach of a team that has such a big following. It is still early days in his career as a coach. But he'll soon learn,\" Shastri said, while on commentary during the second Test in Pune.Coming to the match, New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first. Half-centuries from Devon Conway (76 in 141 balls, with 11 fours) and Rachin Ravindra (65 in 105 balls, with five fours and a six) placed Kiwis in a strong position at 197/3, with Ravichandran Ashwin (3/41) being the only one to have made some dents into the batting. Floodgates opened for wickets after Conway's dismissal, with comeback man Washington Sundar (7/59) getting the remaining wickets to get NZ to 259 all out.India was tasked to overcome this rather modest total and gain a sizeable lead. After skipper Rohit Sharma's dismissal for a duck, youngsters Shubman Gill (30 in 72 balls, with two fours and a six) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (30 in 60 balls, with four boundaries) tried forming a partnership. However, their effort was cut short at 49 runs. Just like the first innings, dismissal of a set Gill paved way for Mitchell Santner to run through the Indian line up. Santner (7/53) and Glenn Phillips (2/26) made Indian batters dance to their tunes on their own pitches, skittling them out for just 156 runs. Ravindra Jadeja top-scored with 38 in 46 balls, with three fours and two sixes.Kiwis got themselves in a commanding position in their second innings. Led by skipper Tom Latham's 86 in 133 balls, with 10 fours and some important contributions from Phillips (48 in 82 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes) and Tom Blundell (41 in 83 balls, with three fours), Kiwis increased their 103-run first inning lead to a lead of 358 runs, being skittled out for 255 after some fine bowling on first session of day three by spinners.Sundar (4/56) once again lead the bowling from the front, with Jadeja (3/72) and Ravichandran Ashwin (2/97) wiping the lower-middle order and tail.In the chase of 359, India got a fine start from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who stitched a valuable 62-run stand with Shubman Gill (23 in 31 balls, with four boundaries). However, after Jaiswal's dismissal for 77 in 65 balls, with nine fours and three sixes, India never recovered, falling a prey to Kiwi spinners and bundled out for 245, losing the test by 113 runs. With this India also registered its first home series loss in 12 years.Santner (6/104) was once again the star, taking 13 wickets in the match, with Phillips (two wickets) and Ajaz (one wicket) also offering some support to end the Test two days early.For Gautam Gambhir and India, the focus now turns to Mumbai and the iconic Wankhede Stadium, when they take on New Zealand in the third and final Test, where they will look to end the series on a high.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

With this match-winning display, Santner now ranks among the top match figures by a visiting bowler in India.Santner\u2019s remarkable 13/157 helped New Zealand secure a historic series victory, marking the first time since 2012 that India has lost a Test series at home.According to *Wisden*, in the second Test, Santner achieved his career\u2019s first five-wicket haul, claiming seven wickets in the first innings alone. It was the first time the Test veteran had taken more than three wickets in an innings, coming in his 29th Test match; his previous best was 3/34 against South Africa earlier this year.On a spin-friendly pitch, Santner\u2019s controlled pace and accuracy proved decisive. His first-innings haul of 7/53 dismantled India\u2019s batting order, and he maintained his dominance in the second innings with figures of 6/104, delivering 29 consecutive overs.India\u2019s chase, led by Yashasvi Jaiswal\u2019s quickfire 77 off 65 balls, fell 103 runs short as Santner\u2019s tight bowling and a crucial run-out of Rishabh Pant for a duck sealed New Zealand\u2019s victory.Santner\u2019s match figures of 13/157 place him third among visiting bowlers in India. England\u2019s Ian Botham took 13/106 in 1980, holding the second spot, while Santner\u2019s compatriot Ajaz Patel tops the list with 14/225 in 2021, which included a rare 10-wicket haul in an innings.Santner\u2019s figures are also the third-best by a New Zealand bowler in Test history, following Ajaz Patel\u2019s 14-wicket feat and Richard Hadlee\u2019s 15/123 against Australia in 1985-86. His performance cements his place among New Zealand\u2019s finest Test bowlers and adds another memorable chapter to their Test cricket history. (ANI)",

He also hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), claiming that the party is not fighting the election not through its workers but through its officials.\"BJP is fighting the elections not through its workers but through its officials. If any party starts fighting the elections with officials, then its defeat is certain...BJP can do anything, they can cross any limits,\" he said. Earlier on Saturday, the party's Maharashtra Chief Abu Azmi expressed concern that the party may face \"betrayal\" again like the previous two terms. Azmi added that he does not want the Maha Vikas Aghadi to break but he will make his decision within two days. He also said that if seats are not given to the party, it will have no option but to contest alone.Speaking to ANI, Azmi confirmed Akhilesh Yadav has given him complete authority to decide on the matter. \"The seats which I had been demanding are being announced. I think that we are going to face betrayal like the previous two terms. Looks like they don't want to give seats to the Samajwadi Party. I don't want the MVA to break and the votes to be divided but if they don't listen to us then we won't have an option but to contest alone. I have spoken to Akhilesh Yadav. He has given me complete authority,\" he said. Moreover, Congress released its third list of 16 candidates for the elections, with the party's total candidates coming up to 87.Congress has fielded Rana Dalipkumar Sanada from Khamgaon seat, Hemant Nanda Chimote from Melghat, Manohar Tulshiram Poreti from Gadchiroli, Manikrao Thakare from Digras as some of the nominees. Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole had said earlier that each alliance partner, namely Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar) will be contesting 85 seats each. As the polling date draws near, both the ruling Mahayuti alliance comprising the BJP alongside the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) and Ajit Pawar-led NCP and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) have intensified their preparations. The nomination process for the 288 seats in the assembly has started and the polling will happen on November 20 with the results to be declared on November 23. Except for the headline, the story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI.",

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team made history on Saturday when it won a Test series in India for the first time. To put things in perspective, it won a Test match for the first time in 38 years when it defeated India in the first Test at Bengaluru.\n\nThe margin of defeat (by eight wickets in the Bengaluru Test and b y 113 runs in the Pune Test) is proof of how dominant they were in outplaying India.\n\nFor India, it was its first Test series defeat at home in 12 years, snapping a record 18 consecutive home series wins. India has lost a Test series at home only four times since 2000. For New Zealand this is perhaps their best series win as even top teams like Australia and England struggle to beat India at home.\n\nIf it was Rachin Ravindra\u2019s heroics that won them the first Test, in the second it was Mitchell Santner\u2019s terrific bowling on a wearing pitch that won New Zealand the Test. He bowled an unchanged spell of 29 overs in the second innings.\n\nIndian collapse\n\nFor India it was their batters that let them down. No team can hope to win a Test after getting bowled out for a mere 46 runs on the first morning as it happened in Bengaluru.\n\nAt least in that Test India put up a fight in the second innings with Sarfaraz Khan getting his maiden Test century and stitching good partnerships with Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant.\n\nBatters fail to deliver\n\nBut in the second Test the batters simply didn\u2019t turn up. After conceding a 103 run-lead the writing was on the wall for India.\n\nThough they racked up 81 runs in just 12 overs till lunch, after that the collapse almost seemed inevitable.\n\nPreparing for a gruelling five-Test series in Australia starting next month, this series defeat could not have come at a worse time for India.\n\nIt also makes its path to the finals of the World Test Championships of 2026 more tricky. India now has to win four out of its next six Tests, if it has to make it to the finals without the \u2018help\u2019 of other teams.\n\nOf course, plenty of questions will be asked about Indian batting. It will be tempting to lay the blame on too much white ball cricket, but that is a reality that modern batters have to live with. But Indian batters surely have the experience and skill to switch between white and red ball cricket.\n\nNew Zealand cricketers are the perennial \u2018good guys\u2019 of international cricket, so perhaps India wouldn\u2019t mind losing to them as commentator Simon Doull mentioned. A loss against Australia, England or Pakistan would have hurt more.",

        "text": "TikTok diplomacy\n\nThe recent Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan highlights India\u2019s balancing act between diplomacy and defence along the LAC. While leaders discuss peace, the 2020 ban on TikTok remains a defining moment in India-China relations. This ban, triggered by border clashes, wasn\u2019t just about national security. It marked India\u2019s shift in digital geopolitics, creating a void that American tech giants swiftly filled. TikTok had become a platform for millions of Indian creators, and its absence opened opportunities for Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.\n\nThis \u201cTikTok Diplomacy\u201d underscores that today\u2019s battles aren\u2019t just at the borders \u2014 they\u2019re online. As India and China navigate peace talks, the digital front remains a key arena for influence.\n\nFood for thought\n\nA recent Finance Ministry post on social media platform \u2018X\u2019, on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s participation in the IMF Committee\u2019s \u201cRestricted Breakfast\u201d session, drew a lot of attention. The occasion in question was a \u201cDialogue on Policy Challenges\u201d at the IMF; this was in the course of Fund-Bank meetings in Washington.\n\nThe use of phrase \u2018Restricted Breakfast\u2019 kicked off speculation. Several hacks went wild with some even wondering whether some portion of the breakfast had been restricted. At this high-stakes session, Sitharaman joined global leaders to tackle policy challenges in a leaner format. It was later clarified that \u201crestricted\u201d did not refer to what\u2019s on the plate; in fact, the discussion was rich.\n\nSitharaman finally served a robust view on the need for gradual fiscal consolidation and strategic investments. Her message? Like the breakfast itself, global financing should be efficient and impactful. She called on Bretton Woods institutions to prioritise low-cost financing and de-risking strategies, echoing the session\u2019s theme of making every policy measure count. With India leading in growth, Sitharaman\u2019s words left policymakers with food for thought.\n\nIt is not always that everyone remembers one individual with so much love, respect and fondness. Ratan Tata is undeniably one. His passing away saw numerous tributes flowing in \u2014 from ordinary citizens and political leaders, to bureaucrats and business giants.\n\nAt various business forums and meetings, his contributions and philanthropic efforts were remembered. Also many events such as Hyundai\u2019s IPO roadshow and the National Conference of the Wind Energy Sector began with a moment of silence in his honour.\n\nAnthem controversy\n\nAt a recent function where Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi had participated, the word Dravida was left out while singing the National Anthem. The ruling DMK leaders went on a rampage blaming the Governor for this.\n\nOn Friday, the DMK was at the receiving end. At a meeting in which Deputy Chief Minister Udayanidhi Stalin had participated, the word \u2018Thirunadum\u2019 was omitted while singing the Tamil anthem. BJP sought an explanation from the DMK for the omission. Udayanidhi Stalin said, it was a \u2018technical\u2019 fault. This did not appease the BJP leaders.\n\nTamil Nadu Assembly elections in 2026 may see some fireworks if the massive crowd at actor-turned-politician Vijay\u2019s public meeting on Sunday is anything to go by. The election could see an interesting battle between two actor-turned-politicians \u2014 Udayanidhi Stalin and Vijay; the latter recently launched a new party \u2014 Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam. Vijay, who has a large fan base, even made a bold statement at TVK\u2019s inaugural conference at Vikravandi that the Dravidian concept had evolved significantly with the influence of cinema.",

Although it was a good time for the title to change hands, because Grace had held on to the title for over 250 days, this loss has caused a new set of speculations to arise. Jordynne Grace\u2019s contract with TNA is set to expire on January 2025, and it\u2019s believed that she\u2019ll be making a move to WWE once her contract with the promotion ends. Is Jordynne Grace moving to WWE in 2025?As of now, there\u2019s no confirmed information that she\u2019ll be moving to the Stamford-based promotion in 2025. However, this title loss comes at a very convenient time, and has fueled a speculation that she\u2019ll indeed be making a move to Paul Levesque\u2019s domain once her contract with TNA ends. Right now, both the promotions have an ongoing partnership, where wrestlers from the brands make an appearance across both promotions. While most WWE stars haven\u2019t directly appeared at TNA, stars from this promotion have made an appearance at NXT. Joe Hendry is one such example.\u2014 ThisIsTNA (@ThisIsTNA) Also read: The Miz expresses desire to challenge the 16-time World Champion during his 2025 retirement tour: \"We'll never see John Cena in a match ever again\"Former WWE Stars like Nic Nemeth (fka Dolph Ziggler) and the Hardy Boyz are currently a part of the TNA roster and are making a good name for themselves. Speaking of Jordynne Grace, she held her title almost a year, and solidified her position as an exceptional wrestler, who has a lot of potential. If she does indeed move to WWE, it\u2019ll be worth seeing how she fares against the current crop of wrestlers who are employed in the promotion. Alternatively, it could also be that the promotion wanted a fresh face for the championship, causing her to drop the title to Masha Slammovich. If this is the case and Grace does stay on with the promotion, then it\u2019s likely that the contract will be renewed once it expires in January next year. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this story unfolds because January is still two months away.

        "text": "Mohamed Salah rescued Liverpool as the Egypt star's late equaliser earned a pulsating 2-2 draw against title rivals Arsenal on Sunday. Arne Slot's side were on the brink of only their second defeat this season until Salah netted with nine minutes left at the Emirates Stadium. Liverpool had fallen behind to Bukayo Saka's early opener and, although Virgil van Dijk equalised, Mikel Merino put Arsenal back in front before half-time. Salah's eighth goal in 13 games in all competitions this season was aided by Arsenal's latest rash of injuries, with defenders Gabriel Magalhaes and Jurrien Timber both forced off in the second half. Manchester City were the real winners on Sunday as the draw in north London ensured they finished the weekend on top of the Premier League.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Unbeaten City, who beat Southampton 1-0 on Saturday, are one point ahead of second-placed Liverpool, with third-placed Arsenal sitting five points adrift of top spot.It was only the second time Liverpool had failed to win since Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp in the close-season, starting his Anfield reign with 12 victories from 13 games in all competitions.Even so, Liverpool will be happier with the point after showing impressive resolve to twice come from behind against a fellow title contender.Arsenal were left to lick their wounds after the defensive injuries that left them fatally exposed.They were already without Riccardo Calafiori, sidelined by an injury suffered against Shakhtar Donetsk in midweek, while William Saliba served a suspension following his dismissal in last weekend's loss at Bournemouth.Mikel Arteta's side have now gone two league games without a win, leaving them with only three victories in their last seven top-flight matches in a major setback to their hopes of a first title since 2004.Saka, back from two games out with injury, had given Arsenal the perfect start in the ninth minute.Ben White's sublime long pass sent Saka surging down the right flank before he deftly cut back into the Liverpool area, leaving Andrew Robertson trailing in his wake as he lashed a fierce close-range strike into the roof of the net.Merino nearly gifted Liverpool an immediate equaliser when he carelessly let the ball run to Salah, who rifled his shot just wide from the edge of the area.So often over the last two seasons, Arsenal have been dead ball masters thanks to their set-piece coach Nicolas Jover, but for once they were exposed as Liverpool drew level in the 18th minute.Luis Diaz beat Kai Havertz to flick on Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner and Van Dijk got in front of Thomas Partey as the Dutch defender stooped to head home from close-range.But Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces enabled them to regain the lead in the 43rd minute.Declan Rice's teasing free-kick arrowed into the Liverpool area and Merino was perfectly placed to thump his header past Caoimhin Kelleher from six yards.A lengthy VAR check followed to confirm Merino was just onside as the Spain midfielder celebrated his first goal since his close-season arrival from Real Sociedad.Arsenal keeper David Raya plunged to his right to keep out Alexis Mac Allister's header on the final seconds of a thrilling first half.Arteta's already makeshift defence suffered another blow when Gabriel limped off with a knee injury after a challenge from Darwin Nunez early in the second half.Without their first choice centre-back, Arsenal adopted a more cautious approach and Raya was booked for time-wasting with over 20 minutes to play.But the Gunners lost Timber to an injury in the closing stages as their defensive issues reached crisis point and handed Liverpool a lifeline.With just nine minutes left, Arsenal's under-manned rearguard was ruthlessly exposed as Alexander-Arnold's lofted pass sent Nunez clear of teenage substitute Myles Lewis-Skelly.Nunez slipped in the unmarked Salah and he slotted home as Arsenal slumped to the turf in frustration.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Hyderabad: The UP Yoddhas fought hard against a determined Gujarat Giants and registered an important win on Sunday evening at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, in Gachibowli, in Hyderabad in PKL Season 11. The UP Yoddhas won with the scoreline at 35-29. For the UP Yoddhas, Bharat finished with 13 points and Bhavani Rajput added 9 to the cause, while Rakesh stood out for the Gujarat Giants with 8 points to his name. LIVE MATCHThe Gujarat Giants made a strong start to the game with the likes of Guman Singh and Sombir, doing well in attack and defence. The UP Yoddhas, who were caught on the backfoot initially, started to fight back after conceding the lead in the initial minutes. For the UP Yoddhas, it was Bhavani Rajput, who was leading the charge in the early parts of the contest. Midway through the first half, the Gujarat Giants landed a Super Tackle through Jitender Yadav, but moments later, the UP Yoddhas got their noses out in front, picking up a 2-point lead. The Gujarat Giants clawed their way back into the contest and wiped out the deficit, but with minutes to go in the first half, Mahender Singh\u2019s tackle on the Rakesh resulted in an ALL OUT, which put the UP Yoddhas back in the box seat. At the half-time break, the UP Yoddhas went into the break with the score reading 19-17 in their favour. After the break, the UP Yoddhas had their eyes on keeping their lead in tact while. Meanwhile, the Gujarat Giants were trying their best to upset the opposition and wrestle back the momentum. For Gujarat Giants, it was Rakesh who was leading the charge yet again with the skipper Neeraj Kumar and Guman Singh providing ample support. However, as the contest reached the 30-minute mark, the UP Yoddhas had registered a 5-point lead and had some breathing space. In the final phase of the game, the two teams cranked up the intensity, especially the Gujarat Giants, who fought back to level things at 26-26. However, the UP Yoddhas had just about enough in the tank and sprinted across the finish line, eventually winning the contest by a 6-point margin.

        "title": "Heritage Buffs Retrace Landmarks of Nizami Hyderabad",
        "text": "HYDERABAD: Why are some dargahs painted green and others yellow? Why do the names of many places end with 'gunj'? Did our ancestors have a different outlook on death? And, did Hyderabad contribute to scientific developments? Exploring these questions, a group of heritage enthusiasts embarked on a 'map-walk' organised by Deccan Archive on Sunday, part of a series where participants explore unknown neighbourhoods in the Old City through century-old maps, discovering what has been lost and what remains. The walk began at Fateh Darwaza, one of the original gates to Hyderabad, which was established as a walled city. The group used meticulously detailed 'Munn maps', created by the Hyderabad Municipal Survey from 1912-15 under British engineer Leonard Munn. They were made as part of the redevelopment plan of the city, in the aftermath of the 1908 floods. The group explored burial grounds and Sufi shrines, learning about the four Sufi orders \u2014 Chishti, Suhrawardi, Qadri, and Naqshbandi \u2014 each identified by different colours. They visited the shrine of Baba Yahya Pasha, draped predominantly in yellow, with highlights of green. This shrine was flocked by devotees in large numbers as traditional medicines were administered here. The saint lived around the 1930s and was a patron of the last Nizam, Osman Ali Khan. After the death of the saint, the Nizam would come to offer sandalwood paste to his shrine annually on his Urs, or death anniversary. \u201cThe Urs celebrations of Sufi saints in the Deccan are unique. They draw large numbers of devotees, turning the event into a grand mela (fair). Offering yellow velvet cloth and sandalwood is typical of the Chishti Sufi order, which traces back to Khwaja Mohiuddin Chishti, who came from 'Chisht' province in Afghanistan and is buried in Ajmer,\u201d said Sibghatullah Khan, founder of Deccan Archives. Sibghatullah Khan also explained how Misrigunj got its name. \"The term 'gunj' means market, and 'Misri' means sugar, referencing a state-run sugar factory established by the Nizam, with products sold in this market,\" he said. The walk\u2019s highlight was the dargah of Hazrath Shah Raju Qatal Hussaini, a descendant of the famed Gulbarga Sufi Khwaja Banda Nawaz Gesudaraz. The shrine, marked by a towering dome and 25-foot-high granite columns, also holds a unique connection to science. Its dome was selected in the 1880s for the Great Indian Peninsular Trigonometrical Survey to document India\u2019s topography. The shrine\u2019s history connects deeply with the region\u2019s last independent Qutub Shahi ruler before Aurangzeb\u2019s conquest. Shah Raju Qatal\u2019s prophetic choice for the throne, a young boy sweeping the floors of the shrine who turned out to be of royal blood, foreshadowed his fate. The saint sent the king, Abul Hasan 'Tanashah', a pomegranate. With great difficulty, the feeble-bodied king had only 14 grains. The saint then predicted 14 years of rule followed by 14 years of exile. Just as Khwaja Shah Raju predicted, Abul Hasan's rule came to an end with Aurangzeb's conquest of Golconda and he spent the next 14 years in solitary confinement. Reflecting on how Sufis approached death, Sibghatullah Khan noted, \u201cSufi traditions often include preparing for one\u2019s death with rituals and decorations at chosen burial sites. They would invite others to pray at these places, demonstrating a fearless acceptance of death.\u201d This philosophy is seen in how Abul Hasan too, having lived all his life in a Sufi shrine, embodied some spiritual powers to be able to accurately predict the exact Friday of his passing \u2014 a continuation of the unique Sufi outlook on life and death.",

        "text": "Carlos Sainz cruised to an emotional victory for Ferrari ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris in Sunday's incident-filled Mexico City Grand Prix as Red Bull's series leader Max Verstappen was handed two 10-second penalties on his way to sixth. The stewards took a dim view of Verstappen's aggressive driving, the Red Bull driver twice forcing his title rival Norris off the track. Norris grabbed second from Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari near the finish as the Briton enjoyed a major boost in his quest to deny Verstappen a fourth consecutive world championship.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The McLaren driver cut 10 points off the gap to Verstappen which now stands at 47 with four race weekends remaining.Verstappen paid a heavy price for his show of ruthlessness with Norris commenting: \"I knew what to expect from Max. I respect him a lot as a driver and I expected it but it was not very clean driving in my opinion.\"It was a very tough race and I spent a lot of it just trying to avoid crashes.\" It was the second week in succession that the two title-chasers had clashed following a penalty for Norris at the United States Grand Prix.McLaren boss Zak Brown described this latest example of Verstappen's aggressive streak as \"ridiculous\".\"Enough is enough. Let's just have some good clean racing moving forwards. I think the stewards are on it, I think that's clear by the penalties that were given. The stewards did a good job this weekend.\"Asked about his drivers' crown prospects Norris said: \"I'm just keeping my head down, we're doing good job as a team, focus on ourselves, that's all I can do for now.\"Sainz meanwhile is ensuring he leaves Ferrari with his head held high as he switches next season to Williams to make way for seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton.\"Gracias Mexico!\" said a beaming Sainz. \"It is incredible to see this crowd. I have felt their support all week and it gave me a lot of strength - I said I wanted one more win with Ferrari and to do it here with this mega-crowd is incredible.\"It was Ferrari's first victory in Mexico since Alain Prost triumphed in 1990 - enabling them to move ahead of Red Bull in the constructors' championship - and Sainz's second win of the season and fourth of his career.Hamilton finished fourth ahead of his Mercedes team-mate George Russell.Kevin Magnussen finished behind Verstappen in seventh to deliver Haas's best result in Mexico ahead of Oscar Piastri in the second McLaren, who started from the back end of the grid, Nico Hulkenberg in the second Haas and Alpine's Pierre Gasly. Tsunoda outThe race began in a festive atmosphere with Verstappen winning the start from pole-sitter Sainz to lead the run to the first corner where RB's Yuki Tsunoda crashed out after making contact in the midfield squeeze.The race was yellow-flagged to retrieve the debris. Replays showed he collided with Alex Albon's Williams going into the braking zone. Albon retired. Verstappen accelerated as racing resumed on lap six with Sainz soon showing Ferrari's potential and then sweeping inside him to lead on lap nine at Turn One. The Dutchman fought but Sainz hung on and next time round on lap 10 Norris made a move at Turn Eight where Verstappen responded by forcing him wide and off-track. Norris handed the place back.\"I was ahead the whole way through the corner,\" said the Briton. \"This guy is dangerous. I have to avoid a crash. I'll end up in the wall.\" As they squabbled, Leclerc moved up to second while Norris tried again at Turn Four on the next lap only to be pushed off again.\"He overtook me off-track and pushed me off,\" said Norris.The stewards noted both incidents and then issued Verstappen with a 10-second penalty for fouling Norris. \"That's quite impressive,\" said a sarcastic Verstappen. Behind the leaders two-time former champion Fernando Alonso, in his record 400th Grand Prix weekend, pitted his Aston Martin and retired after 17 laps before a second stewards' penalty for Verstappen - a further 10 seconds for leaving the track and gaining an advantage. After a flurry of pit stops Verstappen climbed to sixth as Norris chased Leclerc, passing him for second on lap 63 when the Monegasque slid wide at the final corner.With five laps to go, Norris was seven seconds behind Sainz as Hamilton finally passed Russell for fourth, setting up a frantic finale.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Sergio Lobera\u2019s return to the island city culminated in a 1-1 draw between Mumbai City FC and Odisha FC at the Mumbai Football Arena in the Indian Super League on Sunday as goals by strikers Roy Krishna and Nikolaos Karelis resulted in both teams settling for a point each.\n\nThe game got off to a cracking start and wrapped up under similarly intensified circumstances, but the intermediate period was a slightly cagey affair with both sides engaging in a clash of tactical supremacy \u2013 refusing to concede an inch, stretching the opposition\u2019s defence wide, and creating chances aplenty but still managing to bring their defensive act together to keep the other team at bay.\n\nLobera was the happier of the two coaches at the onset of the game, with his frontline pressing forward and inflicting pressure on the Mumbai City FC defence. Their charge was led by Fijian forward Roy Krishna, spearheading by example and he reaped the rewards for the same in the 14th minute.\n\nAs the Islanders looked to build from the back, Valpuia played a lobbed pass to goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa. The custodian brought the ball down but was unable to keep control over the possession, and Krishna lapped upon the opportunity by sprinting ahead, getting the ball back and simply placing it into the back of the net to help the Juggernauts get ahead in the game.\n\nThe home team got their act back together almost immediately afterwards though. Their attacking unit began functioning in the trademark manner, with Lallianzuala Chhangte taking the ball ahead and squaring up passes at the centre for the striker or the onrushing midfielders. His interlinking with Karelis was a treat for the home fans, and one such move brought them the equaliser in the 23rd minute.\n\nChhangte, near the goal-line, pierced through the Odisha FC backline with a sharp delivery that was met perfectly by Karelis, who simply had to get his foot at the ball to help it land past Amrinder Singh and drag the Petr Kratky-coached team back in the game.\n\nFormer Mumbai City FC star Amrinder was sublime in the second half, first helping them deny Chhangte\u2019s slick effort in the 61st minute. Eight minutes later, PN Noufal and Jon Toral tested Amrinder\u2019s reflexes, catching the Odisha FC backline off-guard with their link up in the final third.\n\nToral had abundant space to strike the ball home but his shot was firmly saved by Amrinder, keeping Odisha FC\u2019s hopes afloat. Midfielder Ahmed Jahouh\u2019s sending off in the 80th minute presented a new challenge for the Juggernauts, but they held their nerves to see off the game without any hiccups and get a draw on the road.",

        "text": "London: Mohamed Salah rescued Liverpool as the Egypt star's late equaliser earned a pulsating 2-2 draw against title rivals Arsenal on Sunday. Arne Slot's side were on the brink of only their second defeat this season until Salah netted with nine minutes left at the Emirates Stadium. Liverpool had fallen behind to Bukayo Saka's early opener and, although Virgil van Dijk equalised, Mikel Merino put Arsenal back in front before half-time. Salah's eighth goal in 13 games in all competitions this season was aided by Arsenal's latest rash of injuries, with defenders Gabriel Magalhaes and Jurrien Timber both forced off in the second half. Manchester City were the real winners on Sunday as the draw in north London ensured they finished the weekend on top of the Premier League. Unbeaten City, who beat Southampton 1-0 on Saturday, are one point ahead of second-placed Liverpool, with third-placed Arsenal sitting five points adrift of top spot. It was only the second time Liverpool had failed to win since Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp in the close-season, starting his Anfield reign with 12 victories from 13 games in all competitions. Even so, Liverpool will be happier with the point after showing impressive resolve to twice come from behind against a fellow title contender. Arsenal were left to lick their wounds after the defensive injuries that left them fatally exposed. They were already without Riccardo Calafiori, sidelined by an injury suffered against Shakhtar Donetsk in midweek, while William Saliba served a suspension following his dismissal in last weekend's loss at Bournemouth. Mikel Arteta's side have now gone two league games without a win, leaving them with only three victories in their last seven top-flight matches in a major setback to their hopes of a first title since 2004.",

Arsenal regained the lead in the 43rd minute, with Mikel Merino unleashing a powerful header. Salah delivered a powerful equaliser in the 81st minute, with both sides sharing a point each. Liverpool is at the second place with seven wins, a loss and draw, giving them 22 points. Arsenal is in the third spot with 18 wins after five wins, three draws and a loss. Chelsea continued their up-and-down season, registering their fifth win of the season against Newcastle United by 2-1. Chelsea got a fine start, with Nicolas Jackson getting the first goal in the 18th minute as a brilliant pass from Cole Palmer reached Jackson, who wasted no time in giving The Blues a lead. The visitors levelled the scores in the 32nd minute, as Alexander Isak delivered a breakthrough strike which meant that the Magpies scored for the first time in three league games. At the half-time, score was 1-1.In the 47th minute, Palmer beat Nick Pope at his near post, registering his 17th Premier League goal at Stamford Bridge this year. Chelsea is at the fifth spot with five wins, two draws and losses, giving them 17 points. With three wins, losses, draws each and a total of 12 points, Newcastle is at 12th spot. Manchester United\u2019s poor season continued as they slid down to 14th spot after a 1-2 loss to West Ham United at The London Stadium. After Crysencio Summerville secured the lead for his side in the 74th minute, it seemed Casemiro had got his side one point at least with his strike in the 81st minute. However in the final moments, referee David Coote was sent to pitchside after a collision between Matthijs de Ligt and Danny Ings. The replays showed the United defender clipping the ball with his thigh before catching the Iggs on the lower leg. After a long review, it was decided that West Ham would get a penalty and Jarrod Bowen converted it. Man United has 11 points this season after three wins, two draws and four losses, while West Ham is one spot above with the same statistics.",

        "text": "London: Arsenal and Liverpool battled it out for a frustrating 2-2 draw at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. The result sees Manchester City attain the top spot in the Premier League table.\r\n\r\nIn what can only be described as a fiery encounter, Bukayo Saka, making his first appearance after suffering an injury during the October international break, did not take long to open the account on the night as he scored the opening goal nine minutes into the game.\r\n\r\nSaka was fed an over the top ball by Ben White which he cut back onto his left foot, completely bypassing Robertson in the process, and hit the back of the net.\r\n\r\nThe game was being played at a very high tempo and it did not take long for Liverpool to come back into the game. Trent Alexander Arnold\u2019s darting ball from the corner flag found Luis Diaz who nudged the ball onto a waiting Virgil Van Dijk who made no mistake in equalizing the game in the 18th minute.\r\n\r\nArsenal responded with a set piece of their own in the 43rd minute when Declan Rice\u2019s pinpoint cross found Mikel Merino who headed the Gunners into the lead. It was the Spaniard\u2019s first goal for the club since making the switch to North London in August and helped Arsenal take the 2-1 lead into half-time.\r\n\r\nDisaster struck for Mikel Arteta in the second-half as Arsenal\u2019s injury list grew even further. Gabriel Magalhaes suffered a knee injury and despite an effort to stay in the game had to be subbed off which will be a cause for concern given his importance to the side.\r\n\r\nWith the exit of Magalhaes, Liverpool grew into the match and started dominating possession. After repeated attempts, Arne Slot\u2019s side finally broke through in the 84th minute thanks to Salah\u2019s simple finish after the Egyptian was squared the ball by Darwin Nunez in a great position read outside the six-yard box.\r\n\r\nDespite a seven minute added period in regulation time, no winner availed and both teams had to settle for a point.",

        "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo, a legendary footballer with a global fan base, recently met a 24-year-old superfan named Gong, who cycled from China to Saudi Arabia for seven months to meet him. Starting from his home on March 18, Gong arrived at the Al Nassr Football Club on October 20, as the South China Morning Post reported.Throughout his journey, Gong cycled through several countries, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Iran, and Qatar, before reaching Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. After Ronaldo's team learned about Gong's extraordinary effort, they arranged a meeting outside the Al Nassr Football Club.During their encounter, Ronaldo signed Gong's shirt and posed for several photos with him. According to the South China Morning Post, Gong faced numerous challenges. He struggled with language barriers, budget-friendly meals in different countries, and the physical exhaustion of cycling such a vast distance.Gong's trip to Riyadh was inspired after Ronaldo had to cancel a planned visit to China in February due to a leg injury. Gong covered an impressive 13,000 kilometres on his bike, carrying essentials like two 60,000mAh power banks, a tent, cooking utensils, clothes, and other necessities. In places where food was costly, he relied on bread and used translation software to communicate with locals. In August, while in Armenia, he fell ill with a high fever and collapsed on the roadside, later receiving free hospital treatment.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Reflecting on the journey, Gong shared that the experience made him more mature and patient and helped him forge new friendships. After reaching Riyadh on October 10, he waited several days to meet Ronaldo, who was in Europe at the time. The Al Nassr FC staff assured him of a brief meeting, which finally happened after he saw Ronaldo play in an Al Nassr vs. Al Shabab match, thanks to a fan who offered him a ticket.When Gong met Ronaldo, the footballer shook his hand, hugged him, and signed his No. 7 Al Nassr jersey. Ronaldo also autographed a banner with the names of Gong's friends and inscribed the phrase, \"What I dream of is true love and freedom.\"In China, Ronaldo, or \"C Luo,\" is celebrated for his record-breaking career, boasting over 900 goals and being the most-followed individual on Instagram, with 640 million followers. Gong now plans to visit Portugal, Ronaldo's hometown, as his next adventure.",

        "text": "Chris Wood struck twice in Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at Leicester as the New Zealand striker condemned Foxes boss Steve Cooper to defeat against his former club on Friday. Ryan Yates put Forest ahead in the East Midlands derby at the King Power Stadium before Jamie Vardy levelled for Leicester. The in-form Wood restored Forest's lead and netted again with his seventh goal in nine matches this season. Forest' second successive victory lifted them into fifth place in the Premier League.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");They have lost just once in nine league games this term, proving their decision to sack Cooper and hire Nuno Espirito Santo was a shrewd move.Cooper was facing Forest for the first time since his dismissal in December.The 44-year-old spent two years in charge of Forest, guiding them from the bottom of the Championship back to the Premier League after a 23-year absence before being axed with the club just above the relegation zone.Nuno saved Forest from the drop, while Cooper was hired by promoted Leicester in the close-season to replace Enzo Maresca after the Italian's move to Chelsea.\"It's self-inflicted, no doubt about that, and it's on us. We all have to take responsibility for how the game panned out. We made poor mistakes for the goals,\" Cooper said.\"It's a setback after winning a few games coming into this. We have to accept it.\"Forest's first win at Leicester since 2013 was sweet viewing for Nuno, who had to watch from the press box as he served the second game of a suspension.\"Chris deserves his plaudits. He's done an amazing job. He's very honest and he gives everything on the pitch for us,\" Nuno said.\"It's not about the table. This group wants to progress and they want to make the fans enjoy. We see these players work every day and we demand from them.\"Forest ignited a dramatic first half in the 16th minute, seizing the lead thanks to a Leicester meltdown.Facundo Buonanotte dwelt on the ball too long instead of clearing the danger and Wood's deflected shot drew a woeful attempted clearance from James Justin.Yates pounced on the loose ball and curled his low strike into the bottom corner from 20 yards.Vardy keeps scoringLeicester's response was emphatic as Vardy dragged them back on level terms in the 23rd minute.Harry Winks whipped a teasing cross into the Forest six-yard box and Vardy got between two defenders to prod home from close-range in typically predatory fashion.Leicester keeper Mads Hermansen made a superb save to repel Nicolas Dominguez's close-range volley when the Forest midfielder looked certain to score.Hermansen made another fine stop to keep out Callum Hudson-Odoi's blast from the edge of the area.But the Dane was beaten again in the 47th minute when Wood deftly controlled Elliot Anderson's pass and swivelled to fire a fine finish into the bottom corner from 12 yards.Leicester appealed in vain for a penalty after Vardy threw himself to the ground following a brief tug from Nikola Milenkovic.That proved a crucial moment as Wood punished woeful defending to net again on the hour.A long punt from Forest keeper Matz Sels should have been dealt with by Leicester's Wout Faes but the Belgian allowed the ball to bounce past him and Wood looped a close-range header over Hermansen.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Even full balls were difficult to hit out as Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel discovered with catches in the deep. To apply the finishing touches to a dream third innings, Glenn Phillips hit two sixes in a last-wicket partnership to take the lead past 350.The day didn't start well for India as they went to the experienced pair of spinners. The first ball from Ashwin produced an edge that Rohit Sharma didn't go for. Tom Blundell and Phillips added a quick 33 to the overnight score before Jadeja found his first wicket of the match, a natural variation that went past Blundell's inside edge.Santner thought he had a half-volley he could hit for a six, but the pitch played its tricks and the toe-end of the bat could only send it as far as long-on. Ashwin produced an edge from Tim Southee, which Rohit accepted this time.In a chaotic finish to the innings, Ashwin was denied a wicket as India failed to review, but Ajaz's slog-sweep in the next over ended up in a superb catch at deep midwicket. Washington Sundar ran to his right and stuck out his long arms, but this only meant his chances of taking a second five-for in the match were evaporating. He was not done for the match, though. Don't be surprised if he is promoted in the batting order.The last wicket was lazy play from both Washington and William O'Rourke. Phillips, having hit two sixes, was looking to manipulate strike and caught Washington napping at deep cover. The non-existent second now looked on, and O'Rourke took it casually, not expecting a throw at his end. Jadeja showed quick thinking by deflecting the throw onto the stumps even as he was expressing displeasure with Washington.\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "Former cricketer Nasser Hussain believes England captain Ben Stokes is in a need of \u201cbit of help\u201d as the visitors stare towards an unprecedented series defeat against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. Legspinner Rehan Ahmed ensured England\u2019s surge with a three-wicket burst just before the stroke of lunch. The late effort from Rehan raised hopes of England taking a sizeable lead. But Pakistan\u2019s tail-end came to hurt England in their exploits, with the experienced spin duo Noman Ali and Sajid Khan wreaking havoc with the bat. Noman\u2019s 45 and Sajid\u2019s 48* rubbed salt on England\u2019s fresh wounds before eventually bowling them out on 344. \u201cEngland\u2019s struggles against the tail repeated themselves. It\u2019s not just today or in this series, but in the last two or three years, they have struggled to get through tail-enders. Even when England have had pace, I think they\u2019ve slightly lost the plot and gone just for a bouncer ploy. I\u2019m not talking about here [in Rawalpindi] in these conditions, but even when they\u2019ve had Mark Wood,\u201d Hussain said as quoted from Sky Sports. With their precise line and lengths, England had forced Pakistan\u2019s back against the wall by reducing them to 155/6. However, from that point, England lost the plot, which allowed the hosts to mount a comeback. \u201cSometimes they will bowl beautifully to the top order, and then, as soon as the tail-enders comes in, it\u2019s bouncers right away, and they get hit everywhere. They do lose the plot a little bit. Stokes maybe puts so much energy into his captaincy, into the week of captaincy, he may just need a bit of help when England are seven or eight down,\u201d Hussain added. After taking lunch, Rehan, who had been on a roll, didn\u2019t bowl a single over for the first eight overs. By the time he got the ball in his hand, Pakistan had already raced away from England\u2019s grasp. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many senior bowlers around in this side, he may just need someone to drag him to one side and explain his reasoning. I was amazed Rehan Ahmed didn\u2019t start after lunch. A wrist spinner who\u2019d just got three-for before lunch. I\u2019d have gone with the wrist spinner against the lower order,\u201d Hussain added. (ANI)",

        "title": "BruntWork shares takeaways from Mayer Brown's 16th Annual Outsourcing Conference",
        "text": "The event focused on the latest changes in outsourcing contracts, the role of strong governance, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI). BruntWork, an up-and-coming company in outsourcing, shared its thoughts on how these developments will shape the future of work. Outsourcing Contracts Take on a New Form The event started with discussions on how outsourcing contracts now focus on flexibility and mutual gains, emphasizing the need to hire a marketing assistant for more agile operations. Brad Peterson, head of Mayer Brown's global technology transactions team, pointed out that modern agreements have moved beyond cost-cutting to prioritize long-term collaboration. BruntWork\u2019s CEO Winston Ong agreed, saying, \"Rigid contracts don\u2019t benefit clients nowadays. We\u2019ve succeeded by forming partnerships focusing on adaptability and common goals.\" The firm builds lasting relationships rather than treating deals as purely transactional. The outsourcing industry has matured, and both clients and providers now value collaboration. BruntWork supports this by fostering openness and flexibility in its services, resulting in high client retention and steady growth. Companies now look for partners who bring advancement and operational value, and BruntWork\u2019s teams\u2014 virtual assistants for sales, personal virtual assistants, and digital marketers\u2014are ready to deliver. Governance That Promotes Growth Governance models that blend stability with fresh ideas became another important topic at the conference. Speakers emphasized the need for structures that handle market disruptions while allowing room for new thinking. With global uncertainties affecting businesses, the timing of this discussion felt right. BruntWork adopts governance practices that allow both flexibility and creativity to thrive. Ong explains, \"Governance involves creating a space where innovation can flourish, even during tough times.\" BruntWork operates using a remote-first model, tapping into a global workforce. This strategy keeps operations running smoothly, even when unexpected events disrupt traditional office environments. The company\u2019s experience in logistics outsourcing has proven invaluable during crises, as their remote teams continue to make sure clients\u2019 operations stay on track, regardless of external challenges. The firm also emphasizes learning and development for its staff. Continuous growth helps its team stay ready to meet client demands and offer the latest outsourcing solutions. AI Regulations and the Future AI regulations sparked significant discussion, particularly as lawmakers worldwide develop the EU\u2019s upcoming AI Act and other similar laws. Mayer Brown\u2019s partners, Ana Bruder and Arsen Kourinian, led a session that explored how these regulations will influence outsourcing, especially regarding data privacy and transparency in algorithms. BruntWork is preparing for these changes, knowing that companies that are ahead of AI regulations will gain a significant edge. Ong remarks, \"We make sure our AI services comply with current laws and are built to adapt to future ones. This keeps us as a reliable partner in a fast-changing legal world.\" To stay ahead, BruntWork has set up data governance systems and ethical AI practices, particularly for its social media virtual assistant solutions. Focusing on compliance and forward-thinking strategies allows the company to help clients reduce risks while taking advantage of AI opportunities. With outsourcing continuing to advance, conferences like Mayer Brown\u2019s provide valuable insights for service providers and clients. BruntWork's message is simple: embrace new technology, stay adaptable, and build strong partnerships. Its focus on governance, AI readiness, and flexible contracts makes it a leader in the next phase of outsourcing, where technology and human talent combine to create value for businesses worldwide.

        "title": "Suarez, Alba Give Inter Miami Winning Start in MLS Cup Playoffs",
        "text": "Fort Lauderdale: Jordi Alba struck a 60th minute winner as Inter Miami began their first MLS Cup playoff campaign of their Lionel Messi era with a 2-1 win over Atlanta United on Friday. Miami could book their place in the Eastern Conference semi-finals if they can win game two of the best-of-three series in Atlanta on November 2 but after a tight game they will be wary of the task that awaits in Georgia. Inter, the top seed and favourites in the playoffs, made an electric start to the game with Luis Suarez firing them ahead in the second minute when his former Barcelona team-mate Alba found Diego Gomez and the Paraguayan slipped the ball to Suarez who made no mistake from close range. Atlanta qualified through a wildcard game in Montreal on Tuesday and they were slow out of the blocks as Miami dominated possession and gave visiting keeper Brad Guzan a busy opening half. Alba fed Messi, whose sweetly struck, first-time shot forced the 40-year-old keeper into a fine, diving save. Atlanta suffered a blow when right winger Brooks Lennon had to go off in the 21st minute and five minutes later Messi threatened again with his effort from 25-yards forcing another save from the outstanding Guzan. A minute later, Miami should have doubled their lead from a corner but David Martinez headed against the post with the goal at his mercy. Messi then hit the post with an attempt to beat Guzan at his near post and a thundering follow-up shot from Marcelo Weigandt had the former Aston Villa keeper at full stretch. Atlanta's problems continued with defender Stian Gregersen forced off with a muscle injury but just when it seemed everything was conspiring against them they got back on level terms in the 39th minute. Pedro Amador played a clever little pass to find Georgia winger Saba Lobzhanidze inside the box and his first-time, left-foot shot flashed into the far bottom corner. The visitors then had a glorious chance to go in with a lead at the break when Russian Alexey Miranchuk carved out a lovely ball through to Jamal Thiare but his shot lacked composure and was well wide. The unique format of the first round of MLS's playoff, which go straight to penalties if the games are level after 90 minutes, would have given Atlanta hope that they could pull off an upset. But their determined efforts were undone on the hour when they fell asleep at a Miami corner -- after a short-corner Messi played the ball across to Alba, who was left in acres of space outside the box.Rare qualityThe Spanish full-back gratefully accepted the invitation and unleashed a fierce drive from 25-yards out which flew past the helpless Guzan. Messi had a chance to get on the scoresheet in stoppage time but he was denied by Guzan, rolling back the years, who raced out quickly to smother the shot. Miami coach Gerardo Martino said Alba's goal was a reminder of his class as an attacking full-back. \"It's not easy to find full-backs who are so involved in attacking play. You'd have to go back to Dani Alves, Cafu, Marcelo, Roberto Carlos.... that's the level,\" he said. \"He has a technical quality that is very rare to see in a full-back and this is enhanced by the understanding he has with Luis and Leo. It's difficult to find a player in his position who is so decisive,\" added the former Barcelona coach. Martino also had a word for former US international Guzan. \"If it wasn't for Brad's performance, we would have ended up with a few more,\" said the Argentine coach, who won the MLS title during his time with Atlanta.",

        "text": "Fort Lauderdale, Fla: Lionel Messi's every move was on display in his Major League Soccer playoff debut. Every touch. Every shot attempt. Even when he wasn't doing anything at all, it was shown. There was a Messi-cam focused on the Inter Miami superstar throughout his team's playoff-opening, 2-1 win over Atlanta United on Friday night. Nothing but the eight-time Ballon dOr winner livestreamed on MLS' TikTok account for the duration of the match. It captured the excitement surrounding Inter Miami, which surged in popularity when Messi arrived midway through the 2023 season. The stadium was packed with Messi fans and familiar faces, including Miami Dolphins wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. , former NFL player Chad Ochocinco Johnson and actor Idris Elba. The Messi effect has been awesome. It's been very awesome, Johnson said in a televised interview . From a global aspect, having Messi here in the States and being able to grow the game as much as we've been trying to grow the game and make it more popular here, being that we have so many different sports. ... Especially for me, not having to travel to Spain anymore to watch him play has been a joy. Messi didnt score but assisted on Jordi Albas go-ahead goal in the 60th minute. He had several chances that were denied by Atlanta goalkeeper Brad Guzan, who had five saves on Messi Friday night. Inter Miami is the No. 1 seed in the playoffs after setting MLS records for points (74) and winning percentage (.765). Messi, coming off a hat trick in the regular-season finale, is in contention for league MVP despite missing nearly half the MLS season because of injury and commitments to Argentina's national team. He finished with 20 goals and 16 assists. Luis Suarez also scored 20 goals, joining Messi to become the first pair of MLS teammates to reach that milestone in a season. The 37-year-old smiled and hugged his teammates when Suarez scored the opening goal less than two minutes into the match. He was shown blowing past a defender and with one swift touch firing a strike from outside the box, which Guzan pushed over the crossbar, and later placing both hands on his head and looking up into the stands when Guzan denied him again. Fans stood for most of the first half. And those closest to the pitch leaned forward with their phones stretched up as far as their arms would allow to capture photos and video of Messi when he got close.",

He was caught by Mitchell Santner at the hands of Will Young. Now the expectations of the Indian team will be very high from Jaiswal because if he plays big innings then this target can be easy for the team. Jaiswal (Yashasvi Jaiswal) made an exciting start by hitting a six and a four against Tim Southee in the first over itself.\n\nIndia would like Jaiswal and Gill to keep the pressure on the Kiwi bowlers for a long time because India still needs 278 runs to register a win and save the series. At present, Yashasvi Jaiswal is unbeaten on 46 runs and Shubhman Gill is unbeaten on 22 runs. Earlier, the New Zealand team could add only 57 runs to yesterday\u2019s lead of 301 runs and were out for 255 runs after losing their last five wickets in the first hour of the third day.\n\nThe New Zealand team scored 255 runs in the fourth innings, thanks to the contribution of 86 runs by captain Tom Latham. Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell scored 41 runs on 83 balls and Glenn Phillips also scored 48 runs on 82 balls on a pitch favorable for spinners.

The 2-1 win, Pakistan's first at home against England since 2000, was set up by starring performances from unlikely heroes Sajid Khan and Noman Ali.\n\nThe spin duo were brought back mid-series to replace under-performing players and took 39 of the possible 40 wickets across the final two Tests. Their impactful displays helped Pakistan complete a stunning turnaround from 1-0 down.\n\nIn a cryptic tweet after the series concluded, Hafeez praised Sajid and Noman for \u201cexposing many faces\u201d with their star showings. While not explicitly stated, the message appeared to take a subtle shot at selections and in-form players.\n\nSome fans speculated Hafeez was referring to current captain Babar Azam's dropped after the first Test defeat. Babar's selection and form have been topics of debate in Pakistan of late. Hafeez's wording kept his intended target ambiguous but suggested underlying criticism.\n\nAs a former team director and interim coach, Hafeez would have insight into the national set-up. His post-series tweet added an intriguing sideplot to Pakistan's triumph. Sajid and Noman's match-winning 39 wickets highlighted the value of flexibility and choosing form over reputations.\n\nTheir rise reinforced the adage that success has many fathers while failure is an orphan.

Noman Ali 6-42, and Sajid Khan, who took 4-69, exposed England\u2019s vulnerability on a turning track.\n\nThe total marked England\u2019s lowest-ever in Pakistan and underscored the dominance of the hosts\u2019 spin attack.

        "text": "New Zealand stand three runs shy of clinching a historic series win over India on Day 3 of the second Test in Pune on Saturday. Both teams went for Tea after India were reeling at 178/7 with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja unbeaten with scores of 9(10) and 4(13), respectively. With the first Test series defeat at home on the cards for India under head coach Gautam Gambhir, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill continued to keep the hopes of rewriting the history book alive by completing the mounting 359-run chase against the Kiwis. But once again it was Mitchell Santner who haunted India\u2019s batters with his sheer accuracy to take New Zealand closer to victory. Gill (23) walked back pretty early in the session and Jaiswal (77) edged one to Daryl Mitchell. Washington Sundar was promoted up in the order to join stalwart Virat Kohli at the crease. The duo adopted a defensive approach, which allowed New Zealand bowlers to keep the flow of play in check. Mitchell Santner trapped Kohli (17) in front of the stumps with an arm ball and Rishabh Pant ran himself out to further increase India\u2019s woes. Sarfaraz Khan failed to deal with a ball that spun away from his bat and crashed into the stumps. Sundar was forced to return to the dressing room after Will Young took a sharp catch. Earlier in the match, on the opening hour of Day 3, Ravindra Jadeja was the architect behind New Zealand\u2019s downfall, making short work of their tail end. After restricting the Kiwis to 255, Jaiswal and skipper Rohit Sharma arrived on the field loaded with ammunition. Mitchell Santner turned up the ante after Tim Southee and William O\u2019Rourke lost their attacking edge with the new ball. Santner entered the fray to enforce a breakthrough as Jaiswal started to open his arms. Rohit tried to have a go against Santner but failed in his exploits. He took a step forward while trying to negate Santner\u2019s delivery but ended up edging the ball straight to Will Young. As silence started to overtake a jubilant crowd in Pune, Gill arrived at the crease to inject a new life into India\u2019s dying chase. The \u2018Gamball\u2019 took over New Zealand\u2019s cut-throat bowling attack, with Gill and Jaiswal having no mercy to spare en route to scripting history. In the past 26 instances, India have only once managed to chase down a 300-plus total. The victory dates back to 2008 when India faced England in Chennai. Out of the 26 instances, India has lost on 14 occasions. The flurry of boundaries eclipsed the hopes of losing the series and served as a reminder of what India is capable of pulling off, even in the direst of situations. Jaiswal\u2019s inside-out, movement of feet and traditional drives were a sight to behold, while Gill, with his sweeps, outmanoeuvred New Zealand\u2019s spin threat.Brief Score: New Zealand 259 & 255 (Tom Latham 86, Glenn Phillips 48*; Washington Sunda 4-56) vs India 156 & 178/7 (Yashasvi Jaiswal 77, Shubman Gill 23; Mitchell Santner 5-72).

Pakistan chased down the modest target of 36 runs in just 19 balls, sealing a nine-wicket victory.\n\n\u201cThe national players won by playing the best game. Sajid Khan and Nauman Ali proved their skills by bowling brilliantly. Saud Shakeel scored a century and showed excellent batting. The team put up a brilliant performance and won the Test series,\u201d said PCB President Mohsin Naqvi in a statement released Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis win will boost the morale of the players. The players along with the nation were waiting for such a glorious victory. The new players justified their inclusion in the team with performances,\u201d it further added.\n\nThe hosts lost the first game by an innings and 47 runs in Multan. It was their sixth consecutive loss under Shan Masood\u2019s leadership, and they had not won at home since February 2021, including a 0-3 crushing series loss against England during their previous visit in late 2022.\n\nThe triumph, which is Masood\u2019s first series win as captain, is particularly impressive given Pakistan\u2019s decision to shake up their squad, benching Babar Azam, Naseem Shah, and Shaheen Afridi, and instead bringing in Sajid and Noman. The strategic shift to dry turning pitches proved crucial in unleashing their spinners, and the sin duo dominated throughout the series, capturing 39 of the 40 English wickets.\n\nThis decisive turnaround for Pakistan came after a rough patch of six consecutive Test losses and an 11-match winless streak at home. This was also the first time Pakistan\u2019s pace bowlers did not bowl a single ball in a Test.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Four innings, four batting collapses. India have rarely witnessed such a dismal batting display on home soil. Bowled out for 46 in the first innings in Bengaluru, they slipped from 408/3 to 462 all out in the second.Then came the first innings of the second Test, where they managed just 156. And just when it seemed like the hosts might have overcome their struggles, another collapse followed.As it happenedIn their pursuit of 359, the hosts crumbled from 96/1 to 245 all out, yet another batting failure. India's unbeaten streak of 18 home series came to a disappointing end on the third day of the second Test against New Zealand. With a 113-run victory, New Zealand secured their first Test series victory against India on Indian soil. The Kiwis had earlier won the first Test in Bengaluru by 8 wickets. The third and final Test of the series will take place at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, starting on November 1.\u2014 BCCI (@BCCI) This was India's first home Test series loss since December 2012, when Alastair Cook's England beat them 2-1 in a four-match series.Mitchell Santner's exceptional bowling played a crucial role in New Zealand's success, as he consistently troubled the Indian batsmen throughout the match. His ability to extract turn and bounce from the surface made him a constant threat.His outstanding performance, which included a match haul of 7/53 and 6/104, highlighted the vulnerabilities of the Indian batting lineup on the turning track.Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (77 off 65) gave India a blazing start in their chase, taking on the Kiwi attack with confidence and aggression. He shared a 62-run partnership for the second wicket with Shubman Gill (23 off 31), who was squared up by Santner and edged to first slip. Soon after, Jaiswal, the standout performer, also edged one to first slip.Virat Kohli (17), whose dismissal in the first innings became a huge talking point, faltered again and couldn't offer much resistance despite starting strong with a backfoot flick for four.Santner continued to chip away as the pitch played into his hands, with some balls turning away from the bat and others holding their line, all pitched in consistent areas. Jaiswal, who was earlier beaten by the left-arm spinner, couldn't reach the pitch of the ball and edged to Daryl Mitchell at slip.India's woes deepened when Rishabh Pant (0) was run out after a miscommunication with Kohli. Sarfaraz Khan then fell to a ball that turned sharply, crashing into his off-stump as his bat jarred into the ground in defense.Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin delayed the inevitable with a 39-run stand for the eighth wicket, but Mitchell Santner struck again, claiming Ashwin for his sixth wicket.Ajaz Patel then contributed with a couple of wickets as India were bowled out for 245.",

Airport authorities clarified that it was due to the long float of the flight into the runway caused by crosswinds.The flight touched down at the main runway beyond the threshold point. The alert pilot, realising the flight might not have enough runway space to slow down, decided to take off immediately. However, nothing untoward happened to the passengers in the incident.The flight (6E265) from Jaipur usually reaches Chennai at 1.05 pm. On Saturday, it arrived a little earlier and was about to land at 12.45pm. However, due to crosswinds, the pilot could not touch down at the start of the runway, and the flight floated in and touched the middle of the runway. The flight took off immediately, went around and landed again at 12.58 pm. 114621271Airport authorities have said only when the flight lands at the threshold point will the pilot have enough runway time to slow down the flight and taxi it to the parking bay.",

        "text": "Legendary Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh shared his insights on Chennai Super Kings\u2019 potential retention strategy for the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season.In an exclusive interview with Star Sports, Singh stated, \u201cI\u2019m not certain if Dhoni will play or not, but if he\u2019s available, he would undoubtedly be the team\u2019s first retention choice, even if he\u2019s considered an uncapped player this season.\u201dHe added that, following Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja and Rachin Ravindra would be crucial retentions, with captain Ruturaj Gaikwad also an obvious choice.Australian cricket legend Tom Moody, speaking exclusively to Star Sports about the Sunrisers Hyderabad\u2019s potential IPL retentions, outlined SRH\u2019s retention strategy and identified players he believes should be prioritised ahead of the IPL auctions.Moody commented, \u201cWhen I look at SRH, they\u2019ve got one of the tougher tasks among franchises during this retention period. At the top, I\u2019d look to secure captain Pat Cummins, followed by Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma. I\u2019d extend it even further, which would be costly, but retaining a player of Heinrich Klaasen\u2019s calibre is worth it. Then there\u2019s Nitish Reddy, who has recently been capped, and I believe it\u2019s essential they lock him in before he enters the auction. Among uncapped players, I\u2019d definitely consider Abdul Samad, who is a rare talent. He\u2019s a powerful hitter capable of transforming the game in the middle order.\u201dHe continued, \u201cI believe these four players will be retained. Besides them, we could also see Pathirana, an excellent bowler, remain in the squad. If an uncapped player is retained, there could be a surprise choice, though it\u2019s possible CSK will retain only five players. In my view, the likely retentions are Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Rachin Ravindra, Ruturaj Gaikwad, and Pathirana.\u201d (ANI)",

After Conway\u2019s dismissal, Washington Sundar (7/59) exploited the momentum, dismissing the remaining batsmen to bowl New Zealand out for 259.India faced the task of overcoming this modest total to gain a substantial lead.

This series defeat marks a significant low for India, with three losses at home this year\u2013two against New Zealand and one against England. This is the third time in history that India has experienced three home defeats in a calendar year, following four losses in 1969 (three to Australia and one to New Zealand) and three losses in 1983 against the West Indies.This defeat also adds to Rohit Sharma\u2019s captaincy woes, as it marks his fourth loss in 15 home Tests, matching the record of Kapil Dev and Mohammad Azharuddin, both of whom faced four home defeats in 20 matches. The only Indian captain with a higher number of home losses is MAK Pataudi, who recorded nine defeats in 27 Tests.Mitchell Santner played a crucial role in New Zealand\u2019s victory, taking 13 wickets for 157 runs in the second Test. His performance is now among the best in history, ranking as the third-best match figures for a New Zealand bowler, the third-best for any team against India, and the third-best for any visiting bowler in India. Santner\u2019s standout performance was pivotal in New Zealand\u2019s success and has solidified his place in the record books.New Zealand\u2019s victory also places them in a select group of visiting teams that have managed to win a Test series in India. Historically, only five teams have achieved this feat, England (five times, last in 2012/13), West Indies (five times, last in 1983/84), Australia (four times, last in 2004/05), Pakistan (1986/87), and South Africa (1999/00). With this series win, New Zealand becomes the latest team to join this elite group.The loss signifies the end of India\u2019s remarkable record of 18 consecutive bilateral home series victories, which stood as the longest such sequence for any team. As Indian cricket faces a period of reflection and adjustment, the team will need to address its shortcomings, particularly in handling spin-friendly conditions, as they prepare for future challenges ahead.

        "text": "Chennai: Veteran investor Jim Rogers finds that the bull-run in gold and silver will continue for next two-three years amidst rising global debt and geopolitical turmoil. He wants investors to remain cautious of the US dollar and warns that the meltdown of overheated equity markets is a closer reality.\u201cDo not sell your gold and silver now. The bull-run is not over yet. It will move up for next two-three years as the globe is facing many problems, including mounting debt and tensions,\u201d Rogers, who co-founded Quantum Fund along with George Soros, told Financial Chronicle over the phone from Singapore.According to him, the tensions between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Iran and involvement of larger players in the turmoil can drive commodity prices up. If the tensions continue and escalate, oil, gold and silver prices can rise further up to unimagined levels. As for oil, a level of $150 per barrel cannot be dismissed.Even otherwise, the world is staring at a large crisis of mounting debt. \u201cThe US is now a debt nation. Countries have been printing more money to boost the economy. That is what they do to keep the jobs growing,\u201d he said.\u201cInvestors have been flocking towards the US dollar considering it as a safe haven amidst the turmoil. With the rising debt, the dollar is not safe and I plan to sell off my dollar in a few weeks. Even central banks of emerging markets have been going light on their dollar reserves due to the heavy debt and instead buying gold,\u201d he said.Rogers prefers to buy silver at this point of time. \u201cI own gold as well as silver. Gold is at an all-time high level, but silver is yet to return to that level,\u201d he said. He is not keen on cryptocurrencies as he finds that they are just \u2018trading vehicles\u2019 unlike gold and silver which have a \u2018real purpose\u2019.He also wants investors to be cautious of equity markets. \u201cEquity markets are at or near all-time high levels. Too many people are investing too much money into stock markets. Equities are trading at very high valuations. It is a sign of markets getting closer to the end,\u201d he said. He finds that the meltdown of equity markets is a closer reality.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: The State Cabinet on Saturday approved the Hyderabad Metro Rail Phase-2 project, a significant expansion aimed at addressing connectivity needs across the city. The project, estimated to cost \u20b924,200 crore, will span 76.4 kilometres and cover the five major corridors of Nagole-Shamshabad, Raidurg-Kokapet, MGBS-Chandrayangutta, Miyapur-Patancheru, and LB Nagar-Hayathnagar.The Cabinet meeting, headed by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, approved the detailed project report (DPR) for Phase-2, with plans to execute the project through a public-private partnership (PPP) model in collaboration with the Centre.The DPR will be referred to the Centre for final approval. This Cabinet meeting, which lasted over five-and-a-half hours, was marked by multiple decisions with far-reaching impacts for the state\u2019s infrastructure, welfare, and administrative landscape.The Cabinet also decided to clear one pending DA instalment for employees and pensioners, out of five which are pending, and to resolve the problems of employees and unemployed on account of controversial GOs 317 and 46 issued by previous BRS government. A special resolution will be brought before the Legislative Assembly to resolve legal matters tied to these GOs.The Cabinet cleared the sanctioning of 3,500 Indiramma houses to every Assembly constituency as a Diwali gift to the poor and homeless. Allotment letters will be distributed to beneficiaries on November 2.Briefing the media on the Cabinet decisions, information minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy said that gram sabhas and ward sabhas would be held across local governments to ensure transparent selection of beneficiaries,The Cabinet decided that the caste census would be completed before November 30.

BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar noted that each enumerator would cover approximately 150 households.The Cabinet gave the nod for a comprehensive \u20b928,000 crore initiative to construct new roads and repair existing ones across villages, municipalities, and state highways over four years. The project will be executed in a phased manner through the PPP model, with particular emphasis on connecting rural areas to district and state hubs through double and four-lane roads.The Cabinet approved the relocation of the Osmania General Hospital to the Police Grounds in Goshamahal, a 32-acre site chosen to meet the hospital\u2019s growing needs.

The decision includes a ban on defaulters who fail to return rice stocks post-milling. Mills in compliance will be allowed to mill paddy stocks with bank guarantees as security.Srinivas Reddy dismissed reports that the Cabinet had approved allotment of land to actor and TD MLA Nandamuri Balakrishna for setting up a film studio in Hyderabad. Srinivas Reddy said no such proposal was discussed in the Cabinet meeting.",

        "text": "Erling Haaland fired Manchester City to the top of the Premier League as the striker sealed a 1-0 win against Southampton, while third-placed Aston Villa were frustrated by Bournemouth's last-gasp leveller on Saturday. Haaland had gone three league games without a goal but he ended that mini drought in the first half at the Etihad Stadium. That was enough to lift Pep Guardiola's side into first place, two points ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who can regain pole position if they win Sunday's blockbuster clash with title rivals Arsenal.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");City have not lost a league game at the Etihad for two years, a run encompassing 35 games, and bottom-of-the-table Southampton, who have only one point from nine games this season, were never likely to shatter that impressive streak.With Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku ruled out, Guardiola made four changes to the team that thrashed Sparta Prague in the Champions League on Wednesday.Haaland had scored an audacious goal against Sparta and while his effort to kill off Southampton was more prosaic, it was arguably far more valuable given the context of a tense title race.Matheus Nunes' cross reached Haaland in the fifth minute and the Norwegian showed strength and desire to get to the ball ahead of his marker for a close-range strike.City spurned several chances to increase their lead but Haaland's 14th goal in all competitions this season gave the unbeaten champions seven wins from nine league matches as they chase a fifth successive title.\"The way Southampton played, they are so demanding. Big credit to them, it was not because we were sloppy or flat. I don't have that feeling,\" Guardiola said.\"We created chances and unfortunately couldn't score the second. I think we were there and sometimes they are good. We have to accept that.\"Aston Villa's hopes of pushing for the title suffered a setback as Bournemouth snatched a 1-1 draw at Villa Park.Villa are unbeaten in the Champions League, sitting top of the table after seeing off Young Boys, Bayern Munich and Bologna.But they couldn't follow their latest European success with a domestic victory despite taking the lead in the 76th minute.Ian Maatsen crossed and Leon Bailey teed up Ross Barkley to hook in his first goal for the club.But Evanilson rescued Bournemouth with a headed equaliser six minutes into stoppage-time.Wolves fightbackBrentford beat fourth-bottom Ipswich 4-3 in a thrilling clash in west London.Ipswich's Sam Szmodics produced a fine finish from 15 yards in the 28th minute before George Hirst clipped a composed strike past Mark Flekken three minutes later.But Yoane Wissa netted in the 44th minute and Harry Clarke's own goal seconds later hauled Brentford level. Bryan Mbeumo's 51st-minute penalty, awarded for Clarke's foul on Keane Lewis-Potter, put Brentford 3-2 up.Capping a miserable day for Clarke, he was sent off in the closing stages after fouling Lewis-Potter to earn a second booking.Liam Delap's 86th-minute equaliser appeared to have spared Clarke's blushes, but Mbeumo snatched victory with the last kick of stoppage-time.Second-bottom Wolves staged a superb fightback to draw 2-2 at fifth-placed Brighton.Danny Welbeck bagged his sixth goal of the season in first half stoppage-time and Evan Ferguson struck with a clinical finish from Tariq Lamptey's 85th-minute cross to leave Brighton in control.But Rayan Ait-Nouri got one back three minutes later and Matheus Cunha saved winless Wolves from a sixth successive league defeat with a deflected equaliser deep into stoppage-time.Everton forward Beto salvaged a 1-1 draw against Fulham as his stoppage-time header cancelled out Alex Iwobi's 61st-minute strike against his former club at Goodison Park.Although Everton are unbeaten in their last six games, they sit just three places above the relegation zone.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo made sure Napoli will stay top of Serie A this weekend after firing the winner in Saturday's 1-0 victory over Lecce to move his team five points clear. Captain Di Lorenzo bundled home the only goal of a scrappy game in Naples after Scott McTominay's header from a corner was saved by Lecce goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone, giving Napoli their fourth win in as many matches. The Italy full-back's third goal of the season for Napoli came after he was denied in the first half when his close-range finish was rightly ruled out for offside.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Napoli are comfortably ahead of second-placed Inter Milan, who host Juventus on Sunday in the biggest match to date of their league title defence.\"It was a really important match for us, we tried in every way possible to score and in the end we managed to do it,\" said Di Lorenzo to DAZN.Antonio Conte's side created little else against spirited Lecce, who remain second from bottom on five points after a fourth straight defeat, as Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Matteo Politano started on the bench.Romelu Lukaku fluffed Napoli's best chance of the match when he skied over from inside the six-yard box nine minutes after half-time, and the hosts were panicky in the final minutes as Lecce pushed for a leveller.Lecce came into the match on the back of last weekend's 6-0 home hammering at the hands of Fiorentina which put coach Luca Gotti's job at risk but went toe-to-toe with Napoli and on another day could have easily left with a point.\"I don't like to lose, even with our heads held high,\" said Gotti.\"But I'll take the attitude of our players today, let's hope we can take it into the coming matches.\"Gasperini's 400th matchOn Tuesday, Napoli travel to the San Siro to face AC Milan, who sit sixth and will not play this weekend after Saturday's match at Bologna was postponed due to torrential rain and flooding.Bologna and its surrounding areas are still reeling from a massive downpour over last weekend which claimed the life of a 20-year-old man.On Friday Serie A president Lorenzo Casini said the match would likely be played in February due to the two clubs' Champions League commitments and Milan's involvement in the four-team Italian Super Cup which will be played in Saudi Arabia in early January.Atalanta celebrated Gian Piero Gasperini's 400th match as coach by destroying Verona 6-1 with a stunning display in which they raced into a five-goal lead in just over half an hour.Marten de Roon, Charles De Ketelaere and doubles from Serie A top scorer Mateo Retegui and Ademola Lookman fired Atalanta up to fourth, level on 16 points with Juventus, and made up for Wednesday's frustrating goalless draw with Celtic in the Champions League.\"We were disappointed with the Celtic game as we created loads. Today we scored plenty of goals,\" said Retegui who has scored 10 times in his first nine league matches with Atalanta.\"It's down to the faith shown in me by the lads and the fans. I've got a lot of teammates with a lot of experience who have helped me integrate well in the team.\"The hosts went ahead in the sixth minute when De Roon thumped home Lookman's cross, and the match was effectively over by the 14th minute after Retegui and De Ketelaere both curled in fine left-footed strikes.Verona got the treatment Celtic should have suffered and coach Paolo Zanetti looked shellshocked on the sidelines as Lookman first skipped past three players and drilled home at the near post before tapping in Ederson's low cross in the 34th minute.Amin Sarr scored a consolation goal in the 42nd minute and Atalanta took their foot off the gas after the break, only adding to their score once through a Retegui tap-in.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

The Spaniard, who leaves the team at the end of the season, clocked one minute and 15.946 seconds to beat series leader and three time champion Verstappen, whose first and fastest lap in the top 10 shoot-out was deleted, by 0.225 seconds.

My laps were almost identical and perfect. It is such a tricky circuit!\"Verstappen, who had an engine change on his car following problems on Friday, said: \"I felt under pressure and I was playing catch-up especially after losing my first lap time.\"That just gave more pressure and I am very happy to be on the front row. I didn't think it was possible. This is one of the hardest tracks to get things right.\"Norris said he was satisfied with third.\"Honestly, I'm pretty happy as I struggled to get more in my final two laps. Carlos was very quick all weekend, but I'm happy with third. Ferrari look very strong.\"Kevin Magnussen was seventh for Haas, the team's best qualifying result in Mexico, ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Williams' Alex Albon and Nico Hulkenberg in the second Haas. Luckless PerezThe Sauber drivers were first out as Q1 began in warmer conditions than those for final practice with a track temperature of 45 degrees and the air at 22. In the rarefied atmosphere, this was likely to affect performances of tyres and engines. Both Ferraris went top before Norris, and then Verstappen took control. Perez, struggling with his brakes, was 1.5 seconds adrift in 14th.As the track improved, the times tumbled with Stroll briefly fourth and Gasly second ahead of Hulkenberg. Switching to softs, in search of more pace and grip, Piastri, who was fastest for McLaren in FP3, fought to progress and slumped to 19th ahead of Red Bull's Perez with two minutes to go - while Norris leapt to the top of the times. In the final seconds, big improvements by others left Piastri and Perez in the drop zone - a surprise to many and a shock to the Mexicans' huge following at the circuit. Perez wound up 18th to extend his miserable run and was eliminated along with Williams' Franco Colapinto in 16th, Piastri 17th, Esteban Ocon of Alpine and Sauber's Zhou Gruanyu. For the luckless Perez, it was his worst starting slot in nine Mexican Grands Prix.\"It's very difficult with this car - I can't attack the corner into braking,\" said Perez. \"I went off at Turn 12 and beached it on the kerb,\" said Piastri.\"And that was it. So frustrating... a poor mistake to make.\"Alex Albon led the way for Q2, with Verstappen setting the early pace before Norris took command as RB's Yuki Tsunoda locked up and crashed at Turn 12, bringing out red flags. He was unhurt. This meant he and team-mate Liam Lawson were out along with Aston Martin's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, in his 400th Grand Prix, and Lance Stroll and Sauber's Valtteri Bottas.Verstappen setting the pace in the top-10 final session with a sizzling early lap in 1:16.368, more than half a second quicker than Norris, but the Dutchman's lap was deleted for exceeding track limits. That left Ferrari to take control with Sainz on top in 1:16.055.Fortunately, Red Bull had another set of softs available for Verstappen's second run.In a frantic finale, Sainz improved his time to resist Verstappen's best effort with Norris lining up third, unable to break into the front row.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Hyderabad FC hammered Mohammedan SC 4-0 to register their first win of the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 season at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Saturday.On a night where the hosts took the field in search of their maiden home win, it was Allan Paulista, who scored a brilliant brace with the likes of Stefan Sapic and Parag Shrivas also joining the goal-scoring bonanza, as per an ISL press release. Thangboi Singto\u2019s men initiated the groundwork for a brilliant win when Allan Paulista capitalized on Padam Chettri\u2019s mistake to hand the visitors an early lead in the fourth minute. The Brazilian was lurking in the penalty area when Padam failed to clear his lines following a pass from Florent Ogier. Paulista saw the opportunity and tucked it past the goalkeeper.Hyderabad FC piled more pressure on Mohammedan SC\u2019s backline and they were duly rewarded in the 12th minute when Stefan Sapic rose the highest to head home the second goal from a Cy Goddard corner.Hyderabad FC\u2019s onslaught kept going as the hosts were unable to match their intensity and left acres of space in midfield. Three minutes after the second goal, Paulista added another to his tally after Parag Shrivas found the Brazilian unmarked in the final third. The 25-year-old hammered the ball home, beating Padam all ends up. Hyderabad FC scripted history as they raced to a 3-0 lead in just 14 minutes and 38 seconds which is the second-fastest in ISL history.Hyderabad FC could have extended their lead when Andrei Alba found himself in space right at the edge of the penalty area. But the Brazilian scuffed his shot wide. In the first half, Mohammedan SC were slower to react to second balls, they left plenty of space while defending and lacked that spark in attack. Despite having the lion\u2019s share of possession they went into the break trailing 3-0 at home.The second half saw Mohammedan SC tactician Andrey Chernyshov turn to his bench as he brought on Cesar Manzoki, Mohammed Irshad and Makan Chothe to solidify all three departments. Despite the changes, the visitors added another goal to their scoresheet in the 51st minute when Parag Shrivas combined with Alba to produce a long-range missile. The young defender swerved the ball straight into the top right corner, leaving Padam and Mohammedan SC backline completely bamboozled. It was a special moment for the youngster as he scored his maiden ISL goal.Right after conceding their fourth goal, the hosts had a great chance to pull one back when Manzoki found himself in space in the box but his subsequent effort struck the post. Later Bikash Singh saw his chance go begging following Alexis Gomez\u2019s excellent cross.In the last 20 minutes of the game, Mohammedan SC threw bodies forward in search of goals but unfortunately, it was just not their night as Hyderabad FC registered their second clean sheet and first win of the season.*Key Performer of the Match: Allan Paulista (Hyderabad FC)*The Brazilian forward led the lines perfectly as he scored a brilliant brace to open his account in ISL while also putting in a shift with his two tackles. Paulista completed 18 out of his 22 passes and kept the opposition defenders on their toes.After this win, Hyderabad FC will host Mohun Bagan Super Giant on October 30. Meanwhile, Mohammedan SC will be in action again in the Kolkata Derby against East Bengal on November 9 in an away fixture.Brief ScoresMohammedan SC 0-4 Hyderabad FC 4 (Allan Paulista 4\u2032 15\u2032, Stefan Sapic 12\u2032, Parag Shrivas 51\u2032).",

        "title": "Indian players were 'overconfident': Ex-Pak cricketer",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali feels Indian players were 'overconfident' ahead of the start of the series against New Zealand and that resulted in the hosts succumbing to their first home series loss in 12 years.After their clinical triumph in the opener in Bengaluru, New Zealand beat India in three days in the second Test in Pune to claim their first-ever series win in India. Basit said that New Zealand's 2-0 series loss in Sri Lanka and Rohit Sharma and Co. winning the Bangladesh Test in two days made them overconfident. But the Kiwis did their homework before the India tour and exposed their batting completely in the first two Tests. \"I had said chasing 350-plus will be too difficult. There had to be ton from one of the top three batters. India's batting got exposed. In the first match, Kiwi pacers took 17 wickets. In the second Test, spinners took 19 wickets. India players were neither able to play pacers well nor spinners. On a track that had pace and bounce (Bengaluru), India lost and on a spinning track, India lost as well,\" Basit said on his YouTube channel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOwiURPd2w4 \"The match India won against Bangladesh in two days and New Zealand's 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka, the team might have thought they would beat the Kiwis easily. This means, Indian management and Indian players were overconfident. New Zealand did their homework. They had nothing to lose. No one would have thought that the Kiwis might be able to defeat India. Even New Zealand themselves wouldn't have thought of something like this. But they did their homework,\" he added.The BCCI also recently announced the squad for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy and Basit feels that without Mohammed Shami India will have a lot of problems Down Under. Basit said that with only Siraj out there along with youngsters, the entire load will be on Jasprit Bumrah on the marquee tour. \"I am surprised (mujhe hairat hai) why there is no Mohammed Shami in the squad for the Australia tour. You have put all the load on Bumrah. Arshdeep (Singh) could have been in the squad because he brings variety. In this team, India's fast bowling is not complete without Shami. Without Shami, India might face problems in Australia. In Australia, your weapon is fast bowling. India will have problems in Australia,\" he said. The first BGT Test commences from November 22 in Perth.",
        "summary": "Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali believes that India's overconfidence led to their first home series loss in 12 years against New Zealand. He criticized India's batting and bowling performances while highlighting the absence of Mohammed Shami for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy, predicting difficulties for India's fast bowling attack in Australia.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: In an extraordinary week of cricket, New Zealand achieved unprecedented success on the global stage, rewriting history with two landmark victories. Within a span of seven days, the Black Caps secured their first-ever Test series win in India, while the White Ferns claimed their maiden ICC Women's T20 World Cup title. These incredible achievements have catapulted New Zealand cricket into the spotlight like never before.Black Caps end 69-year wait with historic Test series win in IndiaThe week of glory began on October 20, when New Zealand's men's team ended a 36-year winless streak in India with a commanding 8-wicket victory in the first Test in Bengaluru. It was New Zealand's first Test win on Indian soil since 1988 and only their third in history. The victory marked the start of their first-ever series triumph in India in 13 attempts since 1955.Under an overcast condition, India's batting crumbled under the pressure, posting just 46 runs in their first innings - their lowest Test total in Asia. New Zealand pacer Matt Henry spearheaded the demolition, taking 5 for 15. In response, New Zealand amassed 402 runs, taking control of the match. India showed fight in their second innings, with Sarfaraz Khan's 150 helping set a target of 107, but the Black Caps chased it down with ease.The second Test in Pune was even more dramatic. New Zealand fought back after being bowled out for 259, with Mitchell Santner delivering a match-winning performance, taking 7 for 53 to dismiss India for just 156. New Zealand set India a challenging fourth-innings target of 359, and despite Yashasvi Jaiswal's blistering 77, India folded for 245, giving New Zealand a 113-run victory and their first-ever Test series win in India. This also ended India's 12-year unbeaten run in home series.White Ferns make history with maiden T20 World Cup winWhile the men's team was making history in India, the New Zealand women's team, the White Ferns, achieved their own momentous victory by lifting their first-ever ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Dubai on the same day as the Bengaluru Test win (October 20).Entering the tournament as underdogs, the White Ferns stunned the cricket world by defeating India by 58 runs in their opening game. Despite a setback against defending champions Australia, New Zealand reached the semifinals with wins over Sri Lanka and Pakistan. A narrow 8-run victory over West Indies in the semifinals set up a final clash with South Africa.In the final, the White Ferns posted a competitive total and restricted South Africa to win by 32 runs, claiming their first T20 World Cup and second ICC trophy, following their 2000 Women's ODI World Cup win.Seven days of glory for New Zealand CricketIn just seven days, New Zealand cricket achieved historic feats that have redefined their legacy on the world stage. The Black Caps' first-ever Test series win in India and the White Ferns' maiden T20 World Cup triumph represent the pinnacle of New Zealand cricket's red-letter week, marking a period of unprecedented success that will be remembered for years to come.",

        "text": "NorthEast United FC produced a majestic performance in front of their home supporters at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati to round off a thoroughly convincing 5-0 victory against Jamshedpur FC in the 2024-25 Indian Super League on Saturday. \n\nThe Highlanders got hold of their second win of the campaign in utmost style, as their free-flowing frontline got together to break past the Jamshedpur FC defence multiple times across both halves. This is the club\u2019s biggest win in ISL history and the first time they have scored five goals in a game in the competition as well.\n\nThey were also helped with the Red Miners being reduced to 10 men with defender Stephen Eze getting sent off in the 29th minute. However, the Juan Pedro Benali-coached team had already gotten the lead thanks to the opening strike five minutes into the game by Alaaeddine Ajaraie.\n\nBuanthanglun Samte had set up a rather straightforward pass for Ajaraie on the left flank. The dynamic attacker backed his instincts to take a shot at goal from distance and his perfect attempt at netting the ball into the top right corner with a classic finish brought the spectators at the edge of the seats and left them awestruck.\n\nTwo minutes later, Mohammed Bemammer found Ajaraie at the appropriate goal-scoring position to double the lead of the Highlanders. Inside the centre of the 18-yard box, Ajaraie made a solid effort but it didn\u2019t culminate in a strike. Eze getting shown a second yellow card just before the half-hour mark turned the tables of the game, with Benali\u2019s men maintaining an absolute stronghold over the flow of the game thereafter.\n\nNorthEast United FC have unearthed a gem in Parthib Gogoi and the youngster didn\u2019t disappoint this evening as he brought up a brace to reach 10 ISL goals \u2013 the most by any player in the league before turning 22. \n\nThough last year he floored the fans with his long-range stunners, Gogoi has added finer elements to his gameplay and those were evident across his two goals here. He made a run inside the box and met Ajaraie\u2019s squared up pass perfectly to slot it into the bottom right corner in the 44th minute. \n\nTen minutes into the second half, it was Jithin MS who turned the provider for Gogoi, finding him in an exemplary situation inside the box. The latter didn\u2019t disappoint, landing the ball into the top left corner to triple the team\u2019s lead.\n\nNorthEast United FC refused to take their foot off the pedal despite gaining a comfortable lead.\n\nSubstitute Macarton Nickson made an instant impact, joining the goal-scoring frenzy by depositing the ball into the top right corner from the edge of the box through an assist by Hamza Regragui in the 82nd minute. \n\nAjaraie wrapped up the proceedings by nailing the fifth goal of the game in the 90th minute. It was a consequence of a quick counter-attack by the Highlanders, set up by Michel Zabaco who spotted the forward at the centre of the box.",

        "text": "Hyderabad FC beat Mohammedan SC 4-0 to register their first win of the 2024-25 Indian Super League season at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Saturday.\n\nOn a night where the hosts took the field in search of their maiden home win, it was Allan Paulista, who scored a brilliant brace with the likes of Stefan Sapic and Parag Shrivas also joining the goal-scoring bonanza.\n\nThangboi Singto\u2019s men initiated the groundwork for a brilliant win when Allan Paulista capitalized on Padam Chettri\u2019s mistake to hand the visitors an early lead in the fourth minute. The Brazilian was lurking in the penalty area when Padam failed to clear his lines following a pass from Florent Ogier. Paulista saw the opportunity and tucked it past the goalkeeper. \n\nHyderabad FC piled more pressure on Mohammedan SC\u2019s backline and they were duly rewarded in the 12th minute when Stefan Sapic rose the highest to head home the second goal from a Cy Goddard corner.\n\nThe visitors\u2019 onslaught kept going as Mohammedan SC were unable to match their intensity and left acres of space in midfield. \n\nThree minutes after the second goal, Paulista added another to his tally after Parag Shrivas found the Brazilian unmarked in the final third. The 25-year-old hammered the ball home, beating Padam all ends up. Hyderabad FC scripted history as they raced to a 3-0 lead in just 14 minutes and 38 seconds which is the second-fastest in ISL history.\n\nHyderabad FC could have extended their lead when Andrei Alba found himself in space right at the edge of the penalty area. But the Brazilian scuffed his shot wide. \n\nIn the first half, Mohammedan SC were slower to react to second balls, they left plenty of space while defending and lacked that spark in attack. Despite having the lion\u2019s share of possession they went into the break trailing 3-0 at home.\n\nThe second half saw Mohammedan SC tactician Andrey Chernyshov turn to his bench as he brought on Cesar Manzoki, Mohammed Irshad and Makan Chothe to solidify all three departments. \n\nDespite the changes, the visitors added another goal to their scoresheet in the 51st minute when Parag Shrivas combined with Alba to produce a long-range missile. The young defender swerved the ball straight into the top right corner, leaving Padam and Mohammedan SC backline completely bamboozled. It was a special moment for the youngster as he scored his maiden ISL goal.\n\nRight after conceding their fourth goal, the hosts had a great chance to pull one back when Manzoki found himself in space in the box but his subsequent effort struck the post. Later, Bikash Singh saw his chance go begging following Alexis Gomez\u2019s excellent cross.\n\nIn the last 20 minutes of the game, Mohammedan SC threw bodies forward in search of goals. But unfortunately, it was just not their night as Hyderabad FC registered their second clean sheet and first win of the season.",

England's attacking and positive brand of 'Bazball' cricket faced yet another setback as they once again succumbed to spinners in the subcontinent, with spinners Noman Ali and Sajid Khan shined with stunning bowling spells to hand Three Lions a nine-wicket loss in the third Test at Rawalpindi to secure a 2-1 series win.\r\n\r\nwindow._rrCode = window._rrCode || [];_rrCode.push(function(){ (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\"); });Speaking to Sky Sports, Nasser lauded the team for removing batter Babar Azam and star pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah after their poor performances in the second Test and praised their spinners for being of \"highest quality\". He also said that England players were not very good at playing or bowling spin.\"Congratulations to Pakistan for making that change, they lost six Tests in a row, the fans and supporters were not happy. Different pitches and selectors and they found the kryptonite to Bazball,\" said Nasser.\"They have spinners of the highest quality and they have players that play spin really well. It is exposed to England when the ball does spin. When it spins and it is gripping, England does not play spin or bowl spin as good as Pakistan,\" he added.Hussain also questioned England's ability to play well on any other surface than a flat deck and said that discrepancies in England's scores were a huge concern.\"There should be a discrepancy because the pitches have been so different from the first Test to the second and third. There is no doubt that scores should go down and spinners should go up. But, the discrepancy in the England side is a concern,\" said Hussain.\"It should not be so drastic that you play so well on flat pitches and you can hit through the line but the moment it grips you cannot play like that and so then you are lost,\" he added.Coming to the match, England opted to bat first. After being reduced to 118/6, it was a counter-attacking century stand between Jamie Smith (89 in 119 balls, with five fours and six sixes) and Gus Atkinson (39 in 71 balls, with five fours) that took England to 267.Sajid (6/128) and Noman (3/88) were the top wicket-takers for Pakistan.Thanks to a brilliant century from Saud Shakeel (134 in 223 balls, with five fours) and lower-order contributions from Noman (45) and Sajid (48), Pakistan reached a score of 344 and gained a 77-run lead.Rehan Ahmed (4/66) and Shoaib Bashir (3/129) were the top wicket-takers for England.England could not build a healthy lead for themselves, skittling out for 112 runs in their second innings with Joe Root (33) and Harry Brook (26) top-scoring. They could only gain a 35-run lead.Sajid (4/69) and Noman (6/42) were the top bowlers for Pakistan, who chased down the 36-run target effortlessly to win the series 2-1.Shakeel was given the 'Player of the Match' award for his century.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "'Onus of series loss is on...': Former cricketers defend Gautam Gambhir",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: Former batsman Sanjay Manjrekar feels it would be unjust to blame coach Gautam Gambhir for the Test series defeat to New Zealand, but former wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik feels the senior Indian players have the responsibility. The Black Caps established an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series when India lost the second Test match against New Zealand by 113 runs in Pune on Saturday. This put an end to India's impressive run of 18 straight home series victories after their 2012-13 defeat at the hands of England.The senior players fared poorly in both games. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma both had trouble at bat, while the powerful spin combination of Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin also didn't have much of an effect.114648870\"Yeah. Why shouldn't it (the onus of the series loss) be the senior players? They will look at themselves and say, 'What could we have done better?' I don't think they have run away from it,\" Karthik said on 'Cricbuzz'.\"If you can celebrate the highs and the fans enjoy how important they are, when the team wins, then when the losses happen, and the brick bats are thrown at you I think they will have the courage to face it,\" he added.114648878Karthik acknowledged that they did not have their finest series and stated that the seniors themselves will accept blame for the loss.\"If you go and ask each one of them personally, what they think of the series I don't think they'll have great things to say about how the whole team played, and it is only but fair to ask them questions about what can be done better for future of Test cricket in India and for Indian Test cricket.\"So, knowing them personally, and I do know each one of them personally. They will say that they didn't have the best series. The question then becomes what do they need to do to get better and it is a very very current question to ask,\" he detailed.114648884Following India's tactical errors and frequent batting collapses in the two Test matches, new head coach Gautam Gambhir has also come under criticism, but Manjrekar extended his support for the former opener.\"I will still maintain that the coach has the minimal influence on a team, lesser than your 11th weakest player. He does not set foot on the ground, the captain is in-charge out there.114648904\"But you have to applaud him for Washington Sundar's selection, which was an immediate hit,\" Manjrekar told 'ESPNcricinfo'.\"But the move to send Washington ahead of Sarfaraz Khan or maybe four spinners here would have made more sense. But to put any kind of responsibility on the door of Gautam Gambhir would be terribly unfair because until now we can't do it because in cricket, a coach has minimal influence on performances,\" he added.114648906Rohit should come out of the T20 thinking of match upsManjrekar questioned Rohit's \"bizarre\" choice to send Washington, an all-rounder, ahead of Sarfaraz, who was in form.\"The move to have Sarfaraz Khan bat down the order and sending Washington Sundar above him because he is a left-hander, those kind of things shouldn't happen.\"It's just bizarre. That's one thing that Rohit Sharma needs to be careful of...the T20 thinking of match ups left hand-right hand combinations. I think he should just go by the overall quality and ability of players.\" Manjrekar said.114648912Rohit could score 60 runs in four innings (2,52;0,8) when India needed its seasoned batsmen to take the lead, but Kohli was somewhat superior with 88 runs (0,70;1,17).The talismanic batsman could have adequately prepared for the lengthy Test schedule by making himself available for the domestic matches, according to former India captain Anil Kumble, who emphasized Kohli's absence from the domestic circuit.\"Perhaps just one or two innings in a match situation could have helped. Being in an actual game is definitely more beneficial than just practice; it gives an upper hand,\" Kumble said on 'Jio Cinema'.\"If he feels that playing earlier would have benefited him, and the team management agrees, then maybe it would have,\" he added.",

The addition of the foreign players made a huge difference but Singto praised the group for pulling through difficult times.\u201cWe had a big struggle. But with the new ownership coming in, the rocky boat has settled down a bit. Supporters supporting us on and off the field have been helping us. So, all the players are believing. Some experienced players like Lenny coming in have helped the younger players. Also, the management believing in us has helped. We are an all-Indian staff and it\u2019s not easy but credit to the support staff, medical team for being together. Today there was some luck with us. But we created that luck,\u201d Singto said in the post-match press conference as per a press release from ISL.It was the first time that Hyderabad FC were able to field all four foreigners this season and two of them scored three of their goals in Kolkata. Singto shed light on the selection process that they had followed to pick the players.\u201cBefore signing the players we do some research. This is my ninth season in ISL and when I spoke to them, I really relate to players who are good human beings. So, we are looking at players who will not just contribute to our game, but through their persona can help the team gel together,\u201d he said.\u201cLast season, we had one win and this season in five games, we have one win and a draw. Hopefully, we continue the good work,\u201d he added.The former Kerala Blasters FC assistant head coach was especially delighted for the fans who had waited so long to celebrate a win.\u201cVery happy for the team, very happy for the players. and for the fans too,\u201d he said.\u201cThere was a huge crowd today (at KBK). When we play in Kerala, I feel really happy because they have the yellow army. Also, in derbies (in Kolkata) lots of people come to the stadium. I\u2019m sure when we start winning like this, our fans will also come to watch the games. The fans want excitement, a good game and to win. We are trying to bring our supporters to the stadium with good performances,\u201d he added.Hyderabad FC face another team from Kolkata in their next game as they welcome Mohun Bagan Super Giant at the GMC Balayogi stadium, a game that Singto is looking forward to.\u201cNext match is against Mohun Bagan SG who are one of the best teams in ISL and we will have to play better than what we did today,\u201d he concluded.",

        "text": "Former India head coach Ravi Shastri came out in support of the current Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir after the side conceded the ongoing Test series to New Zealand. India, captained by Rohit Sharma, marking their first Test series loss at home in 12 years. Shastri explained that since Gautam Gambhir is in the early phase of his coaching stint with the national team, there is still enough time on hand. Indian batters got the taste of their own medicine as the Kiwi spin attack led by Mitchell Santner, who took 13 wickets in the match, trapped the hosts in their own spin trap and defeated India by 113 runs to secure the series 2-0 with a game to go.\u201cNew Zealand have beaten them (India) handsomely in both the Test matches. It\u2019s food for thought (on series loss). He (Gambhir) has just taken over the job. It is never easy being coach of a team that has such a big following. It is still early days in his career as a coach. But he\u2019ll soon learn,\u201d Shastri said, while on commentary during the second Test in Pune.Coming to the match, New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first. Half-centuries from Devon Conway (76 in 141 balls, with 11 fours) and Rachin Ravindra (65 in 105 balls, with five fours and a six) placed Kiwis in a strong position at 197/3, with Ravichandran Ashwin (3/41) being the only one to have made some dents into the batting. Floodgates opened for wickets after Conway\u2019s dismissal, with comeback man Washington Sundar (7/59) getting the remaining wickets to get NZ to 259 all out. India was tasked to overcome this rather modest total and gain a sizeable lead. After skipper Rohit Sharma\u2019s dismissal for a duck, youngsters Shubman Gill (30 in 72 balls, with two fours and a six) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (30 in 60 balls, with four boundaries) tried forming a partnership. However, their effort was cut short at 49 runs. Just like the first innings, dismissal of a set Gill paved way for Mitchell Santner to run through the Indian line up. Santner (7/53) and Glenn Phillips (2/26) made Indian batters dance to their tunes on their own pitches, skittling them out for just 156 runs. Ravindra Jadeja top-scored with 38 in 46 balls, with three fours and two sixes. Kiwis got themselves in a commanding position in their second innings. Led by skipper Tom Latham\u2019s 86 in 133 balls, with 10 fours and some important contributions from Phillips (48 in 82 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes) and Tom Blundell (41 in 83 balls, with three fours), Kiwis increased their 103-run first inning lead to a lead of 358 runs, being skittled out for 255 after some fine bowling on first session of day three by spinners. Sundar (4/56) once again lead the bowling from the front, with Jadeja (3/72) and Ravichandran Ashwin (2/97) wiping the lower-middle order and tail.In the chase of 359, India got a fine start from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who stitched a valuable 62-run stand with Shubman Gill (23 in 31 balls, with four boundaries). However, after Jaiswal\u2019s dismissal for 77 in 65 balls, with nine fours and three sixes, India never recovered, falling a prey to Kiwi spinners and bundled out for 245, losing the test by 113 runs. With this India also registered its first home series loss in 12 years. Santner (6/104) was once again the star, taking 13 wickets in the match, with Phillips (two wickets) and Ajaz (one wicket) also offering some support to end the Test two days early. For Gautam Gambhir and India, the focus now turns to Mumbai and the iconic Wankhede Stadium, when they take on New Zealand in the third and final Test, where they will look to end the series on a high.

But if something is giving you happiness, then it is okay.\n\nBut you should not keep the sad thing in your mind because by doing so, that thing either keeps hurting you forever or it turns into anger and weakens you mentally.\n\nThis is the reason why people keep getting angry all the time. Sometimes we take out the anger of one person on another person.\n\nShare your heart\u2019s feelings with someone close to you\n\nYes, because when people have something in their mind or heart, then they get more angry, but if this is the case with you, then you should share your thoughts with someone close to your heart because by doing this you feel better.\n\nDon\u2019t let anger increase your stress\n\nYou all know that most of people get very angry due to stress, due to which they become irritable but to keep this away you have to reduce stress.\n\nExpress anger appropriately\n\nSometimes you are not a person who gets angry on small things but you suddenly get angry on some matter, then in such a case you should recognize your anger and do something about that work that was making you angry.\n\nFor example, you saw injustice being done to someone due to which you got angry but here you have to understand the meaning of your anger by raising your voice against it, after which you can control your anger by satisfying your mind.\n\nThink once before speaking in anger (one should speak after thinking)\n\nPeople who get angry a lot, say anything to anyone in anger, but this creates distance in people\u2019s relationships. That is why if you think once before saying your words in anger, then you can save your important relationships from breaking.\n\nNote- Take special care of this thing, otherwise you may say something to a close person in anger which can hurt his/her feelings. \n\nBoxing on a punching bag (calm down anger)\n\nSometimes there are some people who are unable to control their anger by staying calm, this is normal but anger of most of the people ends by staying calm but if your anger is very high and you cannot remain calm in anger\n\nSo in such a situation it does not work, in this you should calm your anger by boxing on a punching bag or by doing some gym exercise, by doing this you do things like boxing on a punching bag, boxing on a pillow, etc. to bring out your anger.\n\nNote \u2013 Although this is wrong, but it is very important to calm down your anger as soon as possible, otherwise it will cause you mental harm because it calms down anger but disturbs your mental peace. \n\nStart counting when you are angry\n\nYes, this work is very useful for you, whenever you are angry, you have to count to relax, after which your anger slowly calms down\n\nNote \u2013 Here you can decide whether you want to sing the count in forward or backward direction (here keep the count from 1 to 10 or 10 to 1 maximum because doing more will take more time)\n\nThink about anger and find a solution\n\nThis work is very important to reduce or end anger because in this you think calmly about all those things that make you angry, after which you think about removing all these reasons.\n\nBy doing this, you try to end your anger yourself, after which you gradually become mentally strong in such angry situations and reduce your anger.\n\nListen to music when you are angry (listen to your favorite song)\n\nEvery person in the world likes some kind of music (song) like I like Punjabi songs very much, similarly you too will like some songs, now you have to listen to your favorite songs when you get angry, after which your anger calms down very quickly.\n\nRecognizing the Signs of Anger\n\nWhen you become aware of all the symptoms of your anger, then before getting angry, you know that you are getting angry now, in such a situation you can flare up but at this time you have to control yourself.\n\nPeople who are angry usually show such symptoms which include clenching of fists, trembling, sweating, increased temperature, increased blood pressure, etc.\n\nLearn to exercise self-control by not losing your temper in anger\n\nYes, if you are feeling angry then first of all to get rid of anger, you have to learn to control yourself in which we learn not to lose our temper in our anger. Yes, it is true that most of the people in anger think that today I will do or die.\n\nBut in such a situation, you create a bad image of yourself in the eyes of the people because people will only see your anger. What was the matter, whose mistake was it, why did you get angry, no one asks all these things but here if you learn the skill of self-control \n\nSo it helps in controlling your anger.

What should we do?\n\nIt happens many times that we get very angry at someone but later we realize that we should not have gotten angry because he/she was my close relative (it includes wife, friend, father, mother, son, brother), etc. but what should you do now?\n\nSo in such a situation, after getting angry, you should immediately hug that person and say sorry, after which you can handle the situation, but if you do not do this, then that person will feel bad about your words, after which your relationship will get spoiled.\n\nWhat should one do when one gets very angry?\n\nWhen you get very angry, you should do things like counting, meditation, taking deep breaths, listening to music, staying calm, walking, laughing, doing yoga and exercise, giving time to yourself, lightening your mind, eating healthy food, taking complete rest, etc.\n\nWhy do we get angry at small things?\n\nIf you get angry at small things, then you start getting irritable.

        "text": "The relentless accuracy of bowlers, led by Radha Yadav, drove India to a comfortable 59-run victory over New Zealand in the first women's ODI in Ahmedabad on Thursday. India now lead the three-match series 1-0, after bowling out the Kiwis for 168 who were chasing a gettable 228. Left-arm spinner Yadav (4/42) was India's lead act in bowling. Debutant pacer Saima Thakor inflicted the first blow in only the second ball of her international career, removing Suzie Bates (1).\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Bates feathered an away-swinger to Yastika Bhatia behind the stumps.But that was only the beginning as three more wickets fell while New Zealand reached 79, and the dismissal of skipper Sophie Devine was the most bizarre.Devine forgot to drag her feet back behind the crease as stumper Yastika whipped the bails off after bowler Deepti Sharma threw the ball back to her.New Zealand briefly raised the vision of a comeback through the fifth-wicket partnership between Brook Halliday (39) and Maddy Green (31) that was worth 49 runs, the highest in their innings.But Thakor returned to dismiss Halliday to break the growing stand, and thereafter the New Zealand innings never recovered.Before that, India too endured a stifling batting experience of their own as they failed to counter the wily Kerr sisters \u2013 Amelia and Jess \u2013 as they were bowled out for a slightly under-par 227 after opting to bat first.Leg-spinner Amelia (4/42) and medium pacer Jess (3/49) were at the forefront of the Kiwis' charge with the ball, and they received able support from off-spinner Eden Carson (2/42).The bane of the Indian innings was the batters' inability to convert the starts they got.Deepti Sharma (41), debutant Tejal Hasabnis (42), Shafali Verma (33), Yastika (37) and Jemimah Rodrigues (35) started off the block in fine fashion but were unable to build on.Hasabnis, in particular, will feel terrible as she was batting so well before getting out to Amelia.The right-hander danced down the track to the leg-spinner seeing the flight, but she failed to connect with the ball while attempting an almighty heave. Stumper Isabella Gaze did the rest.The lone bright spots in India's innings was a 50-plus alliance \u2013 a 61 between Rodrigues and Hasabnis for the fifth wicket.Skipper Smriti Mandhana, who led the side after Harmanpreet Kaur was rested due to a niggle, was dismissed in the third over itself.She gave a simple catch to Georgia Plimmer off Jess as India could not impart the desired early momentum to their innings.Subsequently, they struggled for it the rest of the innings but the hosts' bowler rose the occasion.",

Devine neglected to bring her feet back behind the crease, allowing stumper Yastika to remove the bails after Deepti Sharma returned the ball.New Zealand briefly threatened a comeback through a 49-run fifth-wicket partnership between Brooke Halliday (39) and Maddy Green (31), which turned out to be the highest stand of their innings.\u2014 BCCIWomen (@BCCIWomen) However, Thakor broke this partnership by dismissing Halliday, and from that point on, New Zealand struggled to recover.Before that, India had their own challenges with the bat, managing to score a modest 227 after opting to bat first against the crafty bowling of the Kerr sisters \u2014 Amelia and Jess.Amelia led the charge with 4 wickets for 42 runs, while Jess contributed with 3 for 49, supported ably by Eden Carson, who took 2 wickets for 42 runs.India's innings suffered from their inability to convert promising starts into substantial scores. Deepti Sharma (41), debutant Tejal Hasabnis (42), Shafali Verma (33), Yastika (37), and Jemimah Rodrigues (35) all got off to solid starts but failed to build on them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q19MzBbziYHasabnis, in particular, will be disappointed, having been in good form before being dismissed by Amelia. She attempted to dance down the track to the leg-spinner but mistimed her ambitious shot, resulting in a stumping by Isabella Gaze.India did achieve one significant partnership, with Rodrigues and Hasabnis combining for 61 runs for the fifth wicket.Meanwhile, skipper Smriti Mandhana, who took charge with Harmanpreet Kaur resting due to a minor injury, was dismissed early in the third over, caught by Georgia Plimmer off Jess. This dismissal set the tone for a challenging innings, and despite their struggles, India's bowlers rose to the occasion.",

On Thursday, the team exacted revenge of sorts by beating the recently-crowned World Champions and taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\n\nAsked to bat first by New Zealand, India were bowled out for 227 with the Kerr sisters Amelia and Jess sharing seven wickets between them. The Indian team came back strongly to bundle out New Zealand for 168 and registered a 59-run win.\n\n\u201cIt has been a tough 1.5-2 months, so nice to start with a win. If you don\u2019t believe in cricket, you won\u2019t be able to do it. We had a talk that we were under-par but if we field well, we could add 20-30 runs,\u201d said Smriti Mandhana, who was leading India as skipper Harmanpreet Kaur was unavailable due to a niggle.\n\nMandhana also praised pacer Saima Thakor, who bagged an early wicket for India. \u201cSaima set the tone for us with Suzie\u2019s wicket. She was brilliant. She has been around with us (for the past couple of months). She has been brilliant throughout and we have seen her work really hard. Really happy for her and hope this is just the start for her. Whoever batted today, we asked them what is the right length,\u201d said Smriti in the post-game presentation.\n\nMandhana called all-rounder Deepti Sharma, who contributed a vital 41 runs and also claimed a crucial wicket. \u201cDeepti is a superstar \u2013 she knows what to do. Radha also came in (and bowled well), Hemalatha also chipped in,\u201d she said.\n\nDeepti Sharma, who was adjudged as the Player of the Match, said it was an important win as it set the tone for the series. \u201cIt is important how you start because it sets the tone. I had belief in myself, whether it was bowling in the powerplay or when I was batting. We talked about not thinking about the total, and were just focusing on bowling in partnerships,\u201d said Deepti.\n\nDeepti also played a key role in running out New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine, who had moved out of the crease while blocking the ball and was caught out at the line. \u201cIt was not a lot. I thought she was outside her crease, so I felt throwing it (to Yastika) was a good option,\u201d said Deepti.",

He believes such comments can significantly impact the players.Gillespie mentioned that remarks from former players on TV shows and YouTube channels have hurt the cricketers. \u201cI'm very protective of players and very protective of staff I work with and just want to make sure that the environment that we're trying to create is a safe space for everyone and if that gets eroded then that can lead to a bit of frustration,\u201d he told Sky Sports.He requested former players to be careful when sharing their opinions, especially on social media. \u201cA lot of former players have their own space on social media \u2013 YouTube, whatever, and they're paid to have an opinion. One thing that I have noticed here is that the players notice everything and if they get some positive feedback from former players they idolised as kids, that goes a long way when they get some positive reinforcement. But it can have the opposite effect too if there's a lot of criticism by those former players,\u201d he added.Gillespie also expressed frustration over his reduced role. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) removed him and Test captain Shan Masood from the selection committee and took away their input on pitch preparation.\u201cI think there's always frustration from time to time. For me, when I came on board with Pakistan cricket, I was told there was a long-term plan, and we need to make sure our communication's spot on. I made that a real focus and so you can get frustrated if those things aren't done how you would like,\u201d Gillespie said.",

        "text": "Joao Felix ended his goal drought with a brace as Chelsea powered to a 4-1 win against Panathinaikos in the UEFA Conference League, while Welsh club The New Saints made history with a 2-0 victory against Kazakh side Astana on Thursday. Portugal forward Felix has struggled to make an impact since returning for a second spell with Chelsea in August. Yet to start a Premier League game following his move from Atletico Madrid, the 24-year-old seized the chance to prove a point to Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca. Felix's only goal in seven previous appearances this season came on his debut at Wolves on August 25.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");He ended his six-game barren run in the first half against out-classed Panathinaikos and netted again after the interval.Mykhailo Mudryk and Christopher Nkunku were also on target as Chelsea made it two wins from two games in the tournament.\"The most important thing is no matter how many players we change, you can see the identity of the team. The identity is quite clear,\" Maresca said.\"What we want is exactly what they're doing, taking the chance when we give it to them. Tonight once again they showed that.\"Before kick-off, Panathinaikos paid an emotional tribute to their defender George Baldock, who drowned in his swimming pool in Athens aged 31 earlier this month.Maresca made 11 changes from the side that lost at Liverpool last weekend, but still fielded a strong side that was far too dynamic for the Greeks.Felix put Chelsea ahead in the 22nd minute, starting the move with a cushioned header to Mudryk before sprinting into the six-yard box to slot home from the Ukrainian's cross.After setting up Chelsea's opener, Mudryk bagged the second himself in the 49th minute with a fierce strike from Neto's cross.Felix scored again in the 55th minute, putting the result beyond doubt with a 20-yard drive that took a wicked deflection into the net.Nkunku's 59th minute penalty, awarded for Daniel Mancini's foul, underlined Chelsea's superiority.Facundo Pellistri got one back for Panathinaikos with a close-range finish in the 69th minute.TNS fairytaleThe New Saints are the first club from the Cymru (Wales) Premier League to win a match in the group phase of a European competition.Playing at English League One side Shrewsbury's New Meadow instead of their own stadium, which was too small for Conference League regulations, the Welsh minnows took the lead in the 40th minute when Rory Holden headed home from Jordan Williams' cross.Craig Harrison's side, the first team from the Welsh domestic system to make a European group stage, were beaten 2-0 at Fiorentina in their opener, but they would not be denied a fairytale victory this time.In the 78th minute, Adam Wilson's cross was handled by Islambek Kuat in the penalty area and Declan McManus drilled his spot-kick down the middle.\"Qualifying to this stage was special and tonight getting our first win at this stage of the competition it's a dream come true,\" Harrison said.\"I'm so proud of everyone involved at the club. We do deserve to be here and we can win at this level.\"Beaten by West Ham and then Olympiakos in the last two Conference League finals, Fiorentina survived a scare in their 4-2 win at St Gallen.The Swiss side took a shock lead through Felix Mambimbi's 23rd minute goal but Lucas Martinez equalised in the 50th minute.Jonathan Ikone struck for Fiorentina four minutes later before St Gallen's Lukas Gortler levelled in the 62nd minute.Ikone restored the lead in the 69th minute and Robin Gosens's stoppage-time goal secured the Serie A team's second successive victory in the competition.The champions of the Republic of Ireland were too strong for the champions of Northern Ireland as Shamrock Rovers routed Larne 4-1 in Belfast.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho said his former club Manchester United escaped Istanbul with a point after he was sent to the stands in a 1-1 Europa League draw on Thursday. United have drawn all three of their European games this season and a point does little to ease the pressure on under-fire manager Erik ten Hag. Christian Eriksen fired a depleted United in front on 15 minutes, but Fenerbahce had the better of the chances and got their reward when Youssef En-Nesyri equalised early in the second half.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"We were better than them, so overall a good result for Manchester United,\" Mourinho told TNT Sports.A point leaves United languishing in 21st of the 36-team table and with their chances of securing a top-eight finish to progress directly to the last 16 fading.Fenerbahce are in 14th on five points, with a top-24 finish enough to qualify for the playoff stage.Mourinho also came into the game under pressure early in his reign with Fenerbahce trailing rivals Galatasaray by eight points at the top of the Turkish Super Lig.\"If we play like this in the Turkish league, we destroy every team,\" added Mourinho, who was shown a red card for his protests after appeals for a penalty were waived away in the second half.\"He (the referee) told me something incredible. He could see the action in the box and my behaviour on the touchline.\"I congratulate him because it is incredible his peripheral vision. During the game, 100 miles per hour, he had one eye on the penalty situation and one eye on the bench and my behaviour. That is why he is one of the best referees in the world.\"United were without 10 players, including captain Bruno Fernandes, due to suspension or injury.In Fernandes' absence, defender Noussair Mazraoui started in an unfamiliar attacking midfield role and had a part to play in an impressive opening goal.Manuel Ugarte dispossessed former United midfielder Fred to launch a counter-attack that involved Alejandro Garnacho and Mazraoui before Joshua Zirkzee teed up Eriksen to blast home from the edge of the area.However, for the third time in three Europa League matches, Ten Hag's men failed to build on taking the lead and have now gone a full calendar year without winning a European game.\"We have to win and we get again in the position to win, but we have to be killing (the opponent off) more,\" said Ten Hag. \"We let the opponent get away with the point.\"- Onana double-save -Ugarte has struggled to establish himself since arriving in a \u00a350 million ($65 million) deal from Paris Saint-Germain in August.But the Uruguayan showed the defensive awareness that attracted United's interest with a brilliant goal-saving challenge to deny Dusan Tadic a tap-in.United also needed an excellent double save from Andre Onana to parry two En-Nesyri headers to protect their lead at half-time.It was wiped out within four minutes of the restart as more sloppy defending allowed En-Nesyri to head in Allan Saint-Maximin's inviting cross.Fenerbahce were furious moments later when penalty appeals for a foul on Bright Osayi-Samuel were waived away.Mourinho took his protestations too far as he was dismissed by experienced French referee Clement Turpin.There remains plenty of time for United to dig themselves out of trouble with five more favourable looking Europa League fixtures to come against PAOK, Bodo Glimt, Viktoria Plzen, Rangers and FCSB.However, whether Ten Hag will still be in charge for all of those fixtures remains a major doubt after winning just four of United's opening 12 games of the season.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

I will do what I think is right.\"He explained that Verstappen was a master of defending aggressively by staying ahead at the apex and then attacking.\"He had gone in too hard and was overtaken off the track - it's such a big talking point for everyone and a lot of other drivers and teams don't agree on it.\"But it is what Max does and he is very good at it, probably the best in the world. I am still there and avoiding collisions. It's clear what his intentions are and he is in a more powerful position than me.\"The Texas race winner Charles Leclerc of Ferrari added his view, suggesting that Verstappen \"being on the limit of the regulations\" is what makes battles with him \"so exciting\".\"With him, you know he will never let you have any room and it will always be on the limit of the regulations and sometimes a bit over!

Initially, Brambilla\u2019s shot was blocked haphazardly by Jay Gupta as the ball rebounded off Gil and ended up in the back of the net.After conceding, the Gaurs tried to push forward in search of a breakthrough but lacked the final touch in the penalty area. Just when FC Goa were growing into the game, they suffered a major setback with Borja Herrera\u2019s injury closer to the drinks break. Manolo Marquez turned to Armando Sadiku, thereby tweaking his formation.The change brought some momentum for the visitors as they showed more hunger in attack looking for the equalizer. They had a couple of golden opportunities falling for Carl McHugh, who despite being unmarked failed to hit the target with his headers.Eventually, Marquez\u2019s men found the equalizer right at the stroke of half-time when Aakash Sangwan, with his beautiful cross from the left, found Udanta Singh in space. The 28-year-old shouldered the ball past Samik Mitra to pull the scores level.The goal surely spurred them on to take the lead in the second half and they did exactly that. The visitors secured the lead in the 51st minute through Sadiku\u2019s spot-kick after Samik Mitra brought down Dejan Drazic in the penalty area. With this goal, Sadiku became the first FC Goa player to score in five consecutive ISL games.FC Goa almost scored another goal when Brison Fernandes and Boris Singh combined to haunt the Chennaiyin backline. However the former was flagged offside.In order to restore parity, Owen Coyle turned to Daniel Chima Chukwu, replacing Wilmar Gil in the 67th minute. Meanwhile, Marquez also brought on Iker Guarrotxena in place of Drazic to add more presence up front. But it was Chukwu, who became the super-sub scoring the equalizer in the 79th minute with thumping header from Connor Shields\u2019 flagkick.The forward almost scored the winner for Chennaiyin FC in stoppage time when Mandar Rao Dessai found him in the box with a telling cross but the Nigerian\u2019s header was exceptionally kept out by Kattimani. In the end, both teams had to settle for a point.The match lived upto its expectations with four goals coming in and taking the tally of goals in the fixture to 99, since the inception of ISL.Connor Shields was once again the protagonist for Chennaiyin FC with a fine assist for Chukwu\u2019s goal. Other than that he created seven chances on the night while also completing 14 out of his attempted 17 passes. Apart from his shift in attack, the Scotsman also worked hard in helping out the backline.In Gameweek 7, Chennaiyin FC will travel to Delhi to face the high-flying Punjab FC on October 31 while FC Goa will host league leaders Bengaluru FC on November 2.Brief Scores: Chennaiyin FC 2 (Jordan Wilmar Gil 11\u2032, Chima Chukwu 79\u2032) \u2013 2 FC Goa (Udanta Singh 45\u2032, Armando Sadiku 51\u2032 (P)).",

The spectacular moment came in the 38th minute of the match.\n\nFenerbahce striker Youssef En-Nesyri's bullet header was palmed away by Onana much to the shock of the centre-forward who thought his effort was goal-bound. He then got himself up just in time to dramatically save a header from the same man from very close range. Mourinho raised his hands on the touchline as if to say Onana\u2019s double stop was not possible.\n\nLet us know! \ud83d\udc42\n\nWhat type of content would you like to see from us this year?\n\u2014 HubSpot (@HubSpot)\n\nDuring the half time, Mourinho was seen having a word with Onana following his double save\n\nLet us know! \ud83d\udc42\n\nWhat type of content would you like to see from us this year?\n\u2014 HubSpot (@HubSpot)\n\nManchester United vs Fenerbahce highlights\n\nEuropa League: Andre Onana Pulls Off Double Save To Leave Jose Mourinho Laughing In Disbelief During Manchester United vs Fenerbahce Match; Video\n\nApple, Made In India: Foxconn Buys Equipment Worth \u20b9267 Crore For Tamil Nadu Factory To Locally Make iPhone 16 Series\n\nBombay HC Restricts Customs Dept From Destroying 7 Artworks By Renowned Artists FN Souza & Akbar Padamsee\n\nMaharashtra Elections 2024: MLA Zeeshan Siddique Dumps Congress To Join NCP, Fielded From Mumbai's Bandra East; Video\n\nManchester United took an early lead in the 15th minute when Christian Eriksen finished off a swift counter-attack, firing home a powerful shot after a clever assist from Joshua Zirkzee. However United back four looked vulnerable as Fenerbahce kept the pressure in search of an equaliser.\n\nAfter Youssef En-Nesyri saw his goal scoring opportunity denied by Onana in the first half, he made no mistake on his second attempt. En-Nesyri punished United's lackluster defending, heading home a well-placed cross from Allan Saint-Maximin four minutes into the second half. Adding to United's woes, winger Antony had to be stretchered off late in the second half, raising concerns about the club's growing injury list.\n\nHowever the happiness turned into sadness for the Turkish club as Jose Mourinho was given the marching orders just after the goal, as he argued vehemently for a penalty decision. Despite the setback, Fenerbahce held firm, frustrating United for the rest of the match.\n\nSpeakign about team's performance, Mourinho said, \"I think my boys did an amazing match. Probably in England people will speak of two or three players for Manchester United who did not play, you do not know how many of us didn\u2019t play. At the start we had four players out of the list, and we had injuries. We had to do a crazy puzzle. Our performance was extraordinary.

Sharing the photo on Instagram, he hinted at Salman Khan's cameo in the film and wrote, \"Hum sab ne mil ke ki bohot si Chulbul baatein. #SinghamAgain.\" ICYDK, Salman is reportedly reprising his role as Chulbul Pandey from Dabangg.

There was some way to go still but an even longer grind for India to protect their proud home streak of 12 years. On a pitch that turned enough, Mitchell Santner and Glenn Phillips exercised a vice grip on the scoring and took six wickets to reduce India to 107 for 7, still trailing by 152 runs and the prospect of a tough chase in the fourth innings looming large.Right from the first over, the threat of the pitch was writ large. Three balls from Santner behaved differently from the same spot: one turned less than expected, one angled in to nearly get Shubman Gill lbw and one turned big part the outside edge. Santner was all over India from that moment on, bowling through the session for figures of 14-1-34-4. It took persistence and patience to get the first wicket, Gill in the 11th over of the day, but newer batters found it incredibly hard to start on this pitch.Once Virat Kohli missed a full toss to be bowled for 1, Tom Latham brought Phillips on for two left-hand batters, whom he duly went on to get, one with the turn and one with a ball that went straight on and stayed low.It was in the first hour that New Zealand needed to keep believing. They kept attacking fields despite Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal's penchant for the big hits. Known of late to respond to such situations with counterattack, India were itching to attack, but the bowling from Santner was good enough to deny them that. Gill managed to hit Tim Southee for a six, but he had to charge at the fast bowler for that. Jaiswal had to play the reverse-sweep to get a boundary.Eventually, Santner was rewarded for the hard work when he had an umpire's call on an lbw go his way. For Gill, this was almost a repeat of the chance in the first over. As the 15 seconds on the DRS timer lapsed, the crowd broke into a big cheer for the arrival of Kohli. The joy for them was short-lived as Kohli soon missed a full toss, which he tried to mow to square leg.By now the effect of the roller was wearing off. Batters were shanking even full balls or those that they got close to by using their feet. The ones that didn't turn created further doubt. As it tends to happen at such times, fielders were everywhere, a hard sweep went straight into the shin of short leg, a short ball stopped and turned, and the pressure kept mounting.It took Phillips four balls to turn one and take Jaiswal's edge to slip. Rishabh Pant, who had been kept quiet with in-out fields, then went to pull one that was only slightly short of a length. The ball stayed low and bowled him, drawing an inaudible invective that might end up hitting Pant in the wallet.Sarfaraz Khan, who showed proficiency against spin in Bengaluru, soon found out that the margin for error was little here. If you had to attack, you needed rank bad balls. He tried to go inside-out to a really full ball, and it still spooned just over cover. His sweep was blocked, and brought him just singles. Eventually he tried to the clear the deepish mid-off without getting to the pitch of the ball, a reminder of Phillips' dismissal on day one. A shooter then did R Ashwin in, the first time Santner went past three wickets in a Test innings.India were now left looking at Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar to rescue them.Sidharth Monga is a senior writer at ESPNcricinfo\r\n\r\nSource link",

Verstappen also went over the track\u2019s white lines while defending, prompting Norris to question the ruling.\r\n\r\nReflecting on the battle ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix, Norris explained, \"I\u2019d probably approach things in a pretty similar way. Slight tweaks here and there. Of course, I didn\u2019t come out on top in the whole battle\u2026 Max is probably the best in the world in this style of defense and attacking. I\u2019m going up against the best, and therefore I\u2019ve got to be at his level,\" Norris was quoted by F1 as saying.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging that he still has progress to make, Norris sees the experience as an opportunity to improve. He added, \"At the minute, I would say I\u2019m not quite at the level I need to be. It\u2019s a shame to say, but it\u2019s probably the truth\u2026 I want to be the one that comes out on top. I believe I rightfully was, but obviously, the penalty changed things.\"\r\n\r\nThe young driver also raised concerns over the current rulings on wheel-to-wheel racing, suggesting there should be clarity for similar scenarios in the future. \"I don\u2019t believe (the penalty) was correct,\" Norris shared. \"The fact of getting off your brakes to achieve the ruling of being ahead at the apex, no matter how wide you run on the exit, is incorrect. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how racing should be.\"\r\n\r\nHe feels the penalty was harsh, saying, \"It\u2019s not that I shouldn\u2019t have got a penalty and he (Verstappen) should\u2026 We were both in the wrong, and therefore I think that\u2019s racing.\"",

        "title": "Asked About Excuse If India Beat Australia Again, Cummins Gives Epic Reply",
        "text": "Australian skipper Pat Cummins hilariously revealed what excuses he will make if his team loses the highly-anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India, which is starting from November 22 onwards at Perth. Cummins was speaking at The Grade Cricketer podcast. On being reminded that he would not have any excuses if he loses the BGT this time around, his first as a captain, Cummins said hilariously, \"I will find some (laughs). Cameron Green was going to open the batting and bowling.\"\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The back surgery for his recurring back issues have ruled Green out of the highly-anticipated Border Gavaskar Trophy against India, beginning on November 22.Green's expected recovery time is considered to be around six months, which will rule him out of Australia's Test tour of Sri Lanka in February and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan. Considering his recovery time, he could also miss out on the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.The 25-year-old reported pain in his lower back during Australia's tour of the UK in September. He went for scans, and the reports revealed a stress fracture. Stress fractures are quite common among fast bowlers, with pacers James Pattinson, Jason Behrendorff, Ben Dwarshuis, and India's Jasprit Bumrah sustaining it during their careers.Green being ruled out disturbs the side's balance heavily. He was given a spot at number four following David Warner's international cricket retirement and Steve Smith's consequent move to opening. Green justified the faith in him with a brilliant 174 batting at the spot against New Zealand this year. With Smith having moved to number four again after producing mixed results as opener, Australia needs an opening partner for Khawaja. They need a solid pace bowling all-rounder to partner Mitchell Marsh and reduce the workloads for trio of Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. However, with Green out, Australian team management has been presented with a huge puzzle they will have to solve carefully.Cummins also revealed that he does not have any say on how wickets would be in Australia but noted that they were good during last couple of seasons.\"It feels like if someone has scored a hundred, they have batted the house down. Taken them a few sessions whereas my first couple of years, some of those wickets were so flat,\" he added.The skipper wants a balanced contest between bat and ball during the series.\"I think some of those Indian spinning wickets as well, I think that last tour, Delhi we should have won, it just get the teams close to each other if you get the wickets like that, but you do not listen to our players complaining about those types of wickets,\" he concluded.After the first Test at Perth from November 22 onwards, the second Test, scheduled for December 6 to 10 at Adelaide Oval, will feature the exciting day-night format under the stadium's lights. After that, fans will turn their attention to The Gabba in Brisbane for the third Test, which will be held from December 14 to 18.The customary Boxing Day Test, set for December 26 to 30 at Melbourne's storied Melbourne Cricket Ground, will bring the series to its penultimate stage.The fifth and final Test, taking place at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3 to 7, will serve as the series climax, promising a dramatic conclusion to an exciting contest.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

In his second attempt, he skillfully lofted the ball to the roof of the net to earn India an important 1-0 lead.India had a chance to extend their lead in the 8th minute after earning two back-to-back PCs but the New Zealand custodian produced outstanding saves.In the following minutes, New Zealand created an attacking formation that helped them make a successful foray into the striking circle, but Rosan Kujur was sharp in his defence to keep them from scoring.New Zealand eventually worked their way through Indian defence in the 17th minute when Elmes scored a fine field goal to equalise. But India was quick to respond, with Rohit striking from the PC to regain the momentum and also lead 2-1.Both teams played with frantic speed and though India created a flurry of PCs towards the end of the second quarter, they could not find success.To their dismay, New Zealand began the third quarter with a fine PC conversion by Elmes, who had struck for the second time.Elmes' fierce power in his drag-flick was a pain-point for Indian defence, as he completed a hat-trick of goals in the 45th minute to take New Zealand 3-2 ahead.India's problems with penalty corner conversion continued in the fourth quarter as they missed a chance in the 46th minute.New Zealand, on the other hand, came up with brilliant counter attacks in the following minutes but Indian defence held sway.With 90 seconds left on the clock, India found a golden opportunity to equalise when they earned a PC.This time, they found success with a splendid variation which was executed to perfection by Priyobarta, ending the thrilling encounter with a 3-3 draw.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Pune, Oct 25 (IANS) Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner grabbed career-best figures of 7-53, while Tom Latham played a fine captain\u2019s knock of 86 as New Zealand put themselves on the verge of a historic series win after ending day two\u2019s play at 198/5 in 53 overs and lead India by 301 runs in the second Test at MCA Stadium here on Friday.\n\nA day after Washington Sundar blew away New Zealand with his 7-59, it was Santner\u2019s turn to torment the Indian batters on a spin-friendly pitch through a stunning exhibition of varying his pace, line and length, flight and dip to pick his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests by bowling 17.3 overs relentlessly and unchanged from the commentary box end. He was also well-supported by Glenn Phillips\u2019 2-26 and helped by some rash shot selection and lack of gumption from the Indian batters.\n\nArmed with a 103-run first-innings lead, Latham was enterprising in his stay at the crease and hit ten boundaries in his vital 133-ball knock of 86. Tom Blundell also looked solid in his unbeaten 30, after putting a stand of 60 runs with Latham for the fifth wicket. The onus will be on him and Glenn Phillips (nine not out) to bat India out of the match, and try to force a result on Saturday.\n\nFor India, whose tactics and fielding placements bordered on the defensive, Washington Sundar again emerged to be the pick of bowlers with 4-56, while Ravichandran Ashwin took a wicket, and the rest of the bowlers couldn\u2019t step up to stop New Zealand\u2019s charge.\n\nIn the morning, resuming from 16/1, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal stitched a 49-run stand for the second wicket. But once Gill was trapped lbw by a quicker delivery from Santner, the wickets started tumbling for India. The crowd at Pune was stunned into silence when Virat Kohli went for a pre-mediated slog-sweep off Santner, but he missed the low full toss which went below his bat to hit the stumps, leaving the ace batter shell-shocked.\n\nPhillips struck in the first over of part-time off-spin as Jaiswal came forward to defend, but gave an outside edge to the first slip. Rishabh Pant was next to fall, after his pre-mediated pull off Phillips went past his bat to hit the stumps.\n\nWith a chance to play sweep-shot blocked, Sarfaraz Khan aimed to go inside-out against Santner but miscued to mid-off. Santner had another moment of absolute joy when he trapped Ravichandran Ashwin lbw with a quicker delivery and cap off a brilliant session for New Zealand to leave India in disarray yet again.\n\nJadeja could have been out first ball post lunch when short leg dived forward to take the catch off his inside edge, which New Zealand didn\u2019t review and replays later showed a spike on the ultra edge. He then put pressure back on Santner with two boundaries, before dancing down the pitch to hit Ajaz Patel for two sixes.\n\nBut Santner got his fifth wicket of the innings by getting a length ball to spin in from outside off-stump and caught Jadeja on the crease by trapping him lbw. Jadeja went for the review, but replays showed the ball clipping leg-stump, as he walked back for 38.\n\nDespite Sundar smashing two fours and a six off Ajaz, Santner swiftly ended India\u2019s innings by knocking over Akash Deep\u2019s off-stump and trapping Jasprit Bumrah lbw to lead the team off the field in the ascendancy.\n\nAfter India conceded a lead of 103 runs, it wasn\u2019t a surprise to see them start with a spin from both ends. But New Zealand were positive in their batting approach \u2013 taking singles to keep the scoreboard moving, using their feet well, and pouncing on anything that fetched them boundaries.\n\nLatham\u2019s proactiveness was evident from the time he brought out the cover drive and glance off Ravichandran Ashwin for two fours, followed by Devon Conway nailing a loft down the ground and sweep off him for a similar result.\n\nThough Conway was trapped lbw on a sweep off Washington Sundar, Latham and Will Young dazzled with their exhibition of the reverse sweep, paddle sweep, conventional sweep and drives. But Young was caught in the crease by a straighter delivery from Ashwin and trapped lbw. The final session began with Sundar\u2019s arm ball sneaking under Rachin Ravindra\u2019s bat and hitting the top of the off-stump. While Latham got his fifty, after being dropped on 49 by Rishabh Pant, Daryl Mitchell got going with a sweep and down the ground boundaries.\n\nBut in a bid to hit a big shot off Washington\u2019s slower ball, Mitchell holed out to long-on. From there, Latham and Blundell picked the lengths easily, especially against Ravindra Jadeja, to get boundaries mostly through the off-side.\n\nBut Washington struck to take his fourth wicket and 11th of the game by trapping Latham lbw on the sweep. Blundell and Phillips hung around to ensure New Zealand ended a day full of complete domination on a high, as India stared at the possibility of losing a Test series at home for the first time since 2012.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nNew Zealand 259 & 198/5 in 53 overs (Tom Latham 86, Tom Blundell 30 not out; Washington Sundar 4-56) lead India 156 all out in 45.3 overs (Ravindra Jadeja 38, Yashasvi Jaiswal 30; Mitchell Santner 7-53, Glenn Phillips 2-26) by 301 runs",

        "text": "Pune: The batters' constant failure in making runs in the first innings is costing the team dear, admitted bowling coach Morne Morkel even as India are in danger of losing the first Test series at home since 2012-13.After getting bundled out for an abysmal 46 in the first innings of the opening Test, India were skittled out for a mere 156 in the first essay of second Test here on Friday as New Zealand took firm control of the match.\"I never like to have a punch up between batters and bowlers but, in Test match cricket you need to score the first innings runs,\" Morkel told the media during the post-day press meet.\"If we put our hand up, we haven't been able to do that. There are world class players in our batting line up. I know that individually, they've got their processes and they know how to go about those things,\" he added.Morkel hoped to see a better outing from Indian batters in the second innings.\"Hopefully, we can iron those mistakes out because it's costing us at the moment \" not getting the runs on the board \" but I'm pretty sure there's enough experience, enough knowledge amongst them to rectify that,\" he added.\"I back the team (to come up) with a strong response in our second innings. I'm excited to see how they bounce back and how they play this situation and the conditions,\" he said.Morkel said India will have to maintain belief and back their knowledge of the conditions to avert losing the match and the series.\"We have to believe. This game is a funny game. Our guys are attacking players, there's guys that know these conditions well. Our talk before this game was that we are masters in these conditions, we know how to sum these conditions up,\" he said.\"Let's be honest, it's going to be a tough task. But what an opportunity for somebody to really inspire and put in a fighting and a top performance \" that's the way I see it.\"When conditions are tricky and tough you'll see real people stand up and fight and if we show that fight and somebody gets the momentum going in these conditions, you never know,\" he said.Morkel said the hosts wanted to see off the overs on Day One when they reached 16/1 in 11 overs and then find momentum on Day Two.\"I think they (New Zealand) bowled very well in partnership. Watching from the outside, it was very hard for us to rotate strike, to keep the scoreboard ticking,\" he said.\"In these sort of conditions where the ball is turning and asking a lot of questions, it is important to do that.\"The pace that (Mitchell) Santner bowled today in particular, was spot on for this surface. On Day Two, arriving here this morning being one down, our camp was very confident that we were going to bat big but unfortunately we just couldn't get that momentum going,\" he added.Morkel praised New Zealand for coming to this tour well-prepared.\"I must give credit to New Zealand. The way they've adapted to conditions, the way they've sort of blocked out what is in front of them and just played the game, it's been incredible so far in this series,\" he said.\"Definitely in Bangalore and here, playing those sessions, playing those important moments they've done it better than us at the moment.\"\"And that's one of the reasons why they're on top of this game at the moment. They're creating pressure with the ball. They're putting our bowlers under pressure by sweeping and reverse-sweeping well.\"They're a team that plans well, they go into tours and really leave no stone unturned so I'm not surprised by the way they're playing at the moment,\" he added.",

        "text": "Chennai: Less than a week after a controversy broke out over the rendering of the Tamil anthem, an official event at the State Secretariat on Friday saw the singers goofing up by mispronouncing a few words in the lyrics, impelling the chief guest, Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, to ask for singing the song once again.Asked about the faux pas later, Udhayanidhi Stalin told the media that it was due to a technical fault and it was not committed by the singers. Since the microphone did not work properly, the voice broke at three or four points and hence they were asked to sing the anthem all over again, he said. Even as the anthem was being rendered by three women at the start of the function organized to present certificates for those who had completed their courses under the Chief Minister\u2019s Fellowship Programme, the Deputy Chief Minister flinched when certain words like \u2018kandamithil\u2019 and \u2018pugazh manakka\u2019 were mispronounced. Later, he asked the secretary of Programme Implementation Department Darez Ahmed to make the singers render the anthem again. It was the same venue, the Nammakkal Kavignar Maligai, that witnessed a kerfuffle following an earthquake scare triggered by a fissure that developed in the first floor due to an air crack on Thursday. Earlier a flaw in the rendering of \u2018Tamil Thaai Vazhthu\u2019 on October 19 at the Doordarshan office in Chennai had also created a controversy, leading to the Doordarshan office apologizing for the mistake of skipping a line during the singing of the anthem. At the certificate distribution event of the Chief Minister\u2019s Fellowship Programme, Udhayanidhi Stalin handed over post graduate degrees on Public Policy and Management to 19 young academics. He said Chief Minister M K Stalin had allocated Rs 6.5 crore for the programme.",

Over 130 gm of MDMA, 10 LSD blots, 4 mobile phones and some other evidence were seized from the gangs. Hyderabad city police commissioner CV Anand said that the kingpin of one of the gang, Kurba, a Sudanese national, had a delivery boy, also a Sudan national, Abdul Rahman Usman alias Annin, in Hyderabad. Kurba gets his supply from 4-5 Tanzanians and Nigerians. The addicts in need of MDMA or cocaine contact Kurba in Bengaluru and make the payment, which is accepted through mule accounts. Then Kurba alerts Annin in Hyderabad to supply the required contraband at a specified location or do dead drop, to evade detection. Annin and Kurba are absconding and the police launched a manhunt for them. In the second case, a local named Imran, a resident of Hyderabad, who is a consumer and supplier of the drug, led to busting of the gang. He got addicted to the drug at a very young age, Anand said. He has been arrested and over 80 gms of MDMA has been seized. Whenever Imran is in need of the drug, he goes to Bengaluru and contacts one Nanda Kumar, who is a native of Kerala, and collects it from him. Naveen is the delivery boy in Hyderabad. Jicquey Ouey, a Nigerian, is the main supplier to Nanda Kumar and Naveen. Nanda Kumar and Naveen are in the custody of H-NEW. All these people operate based on cash on delivery or dead drops. Both the gangs use dead drop -- contact less type of operation. Both the gangs use virtual numbers. \"Now, we have got the technology to track VPNs,\" Anand said. They also use fake identities and fake accounts to transfer money and also elude arrests. Synthetic and semi-synthetic drugs are being supplied to Hyderabadis from Bengaluru, Mumbai and Goa. Ganja is coming from the eastern parts -- Odisha, some parts of AP and Telangana.",

        "text": "Do Patti, which focuses on classic sibling rivalry, also tries to deliver a strong message on domestic violence and abuse of women. Kriti, who is cast in a double role, reveals that her sole aim in turning producer was to narrate stories. \u201cI want to tell stories that need to be told, that have a heart. I am a hungry actor, and in that process, I also end up choosing a film, as well as a character, that is strong and layered\u201d. Though Do Patti has opened to mixed reviews, Kriti Sanon has had a rewarding year, with two back-to-back hits \u2014 the heist comedy Crew, and rom-com with a twist Teri Baaton Mein Uljha Jiya. The actor feels though it\u2019s a hard road for women in cinema, the current trend is that the box office is no longer driven by star power. \u201cThe success or failure of a film have gone beyond the stardom of the actor. It is the content which is the main star of every film. I also want a shift to where it doesn\u2019t matter whether it is a man or a woman who is dominating the film, as long as it is a good film,\u201d she says. Female driven films She feels the recent success of her films as well as of Stree 2, which continues to break records, will help negate the perception that female-driven movies are risky business. \u201cI want people to put in the same amount of money and take the same risks irrespective of gender, which should never be a criteria at all. The actors should be paid based on how much audience they can pull in, regardless of being a man or a woman.\u201d Having made her debut in Heropanti opposite Tiger Shroff, it was the 2017 Bareilly Ki Barfi, which proved to be the game changer for her. Winning the National Award for Best Actress for Mimi cemented her position in Bollywood. An outsider, Kriti says she has indeed come a long way to the point where people know her name and acknowledge her work. \u201cIt all comes down to the kind of actor you want to be perceived as. I am very hungry to be known as a good actor, as well as not be typecast as a glamorous heroine or such-and-such a hero\u2019s heroine. An actor can only fill the vessel according to its size, one needs that scope for performance. Films like Bareilly Ki Barfi and Mimi helped showcase my potential which was not seen before. I am in a good place currently, where I am no longer operating from a place of insecurity or seeking validation.\u201d An entrepreneur The enterprising Kriti has also launched a beauty brand and clothing line with sister Noopur. The actor says, unlike her screen character in Do Patti, she and Noopur share a close bond. \u201cWe have our disagreements and fights, like all siblings do. She is also my best friend. A sister\u2019s love is always there, no matter how hard one tries to push it down.\u201d For Kriti, it\u2019s going to be a hectic Diwali, with the post-release promotions of her film. She has also signed on for something big, she says, but declines to give details. Her current wish list includes being part of an intense love story. \u201cI want to do a Superwoman kind of character which has a lot of action, and a comedy as well,\u201d she says.",

The court stayed the guidelines issued in 2023 which permitted the height of the buildings in the second row and beyond behind the Art Deco buildings to rise to 58 metres and above \u2014 15 storeys or higher compared to the 5-6 floor buildings facing the sea. The Art Deco buildings at Marine Drive and Oval were bestowed the status of a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nThe approximately 35 buildings along the sweep of the seafront, built nearly a hundred years ago on reclaimed land, broke away from the then prevailing Victorian or Gothic style to this one, drawing on the modernism and industrial boom but making a hat tip to the sea through various design elements. They made for a uniform skyline till Nariman Point was built which led UNESCO to state that the precinct had a \u201chigh degree of integrity in visual, spatial and planning terms\u201d.\n\nThe Maharashtra government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation have been trying hard to permit tall constructions behind this front row clearly to allow builders to rake in profits. Doing so will mar the Marine Drive visually and permanently wreck one of the most recognised places in the world. It\u2019s only appropriate that the HC rapped the authorities.",

Kohli and Gambhir's light-hearted exchange added a positive vibe to the session.\u2014 mufaddal_vohra (@mufaddal_vohra) Team India is optimistic that Rishabh Pant will be able to continue as the wicketkeeper in the second Test, despite sustaining a knee injury during the first match, according to assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate.In the opening Test, which marked New Zealand's first victory in India since 1988, Pant played a courageous innings, scoring 99 runs. However, while performing his wicketkeeping duties, he suffered an injury in the same knee that had undergone surgery following a severe car accident in December 2022, which had kept him out of action for over a year.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkTDl5kZ55EAs the home team aims to equalise the three-match series in the upcoming Test in Pune on Thursday, Pant's fitness remains a key concern. Ten Doeschate addressed reporters, saying, \"Rishabh's pretty good. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee. But fingers crossed he'll be good to keep in this Test as well.\"India faced a challenging start in the opening Test, being dismissed for a mere 46 runs. However, a remarkable comeback was staged, led by Pant and Sarfaraz Khan, who formed a formidable 177-run partnership. Sarfaraz, who replaced Shubman Gill in the lineup, showcased his prowess by scoring an impressive 150 runs.With Sarfaraz's maiden Test century, Team India now faces a selection dilemma as Gill is expected to return for the second match. The team management has expressed support for senior batsman KL Rahul, despite his recent inconsistent batting performances. \"There's certainly no concerns about KL,\" affirmed ten Doeschate, \"He's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space, but yeah, we're certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team.\"",

By taking extreme measures, such as using giant heaters and industrial fans to accelerate the drying process, the team hopes to defy Rawalpindi's natural favouring of fast bowlers and turn it into a spinner-friendly surface\u2014one that could prove decisive in the series.Vice-captain Saud Shakeel noted that, unlike Multan, Rawalpindi is not naturally inclined to take turn. Shakeel explained the climatic differences between the cities, with Multan being warmer and more humid, factors that contribute to quicker wear and tear on the surface. The stakes are high for Pakistan, who are coming off a much-needed win in Multan on a spinning wicket. After victory in Multan, slipper Shan Masood, openly expressed his desire for a turning track, the team is focused on replicating the conditions that helped them level the series.\"If you look at the difference between Multan and Pindi, there's a difference in climate,\" Shakeel said in the press conference. \"Multan is warmer than Pindi, Multan is warmer and more humid compared to Pindi. Pindi favours fast bowlers slightly and has more bounce, compared to Multan. The groundsman prepares according to that, and I think that's what causes the changes in the pitch.\"But the way the pitch looks and the success we got in the second Test, we'll try for a similar kind of pitch that favours us and helps us win this game,\" he said.Pakistan's effort to manipulate the pitch, however, has not gone unnoticed by England. English batter Harry Brook speculated that the Rawalpindi surface had been \"raked\" to encourage early deterioration, a tactic designed to bring spinners into play from the start.In response, England announced their XI early, opting for just one specialist seamer, Gus Atkinson, and relying heavily on their spin trio, including leg spinner Rehan Ahmed. This strategic move signals that England is prepared to face another spin-heavy battle and could be a direct response to Pakistan's efforts to reshape the pitch to their advantage.Pakistan's struggle to figure out the best use of home conditions has been ongoing since their return from playing in the UAE. Initially, the team experimented with seam-friendly pitches to capitalize on the talents of fast bowlers like Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, leading to early successes against Sri Lanka and South Africa.With IANS inputs",

It was once referred to as the \"second legislative assembly\" as as many of its members were MLAs, MPs, ministers, and former chief ministers, who were often seen there with their families. Former chief minister M. Chenna Reddy once served as the club's chairman. The current members have raised concerns about the underutilisation of some of the club's amenities. There is also a demand to bring into use the 100-seat dining table and the pure silverware and utensils that were gifted to the club by the Nizam. It is said that the table and silverware resemble those at Falaknuma Palace. This club is famous for its authentic food, bridge and cards, and sporting facilities like billiards, a gym, and a spa. It has gained increased patronage from families, especially for its tambola, which draws around a 1,000 attendees on weekends. S.R. Vijay Raj, executive committee member, explained, \u201cThere were several challenges before the committee, but we gradually resolved many of them. The main issue with the lawn tennis facilities will be resolved soon. Recently, the club was refurbished, especially the Pavilion Bar, which is modeled after the one at Lord's Club in England.\u201d T. Shesh Narayana, one of the contestants, said, \u201cThe club used to host international sports events, especially cricket matches. Many former players spent their evenings here whenever international cricket was held in the city. The last match here was in 2002, between India and New Zealand.\u201d \u201cThe club has several international players as members, including Mohammed Azharuddin, Arshad Ayub, Hari Krishna Prasad, and many more,\u201d he said.",

Bonds and fixed deposits feel safer to me, especially with the economic uncertainties we face,\u201d said Anita Rao, a 45-year-old teacher.The study found that regret aversion bias played a significant role, with 50 per cent of women preferring safer investments to avoid future regret. This conservative stance, while reducing risk, also limited their potential for higher returns. The findings throw light on the need for financial advisors to offer personalised advice, helping women navigate these psychological biases.The study also highlights overconfidence bias, which affected over 30 per cent of women. These investors tend to overestimate their decision-making abilities, resulting in frequent trading. Confirmation bias, which led 40 per cent of participants to favour information that supported their existing beliefs, often resulted in missed opportunities for diversification. \u201cI used to think my decisions were foolproof, given my qualifications and a little research that I did, but later I have realised the need to consult experts,\u201d said Meghana Reddy, a 34-year-old IT professional, who has since diversified her portfolio after seeking professional advice.Trend-chasing bias was found among 35 per cent of the women surveyed, making them susceptible to market volatility. Many followed market trends without thorough analysis, leading to potential losses during downturns. \u201cI used to follow the crowd, but after a few setbacks, I\u2019m more cautious. Now, I focus on long-term stability rather than quick gains,\u201d Priya Jain, 29, a fashion entrepreneur, told Deccan Chronicle.\u201cThe idea that women can\u2019t process numbers or money was a crazy lie made up to keep women away from accountability and independence. Tailored guidance can empower women to make more informed, balanced, and diversified financial decisions,\u201d said Madhava R.K., a chartered accountant-turned-financial adviser",

        "text": "Berlin, Oct 23 (IANS) Bundesliga side RB Leipzig has become familiar with Europe\u2019s legendary teams during the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League campaign. After facing Atletico Madrid and Juventus, the 2023 German Cup winners will now host Liverpool FC this Wednesday evening.\n\nWhile Leipzig recorded narrow defeats against Atletico Madrid (2-1) and Juventus (3-2), their match against Liverpool offers another opportunity for the German side to make an impact. Despite the two losses, coach Marco Rose\u2019s team pushed both giants to the brink, with both games decided in the dying minutes. Liverpool, the current Premier League leaders, present a formidable challenge, but Leipzig\u2019s top scorer, Slovenian international Benjamin Sesko, will once again step into the spotlight, reports Xinhua.\n\nSesko has scored all three of Leipzig\u2019s Champions League goals so far, adding to his two goals and two assists in the 2024/25 Bundesliga campaign, which was a clear sign of the 21-year-old\u2019s rising form.\n\nLeipzig\u2019s defensive stability makes them a serious contender. Unbeaten in the Bundesliga and conceding just two goals in seven games, they pose a strong challenge for Liverpool. Sesko, often compared to Manchester City\u2019s Erling Haaland due to his similar physical attributes (Sesko: 1.95 meters, Haaland: 1.94 meters), has largely avoided the spotlight. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to compare me to Haaland,\u201d Sesko has said, adding, \u201cI have my own path.\u201d\n\nSesko\u2019s potential has drawn interest from top European clubs, with Arsenal, PSG, and Milan rumoured to have been tracking him. Despite reports of a 65-million-euro exit clause, the 37-time capped forward extended his contract with Leipzig until 2029.\n\nLeipzig\u2019s strong defensive record six clean sheets in seven league games and Sesko\u2019s goal-scoring prowess position them as serious contenders in Europe. For Sesko, the upcoming duel with Liverpool\u2019s Virgil van Dijk, one of Europe\u2019s top defenders, could be decisive in Wednesday\u2019s clash.\n\nPundits and coaches have predicted a bright future for Sesko. Bayern Munich\u2019s sporting director Christoph Freund and RB Leipzig CEO Marcel Schafer have closely followed his progress, discovering him, like Haaland, in the Red Bull system. Though Sesko may not yet match Haaland\u2019s physical dominance, his technical skills continue to develop as he adapts to the faster pace of the Bundesliga.\n\nWhile Haaland currently has the edge in terms of efficiency, Sesko is closing the gap. It\u2019s no bold prediction to say he could soon be playing for one of Europe\u2019s top clubs.",

The other affected institutions were the CRPF Public School in Rohini and Dwarka of Delhi, and the Kendriya Vidyalayas within the paramilitary forces' office premises at Panchkula (Haryana) and Rampur (Uttar Pradesh). A senior Delhi police officer, who did not wish to named, said the cyber cell has launched a probe into the threat mail that came a day after a blast along the boundary wall of CRPF Public School in Rohini in Delhi. He also said Delhi police has written to the email service provider to get the user ID and other details of the sender. In the e-mail, according to sources, the sender mentioned about politics in Tamil Nadu and sacked DMK functionary Jaffer Sadiq.

        "text": "John McGinn said there is no limit to Aston Villa's ambition in the Champions League after beating Bologna 2-0 to go top of the table in a dream return to the competition. Villa last played in the top tier of European football back in 1983 but Unai Emery's transformation of a sleeping giant knows no bounds as they became the only side to register three wins from three Champions League games so far. McGinn's free-kick flew beyond everyone into the far corner to open the scoring in the second half before Jhon Duran kept up his prolific strike rate on a rare start for the Colombian.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"We don't want to stop here. It puts us in a great position,\" said McGinn, who joined the club when they were still in the second tier of English football in 2018.\"What we are building here is amazing.\"This is home for me. It is my seventh season here, we've had ups and downs. It has been a rollercoaster. Hopefully we can keep climbing.\"Bologna, by contrast, have just one point from their opening three games and one win in 11 games in all competitions this season.The Rossoblu were one of the stories of European football last season as they finished fifth in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 60 years.However, they have struggled since losing star players Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirkzee to Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United, while coach Thiago Motta left to take charge of Juventus.Emery said on the eve of the game he wants to \"break barriers\" at a club that has not won a trophy since 1996.And the Spaniard showed the impressive strength in depth at his disposal with a comfortable win despite making four changes.\"We are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and maturing in everything,\" said Emery.Duran was finally handed his first start in either the Premier League or Champions League after scoring five times as a substitute this season.Set-piece specialistsMcGinn and England international Ezri Konsa returned from injury, while 35 million pounds ($46 million) signing Ian Maatsen came in at left-back.French international Boubacar Kamara made his return from a serious knee injury as a late substitute, while club captain Tyrone Mings was on the bench for the first time since suffering an ACL injury in August 2023.Villa's strength from set-pieces has been one of the keys to Emery's transformation of the club from battling relegation to beating off Europe's finest over the past two years.McGinn's enticing delivery did not even need a touch from the cluster of bodies in the box as the Scotland midfielder's strike found the bottom corner to break the deadlock 10 minutes into the second half.Nine minutes later, Duran made sure of the points with a clinical near-post finish from Morgan Rogers' cross.The combustible striker then showed his displeasure at being replaced by Ollie Watkins moments later as he punched the bench in frustration.But that did not take the shine off another memorable night for Villa in their meteoric rise since Emery arrived in Birmingham.Nine points may already be enough to secure a playoff place with five games to spare.Only the bottom 12 in the 36-team table will be eliminated, but Villa's sights are now on trying to secure a top-eight finish and automatic qualification for the last 16.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "PSG Pay For Missed Chances Again In PSV Champions League Draw",
        "text": "Paris Saint-Germain's stuttering start in this season's Champions League continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw by PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday, leading coach Luis Enrique to admit he was \"worried\" about his team's prospects. The Dutch champions led through a Noa Lang strike just after the half-hour mark at the Parc des Princes, but Achraf Hakimi equalised early in the second half. Nevertheless, this was a game PSG should have won given the chances they created, but once again they struggled to put the ball in the net, a recurring problem in Europe.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"It is difficult to accept the result after a game like that but we already knew that football is often unfair,\" Luis Enrique said. \"We played well throughout and were better than PSV.\"PSG's frustration was summed up when they were awarded a penalty in injury time after a challenge on Marco Asensio, only for the decision to be overturned on review. The French giants had 26 attempts on goal to their opponents' eight. They have now scored just twice in their last five matches in the Champions League, with the other an own-goal against Girona last month.That run goes back to last season's semi-final against Borussia Dortmund which they lost 2-0 on aggregate.\"I think it is obvious that we created a lot more chances than our opponents and we deserved to win the game,\" Luis Enrique added.After a narrow 1-0 victory against Girona and a 2-0 defeat away to Arsenal in their first two matches in the new-look format of the competition, PSG have just four points from a possible nine.There are still five games to play but they have Atletico Madrid at home next followed by Bayern Munich away, suggesting things will not get any easier.\"It is the worst group (fixtures) and we need to be prepared to improve what we can and keep going. But yes, it is difficult and of course I am worried,\" the coach added.PSV, meanwhile, are still winless having previously lost away to Juventus before drawing with Sporting.That shows how big a step up playing in Europe is for the Dutch side, who have a perfect record after nine games in this season's Eredivisie.\"The players did a great job tonight and I am really proud of them to be leaving here with a point,\" said PSV coach Peter Bosz.Rested in Ligue 1 last weekend and controversially dropped against Arsenal, Ousmane Dembele was back in the starting line-up for PSG.Dembele missesThe France winger has never been a deadly finisher and was guilty of missing a couple of big chances in the first half.Lee Kang-in, preferred to Randal Kolo Muani in PSG's attack, was first to force a save from visiting goalkeeper Walter Benitez.Dembele then should have scored in the 19th minute when he arrived unmarked at the back post to meet an inviting cross from the left, but his effort on the half-volley clipped the bar.That was followed by another miss on the half-hour mark as Dembele was played in by a clever Joao Neves pass off the chest, but he blazed over the bar.Having offered little going forward, PSV went ahead on 34 minutes.An Olivier Boscagli interception left the home team exposed, and Ismael Saibari supplied Lang who blasted in a low shot from the edge of the area.PSG were now in danger of a seventh defeat in 15 games in the Champions League since the start of last season, but they found an equaliser on 55 minutes.Hakimi tried a speculative shot from 25 metres which was simply too powerful for Benitez as the ball passed through the goalkeeper's legs.The same player came close to putting PSG ahead before drama ensued in injury time.Swedish referee Glenn Nyberg pointed to the spot in the 93rd minute when Boscagli lunged into a tackle on Marco Asensio, but the defender played the ball and the penalty was cancelled after a VAR check.Benitez then saved PSV with a brilliant save from a Marquinhos header, and the final whistle was met with boos by the home fans.The Qatar-owned club's prospects of finally landing a first ever Champions League title this season currently seem remote.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Veterans Roy Krishna and Mourtada Fall found the net as Odisha FC beat East Bengal 2-1 at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday to register their second win of the Indian Super League season. \n\nKrishna and Fall scored either side of a first-half penalty from East Bengal striker Dimitrios Diamantakos to climb to seventh in the table.\n\nWith this loss, the Red & Gold Brigade succumbed to their sixth successive loss this ISL season and a second consecutive one under new head coach Oscar Bruzon. \n\nThe stage for the same was set up by Krishna in the 22nd minute, as the Fijian forward scored his fourth goal against East Bengal FC in the competition. Livewire youngster Isak Vanlalruatfela was given plenty of space on the left flank when he launched a slightly long-ranged through delivery for Krishna. \n\nThe striker was in the right place at the right time to pierce through the visitors\u2019 backline. He collected the ball at ease, marched forward and mastered the 1v1 situation with East Bengal goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Singh Gill to land the ball in the bottom right corner.\n\nOdisha held on to that lead dearly until midfielder Thoiba Singh floundered and handled the ball in the penalty area as the first half was about to draw to an end. Diamantakos stepped up to snap his scoreless streak and net for the first time in five ISL matches. With his left foot, he deposited the ball into the bottom right corner, past a fully stretched Amrinder Singh.\n\nIn the second half, Odisha had to regain control back over the proceedings, and Lobera\u2019s trusted lieutenants \u2013 Fall and Ahmed Jahouh, yet again answered his call. A free-kick on the inside channel of the right flank, at distance, was sufficient for the duo to turn the tables as Jahouh\u2019s impeccable delivery was directed accurately to Fall, who nodded the ball home and secured the lead back for his team in the 69th minute.\n\nMatters got further complicated for East Bengal when Provat Lakra was sent off for a second yellow card in the 76th minute for a tackle on Jahouh. Being a man down, they were unable to catch up with a well-coordinated Odisha FC unit, who walked back with three points in their bag. \n\nWith this defeat, East Bengal FC have now become the second team in ISL history to lose their first six matches of the season after NorthEast United FC in 2022-23, who had faced defeats in all of their opening 10 games.",

        "title": "Beyond Biryani, Hyderabad is a tech hub",
        "text": "Beyond Biryani: The Making of a Globalised Hyderabad, is not a book about other foods one can try in the city. It is a book where author Dinesh C Sharma attempts to break the stereotype about Hyderabad. In his book he portrays the city as a hub of science and technology. The non-fiction narrative delves into Hyderabad\u2019s journey from being a proto-colonial city under a quasi-Mughal princely state in the 1940s to a thriving, modern metropolis. \n\nDinesh is an award-winning journalist and author with over 30 years of experience in reporting on science, technology, innovation, medicine and environment-related issues for national and international media outlets. Though he has lived away from the city for the past 34 years, Hyderabad is his home as he was born and educated here. \n\nThis is Dinesh\u2019s fifth book, the idea of which germinated while penning his first book about Bengaluru. Dinesh says, \u201cIn my first book The Long Revolution (2009) on the tech craze, Hyderabad was not a significant chapter, it was a story in the passing. As someone who wrote about science, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Hyderabad beyond biryani and presenting its other lucrative and technological side. My book challenges stereotypes, and talks about Hyderabad\u2019s evolution from being a heritage city to a technological hub. The book aims to create a new perspective on Hyderabad, one that transcends the stereotypes of the Nizams and biryani and presents an alternative history. I see Hyderabad as a preferred destination for leading scientific and technological institutions and companies around the world.\u201d\n\nDinesh mentioned that he started working on the book in 2020 after he received the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund. Even though he had been collecting information and doing his research since his first book, he started working full-time on this one in 2020. \u201cFrom missiles and satellites to affordable HIV drugs and COVID-19 vaccines, Hyderabad delivers everything that today\u2019s India is known for. These successes are a result of a long journey of building key institutions over the decades. Despite all this, any mention of Hyderabad goes straight to discussions on biryani.\u201d\n\nAnother reason that prompted Dinesh to focus on the new avatar of Hyderabad is the exponential growth that one could witness and the reasons that made Bengaluru and Hyderabad develop a knowledge-based industry, and giant tech clusters, something that other cities with similar trajectories could not.\n\nHe adds, \u201cMy research was never-ending. Every time I visit, I chance upon something new; every month, there is something new coming up. In the process, I also discovered interesting facts and facets: how the Nizams laid the foundation for inculcating a scientific temper under British rule; how they set up India\u2019s first vernacular university in the city; and how a newly independent India pushed forward on the path of industrial laboratories as well as nuclear fuel and missiles. The book also looks at the last 30 years when Hyderabad has taken a giant leap towards becoming a modern preferred destination. An alternative history.\n\n Why did the author choose the title? \u201cNo one refuses biryani,\u201d he laughs.",

Vinicius produced a brilliant solo goal for Madrid's fourth and slammed in the fifth as Los Blancos ended Dortmund's 100 percent start to the competition by producing another comeback to add to a vast collection in Europe. \"We know that when we are at home, with our fans, anything can happen,\" Vinicius told Movistar. \"We went in (at half-time) very quiet and just listened to the coach, we said just one thing. \"If we scored the first, we would come back once again, and we made another comeback, thanks to the fans and the whole team who gave everything.\" Madrid coach Ancelotti brought Rodrygo into the attack alongside Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius, reverting to a 4-3-3 formation after a brief experiment with three at the back in the narrow La Liga win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. After midfield maestro Toni Kroos' retirement and while trying to bed Mbappe into the team, Madrid have struggled to find balance and consistency this season. They were frustrated for the first half an hour of the game by the visitors, unable to create clear cut openings before the game burst open. Malen opened the scoring with a cool finish after Julian Brandt won the ball back on the edge of the area and Serhou Guirassy squeezed a pass through a tight gap to find the Dutch winger. Four minutes later Malen created the second, using his explosive pace to escape Ferland Mendy and crossing for Gittens to gleefully finish. Madrid responded by carving open Dortmund before the break but without finding a killer finish. Bellingham, without a goal in 10 games this season, headed straight at Gregor Kobel when he ran onto a scooped pass into the area. The England international, facing his former club, then struck the crossbar from close range on the rebound after team-mate Rodrygo had also hit the woodwork, with Madrid fans barely able to believe they had not scored. Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made a fine save to thwart Brandt before the break when the midfielder let fly from outside the area.'We'll fight for everything' The hosts turned the screw in the second half and Kobel saved well at the near post from Lucas Vazquez but could not keep out Rudiger's powerful header from Mbappe's cross after an hour. Two minutes later Madrid were level when Mbappe was tackled in the area but the ball fell invitingly for Vinicius to stroke home with ease. Dortmund coach Nuri Sahin, formerly a Madrid player, took off goalscorers Gitten and Malen but his team could not keep the insatiable hosts at bay. Madrid's comeback was completed by Vazquez after Rodrygo did well to keep the ball from going out of play, and Vinicius added shine with his fine fourth. The Brazilian, expected to claim a first Ballon d'Or on Monday in Paris, carried the ball forward without support and produced a lethal low finish. Vinicius then added a fifth by bursting into the area and rifling past Kobel, also issuing a warning to La Liga leaders Barcelona who visit the Bernabeu on Saturday in La Liga. \"We'll go for it, in our stadium, with our fans, and we will fight for everything this season like always,\" added Vinicius.",

        "title": "Champions League: Arsenal grind out win over Shakhtar",
        "text": "London: Arsenal bounced back from their embarrassment at Bournemouth as an own goal from Shakhtar Donetsk keeper Dmytro Riznyk gave the Gunners a 1-0 win in the Champions League on Tuesday. Mikel Arteta's side crashed to a damaging 2-0 defeat against the Cherries in the Premier League last weekend. That was Arsenal's first loss in all competitions since the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Bayern Munich in April. Their response against Shakhtar was unconvincing, but they did enough to claim three points thanks to Riznyk's first half own goal from Gabriel Martinelli's strike. Leandro Trossard missed a late Arsenal penalty that would have put a flattering gloss on the scoreline at the Emirates Stadium. Worryingly for Arteta, Riccardo Calafiori was forced off in the second half after appearing to injury his knee in the latest injury blow for a team currently missing Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Jurrien Timber. Arteta is already without suspended French defender William Saliba for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool. Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice admitted his side let their \"standards slip\" after Saliba's red card against Bournemouth set them on the way to their first Premier League defeat this season. Arteta had urged his players to use the \"pain\" of that setback as motivation against Shakhtar, but the response was tepid. The Gunners have seven points from their opening three Champions League games, yet this was a far cry from the impressive 2-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain in their previous tie. With one point from three games, Shakhtar remain without a goal in the Champions League this term. The Ukrainian champions spent 17 hours travelling to north London by bus, train and plane, setting off from Kiev on Friday and stopping in Lviv before reaching Poland for a flight to England. Unable to play home European fixtures in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, Marino Pushych's side competed gamely but lacked a cutting edge. Lethargic ArsenalArsenal midfielder Mikel Merino compared his side to an NBA basketball team after nine of the starting line-up at Bournemouth stood over 6ft tall. That imposing strength is key to Arsenal's set-piece prowess and they should have taken an early lead from Trossard's corner, only for Calafiori to shoot wastefully over from close-range. Shakhtar had managed just one shot on target in their first two Champions League games, but they threatened a shock opener when Eguinaldo's goal-bound shot was blocked by Gabriel Magalhaes. Arsenal were in control without ever looking dominant before their fortuitous opener in the 29th minute. Martinelli teased the Shakhtar defence with a menacing raid before cutting inside to unload a low drive that hit the post and rebounded into the net off the unlucky Riznyk's back. Kai Havertz came within a whisker of doubling Arsenal's lead when Mykola Matviyenko made an agile goal-line clearance as the German prepared to head in Gabriel Jesus's cross. Jesus had the captain's armband as Arteta tried to give him a confidence boost following 22 games without a goal. But Jesus was guilty of a poor finish, taking Havertz's pass and shooting too close to Riznyk from close-range. Arsenal right-back Ben White, fortunate to avoid a second booking late in the first half, was replaced at the interval, with Thomas Partey moving from midfield to fill in. Trossard headed wide from Martinelli's cross before Riznyk plunged to his right to keep out Martinelli's blast. Unusually subdued in attack, Arsenal squandered a golden opportunity in the closing stages when Valerii Bondar blocked Merino's cross with an out-stretched arm. Trossard took the penalty but his tame effort was easily saved by Riznyk, a miss that sparked a nervous finale for lethargic Arsenal. Pedrinho's powerful strike from 18 yards was pushed away by Arsenal keeper David Raya before Marlon Gomes' header was gratefully clutched by the Spaniard as the Gunners held on.Arsenal's Brazilian striker #09 Gabriel Jesus (L) shoots the ball but misses to score during the UEFA Champions League football match between Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk at the Emirates Stadium in north London on October 22, 2024.

        "text": "New Delhi: Sanju Samson recently opened up about his struggles during the Bangladesh T20I series, where he felt the pressure to perform and justify the faith shown in him by India\u2019s head coach, Gautam Gambhir. After disappointing performances in the first two T20Is, Samson admitted he found it hard to make eye contact with Gambhir, who had been consistently backing him. However, he turned things around in the third T20I, smashing 111 runs off just 47 balls, including 11 fours and eight sixes. Samson said, \u201cI didn\u2019t score big in the first two matches, and I was hesitant to make eye contact with Gambhir sir. But I kept telling myself 'apna time aayega' (my time will come). When I got that hundred in Hyderabad, and I saw him clapping, it was a great feeling.\u201d Samson highlighted the importance of the coach-player relationship, acknowledging that Gambhir's trust motivated him to perform. \"I desperately wanted to show Gauti bhai that if you are backing me, I won\u2019t disappoint you,\u201d he said. Reflecting on another missed opportunity, Samson shared his emotions after being left out of the playing XI for a World Cup final. Despite being ready to play, the team decided to go with the same XI. Samson recalled how captain Rohit Sharma took the time to explain the decision, even though he wasn\u2019t part of the final lineup. \u201cRohit came to me during the warm-up and explained why they chose the same team. I told him, let us win the match, then we can talk.\u201d Samson appreciated Rohit's approach, particularly how the captain spent time with a non-playing member before such a crucial game. \u201cHe gave me 10 minutes before the toss, explaining the decision. At that moment, I realised this person has a unique quality. He wasn't just thinking about the players who were in the XI; he took the time to explain to me why I wasn't playing. That gesture won my respect for a lifetime.\u201d Samson also expressed his regret about not playing in the final, saying it would be a moment he would carry with him, especially missing the chance to play under Rohit in such a crucial match.",

        "title": "India vs NZ \u2013 Gautam Gambhir backs KL Rahul, but will he play in Pune?",
        "text": "India coach Gautam Gambhir has vehemently backed KL Rahul to come good amid mounting scrutiny on his recent form in Test cricket. After making a duck in India's 46 all out in the first innings of the Bengaluru Test, Rahul was dismissed for 12 in the second as India lost to New Zealand by eight wickets.\"You don't pick players on social media because of social media or for that matter even what the experts are saying,\" Gambhir said on while addressing Rahul's form on the eve of the second Test in Pune. \"What the team management thinks and what the leadership group thinks is very, very important. Ultimately, everyone is judged.\"International cricket is all about being judged, to be honest, because everyone's performance will be judged eventually. But I feel that he [Rahul] is batting really well. Obviously, he has had a decent knock in Kanpur [against Bangladesh] obviously, on a difficult wicket. And obviously, he played according to the plans as well. And I am sure, I think, he would also be knowing that he wants to score big runs and he has that capability of scoring runs. That's why he has been backed by the team management.\"While Rahul has built a strong body of work overseas - he has hundreds in South Africa, England and Australia - his average of 33.87 is the lowest among all specialist batters to have played at least 50 Tests for India.With Shubman Gill, who missed the first Test because of neck stiffness, set to bat at No. 3 in Pune, India will have to make a choice between Rahul and Sarfaraz Khan, who scored his maiden Test century in Bengaluru. Sarfaraz, who took a short break after the first Test because of the birth of his child, rejoined the India side and trained in Pune on Wednesday.While Sarfaraz might have the edge over Rahul after his 150 in Bengaluru, Gambhir did not reveal which way the team was leaning.India also have another choice to make between left-arm wristspinner Kuldeep Yadav and offspin allrounder Washington Sundar, who was added to squad after the defeat Bengaluru. Apart from boosting India's spin stocks on a dry, black-soil surface, Washington could add depth to the batting line-up. In his most recent red-ball game, in the second round of the Ranji Trophy, he made 152 at No.3 for Tamil Nadu against Delhi.\"We just felt that probably they [New Zealand] have four or five left-handers in the playing XI,\" Gambhir said of Washington's inclusion in the squad. \"That if we want to have another bowler who can take the ball away from the left-handers, it is always going to be useful for us. But we haven't still decided what is going to be the playing XI.\"We believe that probably there are two [left-hand] opening batters and Rachin [Ravindra] in the middle order. So, we feel that if Washy can give us more control in the middle, it is always going to be good for us.\"While managing the workload of the fast bowlers remains a priority for India's team management heading into a five-Test tour of Australia, Gambhir suggested it won't be done when the series is on the line against New Zealand in Pune and when crucial World Test Championship (WTC) points are at stake. For India to seal their place in the WTC final, irrespective of other results, they need at least four wins and one draw (52 points) in their remaining seven Tests, which will give them 65.79 percentage points.Gambhir, though, said the team was monitoring the workload of Jasprit Bumrah, who has played each of India's three Tests so far in this home season.\"Once the [New Zealand Test] series is over, we still have around 10 or 12 days before the Test starts in Australia,\" Gambhir said. \"So, that's enough break for our fast bowlers. But we will still monitor after the Test match where Jasprit Bumrah is. But it's not only about Jasprit Bumrah. It's about all the fast bowlers. We want to keep them fresh. We know that obviously we've got a long tour and an important tour of Australia.\"But workload management will definitely depend on what the outcome of this Test match is and how much have they bowled in this Test match.\"\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "title": "'Take Mayank Yadav to Australia if...': Lee",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: Brett Lee, a legendary fast bowler known for his devastating pace, strongly believes that if Mohammed Shami is unavailable for selection, Mayank Yadav should be included in the Indian squad for the upcoming tour of Australia. Lee has high expectations from the young Indian pace sensation, particularly on the true and bouncy pitches in Australia.India, who are aiming to secure a spot in their third consecutive World Test Championship (WTC) final, will be traveling to Australia next month to defend the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, there are uncertainties surrounding the selection of experienced seamer Mohammed Shami for the five-match Test series.\"I can tell you that batters are okay when you bowl that 135-140 kmph speed, but when you bowl high 150s, I don't care who it is, no one wants to face that.\"He looks like someone who is a complete package, if Mohammed Shami is not ready, at least get him (Mayank) in the squad. I think he would do pretty well on these Australian wickets,\" Lee told Fox Cricket.Shami's last appearance was in the ODI World Cup final in November, and despite his recent intense training sessions the Indian captain Rohit Sharma is reluctant to include him in the squad for Australia if he is not fully prepared.Lee is well-versed in the challenges batsmen face when confronting high-speed deliveries.Lee said, \"The great thing is with me that I get to work on the IPL and see a lot of good young Indian cricketers. Mayank Yadav, to watch his first IPL game recently, hit 157 kmph first up in his first game.\"Unfortunately, his franchise probably brought him a little early and he did his side again.\"They put him in cotton wool for a bit. The great thing about India is that they are not worried about how much cricket someone has played or hasn't played, if he is ready to go, get him in there. I actually love that theory,\" Lee added.India possess a formidable bowling lineup capable of challenging Australian batsmen on their home turf. Lee recognized the potency of the Indian bowling unit.\"Ashwin is approaching 600 wickets, he has got that beautiful shape when he bowls spin. He can bowl with the new ball as well but I think if India have to win there, then Shami (provided he is fit) can definitely hold the key.\"Jasprit Bumrah, we all know how good he is, he can bowl both ways, he is a great exponent of reverse swing. Mohammed Siraj knows how to make the new ball talk.\"On wickets like Perth, Adelaide, for me it's the combination, these three fast bowlers with Ashwin as the spinner. Then they have got options with guys like who are part-time spinners. But you need to have those three quicks firing if India wants to win,\" Lee said.'India don't want to bow down'Lee described the Indian team as a \"powerhouse that refuses to bow down\" to any opponent, issuing a warning to his fellow Australians ahead of their clash with the Asian giants starting on November 22.His comments followed India's eight-wicket loss to New Zealand in the Bengaluru Test earlier this week.\"This day and age, India is a powerhouse that don't want to bow down. They know how to win, and they know they can beat Australia; they know they can beat the Kiwis. They know they can beat anyone on any given day,\" Lee said.Reflecting on India's performance in the Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, Lee suggested that they might have been influenced by the 'Bazball' approach, which led to some loose shot selection.\"India just didn't go into their shell. Maybe it's Bazball brushing off on other cricketers around the world,\" he noted.\"I know that India won't be proud of the way they played. They played some pretty loose shots.\"India's decision to bat first in overcast conditions raised concerns, as the team was dismissed for just 46 in the first innings of the opening Test - their lowest Test score at home.Lee remarked that the team needs to \"weigh up the risk factor\" and emphasized that the Indians should have assessed the conditions more carefully.\"But, you've got to weigh up the risk factor as well. There are times when you've got to go, 'Okay, well, maybe the big shots aren't working today'.\"Maybe, just rein it in a little bit. I don't think they sort of summed up the conditions as quickly as what they should have done,\" Lee said.India play two more Tests against New Zealand -- Pune (October 24-28) and Mumbai (November 1-5) -- before leaving for Australia.",

        "title": "India vs New Zealand 2024/25, IND vs NZ 2nd Test Match Preview",
        "text": "Big pictureIndia have been here before. It hasn't happened all that often in the recent past, but they've been 1-0 down in a home Test series. It happened against Australia in 2017, and then against England in 2021. Both times, they came back to win the series.Both those series, however, were four Tests long. India's current generation have never really been in the situation they are in now against New Zealand: 1-0 down at home, with only two Tests to go.It puts them under immense pressure. Beating India in India remains the toughest challenge in Test cricket today, but away teams over the last two years have been winning Tests here more frequently than they used to. It's a sign, perhaps, of one era transitioning into another, a reminder of the cricketing mortality of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.This doesn't change the fact, however, that India remain overwhelming favourites when the second Test begins on Thursday. New Zealand won in Bengaluru, yes, but they won via the perfect storm brewed up by the weather and a deceptive pitch that led India to make what turned out to be the wrong toss and selection calls for those conditions. New Zealand were themselves poised to make the same toss call had Tom Latham called correctly.It isn't often that a visiting side shows up for a Test match in India and finds conditions that suit them more than the home side. Before Bengaluru 2024, it had perhaps happened twice in this century: Nagpur 2004 and Ahmedabad 2008.Pune will not be like Bengaluru. India have made every effort possible to restore to this series the one major ingredient it had lacked up to this point: home advantage. The specifics of how the Pune pitch will behave will only become clear when the match begins, but the broad outline is likely to be a lot less help for New Zealand's quicks, and a lot more room for India to maximise the superior skill and control of their spin attack. It won't guarantee the result they want, not against this superb New Zealand side, but whether they win, lose or draw, India will journey to their fate on something like their own terms.Form guideIndia LWWWW (last five Tests, most recent first)New Zealand WLLLLIn the spotlight - Shubman Gill and Glenn PhillipsShubman Gill has found a new level as a Test batter since his move to No. 3 last year, averaging 43.23 across 11 matches and scoring three hundreds (https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/1070173.html?class=1;spanmin1=12+jul+2023;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=innings). He got through a regular workload in the nets in the lead-up to the second Test, suggesting he will return to India's line-up after missing the Bengaluru Test with a stiff neck. With Gill back at No. 3, India's batting order will wear a far more settled look, with the names below his back in their natural habitats.Since his return to New Zealand's Test side in December 2023, Glenn Phillips has taken 23 wickets in nine Tests at an average of 26.47. Of all spinners with at least 15 wickets in this time, only Keshav Maharaj, Nathan Lyon and India's big three have better averages. It's quite a record for an offspinner who was until recently considered a part-timer. Phillips bowled 15 second-innings overs in Bengaluru and picked up the wicket of Virat Kohli. He may have to get through a bigger workload on a more helpful pitch in Pune, even if New Zealand bolster their spin attack, and could have quite an influence on the game if he can chip in with a big wicket or two. His ability to score quickly down the order could be handy too, handier still if it's a low-scoring Test.Shubman Gill is likely to make a comeback in the Pune Test\u2022AFP/Getty ImagesTeam news - Sarfaraz vs Rahul, Southee vs O'Rourke?India have two major decisions to make with regards to their XI. With Gill set to return, they will have to leave out either KL Rahul, who has fairly good returns across a small sample size - a century and two fifties in six Tests - since his middle-order move late last year, and Sarfaraz Khan, who scored a rollicking second-innings hundred in Bengaluru. There's also the question of the second seamer: should Akash Deep, who has looked like a natural in Indian conditions in his brief Test career so far, come in for Mohammed Siraj, whose 13 home Tests have brought him just the 19 wickets at 36.15? A dry pitch is expected to provide ample assistance to the spinners, so India will most likely stick to playing three of them. They have no major reason yet to look beyond the trio of Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav, even if Washington Sundar and Axar Patel make compelling cases as allrounders.India: 1 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 2 Rohit Sharma (capt), 3 Shubman Gill, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Rishabh Pant (wk), 6 KL Rahul/Sarfaraz Khan, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 R Ashwin, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Jasprit Bumrah, 11 Mohammed Siraj/Akash Deep.Despite being 1-0 up, New Zealand may have the more difficult selection to make than India, because it may involve a change in the make-up of their Bengaluru attack. Conditions in Pune are set to be far less conducive to swing and seam bowling, which means New Zealand may have to think of leaving out one of their three quicks - potentially Tim Southee, their ex-captain, or Will O'Rourke, who took seven wickets in Bengaluru - and bring in an extra spinner. This could either be the left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner or the legspinner Ish Sodhi, who has come into the squad with Michael Bracewell released on paternity leave.New Zealand 1 Tom Latham (capt), 2 Devon Conway, 3 Will Young, 4 Rachin Ravindra, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Tom Blundell (wk), 7 Glenn Phillips, 8 Mitchell Santner, 9 Tim Southee/Will O'Rourke, 10 Matt Henry, 11 Ajaz Patel.Pitch and conditionsAfter losing in entirely un-Indian conditions at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, India have gone to great lengths to prepare a track that theoretically minimises the damage New Zealand's quicks can cause. A slow, low turner is in the offing, and spinners can expect increasing help as the Test match progresses with sunny weather expected on all five days in Pune.Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli share a light chat\u2022AFP/Getty ImagesStats and trivia\n After losing just two home Tests in the ten years from 2013 to 2022, India have lost three in the next two years.\n KL Rahul is 19 runs away from the 3000 mark in Test cricket. Of all batters to have scored at least 3000 runs since his debut, only Mominul Haque and Kraigg Brathwaite have lower averages than Rahul's current figure of 33.87.\n Before 2023, Matt Henry had 53 wickets in 17 Tests at an average of 40.24. Since the start of 2023, he has transformed his Test career, taking 50 wickets in just nine Tests at 21.26.\nQuotes\"No, we are not even thinking of giving anyone game time. All we are concentrating on are these two Test matches [against New Zealand]. And these two Test matches are very, very important to us. As important as any other Test match, be it in India or in Australia.\"India head coach Gautam Gambhir when asked if India would pick Akash Deep in order to give him game time ahead of the Australia tour\"It's important that we take the focus, the confidence from that [Bengaluru] game, and bring it into this game, but realise that we both start on zero, both teams start on zero tomorrow.\"New Zealand captain Tom LathamKarthik Krishnaswamy is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "Sangareddy: Bird lovers and birding communities in the city have united to create the first of its kind Hyderabad City Bird Atlas (HBA).\r\n\r\nCoimbatore, Mysore and Pune cities already have such bird atlases while Kerala and Goa have a complete State bird atlas. With the move, the birding communities here aim to systematically document the bird species in and around Hyderabad to create the Hyderabad Bird Atlas. The survey will cover 11 per cent of the area inside the Outer Ring Road (ORR) documenting birds in various habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, natural open areas and urban landscapes. The places will be randomly selected for the survey.\r\n\r\nWhile Hyderabad Birding Pals (HBP) and Deccan Birders are leading the effort, many more organisations including the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) are expected to join the survey. The registration for voluntary enrolment of the participants started on Wednesday. It received an overwhelming response as the number crossed 100 on the first day. The members of the HBA project say the number of participants would be anywhere between 300 to 500. The survey needs to be done twice a year during winter in February and post-summer in July. The first survey of the HBA will be taken up in February 2025. The members have selected some 180 sub-cells (areas) for the survey.\r\n\r\nHowever, they say the State government should extend all the support to birdwatchers to carry out the exercise without any issues. The government should allow birdwatchers into public places, parks, reserve forests, universities, schools, colleges, office campuses, and residential campuses. A systematic survey for the next three to five years would help to create an authentic bird atlas for Hyderabad. HBA would act as a valuable tool for scientists, conservationists, and policymakers to understand bird populations, monitor changes over time, identify important bird areas and strategise conservation efforts, they said.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Telangana Today, a key member of HBA project, Sriram Reddy said the creation of the HBA would help to educate citizens on biodiversity besides encouraging bird watching. The birding atlas would also help in building the Hyderabad brand, he added.",

The Three Lions have made changes in their bowling attack as the visitors will be playing with a triple-spin attack.Under Shan Masood\u2019s stint as the skipper, this is the first time Pakistan will be fielding an unchanged playing eleven. Before the second Test of the series against England, PCB made a firm decision when they dropped Babar Azam from the playing eleven and Kamran Ghulam was handed his maiden Test cap and placed to fill the former skipper\u2019s position.Despite a tough time, Ghulam showed grit and resilience against a fierce English bowling line-up to keep Pakistan in the thick of the action. With an array of shots, he kept the opposition on their toes and smashed 118 off 124 deliveries in the second Test.While Ghulam\u2019s knock set the tone of the Test for Pakistan, it was Noman Ali and Sajid Khan who dictated the outcome with their spin prowess. The duo took all 20 wickets in the second Test, leaving England completely baffled in the process. While Sajid starred with his figures of 7/111 in the first innings, the plaudits belonged to Noman in the second innings for his splendid effort of 8/46.Pakistan will be eyeing to clinch their first series at home since February 2021, when they defeated South Africa.

But Mourinho, who has also managed a string of other high-profile clubs including Chelsea, Real Madrid and Tottenham, said United had potential and he wants them to succeed. \"Maybe you English guys think I'm bluffing, think I am playing mind games,\" he said at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. \"I'm not playing anything -- they have a better team than the results are showing.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"I studied them the maximum I could with my staff and my analysts.

She says, \"I slowly felt my anxiety fade away, and I became hooked for life.\"Her ceramics feature unique textures, along with a mix of colors and organic forms. \u201cClay has a therapeutic effect on the body, mind, and soul, and I am proof of that fact. No wonder it\u2019s become the hottest passion for all the lost souls of the world,\u201d she says.Artist Mudita Bhandari echos similar views. Being an artist whose medium is ceramics, she strongly feels pottery helps her be in sync with life. \u201cAny creative or organic process, whether it's gardening, dancing, or cooking, can be extremely de-stressing and healing, and yet when one is working with clay, it seems to somehow feel like you are directly communicating with your subconscious intuitive self,\u201d she says.Clay is one of the most basic natural materials which has its own process of maturing, it responds to all the weathers just like we humans do. \u201cIt will absorb the moisture from the air in rainy season and dry very slwoly and would dry really fast in the summers. Short cuts dont work with it.\u201d She says, clay has a character of its own and it responds beautifully when you work with it and not try to control it. \u201cWorking with clay and life has many parallels. Just like in life you try contolling something it never works but when you let go and work with it spontaniously, one encounters the most amazing experiences,\u201d informs Mudita.For her, everything about the process of working with clay resonates with a very basic and organic life lesson. \u201cThe material is direct in a very subtle way and tactile. Whatever you make, your hand impression of that moment in time is recorded along with your subcouncious feelings of that moment. It helps me go inwards peacefully away from the hustle bustle of this world,\u201d she adds.",

The preparations were revealed in an ICC meeting on Monday, during which the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, was also present. Sources told Geo News that during the meeting, the PCB officials assured the ICC board members that the upgradation of the three stadiums that will host the matches of the marquee event will be completed within the stipulated time.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Naqvi has also invited ICC board members to Pakistan to review the preparations made for the tournament. The Champions Trophy will begin next year in Pakistan, but there are certain challenges that need to be addressed.Uncertainty continues to loom over India going to Pakistan for the mega event. Since 2008's Asia Cup, India has not played any cricket tournaments in Pakistan due to tense relationships between both nations because of terrorism.A series played from December 2012 to January 2013 in India marked the final bilateral series between the two nations. Since then, both nations have only clashed at ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. On the other hand, Pakistan travelled to India on three occasions since the 2008 Asia Cup.Recently, reports started to surface about the International Cricket Council (ICC) looking at three options regarding hosting the Champions Trophy.According to sources, ICC is either looking to have the tournament go ahead in Pakistan as planned or take place in both Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a part of the hybrid model.As per this hybrid model, matches for India and knockout stage games will take place in Dubai. The third option is the entire tournament, taking place outside Pakistan, with Dubai, Sri Lanka or South Africa as possible hosts.Pakistan have not hosted any major International Cricket Council (ICC) event since the 1996 ODI World Cup, which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The Catalans had lost their last six games against Bayern but outplayed the six-time winners at the Olympic Stadium with Robert Lewandowski also on the scoresheet, while England star Harry Kane struck for the visitors. Hansi Flick, who was in charge of the Bundesliga side in a humiliating 8-2 romp over Barca in 2020, led the Catalans to an emphatic triumph which indicated they may be capable of winning the trophy for the first time since 2015 after a decade of disappointment.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Defeat leaves Bayern with only one victory from their opening three group games and in the bottom half of the table, while Barcelona have two wins and are in the top third.\"In my opinion this game could have been a (Champions League) final, to be able to win it in this way, so well, in front of our fans, is quite special and I leave here happy,\" Raphinha told Movistar.\"Getting the second victory in the Champions League was important and now we have to think about the game on Saturday.\"Barcelona visit European and Spanish champions Real Madrid in a La Liga Clasico this weekend and warmed up for it in spectacular style.\"If you win this type of game you have to celebrate it, and for the team it's incredible,\" said Flick.\"It gives us confidence to believe in ourselves ahead of Saturday.\"Barcelona had not scored in their last four matches against Bayern but were ahead inside one minute, with Fermin Lopez playing Raphinha in behind the visitors' high line.The Brazilian winger, on his 100th appearance for the club since joining from Leeds, and proudly sporting the captain's armband, stayed cool to dribble around Manuel Neuer and roll home.Bayern poured forward in response and after having a goal ruled out for a tight offside, Kane struck in the 18th minute to level.The striker finished acrobatically from Serge Gnabry's inviting cross with Barcelona's defence all at sea.Relentless RaphinhaBarcelona recovered their composure and began to threaten, with former Bayern striker Lewandowski firing wide and Lamine Yamal sliding in to tackle Neuer but seeing the ball roll beyond the post.Joshua Kimmich was booked for taking out Lopez, who was charging into space in Bayern territory.The Barcelona midfielder, a ball of energy, created his team's second for Lewandowski. Lopez left Kim Min-jae for dead with a clever nudge, which Bayern complained about to no avail, before knocking the ball across for Lewandowski to turn home.The veteran Polish striker, 36, has been the chief beneficiary of Flick's arrival after struggling last season and now has 15 goals in 13 appearances.The unstoppable Raphinha rattled home a superb third before the interval, driving into the area after Marc Casado spread the play out to the left flank and arcing a shot through Dayot Upamecano's legs and beyond the reach of Neuer at full stretch.Raphinha completed his hat-trick 10 minutes into the second half, controlling Yamal's ambitious pass brilliantly on his chest while on the sprint, before planting a rasping effort into the bottom right corner from the edge of the box.Bayern coach Vincent Kompany reacted with a quadruple substitution, bringing on four household names in Jamal Musiala, Kingsley Coman, Leroy Sane and Leon Goretzka.At 4-1 up Barcelona's fans began to cheer their team's passes as Bayern chased the ball.\"For the fans, I think it was revenge,\" said Raphinha, looking back at Barca's defeats by Bayern.\"As a fan I suffered through those games too.\"The winger was thrown up in the air by his team-mates at full-time, clutching his match ball.Having not reached the Champions League semi-finals since 2019, belief is starting to grow in Catalonia that Flick could help restore their position among Europe's elite.Bayern, semi-finalists last season, were left licking their wounds.\"The whole team gave 100 percent. So there's no question about effort, but 100 percent was not enough today,\" admitted Kompany.\"(In the first half) it felt like we could edge this game, that it could turn for us.\"But in key moments we got outdone and for that reason the result is fairly heavy.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "A 27th minute tap-in from Darwin Nunez took Liverpool to a controlled 1-0 win at RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday, continuing their excellent start under new coach Arne Slot. Liverpool broke through some early Leipzig pressure just before the half-hour mark when Mohamed Salah hit a perfect header across his body. Nunez sprang forward to prod home the goal-bound ball, grabbing his first Champions League goal since February 2023. Despite a late Leipzig flurry, Liverpool again showed the control and resilience that has taken them to the top of the Premier League table just days out from Sunday's clash at Arsenal. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"We're really happy for the win. We played a difficult away game. We controlled the game in large parts apart from the last few minutes,\" said Slot. \"I asked for a goal. He (Darwin) gave us one but in the lead-up to the goal, Cody Gakpo was important and Mo Salah with an assist. It was a team goal. It's pleasing to see that Darwin did a really good job today.\"Slot has won 11 of his first 12 games in charge in all competitions, the best start of any manager in Liverpool history, while Leipzig are now zero from three in Europe this season.\"With a bit of luck, maybe we could have taken a point,\" Leipzig goalie Peter Gulacsi said, adding: \"In the Champions League, we've had no luck at all.\"Both sides had impressed domestically this season on the back of strong defensive records, with Liverpool conceding three in eight Premier League games and Leipzig just two in seven. Slot made three changes to the side which beat Chelsea 2-1 at home on Sunday, benching Andy Robertson and Curtis Jones for Kostas Tsimikas and Alexis Mac Allister, while Nunez replaced Diogo Jota. Leipzig coach Marco Rose's starting XI made his intentions clear, the coach going for the all-out attack of Lois Openda, Xavi Simons, Benjamin Sesko and Antonio Nusa. Rose's set-up worked early, with Leipzig pressing Liverpool hard and hitting them on the counter. Sesko went close after 19 minutes, pouncing after Caoimhin Kelleher surged out of his box and failed to clear, but the big Slovenian's long-range effort curled just wide of the post. Openda scored from well outside the box on the 26-minute mark but the Belgian's stunner was ruled out for offside.Liverpool made Leipzig pay immediately, Nunez tapping in a goal-bound Salah header, just his second strike in nine appearances this season. Nunez went inches from doubling up shortly after but his point-blank header was well saved by Gulacsi. With one eye on Sunday's match at Arsenal, Liverpool tried to take the sting out of the game in the second half, controlling the match and keeping Leipzig at bay. Salah was upset to be subbed with half an hour remaining, but by then Slot clearly had Arsenal in mind.The home side rallied late, Openda again having a goal struck off for a clear offside, but Liverpool held on to make it three from three in the Champions League.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

It became very difficult and we had difficulty coping with it,\" said Sparta coach Lars Friis.Foden's struggle for form and fitness has compounded City's injury problems with Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne sidelined.But there were encouraging signs for Guardiola as, restored to the starting line-up, the England international drilled home the opening goal after just three minutes.Haaland had nine efforts on goal in total but was frustrated in the first half as Sparta refused to let the floodgates open before the break.Peter Vindahl produced a stunning save low to his right to parry a powerful downward header from Haaland on 10 minutes.Vindahl also denied Foden, while Haaland had another towering header hacked off the line.Haaland did finally deliver City's second with an effort reminiscent of his strike against old club Borussia Dortmund two years ago that won Champions League goal of the season.\"It was an amazing goal. I was speechless after he shot,\" said Nunes.\"When he scored against Dortmund I was watching on TV and to see this live was amazing.\"Savinho's chipped cross was slightly behind the 24-year-old, who contorted his body to strike the ball martial arts style and fire it past Vindahl.Stones nodded in a vital stoppage time winner against Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday and continued his hot streak in front of goal with a looping header from Nunes' cross.\"When Erling is not available, John can play as a striker,\" joked Guardiola.Haaland then completed a three-goal blitz in 10 minutes at the end of a scintillating City counter-attack.Slick passes from Rico Lewis, Foden and Nunes teed up Haaland to slot home his 44th Champions League goal in just 42 appearances in the competition.Guardiola could afford the luxury of replacing his star number nine, along with Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva in the closing stages with City in the midst of a run of seven games in 21 days.However, that robbed Haaland of the chance to complete his third hat-trick of the season when Nunes was felled inside the box.The Portugal international stepped up himself to blast in his second City goal and round off the scoring.City are now unbeaten from open play in 26 Champions League matches, setting the longest unbeaten streak by any club.Victory takes Guardiola's men onto seven points from their opening three Champions League games, behind only Premier League rivals Liverpool and Aston Villa.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' CNN town hall",
        "text": "With less than two weeks until the election, Vice President Kamala Harris held a town hall in Pennsylvania\u2014a crucial battleground state\u2014while her rival, Donald Trump, addressed a rally in Georgia. During the CNN event, Harris tackled a wide range of pressing topics, from immigration and the economy to the contentious issues of abortion and US foreign policy.Throughout the town hall, Harris maintained her jovial demeanor while clarifying her positions and distinguishing her policy priorities from those of President Biden, suggesting a new approach if she were to assume the presidency. The border issue, which has been a persistent challenge for her, once again took center stage. When pressed on whether she would continue building the wall along the Mexico border, she wants \"strengthen our border\" but did not provide further clarification.During the town hall, Harris also called Trump a \"fascist\" and a threat to America's democracy.\u2014 KamalaHarris (@KamalaHarris) CNN anchor Jake Tapper noted that Harris tended to sidestep direct questions, focusing instead on critiquing Trump. \u201cShe concentrated much more on Donald Trump than on the specifics of her own plans,\u201d he observed. Additionally, Dana Bash remarked that Harris\u2019s performance did not quite \u201cclose the deal\u201d with undecided voters.5 key takeaways from Kamala's CNN TownhallStrengthening border securityWhen asked about her stance on former President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, Harris was critical of the previous administration's efforts. \u201cRemember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. They didn\u2019t,\u201d she remarked with a laugh. Despite her critique, Harris defended her support for a bipartisan bill that allocates $650 million for border security, including physical barriers. She emphasised that her focus is on practicality rather than ideology: \"We need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes. Let\u2019s just fix this thing.\" Although Harris has shifted her view on the wall, she clarified that her objective is to \u201cstrengthen our border,\u201d distancing herself from Trump\u2019s approach while acknowledging the need for compromise to address the broken immigration system.Tackling rising grocery prices and the economyOn the economy, Harris was asked about soaring grocery prices, a concern many Americans feel deeply. She agreed that prices remain too high and highlighted her background in fighting corporate price gouging as a potential solution. \u201cPart of my plan is to create a national ban on price gouging,\u201d she said, explaining that companies exploiting consumers would face new consequences. Harris also addressed the housing crisis, advocating for collaboration with the private sector to cut red tape and increase affordable housing options. In her response, Harris criticised both parties for not doing enough to tackle housing affordability but stressed that her administration would take a \"new approach\" focused on tax incentives for home builders and ensuring accountability for corporate monopolies in the housing market.\u2014 CalltoActivism (@CalltoActivism) Defending abortion rights Harris firmly reiterated her pro-choice stance, criticising the Trump-era Supreme Court appointments that led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade. \u201cWhen Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended,\u201d Harris stated. She described the ripple effects of the decision, highlighting how some states have introduced draconian abortion bans with no exceptions for rape or incest. Harris also mentioned conversations with pro-life individuals who were shocked by the unintended consequences of these laws, including women dying from lack of access to essential reproductive care. \"Women have died because of these laws,\" she added, making a passionate plea for bipartisan action on the issue of reproductive rights.Distancing herself from Biden administrationPerhaps one of the most striking moments of the town hall was when Harris made it clear that her administration would not simply be a continuation of Biden\u2019s policies. When asked how she would differentiate herself from the current administration, she responded, \u201cI bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. I represent a new generation of leadership.\u201d Harris highlighted issues like housing, health care, and support for small businesses, noting that her approach would focus on practical solutions rooted in her personal experiences.While acknowledging that much had been accomplished under Biden, Harris was also clear that \"there\u2019s more to do\" and that her leadership would bring a fresh perspective to ongoing challenges.Conflict in IsraelAddressing a question on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Harris called the situation \u201cunconscionable,\u201d particularly the loss of innocent Palestinian lives. She expressed hope that with the death of Hamas leader Sinmar, there was a chance to bring an end to the war and secure a two-state solution. Harris advocated for peace efforts that ensure both Israel\u2019s security and Palestinian dignity, saying, \u201cWe are now at a place where... I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, and work toward a two-state solution.\u201dHarris acknowledged the strong emotions tied to this issue, but urged voters to consider the bigger picture, including the importance of democracy, practical governance, and personal freedoms.",

        "text": "The timing couldn\u2019t have been more coincidental. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first bilateral meeting in five years on Wednesday, where they underscored that a \u201cstable, predictable and amicable\u201d bilateral relationship between New Delhi and Beijing is important \u2014 a refreshing break since the Galwan days. On the other hand, a Lutyens Star in Modi 1.0, who held two crucial portfolios separately \u2014 Information and Broadcasting as well as Sports \u2014 is now back in Rajasthan as a Cabinet Minister of some meaty portfolios like commerce, where his long-term goal is rather ambitious \u2014 match the economic might of China. Col Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore would smile and ask News18, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cChina is already out there. But today we talk about China plus one. Who will be that one? My goal, our goal is to make Rajasthan that entity matching China. Rajasthan is no less than a country and has the expertise, human resources and wherewithal to beat Vietnam, Bangladesh or other similar countries. That is my limited point,\u201d Rathore told News18. One thing he is very clear about is that Rajasthan is not competing with other states.\nBut what about specifics? Right now, Rajasthan economy\u2019s size is a little above Rs 15 lakh crore. Rathore wants to double it to Rs 30 lakh crore, which eventually needs a hunger to match the scale of China.\nThe upcoming Rising Rajasthan has been packaged and marketed much like Vibrant Gujarat but on a much smaller scale. But the discipline is intriguing. Not only has a young Chief Minister toyed with the idea in his very first year of governance, but there has been a well-orchestrated global outreach before the main event in December this year.\n\u201cWhat sets Rising Rajasthan apart is the thrust on communication. We have deputed 23 IAS officers for 23 countries for the next 5 years as points of contact for ease of doing business. We have deputed one RAS (Rajasthan Administrative Service) officer each for every state of India as a communication officer for business investment purposes,\u201d he said.\nDuring the three-day event, one day will be dedicated for non-resident Rajasthanis. The Rajasthan government has already created 21 investment policies, such as a textile park or land aggregation policy.\nA state that was so used to the \u2018revdi\u2019 culture of free mobiles, free ration kits, free electricity and the Chiranjeevi scheme, is now getting used to a new way of expenditure. In her budget this year, Rajasthan Finance Minister Diya Kumari, committed to making the state a $350 billion economy as part of the action plan for \u2018Developed Rajasthan @ 2047\u2019, which comprises 10 resolutions. The commitments included investment promotion.\nChina or no China, how does life away from Lutyens Delhi feel like? When asked if he missed Delhi, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore broke into laughter before carefully choosing his words, \u201cIt was a privilege for me to spend 10 years in Delhi. I would often interact with friends in the media there who I would find intellectually stimulating, which I miss. But coming to the state has been a great deal of administrative and political education for me.\u201d",

        "text": "Microsoft Corp.'s female, Black and Latinx employees are leaving at an increasing rate, a trend that's complicating the company's efforts to build a more diverse workforce.Globally, women accounted for 32.7% of departures for the fiscal year that ended June 30, up from 31% in 2023, according to Microsoft's diversity and inclusion report, which was released Wednesday and measures voluntary and involuntary departures. Black workers accounted for 10% of US exits, compared with 8.7% the previous year, while Latinx departures rose to 9.8% from 8%. By contrast, fewer male and Asian employees left last year than in 2023. The software giant attributed the trends to poaching by rivals, as well as a continued shift away from its physical and online retail business, which has typically had a more diverse workforce.Microsoft continues to hire people from more unrepresented groups but must work harder to retain them, Microsoft Chief Diversity Officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre said in an interview. \"Once that talent arrives at Microsoft we know that we've got to do more,\" she said. That includes providing mentors and career options \"that give them an ongoing reason to invest and stay at Microsoft.\" (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");An increasing number of jobs in cloud-computing data centers, which are widely distributed geographically is giving Microsoft opportunities to boost diversity in hiring, she said. Diversity is increasingly important for Microsoft, which is keen to ensure that its new artificial intelligence products are free from racial, gender and other biases. \"It's going to take lots of perspectives to birth a trusted AI that everybody wants to engage with,\" McIntyre said. Few companies disclose retention statistics along racial and gender lines. Last year BlackRock Inc. released the results of an audit by former US Attorney General Eric Holder that showed Black and Latinx leaders were departing so quickly it was nearly offsetting the Wall Street firm's efforts to diversify its ranks.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "UEFA Champions League: Raphinha hat-trick helps Barcelona thrash Bayern Munich 4-1",
        "text": "Barcelona: Raphinha scored a stunning hat-trick as Barcelona hammered Bayern Munich 4-1 on Wednesday in a riveting Champions League clash. The Catalans had lost their last six games against Bayern but outplayed the six-time winners at the Olympic stadium with Robert Lewandowski also on the scoresheet, while England star Harry Kane struck for the visitors. Hansi Flick, who was in charge of the Bundesliga side in a humiliating 8-2 romp over Barca in 2020, led the Catalans to an emphatic triumph which indicated they may be capable of winning the trophy for the first time since 2015 after a decade of disappointment. Defeat leaves Bayern with only one victory from their opening three group games and in the bottom half of the table, while Barcelona have two wins and are in the top third. Hansi Flick brought Spanish midfielder Fermin Lopez in for his first start of the season after injury, while his Bayern counterpart Vincent Kompany opted for Serge Gnabry in place of Jamal Musiala, who was only fit enough for the bench. Barcelona had not scored in their last four matches against Bayern but were ahead inside one minute, with Lopez playing Raphinha in behind the visitors' high line. The Brazilian winger, on his 100th appearance for the club since joining from Leeds, and proudly sporting the captain's armband, stayed cool to dribble around Manuel Neuer and roll home. Former Tottenham striker Kane had a similar chance to equalise at the other end but took a heavy touch and Inaki Pena raced out of his goal quickly to deny him. The Englishman, who ended a four-game drought with a hat-trick against Stuttgart on Saturday, beat Pena with a header moments later but was ruled marginally offside. Bayern kept pouring forward and Kane found the net once more after 18 minutes, and this time it counted. The striker finished acrobatically from Gnabry's inviting cross with Barcelona's defence all at sea, like Bayern playing high and inviting the Germans to break in behind. Relentless Raphinha Barcelona recovered their composure and began to threaten, with former Bayern striker Lewandowski firing wide and Lamine Yamal sliding in to tackle Neuer but seeing the ball roll beyond the post. Joshua Kimmich was booked for taking out Lopez, who was charging into space in Bayern territory. The Barcelona midfielder, a ball of energy, created his team's second for Lewandowski. Lopez left Kim Min-jae for dead with a clever nudge, which Bayern complained about to no avail, before knocking the ball across for Lewandowski to turn home. The veteran Polish striker, 36, has been the chief beneficiary of Flick's arrival after struggling last season and now has 15 goals in 13 appearances. The unstoppable Raphinha rattled home a superb third before the interval, driving into the area after Marc Casado spread the play out to the left flank and arcing a shot through Dayot Upamecano's legs and beyond the reach of Neuer at full stretch. Raphinha completed his hat-trick 10 minutes into the second half, controlling Yamal's ambitious pass brilliantly on his chest while on the sprint, before planting a rasping effort into the bottom right corner from the edge of the box. Kompany reacted with a quadruple substitution, bringing on four household names in Musiala, Kingsley Coman, Leroy Sane and Leon Goretzka. At 4-1 up Barcelona's fans began to cheer their team's passes as Bayern chased the ball, the style of the victory continuing the team's potential redemption arc after nearly 10 years of hurt in the competition. Having not reached the Champions League semi-final since 2019, belief is starting to grow in Catalonia that Flick could help restore their position among Europe's elite. Another test of that theory soon follows -- Barcelona's next match is a visit to face reigning Spanish and European champions Real Madrid in a tantalising La Liga Clasico on Saturday. Brazilian winger Vinicius Junior netted a treble for Madrid on Tuesday against Dortmund but his compatriot Raphinha matched him in style against Bayern as Barca sent a message of their own.",

        "text": "Manchester: Erling Haaland scored an outrageous backheel volley in the Champions League on Wednesday to issue a timely reminder of his own credentials as a potential Ballon d'Or winner. A day after Vinicius Junior hit a hat trick for Real Madrid , Haaland scored an early contender for goal of the season with his acrobatic effort in Manchester City's 5-0 win against Sparta Prague. Vinicius Junior is the favorite to win soccer's most prestigious individual prize when it is presented at a gala ceremony in Paris on Monday. But Haaland, who came runner-up to Lionel Messi for last year's award, once again showcased his scoring prowess with two goals as City set a new Champions League record of 26 games unbeaten. Haaland's volley in the 58th minute at the Etihad Stadium was a moment of individual brilliance. From around six meters and with his back to goal, the Norway striker leaped in the air and flicked the back of his foot to meet Savinho's cross from the right. Connecting powerfully with his heel, the ball shot down into the turf and bounced high into the top corner beyond Prague goalkeeper Peter Vindahl. \u201cIf I tried to do that I\u2019d pull my groin. I don\u2019t know how he did it, I just think it\u2019s just his long legs. He\u2019s a freak isn\u2019t he?\u201d Haaland's City teammate Phil Foden said. City manager Pep Guardiola said the goal was not normal \u201cfor a human\u201d and likened the forward to Sweden great Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable this talent that this guy has and of course he made a fantastic goal,\u201d he said. Haaland scored his second in the 68th to take his season's total to 13 goals in 12 games in all competitions. His record in the Champions League is now 44 goals in 42 games. Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer in European club soccer's elite competition with 141 goals. Messi is second on 129. Haaland is 17th and rising quickly. But he is expected to miss out on this year's Ballon d'Or with Vinicius Junior as the man to beat, ahead of Haaland's City teammate Rodri. Haaland, however, is likely to contend for years to come if he continues his goal scoring exploits, with Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe leading a new generation after Messi and Ronaldo dominated the award for more than a decade. Neither of those soccer greats, who won 13 titles between them, were nominated this year, appearing to usher in a new era.",

As it turned out, the ball had indeed brushed Young\u2019s gloves.\n\nSoon after, a vociferous appeal for a leg-before against Conway off Ravindra Jadeja was turned down by the on-field umpire but India still chose to review it, losing one appeal in the process.\n\nAshwin, who sent down the majority of the 31 overs bowled in the morning session, found the outside edge off Conway\u2019s bat shortly before lunch but the ball flew away from the reach of the Indian captain at first slip.\n\nEarlier, Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep began proceedings with the new ball but the track did not favour them much, even as they put forth some questions to the Kiwis\u2019 openers with sideways movement.",

        "title": "Champions League: Liverpool sink Leipzig to continue strong start under Slot",
        "text": "Leipzig: A 27th minute tap-in from Darwin Nunez took Liverpool to a controlled 1-0 win at RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday, continuing their excellent start under new coach Arne Slot. Liverpool broke through some early Leipzig pressure just before the half-hour mark when Mohamed Salah hit a perfect header across his body. Nunez sprang forward to prod home the goal-bound ball, grabbing his first Champions League goal since February 2023. Despite a late Leipzig flurry, Liverpool again showed the control and resilience that has taken them to the top of the Premier League table just days out from Sunday's clash at Arsenal. \"We're really happy for the win. We played a difficult away game. We controlled the game in large parts apart from the last few minutes,\" said Slot. \"I asked for a goal. He (Darwin) gave us one but in the lead-up to the goal, Cody Gakpo was important and Mo Salah with an assist. It was a team goal. It's pleasing to see that Darwin did a really good job today.\" Slot has won 11 of his first 12 games in charge in all competitions, the best start of any manager in Liverpool history, while Leipzig are now zero from three in Europe this season. \"With a bit of luck, maybe we could have taken a point,\" Leipzig goalie Peter Gulacsi said, adding: \"In the Champions League, we've had no luck at all.\" Both sides had impressed domestically this season on the back of strong defensive records, with Liverpool conceding three in eight Premier League games and Leipzig just two in seven. Slot made three changes to the side which beat Chelsea 2-1 at home on Sunday, benching Andy Robertson and Curtis Jones for Kostas Tsimikas and Alexis Mac Allister, while Nunez replaced Diogo Jota. Leipzig coach Marco Rose's starting XI made his intentions clear, the coach going for the all-out attack of Lois Openda, Xavi Simons, Benjamin Sesko and Antonio Nusa. Rose's set-up worked early, with Leipzig pressing Liverpool hard and hitting them on the counter. Sesko went close after 19 minutes, pouncing after Caoimhin Kelleher surged out of his box and failed to clear, but the big Slovenian's long-range effort curled just wide of the post. Openda scored from well outside the box on the 26-minute mark but the Belgian's stunner was ruled out for offside. Liverpool made Leipzig pay immediately, Nunez tapping in a goal-bound Salah header, just his second strike in nine appearances this season. Nunez went inches from doubling up shortly after but his point-blank header was well saved by Gulacsi. With one eye on Sunday's match at Arsenal, Liverpool tried to take the sting out of the game in the second half, controlling the match and keeping Leipzig at bay. Salah was upset to be subbed with half an hour remaining, but by then Slot clearly had Arsenal in mind. The home side rallied late, Openda again having a goal struck off for a clear offside, but Liverpool held on to make it three from three in the Champions League.",

        "text": "Indian spin veteran Ravichandran Ashwin overtook Australian legend Nathan Lyon to become the leading wicket-taker in the history of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC). Ashwin accomplished this feat during the second Test against New Zealand at Pune\u2019s Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) stadium.During the game in the first innings, Ashwin has so far taken three wickets for 48 runs in 19 overs at an economy rate of 2.50.Now in 39 matches since the tournament started taking place in a league format in 2019, Ashwin has picked up a massive 189 wickets at an average of 20.71, with best figures of 7/71. He has taken nine four-wicket hauls and 11 five-wicket hauls in the competition. In 2019-21 and 2021-23 cycles, Ashwin ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 71 wickets in 14 matches and the fourth-highest wicket-taker with 61 scalps in 13 matches (with Lyon being at the top with 88 wickets in 20 matches) respectively. In the ongoing 2023-25 cycle of the competition, Ashwin is a chart-topper yet again currently, with 57 scalps in 12 matches. Lyon on the other hand has taken 187 wickets in 43 wickets at an average of 26.70, with best figures of 8/64. He has taken 11 four-wicket hauls and 10 five-wicket hauls in the championship\u2019s history. Ashwin also overtook Lyon (530 wickets in 129 matches) in the all-time Test cricket list to become the format\u2019s seventh-highest wicket-taker, with 531 scalps in 104 matches at an average of 23.75, with best figures of 7/59. He has taken 25 four-wicket hauls and 37 five-wicket hauls in his career. During the highly-anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy starting in Australia on November 22 at Perth, these two legends will duel for spin bowling supremacy, most likely for the last time on Australian soil. Coming to the match, half-centuries from Devon Conway (76 in 141 balls, with 11 fours) and Rachin Ravindra (65 in 105 balls, with five fours and a six), took NZ to 201/5 at the end of the second session. Ashwin has so far taken three wickets while Washington Sundar has two. New Zealand skipper Tom Latham won the toss and elected to bat first in the second Test of the three-match series against India on Thursday. Pacer Matt Henry misses action due to a niggle with spinner Mitchell Santner coming to the playing eleven. For India, pacer Mohammed Siraj, batter KL Rahul and spinner Kuldeep Yadav sat out. Shubman Gill returns to the playing eleven after missing the first Test due to neck stiffness. Akash Deep took Siraj\u2019s place while Washington Sundar took Kuldeep\u2019s spot for his first Test appearance since March 2021.This game is a must-win for Team India, as they are 1-0 down in the series. The Rohit Sharma-led team will have to win this game to keep their 12-year-long home supremacy alive and solidify their chances of making a hat-trick of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) finals as a tougher Australian challenge awaits them.India (Playing XI): Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Sarfaraz Khan, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Akash Deep, Jasprit BumrahNew Zealand (Playing XI): Tom Latham(c), Devon Conway, Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell(w), Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ajaz Patel, William ORourke.

        "text": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the Women's T20 World Cup 2024 Team of the Tournament on Monday and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur is the only player from India who was included in the side. In an otherwise disappointing campaign for India, skipper Harmanpreet was the standout performer for the Women in Blue. She finished as India's top scorer and the fourth-highest overall in the tournament, amassing 150 runs in four innings.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");With two fifties to her name, she boasted an incredible average of 150. Her strike rate of 133.92 was the fifth-best in the tournament. Kaur's quickfire 52 off 27 balls against Sri Lanka was crucial in keeping India's hopes alive for a semifinal spot.South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt was a solid presence for her side at the top. Wolvaardt passed 30 in all but one of her games, with four scores of over 40. While her highest score came in South Africa's first game, it was her resilient 42 in the semi-final that set up a strong base during her team's successful chase against Australia.In pursuit of 135, Wolvaardt helped put her team ahead of the game, scoring at a brisk pace with three fours and a six to her name, allowing Anneke Bosch to settle in and launch a stupendous counter-attack.South Africa's opener formed a strong partnership with captain Laura Wolvaardt at the top of the order, driving the team to the final. Brits amassed 187 runs in six innings, with an impressive average of 37.40, making her the second-highest run-scorer, just behind Wolvaardt. She surpassed 40 runs in three innings, including a match-winning unbeaten 57 in South Africa's opening fixture against the West Indies.Danni Wyatt-Hodge was a firecracker at the top of the order for the England side, notching up the most runs for them at the World Cup. The right-hand batter notched up scores of 40+ in each of England's first three games.Wyatt-Hodge started off her tournament with a brisk 41 against Bangladesh, following it up with a crucial run-a-ball 43 to get past eventual runners-up South Africa. Her best performance was against Scotland in their penultimate game, where she slammed an unbeaten 26-ball 51, to guide England to a 10-wicket win in a record partnership alongside Maia Bouchier.The Player of the Final and the Player of the Tournament, Melie Kerr starred in New Zealand's title-winning campaign. She contributed both with the bat and ball, scoring 135 runs in six innings, with her high score of 43 coming crucially in the final. She took 15 wickets in the competition, becoming the tournament's leading wicket-taker.Her impressive 3 for 24 in the final, including the crucial wickets of Wolvaardt and Bosch, was pivotal in New Zealand's victory, securing their second ICC tournament title.Deandra Dottin shone for the West Indies on her return to international cricket, scoring 120 runs in five innings at an average of 40, playing a crucial role for the team in the middle order. Her tournament-high nine sixes were unmatched, with the next-best being teammate Qiana Joseph's three.Dottin also contributed with the ball, taking five wickets, including a standout performance of 4 for 22 in the semifinal against New Zealand. Her explosive power-hitting was key in West Indies' victory in the virtual quarterfinal against England, securing their spot in the semifinals. The Bangladesh wicketkeeper had a standout performance for the Tigresses, excelling both behind the stumps and with the bat.She scored 104 runs in four innings at an average of 34.66, with a top score of 39 against the West Indies. Yet her best contributions came with the gloves, where she made six stumpings and took one catch. Her total of seven dismissals was the highest among wicketkeepers in the tournament.Afy Fletcher came up clutch with the ball for the West Indies, finishing off with the third-most wickets at this T20 World Cup. Despite not picking up a wicket in their opening game against the Proteas, the 37-year-old returned with strong performances, taking 10 wickets in total, including two 3-wicket hauls against Scotland and England.She picked up her best figures of 3-21 in the West Indies' defining match - their final group stage game against England, which paved their way into the last four. In the semi-final, she scalped two crucial wickets and a laudable 17* as well, with her side knocked out by eventual winners New Zealand.New Zealand's impactful pacer Rosemary Mair bookended her tournament with two outstanding displays. It was the 25-year-old who returned the best figures for the White Ferns in their crucial opening win over India, taking 4/19 from her four overs - dismissing Harmanpreet Kaur with a hooping inswinger in the powerplay and then returning to clean up the tail in the death overs.And Mair was excellent again in the final, taking 3/25 and once more playing the important role of bowling key overs in the powerplay and at the back-end of the innings. With probing accuracy combined with big movement, Mair proved an important weapon for the champions. No pace bowler took more wickets than her ten, and she finished as the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, behind only fellow finalists Nonkululeko Mlaba and Melie Kerr.South Africa's pocket-sized dynamo made her team's tournament come to life with a brilliant 4/29 in their very first game against the West Indies.Mlaba remained crucial for the Proteas throughout the event, varying her speeds and lengths to great effect against opposition batters. Whenever a partnership threatened South Africa, captain Wolvaardt would turn to Mlaba for a breakthrough, and the left-armer didn't disappoint.Her scalp of Tahlia McGrath ended a promising stand for Australia in the semi-final, and Mlaba also removed the well-set Suzie Bates (32) and Melie Kerr (43) in the final.Australia's reliable pacer Megan Schutt had a typically impactful outing in the UAE, troubling the batters throughout the innings. Her ability to maintain control was matched by her wicket-taking prowess. She was at her best in the group game against eventual champions New Zealand. She struck first in New Zealand's pursuit of 149, cleaning up Georgia Plimmer for 4. This was followed by wickets of Melie Kerr and Eden Carson in the 12th and 20th over respectively to seal a dominant win for Australia.Such was Schutt's control on the night that she conceded merely three runs in her 3.2 overs.Women's T20 WC Team of the Tournament: Laura Wolvaardt (C), Tazmin Brits, Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Melie Kerr, Harmanpreet Kaur, Deandra Dottin, Nigar Sultana Joty (WK), Afy Fletcher, Rosemary Mair, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Megan Schutt.",

        "text": "RB Leipzig host Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday as Jurgen Klopp's recent past and not-too-distant future collide. The 57-year-old will not be there at the Red Bull Arena on Wednesday but his shadow still looms over the contest. Klopp stepped down as Liverpool manager in the summer citing exhaustion after a successful nine-year spell which included lifting the Champions League and Premier League. In October, Klopp announced his return to football, not as a coach but running Red Bull's football operations, which oversees clubs in several cities including Leipzig, Salzburg and New York.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");He will be absent from the game, choosing to wait to attend a match after starting the role in January.While the appointment was a surprise in Germany and in England, the focus on Leipzig has been particularly acute. In a strange quirk of the fixture list, Leipzig's five fixtures after the announcement includes games against each of Klopp's former clubs: Mainz, Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund. 'Klopp in Mallorca'Klopp was again a topic of conversation after Leipzig's 2-0 win at Mainz on Saturday, by fans and media alike.Some fans held banners protesting the appointment, while reporters asked if Leipzig coach Marco Rose had asked Klopp for tips on how to beat the Reds on Wednesday. Rose played under Klopp for several years at Mainz and the two maintain a good relationship. He said he would \"not be phoning up\" his former coach for tips on how to beat Liverpool. \"Kloppo is in (Spanish island) Mallorca, looking after his dog, his wife and his children. \"I will do everything (to beat Liverpool) but I won't call Klopp. \"He needs his peace and quiet and needs to rest a bit.\"And I'll grant him that.\"Born and raised in Leipzig, Rose took the ambitious club to the 2023 German Cup title in his first season. The 48-year-old followed it up with a run to the Champions League last 16, where Leipzig were narrowly eliminated by eventual champions Real Madrid. This season, Leipzig have managed to hold onto most of their young talent, giving rise to hopes of a shot at the league title and a long run in Europe.Although Leipzig are second to Bayern Munich on goal difference in the Bundesliga, the Champions League is another story, albeit with a tough draw. Leipzig conceded late goals to lose away at Atletico Madrid and at home against Juventus. The Saxon side have yet to claim a point in Europe this season, making Wednesday's clash with the Premier League leaders even more important.'Extremely stable'Like Liverpool, Leipzig's strong league form this campaign has been built on a miserly defence.Leipzig have kept clean sheets in six of seven league games. The two goals they did concede came against Bayer Leverkusen in a game Leipzig won 3-2, the defending champions' first defeat on German soil in 15 months. Starting the campaign under Klopp replacement Arne Slot, Liverpool have conceded just three goals in eight league games this season, by far the best mark in the Premier League.Peter Gulasci, Leipzig's goalkeeper, on Saturday recognised the similarities. \"Liverpool are extremely stable and don't allow much at the back -- just like us.\"That's why it won't be easy. \"Their style of play has changed a bit (under Slot), they play a bit more with the ball and are very structured. \"We've shown in the first two games we're on par with our opponents, but now we have to finally reward ourselves for our hard work.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Puneri Paltan and UP Yoddhas secured contrasting wins in their first match Pro Kabaddi League on Monday at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, Gachibowli, Hyderabad.\n\nDefending champions Paltan beat the Patna Pirates 40-25 while the Yoddhas began their season with a 28-23 win over Dabang Delhi KC. \n\nPaltan started off strongly, as Aslam Inamdar and co quickly stormed into a 4-0 lead in the first few minutes of the game. Soon after though, the Patna Pirates started to fight back with Ankit\u2019s Super Tackle on Inamdar cutting down the deficit to one point in the early exchanges. \n\nWith just under ten minutes to go in the first half, the Paltan had surged ahead and were looking to consolidate on a three-point lead. After that, a flurry of solid defensive tackles further extended the Paltan\u2019s lead, who were dominating proceedings at this point in time. \n\nFor the Paltan, captain Inamdar led by example with seven points and had fantastic support from Aman with five points and Mohit Goyat, who bagged three points. At the half-time break, Puneri Paltan led 20-10.\n\nAfter the break, the Paltan continued to dominate the contest, keeping the Pirates at an arm\u2019s length. At the midway point in the second half, the Paltan had a 13-point lead to their name. \n\nThe Pirates were giving it their all to mount a comeback, but the likes of Goyat, Inamdar and Aman were having none of it. \n\nIn the final minutes, the Pirates\u2019 Jang Kun Lee was introduced and his arrival triggered a round of rapturous applause from the crowd. However, there wasn\u2019t enough time to turn the tide, as the Paltan came away with a comfortable win to wrap up an entertaining Monday evening.\n\nYoddhas edge past Delhi\n\nThe Yoddhas kicked off proceedings when they picked up the first points of the game through a Surender Gill raid. After that, it was a tight battle, as the two competitors traded raids and points without conceding an inch to each other. Neither side could take an outright lead in the early exchanges in what was turning out to be a close battle. \n\nHowever, as the first half reached the midway stage, Bhavani Rajput took charge as the Yoddhas started to settle in, and edged ahead of their opponents. As the half wore on, Ashu Malik and Nitin Panwar helped Dabang Delhi KC fight back and bring the contest back on level terms. The first half ended with the scores tied at 12-11. \n\nThe second half was also a cautious start with both sides taking their time to strike. Both sides were finding it tough to break each other down despite multiple well thought out moves in the early exchanges. At the end of the first phase of the second half, there was hardly any difference between the two sides. The Yoddhas led by 18-16, with the game very much on a knife-edge. \n\nBy now Naveen Kumar had picked up the baton from Ashu Malik, and was leading the charge for the Delhi as they looked to fightback. However, in the final phase of play, the Yoddhas cranked up the intensity as Sahul Kumar inflicted an all out on Delhi and the raiders also picked up crucial points. \n\nThat helped the Yoddhas take a five-point lead with less than five minutes to go. Eventually, the Yoddhas came away with the win in what was a closely fought game. Rajput top scored for the UP Yoddhas with seven points.",

        "text": "India's victorious T20 World Cup 2024 campaign didn't feature wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson in any many. Despite the fact that Rishabh Pant was making his return to the national side after a long injury layoff, Team India decided to stick with him over picking an in-form Samson. However, right before the final against South Africa, India captain Rohit Sharma had asked Samson to be ready as there was a big chance he would be playing in the title clash. However, it all changed just minutes before the toss.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In an interview, Samson revealed that he was preparing to play in the final for India before Rohit informed him that the team was going with the same XI.\"I had a chance to play the final. I was told to stay ready. I was ready. However, they decided before the toss that we would go with the same team. I was like, no worries. I was in that type of mood,\" Samson told journalist Vimal Kumar during a chat.After the playing XI was decided Rohit spent a good amount of time with Samson explaining the decision.\"During the warm-up, Rohit took me to the side and started to explain to me why he was making that decision. He was like, You understood, na? You know his way, very casual? I told him, 'Let us win the match and then talk.' You focus on the match.\"He later said, \"He came back one minute later and said, 'I know you are cursing me in your mind.' I think you are not happy. I feel like you have something on your mind. Then we had a discussion. I told him, 'As a player, I want to play'.\"Samson even informed Rohit that he didn't want to let go of the opportunity to not feature in a final under his captaincy. This is a regret he would have to live with for the rest of his life.\"Since childhood, I wanted to come here and do something. Then he was like, 'My pattern is like this' and all that. I said I totally respect that you came and explained me. I said, 'I will have a regret; I could not play a World Cup final with a leader like you.' This will be a regret in my heart that I missed a World Cup final with a leader like Rohit Sharma. That will stay in my life.\"However, a thought that changed Samson's mind was the fact that instead of giving the selected XI members his time, Rohit chose to spend time with the player who wasn't even part of the team for the final. This side of Rohit made Samson respect him even more.\"After this, I thought, such a big thing like a World Cup final. Before the final, you have changed your decision. You spent 10 minutes with the player that is not playing just before the toss. He gave me 10 minutes before the toss. After that, I got to know this person has some other qualities.\"If I were in their place, I would be thinking about the players who are playing or my batting. I will explain to Sanju later; that is what normally you think. At that point, he thought 'I have to explain to Sanju, why I took that decision.' At that point, he won a place in my heart that will stay for a lifetime.\"",

He came off the bench 369 days later for the four-time Asian champion with 13 minutes remaining at Al Ain. He almost scored immediately when his low shot from left of the area shaved the post.In a thrilling match between Al-Hilal and the defending champion, Renan Lodi gave Al-Hilal the opener after 26 minutes. Soufiane Rahimi, the tournament top scorer last season, leveled soon after.By the break, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Salem Al-Dawsari put Hilal 3-1 ahead.Mateo Sanabria pulled a goal back just after the hour but Al-Dawsari scored twice more to complete a hat trick, and Rahimi achieved the same feat to make it 5-4.The win maintained Al-Hilal's perfect record in Asia after three games.Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia's Al-Ahli won at Qatar's Al-Rayyan 2-1 thanks to goals from Gabri Veiga and Firas Al-Buraikan.Iraq's Al-Shorta drew with Uzbekistan's Pakhtakor 0-0, and Qatar's Al-Sadd defeated Iran's Persepolis 1-0.Al-Nassr and Cristiano Ronaldo are in action on Tuesday against Esteghlal of Iran.

        "title": "How Bumrah, Shami had helped India win maiden Test series in Australia",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: India pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami form one of the most potent fast-bowling partnerships in world cricket. Their combination is highly effective due to a blend of contrasting but complementary skills.While Bumrah is known for his unorthodox action and ability to bowl consistently at high speeds, excelling in hitting yorkers, especially at the death, and generating seam movement, Shami offers similar pace but focuses more on seam position and swing, both conventional and reverse. His accuracy with both new and old balls makes him dangerous across formats.Both Bumrah and Shami had played pivotal roles in India's historic Test series triumph in 2018-19 - India's first ever Test series win in Australia.Also See: Cricket Live ScoreWith India set to play their first Test against Australia exactly one month from now, here's a look back at the roles Bumrah and Shami played in helping Virat Kohli's team make history.Jasprit BumrahBumrah took 21 wickets from 4 Test matches with a best of 9/86 that came at an average of 17.00 and a strike rate of 44.9.Bumrah was not the spearhead of the Indian bowling attack at the time but left the Aussie shores as the bowling mainstay of the Indian team. The strong shoulder of his that allows him to send thunderbolts at over 140 kmph even from a short run-up led to then Indian captain Virat Kohli saying that he wouldn't like to face Bumrah in a Test match. Some compliment that.And Bumrah had the figures to match Kohli's words. And the guile too. The slower delivery that he bowled to dismiss Shaun Marsh LBW at the stroke of lunch on Day 3 of the Boxing Day Test, not only displayed his accuracy and control but also his maturity.Recall the 147.7 kmph delivery that Bumrah bowled to then Australian captain Tim Paine in Perth. The good length delivery had slight lateral movement, squared up Paine and zoomed past the stumps and over a jumping Rishabh Pant to race to the boundary. Now Paine was not the best batsman in the world but that delivery would have bamboozled any batsman worth his salt.It was not surprising that Bumrah finished as the leading wicket-taker for India with 21 scalps to his name. With his then career-best figures of 6/33 in 15.5 overs at the MCG, Bumrah became the first bowler from the sub-continent to register a five-wicket haul in South Africa, England and Australia in the same year. With match figures of 9/86, Bumrah was India's hero in the Boxing Day Test victory. Bumrah ended his debut Test season with a record 49 wickets by any pace bowler.Mohammed ShamiMohammed Shami took 16 wickets in the four-Test series with a best of 6/136 at an average of 26.18 and a strike rate of 51.2.Shami took 5 wickets in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval which India won by 31 runs. And when Virat Kohli opted to field four pacers in the second Test in Perth, it was Shami, at his furious best, who shone the brightest amongst the Indian seamers.Shami went wicketless in the first innings but in the second innings ripped through Australia's lower middle-order. He was on a hat-trick at one point - having dismissed Tim Paine and Aaron Finch off successive deliveries.It was thanks mainly to Shami's career-best haul of 6/56 that India were able to bowl out Australia for 243 runs in their second innings. But the match slipped from India's grasp due to the lack of a balanced bowling attack - a glaring lapse even Shami had admitted to.The ability of Bumrah and Shami to bowl in tandem makes them one of the most feared fast-bowling duos in modern cricket, especially in Test matches where they have consistently delivered for India both at home and abroad.So the whole of India would be keeping their fingers crossed for Shami to be fit for the Australia tour.",
        "summary": "India's fast-bowling duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, played crucial roles in India's historic Test series win in Australia in 2018-19. Bumrah's consistency and Shami's precision complemented each other perfectly. With both players showcasing exceptional skills, they collectively took 37 wickets, leading India to a memorable victory Down Under. India would be keeping fingers crossed for Shami to be fit for the Australia tour.",

        "text": "Hyderabad FC head coach Thangboi Singto acknowledged his team\u2019s need for improvement at both ends of the pitch after the club suffered their third defeat in the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 season.The Yellow and Black managed to score their first goal of the season against Jamshedpur FC, with Cy Goddard finding the net early in the second half. But it wasn\u2019t enough as first-half goals from Rei Tachikawa and Jordan Murray secured another three points at home for Khalid Jamil\u2019s squad.The visitors started the match positively but couldn\u2019t maintain the momentum for long, allowing the home side to gain control after the initial phase of play.Singto discussed his players\u2019 performance and the issues they faced during their defeat in the post-match press conference.\u201cThe first 30 minutes were one of the best football matches we have played by far. But what happened after the first 30 minutes is a different story. Before Jamshedpur FC scored, we were controlling (the game), and pushing Jamshedpur FC back,\u201d Singto said as quoted from ISL.\u201cBut maybe football is about concentration, and a lack of communication led to that cross happening and from there, with that movement and not tracking Rei (Tachikawa), who was running for a tap-in. We can do better defensively and we need to be sharper,\u201d he added.The long wait for their first goal of the season ended, and while Hyderabad FC showed moments of sharpness, the hosts used their experience overall to secure the three points.\u201cWe scored our first goal of the season at least, though we lost in terms of performance. I think we were happy with the first half and in patches, but, you know, we\u2019re going to churn out the results. We need to win for everybody around us. So yeah, we have to keep working hard,\u201d Singto opined.The visitors actually gained more possession and had more shots on target, with eight compared to Jamshedpur FC\u2019s five.Singto praised his players for their efforts on the pitch, particularly the young winger Ramhlunchhunga, who troubled Jamshedpur FC on several occasions but couldn\u2019t help secure their second point of the season in the end.\u201cSome of the boys really stepped up today. Ramhlunchhunga: what a game he had today! The shortest guy (on the pitch), but he was all around the pitch with some good shots on target,\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut we need to be more clinical; football is about goals. If you want three points, you need to score goals. We scored, but Jamshedpur FC scored two, so hopefully in the next match, we go better prepared and don\u2019t concede and score,\u201d the head coach commented.",

        "text": "Playfulness with a dog turned fatal for a 22-year-old man who slipped from the third floor of a hotel building in Chandanagar, Hyderabad late on Sunday (October 20, 2024).\n\nThe deceased, identified as Uday Kumar, was a painter by profession and resident of Jyothi Nagar, a neighbourhood in RC Puram. The incident unfolded at VV Pride Hotel in Annapurna Enclave of Chandanagar on the intervening night of October 20 and 21, where he was attending a birthday celebration with a group of friends. \n\nAccording to the police, the man stepped out in the lobby around 12.30 a.m. where he saw a dog and started playing with it. \u201cUday ran behind the dog across the lobby and lost control of his speed. He could not take a turn and fell through a window on the third floor. He died on the spot,\u201d the police said. The incident was captured on hotel\u2019s CCTV cameras in which Uday can be seen running across the corridor before crashing into the window. Incidentally, the hotel has a 3.4 ratings and the reviews on Google are unflattering with most of them littered with complaints.\n\nThe body was shifted to Gandhi Hospital for postmortem and his family in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh was informed about the incident. The Chandanagar police booked a case under the Section 194 (suspicious death) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and initiated investigation.",

The preparations were revealed in an ICC meeting on Monday, during which the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, was also present. Sources told Geo News that during the meeting, the PCB officials assured the ICC board members that the upgradation of the three stadiums that will host the matches of the marquee event will be completed within the stipulated time. Naqvi has also invited ICC board members to Pakistan to review the preparations made for the tournament. The Champions Trophy will begin next year in Pakistan, but there are certain challenges that need to be addressed. Uncertainty continues to loom over India going to Pakistan for the mega event. Since 2008\u2019s Asia Cup, India has not played any cricket tournaments in Pakistan due to tense relationships between both nations because of terrorism.A series played from December 2012 to January 2013 in India marked the final bilateral series between the two nations. Since then, both nations have only clashed at ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. On the other hand, Pakistan travelled to India on three occasions since the 2008 Asia Cup.Recently, reports started to surface about the International Cricket Council (ICC) looking at three options regarding hosting the Champions Trophy.According to sources, ICC is either looking to have the tournament go ahead in Pakistan as planned or take place in both Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a part of the hybrid model.As per this hybrid model, matches for India and knockout stage games will take place in Dubai. The third option is the entire tournament, taking place outside Pakistan, with Dubai, Sri Lanka or South Africa as possible hosts.Pakistan have not hosted any major International Cricket Council (ICC) event since the 1996 ODI World Cup, which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka.

        "text": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the Women's T20 World Cup 2024 Team of the Tournament on Monday and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur is the only player from India who was included in the side. In an otherwise disappointing campaign for India, skipper Harmanpreet was the standout performer for the Women in Blue. She finished as India's top scorer and the fourth-highest overall in the tournament, amassing 150 runs in four innings.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");With two fifties to her name, she boasted an incredible average of 150. Her strike rate of 133.92 was the fifth-best in the tournament. Kaur's quickfire 52 off 27 balls against Sri Lanka was crucial in keeping India's hopes alive for a semifinal spot.South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt was a solid presence for her side at the top. Wolvaardt passed 30 in all but one of her games, with four scores of over 40. While her highest score came in South Africa's first game, it was her resilient 42 in the semi-final that set up a strong base during her team's successful chase against Australia.In pursuit of 135, Wolvaardt helped put her team ahead of the game, scoring at a brisk pace with three fours and a six to her name, allowing Anneke Bosch to settle in and launch a stupendous counter-attack.South Africa's opener formed a strong partnership with captain Laura Wolvaardt at the top of the order, driving the team to the final. Brits amassed 187 runs in six innings, with an impressive average of 37.40, making her the second-highest run-scorer, just behind Wolvaardt. She surpassed 40 runs in three innings, including a match-winning unbeaten 57 in South Africa's opening fixture against the West Indies.Danni Wyatt-Hodge was a firecracker at the top of the order for the England side, notching up the most runs for them at the World Cup. The right-hand batter notched up scores of 40+ in each of England's first three games.Wyatt-Hodge started off her tournament with a brisk 41 against Bangladesh, following it up with a crucial run-a-ball 43 to get past eventual runners-up South Africa. Her best performance was against Scotland in their penultimate game, where she slammed an unbeaten 26-ball 51, to guide England to a 10-wicket win in a record partnership alongside Maia Bouchier.The Player of the Final and the Player of the Tournament, Melie Kerr starred in New Zealand's title-winning campaign. She contributed both with the bat and ball, scoring 135 runs in six innings, with her high score of 43 coming crucially in the final. She took 15 wickets in the competition, becoming the tournament's leading wicket-taker.Her impressive 3 for 24 in the final, including the crucial wickets of Wolvaardt and Bosch, was pivotal in New Zealand's victory, securing their second ICC tournament title.Deandra Dottin shone for the West Indies on her return to international cricket, scoring 120 runs in five innings at an average of 40, playing a crucial role for the team in the middle order. Her tournament-high nine sixes were unmatched, with the next-best being teammate Qiana Joseph's three.Dottin also contributed with the ball, taking five wickets, including a standout performance of 4 for 22 in the semifinal against New Zealand. Her explosive power-hitting was key in West Indies' victory in the virtual quarterfinal against England, securing their spot in the semifinals. The Bangladesh wicketkeeper had a standout performance for the Tigresses, excelling both behind the stumps and with the bat.She scored 104 runs in four innings at an average of 34.66, with a top score of 39 against the West Indies. Yet her best contributions came with the gloves, where she made six stumpings and took one catch. Her total of seven dismissals was the highest among wicketkeepers in the tournament.Afy Fletcher came up clutch with the ball for the West Indies, finishing off with the third-most wickets at this T20 World Cup. Despite not picking up a wicket in their opening game against the Proteas, the 37-year-old returned with strong performances, taking 10 wickets in total, including two 3-wicket hauls against Scotland and England.She picked up her best figures of 3-21 in the West Indies' defining match - their final group stage game against England, which paved their way into the last four. In the semi-final, she scalped two crucial wickets and a laudable 17* as well, with her side knocked out by eventual winners New Zealand.New Zealand's impactful pacer Rosemary Mair bookended her tournament with two outstanding displays. It was the 25-year-old who returned the best figures for the White Ferns in their crucial opening win over India, taking 4/19 from her four overs - dismissing Harmanpreet Kaur with a hooping inswinger in the powerplay and then returning to clean up the tail in the death overs.And Mair was excellent again in the final, taking 3/25 and once more playing the important role of bowling key overs in the powerplay and at the back-end of the innings. With probing accuracy combined with big movement, Mair proved an important weapon for the champions. No pace bowler took more wickets than her ten, and she finished as the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, behind only fellow finalists Nonkululeko Mlaba and Melie Kerr.South Africa's pocket-sized dynamo made her team's tournament come to life with a brilliant 4/29 in their very first game against the West Indies.Mlaba remained crucial for the Proteas throughout the event, varying her speeds and lengths to great effect against opposition batters. Whenever a partnership threatened South Africa, captain Wolvaardt would turn to Mlaba for a breakthrough, and the left-armer didn't disappoint.Her scalp of Tahlia McGrath ended a promising stand for Australia in the semi-final, and Mlaba also removed the well-set Suzie Bates (32) and Melie Kerr (43) in the final.Australia's reliable pacer Megan Schutt had a typically impactful outing in the UAE, troubling the batters throughout the innings. Her ability to maintain control was matched by her wicket-taking prowess. She was at her best in the group game against eventual champions New Zealand. She struck first in New Zealand's pursuit of 149, cleaning up Georgia Plimmer for 4. This was followed by wickets of Melie Kerr and Eden Carson in the 12th and 20th over respectively to seal a dominant win for Australia.Such was Schutt's control on the night that she conceded merely three runs in her 3.2 overs.Women's T20 WC Team of the Tournament: Laura Wolvaardt (C), Tazmin Brits, Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Melie Kerr, Harmanpreet Kaur, Deandra Dottin, Nigar Sultana Joty (WK), Afy Fletcher, Rosemary Mair, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Megan Schutt.",

        "text": "RB Leipzig host Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday as Jurgen Klopp's recent past and not-too-distant future collide. The 57-year-old will not be there at the Red Bull Arena on Wednesday but his shadow still looms over the contest. Klopp stepped down as Liverpool manager in the summer citing exhaustion after a successful nine-year spell which included lifting the Champions League and Premier League. In October, Klopp announced his return to football, not as a coach but running Red Bull's football operations, which oversees clubs in several cities including Leipzig, Salzburg and New York.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");He will be absent from the game, choosing to wait to attend a match after starting the role in January.While the appointment was a surprise in Germany and in England, the focus on Leipzig has been particularly acute. In a strange quirk of the fixture list, Leipzig's five fixtures after the announcement includes games against each of Klopp's former clubs: Mainz, Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund. 'Klopp in Mallorca'Klopp was again a topic of conversation after Leipzig's 2-0 win at Mainz on Saturday, by fans and media alike.Some fans held banners protesting the appointment, while reporters asked if Leipzig coach Marco Rose had asked Klopp for tips on how to beat the Reds on Wednesday. Rose played under Klopp for several years at Mainz and the two maintain a good relationship. He said he would \"not be phoning up\" his former coach for tips on how to beat Liverpool. \"Kloppo is in (Spanish island) Mallorca, looking after his dog, his wife and his children. \"I will do everything (to beat Liverpool) but I won't call Klopp. \"He needs his peace and quiet and needs to rest a bit.\"And I'll grant him that.\"Born and raised in Leipzig, Rose took the ambitious club to the 2023 German Cup title in his first season. The 48-year-old followed it up with a run to the Champions League last 16, where Leipzig were narrowly eliminated by eventual champions Real Madrid. This season, Leipzig have managed to hold onto most of their young talent, giving rise to hopes of a shot at the league title and a long run in Europe.Although Leipzig are second to Bayern Munich on goal difference in the Bundesliga, the Champions League is another story, albeit with a tough draw. Leipzig conceded late goals to lose away at Atletico Madrid and at home against Juventus. The Saxon side have yet to claim a point in Europe this season, making Wednesday's clash with the Premier League leaders even more important.'Extremely stable'Like Liverpool, Leipzig's strong league form this campaign has been built on a miserly defence.Leipzig have kept clean sheets in six of seven league games. The two goals they did concede came against Bayer Leverkusen in a game Leipzig won 3-2, the defending champions' first defeat on German soil in 15 months. Starting the campaign under Klopp replacement Arne Slot, Liverpool have conceded just three goals in eight league games this season, by far the best mark in the Premier League.Peter Gulasci, Leipzig's goalkeeper, on Saturday recognised the similarities. \"Liverpool are extremely stable and don't allow much at the back -- just like us.\"That's why it won't be easy. \"Their style of play has changed a bit (under Slot), they play a bit more with the ball and are very structured. \"We've shown in the first two games we're on par with our opponents, but now we have to finally reward ourselves for our hard work.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Puneri Paltan and UP Yoddhas secured contrasting wins in their first match Pro Kabaddi League on Monday at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, Gachibowli, Hyderabad.\n\nDefending champions Paltan beat the Patna Pirates 40-25 while the Yoddhas began their season with a 28-23 win over Dabang Delhi KC. \n\nPaltan started off strongly, as Aslam Inamdar and co quickly stormed into a 4-0 lead in the first few minutes of the game. Soon after though, the Patna Pirates started to fight back with Ankit\u2019s Super Tackle on Inamdar cutting down the deficit to one point in the early exchanges. \n\nWith just under ten minutes to go in the first half, the Paltan had surged ahead and were looking to consolidate on a three-point lead. After that, a flurry of solid defensive tackles further extended the Paltan\u2019s lead, who were dominating proceedings at this point in time. \n\nFor the Paltan, captain Inamdar led by example with seven points and had fantastic support from Aman with five points and Mohit Goyat, who bagged three points. At the half-time break, Puneri Paltan led 20-10.\n\nAfter the break, the Paltan continued to dominate the contest, keeping the Pirates at an arm\u2019s length. At the midway point in the second half, the Paltan had a 13-point lead to their name. \n\nThe Pirates were giving it their all to mount a comeback, but the likes of Goyat, Inamdar and Aman were having none of it. \n\nIn the final minutes, the Pirates\u2019 Jang Kun Lee was introduced and his arrival triggered a round of rapturous applause from the crowd. However, there wasn\u2019t enough time to turn the tide, as the Paltan came away with a comfortable win to wrap up an entertaining Monday evening.\n\nYoddhas edge past Delhi\n\nThe Yoddhas kicked off proceedings when they picked up the first points of the game through a Surender Gill raid. After that, it was a tight battle, as the two competitors traded raids and points without conceding an inch to each other. Neither side could take an outright lead in the early exchanges in what was turning out to be a close battle. \n\nHowever, as the first half reached the midway stage, Bhavani Rajput took charge as the Yoddhas started to settle in, and edged ahead of their opponents. As the half wore on, Ashu Malik and Nitin Panwar helped Dabang Delhi KC fight back and bring the contest back on level terms. The first half ended with the scores tied at 12-11. \n\nThe second half was also a cautious start with both sides taking their time to strike. Both sides were finding it tough to break each other down despite multiple well thought out moves in the early exchanges. At the end of the first phase of the second half, there was hardly any difference between the two sides. The Yoddhas led by 18-16, with the game very much on a knife-edge. \n\nBy now Naveen Kumar had picked up the baton from Ashu Malik, and was leading the charge for the Delhi as they looked to fightback. However, in the final phase of play, the Yoddhas cranked up the intensity as Sahul Kumar inflicted an all out on Delhi and the raiders also picked up crucial points. \n\nThat helped the Yoddhas take a five-point lead with less than five minutes to go. Eventually, the Yoddhas came away with the win in what was a closely fought game. Rajput top scored for the UP Yoddhas with seven points.",

        "text": "India's victorious T20 World Cup 2024 campaign didn't feature wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson in any many. Despite the fact that Rishabh Pant was making his return to the national side after a long injury layoff, Team India decided to stick with him over picking an in-form Samson. However, right before the final against South Africa, India captain Rohit Sharma had asked Samson to be ready as there was a big chance he would be playing in the title clash. However, it all changed just minutes before the toss.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In an interview, Samson revealed that he was preparing to play in the final for India before Rohit informed him that the team was going with the same XI.\"I had a chance to play the final. I was told to stay ready. I was ready. However, they decided before the toss that we would go with the same team. I was like, no worries. I was in that type of mood,\" Samson told journalist Vimal Kumar during a chat.After the playing XI was decided Rohit spent a good amount of time with Samson explaining the decision.\"During the warm-up, Rohit took me to the side and started to explain to me why he was making that decision. He was like, You understood, na? You know his way, very casual? I told him, 'Let us win the match and then talk.' You focus on the match.\"He later said, \"He came back one minute later and said, 'I know you are cursing me in your mind.' I think you are not happy. I feel like you have something on your mind. Then we had a discussion. I told him, 'As a player, I want to play'.\"Samson even informed Rohit that he didn't want to let go of the opportunity to not feature in a final under his captaincy. This is a regret he would have to live with for the rest of his life.\"Since childhood, I wanted to come here and do something. Then he was like, 'My pattern is like this' and all that. I said I totally respect that you came and explained me. I said, 'I will have a regret; I could not play a World Cup final with a leader like you.' This will be a regret in my heart that I missed a World Cup final with a leader like Rohit Sharma. That will stay in my life.\"However, a thought that changed Samson's mind was the fact that instead of giving the selected XI members his time, Rohit chose to spend time with the player who wasn't even part of the team for the final. This side of Rohit made Samson respect him even more.\"After this, I thought, such a big thing like a World Cup final. Before the final, you have changed your decision. You spent 10 minutes with the player that is not playing just before the toss. He gave me 10 minutes before the toss. After that, I got to know this person has some other qualities.\"If I were in their place, I would be thinking about the players who are playing or my batting. I will explain to Sanju later; that is what normally you think. At that point, he thought 'I have to explain to Sanju, why I took that decision.' At that point, he won a place in my heart that will stay for a lifetime.\"",

He came off the bench 369 days later for the four-time Asian champion with 13 minutes remaining at Al Ain. He almost scored immediately when his low shot from left of the area shaved the post.In a thrilling match between Al-Hilal and the defending champion, Renan Lodi gave Al-Hilal the opener after 26 minutes. Soufiane Rahimi, the tournament top scorer last season, leveled soon after.By the break, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Salem Al-Dawsari put Hilal 3-1 ahead.Mateo Sanabria pulled a goal back just after the hour but Al-Dawsari scored twice more to complete a hat trick, and Rahimi achieved the same feat to make it 5-4.The win maintained Al-Hilal's perfect record in Asia after three games.Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia's Al-Ahli won at Qatar's Al-Rayyan 2-1 thanks to goals from Gabri Veiga and Firas Al-Buraikan.Iraq's Al-Shorta drew with Uzbekistan's Pakhtakor 0-0, and Qatar's Al-Sadd defeated Iran's Persepolis 1-0.Al-Nassr and Cristiano Ronaldo are in action on Tuesday against Esteghlal of Iran.

        "title": "How Bumrah, Shami had helped India win maiden Test series in Australia",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: India pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami form one of the most potent fast-bowling partnerships in world cricket. Their combination is highly effective due to a blend of contrasting but complementary skills.While Bumrah is known for his unorthodox action and ability to bowl consistently at high speeds, excelling in hitting yorkers, especially at the death, and generating seam movement, Shami offers similar pace but focuses more on seam position and swing, both conventional and reverse. His accuracy with both new and old balls makes him dangerous across formats.Both Bumrah and Shami had played pivotal roles in India's historic Test series triumph in 2018-19 - India's first ever Test series win in Australia.Also See: Cricket Live ScoreWith India set to play their first Test against Australia exactly one month from now, here's a look back at the roles Bumrah and Shami played in helping Virat Kohli's team make history.Jasprit BumrahBumrah took 21 wickets from 4 Test matches with a best of 9/86 that came at an average of 17.00 and a strike rate of 44.9.Bumrah was not the spearhead of the Indian bowling attack at the time but left the Aussie shores as the bowling mainstay of the Indian team. The strong shoulder of his that allows him to send thunderbolts at over 140 kmph even from a short run-up led to then Indian captain Virat Kohli saying that he wouldn't like to face Bumrah in a Test match. Some compliment that.And Bumrah had the figures to match Kohli's words. And the guile too. The slower delivery that he bowled to dismiss Shaun Marsh LBW at the stroke of lunch on Day 3 of the Boxing Day Test, not only displayed his accuracy and control but also his maturity.Recall the 147.7 kmph delivery that Bumrah bowled to then Australian captain Tim Paine in Perth. The good length delivery had slight lateral movement, squared up Paine and zoomed past the stumps and over a jumping Rishabh Pant to race to the boundary. Now Paine was not the best batsman in the world but that delivery would have bamboozled any batsman worth his salt.It was not surprising that Bumrah finished as the leading wicket-taker for India with 21 scalps to his name. With his then career-best figures of 6/33 in 15.5 overs at the MCG, Bumrah became the first bowler from the sub-continent to register a five-wicket haul in South Africa, England and Australia in the same year. With match figures of 9/86, Bumrah was India's hero in the Boxing Day Test victory. Bumrah ended his debut Test season with a record 49 wickets by any pace bowler.Mohammed ShamiMohammed Shami took 16 wickets in the four-Test series with a best of 6/136 at an average of 26.18 and a strike rate of 51.2.Shami took 5 wickets in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval which India won by 31 runs. And when Virat Kohli opted to field four pacers in the second Test in Perth, it was Shami, at his furious best, who shone the brightest amongst the Indian seamers.Shami went wicketless in the first innings but in the second innings ripped through Australia's lower middle-order. He was on a hat-trick at one point - having dismissed Tim Paine and Aaron Finch off successive deliveries.It was thanks mainly to Shami's career-best haul of 6/56 that India were able to bowl out Australia for 243 runs in their second innings. But the match slipped from India's grasp due to the lack of a balanced bowling attack - a glaring lapse even Shami had admitted to.The ability of Bumrah and Shami to bowl in tandem makes them one of the most feared fast-bowling duos in modern cricket, especially in Test matches where they have consistently delivered for India both at home and abroad.So the whole of India would be keeping their fingers crossed for Shami to be fit for the Australia tour.",
        "summary": "India's fast-bowling duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, played crucial roles in India's historic Test series win in Australia in 2018-19. Bumrah's consistency and Shami's precision complemented each other perfectly. With both players showcasing exceptional skills, they collectively took 37 wickets, leading India to a memorable victory Down Under. India would be keeping fingers crossed for Shami to be fit for the Australia tour.",

        "text": "Hyderabad FC head coach Thangboi Singto acknowledged his team\u2019s need for improvement at both ends of the pitch after the club suffered their third defeat in the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 season.The Yellow and Black managed to score their first goal of the season against Jamshedpur FC, with Cy Goddard finding the net early in the second half. But it wasn\u2019t enough as first-half goals from Rei Tachikawa and Jordan Murray secured another three points at home for Khalid Jamil\u2019s squad.The visitors started the match positively but couldn\u2019t maintain the momentum for long, allowing the home side to gain control after the initial phase of play.Singto discussed his players\u2019 performance and the issues they faced during their defeat in the post-match press conference.\u201cThe first 30 minutes were one of the best football matches we have played by far. But what happened after the first 30 minutes is a different story. Before Jamshedpur FC scored, we were controlling (the game), and pushing Jamshedpur FC back,\u201d Singto said as quoted from ISL.\u201cBut maybe football is about concentration, and a lack of communication led to that cross happening and from there, with that movement and not tracking Rei (Tachikawa), who was running for a tap-in. We can do better defensively and we need to be sharper,\u201d he added.The long wait for their first goal of the season ended, and while Hyderabad FC showed moments of sharpness, the hosts used their experience overall to secure the three points.\u201cWe scored our first goal of the season at least, though we lost in terms of performance. I think we were happy with the first half and in patches, but, you know, we\u2019re going to churn out the results. We need to win for everybody around us. So yeah, we have to keep working hard,\u201d Singto opined.The visitors actually gained more possession and had more shots on target, with eight compared to Jamshedpur FC\u2019s five.Singto praised his players for their efforts on the pitch, particularly the young winger Ramhlunchhunga, who troubled Jamshedpur FC on several occasions but couldn\u2019t help secure their second point of the season in the end.\u201cSome of the boys really stepped up today. Ramhlunchhunga: what a game he had today! The shortest guy (on the pitch), but he was all around the pitch with some good shots on target,\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut we need to be more clinical; football is about goals. If you want three points, you need to score goals. We scored, but Jamshedpur FC scored two, so hopefully in the next match, we go better prepared and don\u2019t concede and score,\u201d the head coach commented.",

        "text": "Playfulness with a dog turned fatal for a 22-year-old man who slipped from the third floor of a hotel building in Chandanagar, Hyderabad late on Sunday (October 20, 2024).\n\nThe deceased, identified as Uday Kumar, was a painter by profession and resident of Jyothi Nagar, a neighbourhood in RC Puram. The incident unfolded at VV Pride Hotel in Annapurna Enclave of Chandanagar on the intervening night of October 20 and 21, where he was attending a birthday celebration with a group of friends. \n\nAccording to the police, the man stepped out in the lobby around 12.30 a.m. where he saw a dog and started playing with it. \u201cUday ran behind the dog across the lobby and lost control of his speed. He could not take a turn and fell through a window on the third floor. He died on the spot,\u201d the police said. The incident was captured on hotel\u2019s CCTV cameras in which Uday can be seen running across the corridor before crashing into the window. Incidentally, the hotel has a 3.4 ratings and the reviews on Google are unflattering with most of them littered with complaints.\n\nThe body was shifted to Gandhi Hospital for postmortem and his family in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh was informed about the incident. The Chandanagar police booked a case under the Section 194 (suspicious death) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and initiated investigation.",

        "text": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) expressed its satisfaction over the detailed briefing of arrangements presented by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials for next year\u2019s Champions Trophy, sources told Geo News. The preparations were revealed in an ICC meeting on Monday, during which the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, was also present. Sources told Geo News that during the meeting, the PCB officials assured the ICC board members that the upgradation of the three stadiums that will host the matches of the marquee event will be completed within the stipulated time. Naqvi has also invited ICC board members to Pakistan to review the preparations made for the tournament. The Champions Trophy will begin next year in Pakistan, but there are certain challenges that need to be addressed. Uncertainty continues to loom over India going to Pakistan for the mega event. Since 2008\u2019s Asia Cup, India has not played any cricket tournaments in Pakistan due to tense relationships between both nations because of terrorism.A series played from December 2012 to January 2013 in India marked the final bilateral series between the two nations. Since then, both nations have only clashed at ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. On the other hand, Pakistan travelled to India on three occasions since the 2008 Asia Cup.Recently, reports started to surface about the International Cricket Council (ICC) looking at three options regarding hosting the Champions Trophy.According to sources, ICC is either looking to have the tournament go ahead in Pakistan as planned or take place in both Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a part of the hybrid model.As per this hybrid model, matches for India and knockout stage games will take place in Dubai. The third option is the entire tournament, taking place outside Pakistan, with Dubai, Sri Lanka or South Africa as possible hosts.Pakistan have not hosted any major International Cricket Council (ICC) event since the 1996 ODI World Cup, which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka.

        "text": "New Zealand's golden generation, led by the inspirational Sophie Devine, will have one last chance to lay hands on a global ICC trophy when it meets a gritty South Africa in the summit clash of the T20 World Cup which is set to throw a new champion, here Sunday. New Zealand's women's team had won the ODI World Cup back in 2000 but none of the current squad members were part of that historic title triumph. Before this event began, New Zealand were in the trenches having lost 10 matches on the trot in the format but under Devine this bunch, comprising of the venerable Suzie Bates and the assuring Amelia Kerr, has done wonders, bringing the side in contention for the ultimate prize.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");It is most probably the last time the Black Shirts will have Devine, Bates and Lea Tahuhu playing of the national side in a global tournament.Devine, 35, has more than 7000 runs under her belt in white-ball formats while the 37-year-old Bates has more than 10,000 runs to her name.Pacer Tahuhu, 34, has 112 wickets in ODIs and 93 in T20Is.They won't leave any stone unturned to ensure that they have a World Cup trophy in their cabinet.South Africa on the other side will be equally determined to complete the unfinished business as they had lost the 2023 World Cup final to Australia at home. They have an opportunity to erase painful memories as they had lost by a mere 19 runs in the close contest.New Zealand have one or other player to rise the occasion in the tournament and in the semifinal against the West Indies, if they failed to set a target big enough to daunt the free-flowing Caribbean batters, their bowlers responded with tidy spells throughout the game to eke out a memorable win.Kerr's wicket tally has swelled to 12 in the tournament as she found apt support from the other end in the likes of Eden Carson (8), Rosemary Mair (7) and the experienced Lea Tahuhu.New Zealand announced their intentions with a big win against India first up and followed that up with consistent performances across departments.A 60-run loss to Australia, arguably the strongest team in the competition, notwithstanding, the Kiwis weren't unnerved as they went on to pip the West Indies in the final over of their low-scoring semifinal to make their third final.When the tournament began towards the end of the first decade of this century, New Zealand appeared to be the team to beat as they made two consecutive finals but got pipped by England and Australia once each.Bates and Devine, the survivors from those campaigns, will thus get a third crack in winning the first ICC trophy for New Zealand in white-ball cricket since 2000 when the men's team won the Champions Trophy in Kenya.But against them will be the formidable South Africa who scripted history of sorts to have stopped the all-dominating Australian team from reaching their eighth consecutive final in the last 15 years and seven editions of the T20 World Cup.If New Zealand has Kerr topping the charts for most successful bowlers, South Africa have two of their top-order batters \u2014 Laura Wolvaardt (190 runs) and Tazmin Brits (170 runs) \u2014 lodged at the top of the batting charts in this tournament.South Africa's all-round might will pose the sternest challenge as the Proteas side is coming off a comprehensive eight-wicket thrashing of Australia, having restricted them to a mere 135/5 and knocked off the target with more than two overs to spare.While a lot will depend on the pair of Wolvaardt and Brits at the top, SA will need the likes of Anneke Bosch and Marizanne Kapp to chip in with the bat too.Similarly, Nonkululeko Mlaba (10 wickets) would also need the rest of the bowlers to replicate their performance from the semifinal, in which they collectively kept it tight to not allow Australia to get away with the bat.Squads:New Zealand: Sophie Devine (captain), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Isabella Gaze (wk), Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Amelia Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder (wk), Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon.Time: 7:30PM IST.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Max Verstappen swept to a convincing pole position for Saturday's sprint race at the United States Grand Prix in a fast and frantic qualifying session on Friday. It was the first time in 12 events since the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in May that the three-time world champion had secured any kind of pole position. Verstappen clocked a best lap in one minute and 32.833 seconds to beat Mercedes' George Russell by 0.012 seconds with Charles Leclerc taking third place on the grid for Ferrari.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");McLaren's Lando Norris, who trails Verstappen by 52 points in the championship with six Grands Prix including three sprints remaining, was fourth ahead of Carlos Sainz of Ferrari and Nico Hulkenberg of Haas.\"That was good,\" said Verstappen. \"We had a good day. Sprint qualifying is always difficult. You never know how much you can push, but the car was working well.\"Of course I'm very happy to be first, it's been a while.\"The Dutchman added: \"It's always very hectic and you know this track is amazing to drive.\"Norris was left frustrated after struggling for set-up balance with his car.\"That was not very good. We are struggling. And my lap was shocking,\" said the Briton.\"I hope I can go forward in the sprint, or at least that's the plan, but honestly for pace we are where we deserve to be.\"'In the mix' Russell said: \"I'm happy and it's been a while since we were on the front tow and my last run was strong. It's good to be back in the mix. The car is feeling great and it's close.\"Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was seventh for Mercedes ahead of Kevin Magnussen in the second Haas, Yuki Tsunoda of RB and Williams' Franco Colapinto.Both Sergio Perez of Red Bull and Oscar Piastri of McLaren failed to progress to the top ten shootout.On a warm, dry day at the Circuit of the Americas, with a track temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, Verstappen led the queue out of the pit-lane to clock a marker lap quickly beaten by Magnussen, Leclerc and then Hamilton in 1:33.840.In a frantic and brisk opening session, lasting only 15 minutes, Leclerc took the initiative in 1:33.647 before the flag to confirm an early surprise exit for McLaren's Oscar Piastri, Esteban Ocon of Alpine, Willliams' Alex Albon, who survived a big spin at the final corner in his 100th Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu of Sauber.A late improved lap by Piastri was deleted because he exceeded track limits at Turn 19.As in the opening period, the second session began with everyone on medium tyres and Hamilton setting the pace in 1:33.370 before Sainz outpaced him by 0.096.Red Bull delayed their runs, but Verstappen swept to second in 1:33.290 on his opening lap with Perez struggling into 10th.\"I'm struggling a lot with the ride,\" reported Verstappen on team radio, on a day when Red Bull's ride-height device had caused controversy.At the flag, Tsunoda had improved to bump Perez down to 11th and out again along with Alpine's Pierre Gasly, the Aston Martin duo of Lance Stroll and two-time champion Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson of RB, the New Zealand driver having taken over from Daniel Ricciardo for the rest of the season.All this meant Colapinto was in the top-ten shootout with Tsunoda and Hulkenberg.The two Mercedes men led the way out for third session with Colapinto in tow, Russell topping the early laps in 1:32.845 to beat Hamilton by 0.533.Verstappen, who had delayed his lap, swept to pole with a strong lap in 1:32.833 to beat Russell by 0.012, leaving Leclerc third and Norris fourth.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Bigg Boss Telugu 8 Day 47 Highlights: Gautam Takes the Lead as Mega Chief",
        "text": "The current season of Bigg Boss Telugu, aptly titled \"Limitless Entertainment,\" has been delivering a blend of drama and excitement week after week. The entry of wildcard contestants, known as the Royals, in the fifth week has added a new layer of competition, often overshadowing the original housemates, referred to as the OG clan. This week\u2019s main task, \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers,\" tested the participants' concentration, strategy, and resilience. Here are some highlights from Day 47 of Bigg Boss Telugu 8:\r\n1. The Cushion Challenge:\r\nThe day began with the continuation of the \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers\" task. Bigg Boss introduced the Cushion Challenge, a twist on the Memory game. Contestants were required to match images displayed on a screen with cushions placed in the garden area, carrying the cushions to a designated grid to score points. \r\n\r\nDespite facing early setbacks, the Over Smartphones team emerged victorious, earning the advantage of eliminating two players from the Over Smart Chargers from the Mega Chief race. They chose to remove Nabeel and Nikhil from the competition.\r\n2. The Conclusion:\r\nThe weekly challenge concluded with four contestants from the OG clan and eight from the Royals still in the game. After the weekly task concluded, Teja and Prithvi were released from their punishment as the week's worst performers, regaining access to their suitcases.\r\n3. Comic Relief from Bigg Boss:\r\nBigg Boss humorously reprimanded Mehaboob and Avinash for napping during the day. The housemates were then summoned to the garden, where they found miniature coffee cups, bun masks, and a violin cutout\u2014a playful nod to Avinash\u2019s earlier requests for coffee and pain relief spray. Both the housemates and viewers enjoyed this lighthearted moment.\r\n4. A Hair-Raising Opportunity:\r\nDuring breakfast, Gautam playfully challenged Prithvi to shave his beard, which Prithvi declined. Bigg Boss then introduced a unique chance to add money to the winner's prize by offering Avinash and Prithvi cash rewards of \u20b925,000, \u20b950,000, or \u20b91 lakh for various haircuts. \r\n\r\nAlthough Prithvi declined, Avinash accepted the \u20b950,000 haircut after much deliberation, adding humour to the situation. He sportingly underwent the haircut, entertaining the audience with his witty remarks.\r\n5. Additional Reward:\r\nIn recognition of Avinash's spirit and courage, Bigg Boss added \u20b950,000 to the winner's prize pool. Furthermore, the house was granted an extra two hours of kitchen time as an additional reward.\r\n6. Selection of the Mega Chief:\r\nThe competition for the prestigious Mega Chief position was through a task called \"Pattuko ledha thappuko,\" in which contenders had to grab a bone placed in a circle before others. The first to seize the bone gained the advantage of eliminating one or two competitors from the race. Gautam ultimately secured the Mega Chief role after a fierce fight.\r\n7. A Slight Commotion:\r\nAt one point, Manikanta grabbed the bone and initially decided to eliminate Hariteja and Teja, citing a pre-game agreement with Gautam to stay in the competition until the end. \r\n\r\nHowever, Gautam denied having made any such deal, leading Manikanta to reconsider his choice and decide to eliminate Teja and Gautam. The situation was resolved by Nikhil, who, as the task Sanchalak, upheld Manikanta's original decision to remove Teja and Hariteja, despite Hariteja's objections.\r\n8. Gautam\u2019s Tribute for Women:\r\nAs the newly appointed Mega Chief, Gautam declared the upcoming week for the women in honour of the female audience. He announced that the women in the house would be exempt from performing household chores unless they volunteered, which garnered appreciation from the housemates and the audience.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the week's episodes, viewers eagerly await the weekend's special broadcasts, during which the host will analyze the housemates' performances\u2013 the weekend episodes air at 9 pm, half an hour earlier than the weekday schedule, on Disney+ Hotstar and Star Maa. \r\n\r\nBased on the above highlights of Day 47 and the promos, a compelling critique of the contestants' strategies and gameplay can be expected in Bigg Boss Telugu 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStay tuned to Yo!

This was largely due to Sarfaraz's penchant for scoring big hundreds, which he carried from first-class to Test cricket with a brilliant 150 off 195 balls, and a partnership of 177 with a partially fit Rishabh Pant, who fell short of his seventh Test century by just one run.114376403India's resilience in Test cricket has been exemplified by remarkable second-innings performances, resulting in some of the most significant improvements in team scores between the first and second innings. 114373829The highest such improvement occurred during the iconic 2001 Kolkata Test against Australia, where India improved by 486 runs, going from 171 all out to declaring at 657/7. In 1999, India witnessed a 422-run improvement against New Zealand in Mohali, from 83 to 505/3 declared.114366921In a recent 2024 Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, India bounced back from a dismal 46 in the first innings to score 462, an improvement of 416 runs. A 375-run improvement took place in 1965 at Brabourne Stadium, where India posted 88 and then 463/5 declared, also against New Zealand.

The White Ferns beat India by 58 runs in their Group A opener but succumbed to a 60-run loss to Australia in their second outing.An eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and a comfortable 54-run win against Pakistan saw Sophie Devine\u2019s team cross paths with 2016 champions West Indies in the top four.A narrow eight-run win over the Windies saw New Zealand make their first summit clash since 2010. The White Ferns reached the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final in the first two editions but lost to England in 2009 before coming up short against Australia the following year.The 2024 Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final promises to be a fascinating contest between bat and ball with South African captain Laura Wolvaardt leading the run-scoring charts in the tournament while New Zealand spinner Amelie Kerr is the top wicket-taker.South Africa, though, seems the more balanced of the two sides ahead of the contest with Tazmin Brits, the tournament\u2019s second-highest run-scorer, and Nonkululeko Mlaba, the tournament\u2019s second-highest wicket-taker, also in their ranks.

Speaking as the chief guest at the Indian Steps and Business Incubators Association (ISBACON-2024) conference held at CCMB in Tarnaka, he highlighted the city's thriving startup ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSharing his vision of promoting startups to attract investments and create employment opportunities in Telangana, he explained that the establishment of T-Hub was based on the belief that providing young talent with the right financial resources would lead to remarkable achievements.\r\n\r\nHe proudly recounted the growth story of T-Hub, his brainchild, which has become the largest incubator center in the country under the names T-Hub, T-Works, and Image Towers. Starting with a capacity of 2,000 startup companies, the success of T-Hub led to the creation of T-Works and Image Towers, which now guide 5,000 startups in one location.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Hyderabad had only 200 startup companies, but today, it boasts over 5,000. He expressed pride in Ratan Tata's praise of T-Hub as the face of modern India. The former IT minister highlighted the establishment of T-Hub, T-Works, Image Towers, TASK, and WE-Hub to support young entrepreneurs, women, and rural youth in transforming their business ideas into reality.\r\n\r\nHe noted that a Hyderabad-based startup played a crucial role in India's first indigenous satellite launch.

        "text": "Jordan Cox is poised to make his Test debut as England's wicketkeeper during their upcoming tour of New Zealand. This opportunity arises as Jamie Smith is set to miss part of the series due to paternity leave. Cox, who will turn 24 on Monday as per ESPNcricinfo, has been England's reserve batter for the last five Tests and now has the chance to make his mark in December. Smith and his partner are expecting their first child in mid-December, coinciding with either the second or third Test against New Zealand.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"Being at the birth of my son is not something I want to miss,\" he told the Daily Mail recently, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\"It will be a memory that I cherish more than any in cricket anyway, so if I lost my place because of it, so be it,\" he added.Cox made his international debut in England's T20I series against Australia last month and will soon join the squads for their upcoming white-ball tour to the Caribbean. Although he was unable to keep wicket for Essex this summer due to a severe finger injury sustained in the Hundred last year, he has been refining his wicketkeeping skills with Brendon McCullum in Pakistan.\"It's life, right?\" McCullum, who is the head coach of the England Cricket team said of Smith's absence.\"People have kids and we wish them all the best, to be there and support their partners. At this stage, it looks like Jamie will probably play the first [Test in New Zealand] and may miss the next two. We're not totally sure - it's up to Mother Nature a little - but we know we've got Jordan Cox in the squad here,\" McCullum said, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.England is confident in Cox's abilities, despite his limited recent experience behind the stumps, a belief reinforced by Smith's own selection earlier this summer while being second-choice at Surrey. McCullum, drawing from his own experience, considers New Zealand to be a comfortable place for wicketkeeping and is eager to evaluate Cox's performance at the Test level. McCullum describes Cox's glovework as \"solid.\"Cox, known for his self-assured nature, admitted that he would get \"bored\" after reaching 40 runs while playing for a struggling Kent side last year. Seeking a change to reignite his passion for four-day cricket, he moved to Essex, where he scored four centuries and averaged 65.57 in his first County Championship season.He took over the No. 4 spot at Essex, vacated by Dan Lawrence's move to Surrey. Lawrence's own recent experiences underscore the challenges of being England's spare batter. After performing well in the Caribbean in March 2022, Lawrence waited over two years for another opportunity in the middle order, only to be placed as an opener with predictable results. Consequently, Cox has now moved ahead of Lawrence in the selection order.Unless England loses a batter to injury or illness before Thursday's third Test in Rawalpindi, Cox will be added to the white-ball squads and travel to the Caribbean, likely alongside Rehan Ahmed. Marcus Trescothick, serving as interim white-ball coach for the three ODIs and five T20Is against the West Indies, has already departed Pakistan in preparation for that tour.Cox is expected to make his ODI debut during the Caribbean series, providing him with an opportunity to stake a late claim for a spot in England's squad for next year's Champions Trophy. However, it is the prospect of a Test debut later this year that could truly satisfy his ambitions and validate the extensive travel he will undertake in the first half of the English winter.\"He's annoyingly good at everything he does - particularly on the golf course,\" McCullum said.\"He's one of those guys that you look at and say he's got a high ceiling in terms of talent, particularly with bat in hand. There's a fair chance that he'll get the opportunity in New Zealand, if Jamie does return home, to bat down the order and take the gloves,\" he noted.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. However, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.Despite the frustration, the Mariners (MBSG) maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.Their relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.The second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.Looking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.The 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.The Scottish midfielder was adjudged the player of the match and he continues to be Mohun Bagan Super Giant\u2019s main man in midfield. Stewart created three chances on the night while registering eight crosses. He also completed 31 out of his 35 attempted passes as per the media release by ISL.East Bengal FC will travel to Bhubaneswar to face Odisha FC in search of their first win of the season on October 22. On the other hand, Mohun Bagan Super Giant will be back in action again on October 30 when they will lock horns against Hyderabad FC away from home.",

        "text": "Manchester United eased the pressure on beleaguered boss Erik ten Hag as they fought back to beat Brentford 2-1, while Tottenham got back on track with a 4-1 rout of West Ham on Saturday. Ten Hag had defiantly slammed \"fairy tales and lies\" about his United future on Friday as the Dutchman insisted he was not in danger of the sack. But the 54-year-old is widely believed to be fighting to save his job after presiding over United's worst start to a top-flight season since 1989-90.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Ten Hag was surely teetering on the brink of being dismissed after Brentford pounced to take the lead in first-half stoppage time when Ethan Pinnock met a corner with a powerful header.The goal sparked a furious reaction from Ten Hag, who was booked for protesting about Matthijs de Ligt's enforced absence to have treatment on a bloodied head wound.But Alejandro Garnacho started United's revival in the 47th minute as the Argentinian met Marcus Rashford's angled pass with a superb volley into the top corner.Rasmus Hojlund bagged the decisive second goal in the 62nd minute, taking Bruno Fernandes' clever flick and clipping a composed finish over Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken.\"We don't score enough, we are not clinical enough, but today we scored two great goals,\" Ten Hag said.\"When you score you add some belief. It is only one win, we have to build on this.\"United's first win in six games in all competitions was only their third victory in eight Premier League matches this term.They sit 10th in the table ahead of an intriguing week, featuring a Europa League trip to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce and a visit to West Ham.Tottenham scored three goals in eight second-half minutes against West Ham to ease the pain of their recent collapse in a 3-2 loss at Brighton. Mohammed Kudus' opener for West Ham was cancelled out before the break by Dejan Kulusevski.Tottenham ran riot after the interval thanks to Yves Bissouma's strike, an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and a fourth from Son Heung-min.It was a third win in four league games for Ange Postecoglou's men, heaping pressure on new West Ham coach Julen Lopetegui after his side's spluttering start to the season.\"Second half was outstanding from the lads -- good energy, good goals, good football,\" Postecoglou said.Leicester's great escapeBrighton moved up to fifth place with a 1-0 victory at Newcastle on a day of mixed emotions for Danny Welbeck, who scored the 35th-minute winner but was later stretchered off with a back injury that left him needing an oxygen mask.Leicester staged a stirring fightback to snatch a dramatic 3-2 victory at winless Southampton.Cameron Archer struck in the eighth minute before Joe Aribo's 28th-minute goal increased the lead for the bottom-of-the-table hosts.But Leicester's Facundo Buonanotte bundled home in the 64th minute before Ryan Fraser was sent off for conceding a penalty with a foul on Jamie Vardy.Vardy stroked in the 74th-minute leveller from the spot and Jordan Ayew drilled into the bottom corner in the eighth minute of stoppage-time.Fourth-placed Aston Villa have made their best start for 26 years after a 3-1 win at Fulham.Raul Jimenez netted in the fifth minute, but Villa's Morgan Rogers equalised four minutes later.Andreas Pereira had a penalty saved by Villa 'keeper Emiliano Martinez before the interval.Ollie Watkins' 59th-minute header completed the comeback and Fulham's Joachim Andersen was sent off for a professional foul on the Villa striker five minutes later.Issa Diop's 69th-minute own-goal sealed the win, although Villa had Jaden Philogene sent off for two yellow cards in three minutes.Everton clinched their first away win in 16 games in all competitions with a 2-0 victory against Ipswich.Iliman Ndiaye and Michael Keane scored to leave fourth-bottom Ipswich without a win in eight league games.Third-placed Arsenal will go top of the table if they win at Bournemouth in Saturday's final match.On Sunday, Liverpool, currently in pole position, host sixth-placed Chelsea, while champions Manchester City travel to Wolves.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Fans of Bundesliga side Mainz unveiled banners slamming former coach Jurgen Klopp's decision to join Red Bull in Saturday's 2-0 home loss against RB Leipzig. Using a play on words with Klopp's last name, the home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and used a quote from their side's former boss: \"I like people until the point they disappoint me.\" A larger banner, in big red letters, asked Klopp if he had \"forgotten everything we gave you?\".

In October, Klopp announced he would join energy drink company Red Bull, which owns clubs in Leipzig, Salzburg and New York, as their global head of football from January 2025.His decision to take up the job at Red Bull has annoyed supporters in Germany -- particularly at ex-clubs Dortmund and Mainz -- who have a long-standing dislike of RB Leipzig.Some fans believe Leipzig, founded in 2009, are not consistent with Germany's 50+1 rule, which requires member control of clubs, while others have hit out at the multi-club ownership model used by Red Bull.Leipzig's win at Mainz sent the club, who are yet to lose in the league this season, top of the table -- at least until Bayern Munich's match against Stuttgart at home later on Saturday.Leipzig coach Marco Rose, who played under Klopp for several years at Mainz, dismissed the fans' criticism as a minority opinion. \"There are 35,000 people in the stadium, many of whom have an opinion. I believe that around 34,936 people love Kloppo for the fact that he shaped an era here, that we achieved something great together,\" said Rose. \"He was here in Mainz for a long time.\"Everyone has their own life somewhere and the right to decide things freely and for themselves. Not everyone has to love it.\"Rose added that: \"(He) didn't even notice (the banner), so it can't have been that wild.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Victor Boniface's 72nd-minute goal was the difference as Bayer Leverkusen beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 at home, while RB Leipzig won 2-0 at Mainz to go top of the table. Omar Marmoush sent Frankfurt 1-0 up, before Robert Andrich equalised for the champions midway through the first half and Boniface completed the comeback in the second period. Leverkusen were given an early chance when Amine Adli was felled in the box, sending Boniface to the spot after a long VAR review. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The Nigerian's shot, too soft and central, was gobbled up by Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. Just five minutes later, the referee was sent to the video screen again, this time finding a penalty for Frankfurt, with Andrich lightly touching Marmoush's foot. Marmoush showed Boniface how it is done, blasting a low shot left to give the visitors the lead on 16 minutes. The Egyptian now has an incredible nine goals and five assists in just seven league games this season.Andrich made good on his error soon afterwards, combining expertly with Adli and Martin Terrier to flit through the penalty area for a superb one-touch goal in the 25th minute.Boniface would also redeem himself, giving Leverkusen the lead inside the final 20 minutes, heading in a deflected cross from substitute Florian Wirtz to put the hosts on course for victory.Andrich told Sky Germany \"we were focused and played good football -- and there was a nice goal from me.\"The 30-year-old midfielder, who made his Germany debut last season after a career largely spent in the lower divisions, said of his performance: \"I always have fun playing football, but I maybe have to work a bit harder than the rest.\"Days out from their home Champions League clash with Liverpool, Leipzig beat Mainz to go top of the table, at least until Bayern Munich's home match against Stuttgart later on Saturday.At kick-off, the Mainz fans unveiled a series of banners critical of former coach Jurgen Klopp's decision to take over as football boss at Leipzig's parent company Red Bull. The home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and accused Klopp, who coached Mainz to a debut promotion before joining Borussia Dortmund and later Liverpool, of \"forgetting everything we gave you\".Still unbeaten this season in Germany despite two Champions League losses, Leipzig took the lead after 20 minutes thanks to an excellent solo effort from Xavi Simons. Leipzig captain Willi Orban tapped in a rebound from a Lois Openda cross to put his side 2-0 up.Orban told Sky: \"We could have finished things off earlier but we're happy with the win.\"Elsewhere, Freiburg continued their impressive start to the season with a 3-1 home win over Augsburg to go into outright second. Freiburg were three goals up at half-time, with Vincenzo Grifo, Philipp Lienhart and Christian Guenter scoring, before Augsburg's Phillip Tietz pulled one back in the second period.Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Tim Kleindienst scored a double, days after making his Germany debut, in a 3-2 home win over former club Heidenheim.Hoffenheim won their first game since their season opener, with Andrej Kramaric, Marius Buelter and Haris Tabakovic scoring in a 3-1 win over lowly Bochum, who sit last with just one point from seven games.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "NIIMH, Little Known Gem in Hyderabad",
        "text": "Hyderabad: In medical advancement, documentation of medical history and heritage plays a very important role. Unknown to many, Hyderabad houses a national institute that documents the history of Indian medical systems. Hidden away in the lanes of Gaddiannaram, Dilsukhnagar, the National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH), is a rich resource for historians and researchers studying traditional Indian medical systems like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and several components of modern medicine. The institute was formerly known as the National Centre of Indian Medical Heritage.The institute came into existence as the upgraded Department of History of Medicine in 1956 under the government of Andhra Pradesh and was handed over to the government of India in 1969. It was earlier housed on the third floor of Osmania Medical College and shifted to its present premises in 2009. Currently functioning under the administrative control of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), ministry of AYUSH, the government of India, it houses a medical history library with over 10,000 books, including rare publications dating back to the 15th century. Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) designated NIIMH as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Fundamental and Literary Research in Traditional Medicine. Shedding light on the rich medical history of Telangana, director of the institute G. P. Prasad said, \"One of the earliest inscriptions, dating back to 400 AD, was found in Phanigiri, Mulugu. It mentions Agrabhisaja, a chief physician, who served under King Devasena. This inscription highlights the reverence for medical practitioners, who were even allowed to erect Dharmachakras (sacred pillars) as a symbol of their importance in society.\" \"Another key piece of medical history is the Sirur inscription from 1,100 AD in Medak. It references Aggalayya, a Jain scholar, Ayurvedic physician and surgeon. Known for his surgical expertise, Aggalayya taught the art of surgery to students from across India and served under four different dynasties. His contributions earned him the title of 'Samanta Raja', a subordinate king, underscoring his stature in society,\" Dr Prasad highlighted. In Yaragudi (currently in Andhra Pradesh), Ashoka inscriptions mention the establishment of both veterinary and human hospitals, along with the importation of medicinal plants from surrounding regions. During the era of the Nizams, we see the rise of Unani medicine alongside Ayurveda. The Nizams supported the development of Unani, and the region became a hub for both systems of medicine. \"Today, more than 200 medical inscriptions have been collected by our institution,\" Dr Prasad informed. Furthermore, the records from Tirumukkuddal in Tamil Nadu even detail the establishment of a 15-bed inpatient department with designated surgeons, physicians, and staff, providing a clear picture of early hospital management, the director explained. Housing two museums dedicated to medical history, the NIIMH showcases some original and thematic art and artifacts. The certificates of the first woman anaestheologist, Lady Rupa Bai Furdoonji; the first batch of students of Hyderabad Medical School; some paintings showing Edward Lawrie's Chloroform Commissions; replicas of surgical instruments mentioned in Susruta Samhita, the first surgeon of India, are some of the exhibits dedicated to Hyderabad. Through initiatives like the AYUSH Manuscripts Advanced Repository (AMAR) portal, the NIIMH has cataloged an impressive 16,000 AYUSH manuscripts, with 4,249 digitised. The Institute\u2019s digital endeavours also include the Showcase of Ayurvedic Historical Imprints (SAHI) portal, which features nearly 800 medico-historical artifacts and the e-books of the AYUSH project, offering digital versions of classical textbooks. The Journal of Indian Medical Heritage run by the NIIMH has published writings that mention how Ayurveda dawned during the reign of Nizams, some manuscripts from the Qutub Shahi period, a history of Anaesthesia and Hyderabad Chloroform Commission, list of Arabic, Persian and Urdu Medical Manuscripts, growth of the hospital system in Hyderabad and many more topics, providing readers with insights into Hyderabad's rich medical heritage.",

This survey, which will run from October 21 to November 21, aims to thoroughly assess the city\u2019s geographical conditions and identify areas most vulnerable to landslides. The initiative comes at the recommendation of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), reflecting growing concern over Shimla\u2019s environmental stability.\n\nTo ensure the smooth operation of the survey, necessary formalities for drone usage in Shimla\u2019s no-fly zones have been completed, and permission has been granted for areas under the army\u2019s control. A consultancy firm has been tasked with carrying out the LIDAR survey and is expected to submit its comprehensive report by November 21.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Anupam Kashyap emphasized the importance of this initiative, noting that the survey\u2019s primary goal is to accurately assess the instability of Shimla\u2019s terrain and prepare for future risks. \u201cThis survey will not only enhance the safety of Shimla\u2019s residents but will also contribute to the city\u2019s infrastructure development,\u201d he added.\n\nHow the Survey Will Work\n\nThe LIDAR technology used in this survey will create a detailed 3D image of Shimla\u2019s geographical features through laser pulses emitted from drones. These pulses reflect off the ground and return to sensors, providing precise data on the depth, height, and surface of the terrain. This information will be critical in identifying areas prone to landslides and will help pinpoint the underlying causes of these dangerous incidents. With this knowledge, the SDMA hopes to implement effective preventive measures to minimize future risks.\n\nLandslides: A Growing Threat in Shimla\n\nShimla has seen a sharp increase in landslides over the past few years, particularly during the monsoon season, when heavy rains destabilize the already fragile terrain. These landslides have led to widespread destruction, including blocked roads, damaged homes, and the displacement of numerous families. Experts attribute the worsening situation to unchecked construction on the hills and environmental imbalances, further straining the city\u2019s stability.\n\nThe implementation of drone-based LIDAR technology is expected to be a game-changer in tackling Shimla\u2019s landslide crisis. By enabling a more accurate understanding of the city\u2019s topography and vulnerabilities, authorities will be better equipped to devise sustainable solutions to mitigate the impact of landslides. With the increasing threat of climate change and urban expansion, such advanced technological interventions are becoming essential in ensuring the safety and long-term sustainability of hill cities like Shimla.",

In the 2024 T20 World Cup, he finished as the third-highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets and was named Player of the Tournament for title-winning Team India.

        "text": "Mumbai City FC grabbed their first victory of the Indian Super League 2024-25 season with a 2-1 win in a closely-fought encounter against FC Goa at the Fatorda Stadium on Saturday. \n\nThe Islanders extended their unbeaten streak to 13 games against the Gaurs to reaffirm their upper hand in the recent history of the fixture. Two strikes in the first half from Nikalos Karelis and Yoell van Niff were sufficient for the Islanders with Armando Sadiku spot-kick ending up as a consolation goal for the home side.\n\nMidfielder Van Nieff was the best player on the pitch as he repeatedly penetrated the hosts\u2019 well-organised defence with his range of passing. Hmingthanmawia Ralte, commonly known as Valpuia, was an energetic presence for Mumbai City FC and it was he who earned a free-kick for them from the right flank in the 21st minute that led to the Karelis' opener.\n\nVan Nieff stepped up on the set-piece and delivered a perfectly dipping curled ball inside the box that met an onrushing Nikolaos Karelis at the centre of the 18-yard area. Karelis thundered the ball into the back of the net through his head, getting the Islanders an important lead in the contest. \n\nSeven minutes later, former Mumbai City FC midfielder Rowllin Borges came close to helping Sadiku secure the equaliser for FC Goa. Now with the Gaurs, Borges squared up a pass to Sadiku from the right flank, and the striker twice attempted to score but to no avail.\n\nVan Nieff ensured to capitalise on a moment in the 40th minute, driving an attack forward with his sheer pace and trickery on the ball. He dazzled ahead from the middle, but instead of taking the passing route, the 31-year-old opted to test his fortunes from distance. The ball landed into the bottom left corner and helped Mumbai City FC head into the half-time break with a comfortable two-goal lead.\n\nIn the second half, Valpuia committed a foul on Sadiku inside the 18-yard box in the 54th minute. He was shown a yellow card for the same and Sadiku made sure that he didn\u2019t fluff this time, hammering the ball into the top right corner a minute later to give FC Goa a sneak back into the proceedings. \n\nMumbai City FC held their nerves impressively thereafter though, as FC Goa could not turn the tides despite coach Manolo Marquez making some inspired substitutions with Dejan Drazic and Nim Dorjee coming on late into the game",

        "text": "Mohun Bagan Super Giant pipped their arch-rivals East Bengal FC by 2-0 in the high-octane Kolkata Derby in the Indian Super League at the Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Saturday.\n\nMohun Bagan Super Giant controlled the tempo of the match from start to finish, as a goal each from Jamie Maclaren and Dimitrios Petratos in either half was enough for Jose Molina\u2019s men to secure their eighth win against the Red & Gold Brigade in ISL.\n\nThe players took their time to settle into the electrifying atmosphere of 60,000 odd fans buzzing at the stadium. It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. \n\nHowever, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.\n\nDespite the frustration, the Mariners maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.\n\nTheir relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.\n\nThe second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.\n\nLooking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.\n\nThe 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.",

France striker Mbappe started and sent the Spanish champions ahead amid reports he is being investigated for an alleged rape during a visit to Sweden. The 25-year-old was criticised in his homeland for not appearing in his country's recent Nations League matches before the Swedish media reports emerged following his trip during the international break, which Mbappe labelled \"fake news\".\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Williot Swedberg levelled for Celta, who might have snatched a draw, but Vinicius tucked home what proved Madrid's winner after 66 minutes.Madrid, unbeaten in 42 La Liga matches, host Barcelona next weekend in the Clasico, after the Catalans welcome Sevilla on Sunday.\"I'm happy because we won after the international break which is not always easy,\" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told Real Madrid TV.\"When they equalised our changes gave new energy to the team and it was a very important win.\"(Mbappe and Vinicius) trained very well in the break, improved their conditions, and they started today's game very well and they have to continue.\"With captain Dani Carvajal sidelined for months to come, Ancelotti replaced the Spanish right-back with Lucas Vazquez.The Italian set up with a three centre-back system, breaking away from his favoured four-man defensive line to accomodate Vazquez as a wing-back.Celta Vigo midfielder Swedberg missed a fine opening in the first half with Thibaut Courtois tipping his effort wide when the Swede ran through on goal.Madrid's new look defence gave Celta plenty of breathing room in attack but the visitors also looked dangerous at the other end, without carving out clear-cut chances.Mbappe slammed Madrid ahead with a long-range effort, which flew into the top corner after Fran Beltran gave the ball away and Eduardo Camavinga laid it off to the striker.It was the forward's first strike from outside the area for Madrid, his sixth league goal and his eighth in 12 appearances across all competitions since joining from Paris Saint-Germain this summer.Celta striker Borja Iglesias rolled home from an offside position as Claudio Giraldez's mid-table side searched for an equaliser.It was a scrappy yet lively clash and Vinicius headed over Fede Valverde's cross and fired a near post effort off-target before the break.Swedberg pulled Celta level with a calm finish in the 51st minute after a fine move from the Galicians, with former Barcelona defender Oscar Mingueza curling in a low cross for the midfielder to stroke home.Vinicius had a goal ruled out for offside against Mbappe in the build-up as the second half continued with the same openness as the first.'A top professional'Javier Manquillo made a brave block to deny Mbappe before Ancelotti sent on veteran midfielder Luka Modric to try and regain control of the match.The 39-year-old Croatian, who became Real Madrid's oldest ever player ahead of 1950s and 1960s Hungarian great Ferenc Puskas, made an instant impact.Less than three minutes after coming on, Modric produced a superb low pass to play in Vinicius, who slid Madrid in front past Vicente Guaita.\"It's a pleasure to coach Modric, to work with him, everything he's been able to achieve and is achieving, he deserves -- he's a top professional and a great guy,\" said Ancelotti.Courtois thwarted Jonathan Bamba after the midfielder darted in behind Antonio Rudiger and tried to prod home.Celta substitute Anastasios Douvikas should have levelled in stoppage time but rolled wide with just Courtois to beat.\"It's bittersweet because we went toe-to-toe with Real Madrid and we were better for much of the game, but we're left with the feeling once more that for our mistakes we let in two goals,\" said Celta midfielder Beltran.\"It would be easy to say 'this is Real Madrid', but (our) team was better... we lost three points, but I think we played a very good game.\"Earlier, Athletic Bilbao moved provisionally fourth by thumping Espanyol 4-1.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Honestly, I don\u2019t think words can describe how much it would mean to us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re playing for everyone\u2013our families, friends, and all those back home gathering in different places to watch and support us. It would be such a special moment. Hopefully, we can make it happen on Sunday,\u201d she added.Suzie Bates also reflected on the significance of winning, saying, \u201cTo be honest, ever since 2009, as a cricketer, when you play team sports, your ultimate goal is to be a world champion. I think all those tournaments have motivated me, and I know they\u2019ve motivated Sophie as well. Some of the younger girls, fortunately or unfortunately, don\u2019t have that same extra motivation.\u201d\u201cBut yes, it feels like everything has built up to this moment, and we get one more opportunity tomorrow to have a good game. The most overwhelming thing is that it\u2019s felt like a really long journey to get back to this point,\u201d Bates added.Squads:South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe TryonNew Zealand: Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.

        "title": "The storm that wasn\u2019t: how Chennai fared",
        "text": "When this year\u2019s first rain spell of northeast monsoon arrived with a downpour a few days ago, scenes of inundation from previous years were indeed repeated. But many areas of the city recovered within a day, partly because of the concerted efforts and immediate preparation of Tamil Nadu government agencies to face extreme situations and weather warning, and also because the rain stopped earlier than expected.\n\nAlso Read: In Pictures | Aftermath of Tamil Nadu rains\n\nSeeking lessons from last year\u2019s Cyclone Michaung that spelled disaster, the government had prepared for disaster management and planned for flood-relief and rescue operations. About 300 flood-relief centres were opened and food was distributed through 98 community kitchens. The field reviews by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, Ministers and officials helped accelerate flood-management work in different parts of the city.\n\nAlso Read: How Cyclone Michaung formed, intensified, rained, and dissipated | Explained\n\nSanitation workers and Greater Chennai Corporation workers persevered round the clock, bailing out stagnant water with heavy-duty pumps and clearing garbage and sewage. The appointment of nodal officers to coordinate among agencies helped to monitor the work.\n\nAlert downgraded\n\nAlthough Chennai recorded an average rainfall of 13 cm-14 cm on October 15, parts of the city and those on the fringes received more than 20 cm. Cholavaram, with the heaviest rainfall of 30 cm, Red Hills with 28 cm, and Avadi with 25 cm, bore the brunt. In contrast to the extreme weather event predicted for over two days when the Regional Meteorological Centre issued a red alert, rainfall ceased on October 16 as the depression changed its trajectory and weakened. S. Balachandran, Additional Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said, \u201cThere is no perfect forecasting system, and not all systems are fully understood. Each depression behaves differently due to thermodynamical conditions. When the system was in the ocean, there was a risk involved; which is why, we issued the alert. It was to caution people not to panic. Understanding weather systems is a continuous process.\u201d\n\nWeather experts suggested that extension agents be trained in assisting disaster management agencies in translating forecasts into alerts. Raghu Murtugudde, professor at IIT Bombay, said, \u201cThe extension agents will be experts in communicating the alerts in regional languages and guiding people to appropriate actions. There are some systematic biases in extreme rainfall predictions since the tropical systems explode rapidly and are hard to predict.\u201d\n\nThe Chennai Corporation estimated that about 540 localities reported waterlogging, including TNHB Colony at Korattur, Venus Colony at Alwarpet, and G.K.M. Colony at Kolathur. Korattur and Red Hills were among the worst-affected places, where localities were marooned well after the rainfall abated. People had to be rescued in boats at Korattur and drones were deployed to deliver relief materials to residents of Kumaran Colony at Red Hills. Water receded quickly in many inundated areas of south Chennai by the morning of October 16. Geeta Padmanabhan of Thiruvanmiyur said that while a few avenues escaped as drains were desilted, residents had to endure water stagnation for two days in areas like Kamaraj Nagar as the storm-water drain was not desilted.\n\nIn areas around Old Mahabalipuram Road, which get engulfed in water every monsoon, residents like Raj Natarajan of Semmencheri expressed concerns over recurrence of waterlogging in some areas unless Okkiyum Maduvu and the marsh opposite the ELCOT SEZ are cleaned. But it was also true that areas prone to flooding showed visible changes following interventions. The interventions and infrastructure improvements since last year did bring about a change in areas including parts of Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Tansi Nagar, S.V.S. Nagar at Valasaravakkam, Porur junction, Poonamallee High Road near St. Andrew\u2019s Church, and Narayanapuram.\n\nAlso Read: Chennai Rains: Volunteers for the season\n\nExtensive desilting of storm-water drains and construction of a new drain network to a distance of 785 km, out of the planned 1,135 km across the city, have made the difference this time, say Corporation officials. The reconstruction of the Thanikachalam Nagar drain, which was in a shambles for years, seems to have resolved the recurrent issues of flooding at Kolathur and Madhavaram. The storm-water drain built by the Highways Department helped 12 stagnation points on the East Coast Road.\n\nHiccups persist\n\nHowever, there were hiccups in terms of the tardy implementation of the storm-water drain and flood-mitigation projects, missing and incomplete links in the drains, and lack of connectivity between the drains and the water channels. A delay in getting approval from the Highways Department held up the construction of a channel linking the Narayanapuram lake to the Pallikaranai marsh through the 200-Feet Radial Road. The Chennai Corporation has identified nearly 50 locations, including Vembuliamman Koil Street at K.K.Nagar, for gaps in the drain network.\n\nThe Metro Rail construction poses a major challenge this monsoon. It has aggravated the waterlogging in south Chennai where residents say the drains get clogged by debris. Nearly 22 locations in the vicinity of the Metro Rail construction sites in various zones were flooded. For instance, the Corporation installed 19 pumps to bail out water from Millers Road and Purasawalkam High Road, but water drained only after a few days. \u201cWorkers dump debris clogging the drains. They are unaware of the consequences. Excavation at the construction site takes away road space and obstructs the natural flow of water,\u201d says a source at Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). The situation remains grim in some localities of north Chennai that stare at imminent waterlogging owing to incomplete civic projects. Pulianthope, Pattalam, Perambur, Choolai, and Vyasarpadi, which have faced inundation for years, remained flooded even after the rain stopped on October 16.\n\nDevelopment projects executed at Madipakkam, another flood-prone area, had open ends, making the locality vulnerable to inundation. Kuberan Nagar Extension, Ram Nagar South Extension, LIC Nagar, and Govindasamy Nagar were affected, owing to incomplete road projects and storm-water drains and the absence of link to waterways. P. Saravana Kumar, founder of Madipakkam Social Service Trust, points out that rain in the days to come would determine the impact of the storm-water drain. The surplus water channel from the Keelkattalai lake needs to be improved to end flooding at Madipakkam.\n\nHowever, Corporation officials say that compared with last year, water stagnation has come down at Madipakkam after the storm-water drain was built and roads were restored. A few streets suffered from minor issues. Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Works) V. Sivakrishnamurthy says the work to prevent inundation near the Ganesapuram subway in north Chennai will be completed in a few weeks as Southern Railway has agreed to permit line block to build a culvert beneath the tracks.\n\nIn neighbouring Tiruvallur district, which was battered by massive rain, officials of the rank of Deputy Collector supervised the work in taluks and ensured better coordination. \u201cWe have no control over water release as the Araniyar and Kosasthalaiyar originate in Andhra Pradesh. This time, we got live updates from Andhra Pradesh through our engineers,\u201d says Collector T. Prabhushankar.\n\nThe space for buffer storage in major reservoirs saved the city from riverine flooding this time and the rivers\u2019 capacity has been improved by 30%. The projects implemented by the Water Resources Department (WRD) to improve major waterways and surplus courses and the controlled water release from the lakes instilled confidence in officials of managing a rainfall of up to 30 cm-40 cm. The department implemented additional projects costing Rs. 2.30 crore to desilt the major waterways. However, Virugambakkam and Anna Nagar residents point to the insufficient carrying capacity of canals, including Virugambakkam-Arumbakkam canal and Otteri Nullah, and lack of desilting. They flag the risk of floodwater spillover and malfunctioning of the drain network during the rain.\n\nPermanent solution?\n\nThe government had been preparing for three months to tackle the monsoon, said Mr. Stalin. He also said a permanent solution to water stagnation would be found soon. The pending projects, based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee for Mitigation and Management of Flood Risk in the Chennai Metropolitan Area, led by former IAS official V. Thiruppugazh, would be finished soon.\n\nMayor R. Priya said, \u201cWe shortlisted the issues faced last year, constituency-wise, and started sorting them out since July. We had plans for 35 low-level areas and installed 100-HP motors in flood-prone locations. A coordination committee was formed to address issues of waterlogging where the Metro Rail project is in progress.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are working to remove the floating garbage from the canals and clean the silt catch pits. We are planning to resolve issues in areas where we have faced problems so far this year.\u201d\n\nTwo government agencies that managed to function almost seamlessly were Chennai Metrowater and Tangedco. Power shutdown was averted except at a few places like west Velachery and T. Nagar where water stagnation on roads and leakage of underground cables resulted in the outages. The sewers carried nearly 953 million litres of sewage on October 15, as against the daily load of 650 million litres. Additional sewer equipment, replacement of sewers in vulnerable locations, and monitoring of leaks through the GIS command centre helped the water agency.\n\nSources in the WRD note that unless the 29 macro drains, including Otteri Nullah, Veerangal Odai, and Captain Cotton Canal, are made free of encroachments and desilted, the scope of flood control will be limited. A wholistic, long-term flood management plan for the entire Chennai Metropolitan Area, instead of Chennai in isolation, would make the city flood-proof. The government must frame a policy to freeze development near waterbodies and waterways.\n\nExperts say the city is not fully prepared for flood management and mitigation. Chennai is largely involved in firefighting rather than finding comprehensive solutions for urban flood resilience. S. Thirunavukkarasu, former Public Works Department official who specialises in hydraulics and hydrology, says, \u201cWhat we are doing now, including construction of storm-water drains, is crisis management. We need to find the root cause of flooding in each watercourse. A comprehensive policy for restoration of waterbodies, with stringent strategies to increase storage to match their annual run-off, and re-establishing the missing links is needed.\u201d Deepening waterbodies would be one of the strategies to shield Chennai from floods and droughts, he adds.\n\n(With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez, Sunitha Sekar, R.

        "summary": "The first \u2018storm\u2019 this monsoon season, for a variety of reasons, did not drown the city as it was feared. The primary reason was that the actual forecast was off the mark, the low pressurein the Bay of Bengal did two things \u2014 it veered off course and lost power, stopping short of the pounding rain forecast. Further, work in terms of building storm-water networks within the city, the constant presence of Ministers and officials overseeing relief work on the ground, and the partnership with a vast network of civic volunteers, all influenced the outcome positively. However, some areas still struggled with water stagnation for a couple of days at least even after the rain ceased. K. Lakshmi finds out more.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has consistently expressed his deep love for Test cricket, which he views as the pinnacle of the sport. Throughout his career, Kohli has often spoken about the unique challenges that the longest format of the game presents, emphasizing that it tests a player's character, mental strength, and skill across different conditions. What adds to Kohli's superstar aura is his energetic and passionate interaction with crowds during matches. One of his signature gestures on the field is when he turns toward the stands and pumps up the crowd, urging them to cheer louder. This act of rallying the crowd is typical of Kohli's aggressive and enthusiastic approach to the game, whether he's batting, fielding, or captaining. It shows his deep connection with fans and his ability to channel the energy of the crowd into his own performance and that of the team.And when that crowd belongs to his IPL team RCB, then they will surely respond to Virat's calls.With India needing quick wickets in a bid to defend a low score of 107 against New Zealand on Day 5, Virat, standing in the slips urged the crowd to make some more noise.A clip of the moment was shared by the official broadcaster:\u2014 JioCinema (@JioCinema) Kohli often makes this gesture during pivotal moments in matches, especially in high-pressure situations. Whether it's urging support during a crucial partnership, celebrating a key wicket, or raising the energy during tense periods, Kohli's ability to involve the fans plays a significant role in creating an intense atmosphere. His charisma and emotional expressions on the field not only lift the morale of the team but also amplify the excitement in the stadium.This crowd interaction is one of the many reasons Kohli has such a strong bond with Indian cricket fans, who see him as not just a player but a passionate leader who thrives on the collective energy of the team and the spectators.",

        "title": "India's Sensational 36-Year Streak Ends With Massive Loss vs New Zealand",
        "text": "New Zealand survived a hostile Jasprit Bumrah spell to foil India's attempt to add a final-day twist to an absorbing series-opener, slaying the cricketing giants at home by eight wickets and ending a 36-year long wait to taste Test success in the country, here Sunday This is Kiwis' first Test win on the Indian soil after the John Wright-led outfit towelled India by 136 runs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, way back in 1988. Even hunting a modest 107 on the fifth day against a world-class attack could be nervy, and New Zealand did that after some initial scares. Will Young (48 not out) and Rachin Ravindra (39 not out) fuelled their chase with a 75-run stand for the third wicket, handholding their side a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");However, the Indians will not be an entirely despondent lot despite the defeat as they showed admirable spunk to claw back from the depths of getting bowled out for 46 in the first innings.They will need to build on it and pretty quickly too as the second Test at Pune starts on October 24.The Rohit Sharma-marshalled side will also have to think deeply about retaining Sarfaraz Khan, who made a 150 in the second dig, as Shubman Gill is poised to return after recovering from a stiff neck.The other point they will moot long is whether to go back to the three-pacer strategy or continue three spinners, a move which backfired here spectacularly, in Pune.New Zealand victory did not come without its share of drama once the day's play started at 10.15am, a wet outfield pushing back the proceedings by an hour.Bumrah (2/29), operating from the dressing room end, found appreciable movement and Tom Latham fell in the first over of the day itself for his overnight naught.Latham was behind the ball to cover the in-dipper but it swung back further to thud on to his pads as umpire Michael Gough raised his finger after vociferous appeal from the bowler and the crowd.The New Zealand captain reviewed the decision more in hope than in conviction and the DRS confirmed his worst fears as well, and he had to walk back.India might just have felt the absence of a third pacer as both Bumrah and Siraj found movement and carry to trouble the Kiwi batters under a largely overcast skies.Kuldeep Yadav, who gave away 26 runs in three overs, had replaced Akash Deep in the eleven for this Test after India went with a three-pronged pace attack against Bangladesh recently.Devon Conway, the other overnight batter, was shaky throughout his stay and would consider himself fortunate to have found a last-minute edge on a Bumrah skidder that otherwise would have trapped him plumb in front.But as luck would have it, the ball beat the gully fielder and raced to the fence.However, the left-hander eventually reached the road's end when Bumrah, operating from around the stumps, caught him right in front of the wicket with another one that skidded and swung back into him.The on-field umpire did not relent but the DRS upheld India's appeal to send Conway (17) back.New Zealand were 35 for two at that point, and one would say the match in balance as a couple of more strikes could have left the cat among the pigeons.But Young and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, found some solidity to resist the Indian charge.Once the sun came out for a while, the ball-movement was much more predictable and the Kiwi batters used favourable conditions to rack in a few boundaries to ease the pressure.Ravindra Jadeja, who started with a no-ball, too did not make much of an impression, conceding 14 runs in his first two overs.There was not much on the Chinnaswamy pitch for him to exploit either as the 22-yard track did not disintegrate on the final day, courtesy rain and cooler climes here.With the margin getting reduced alongside each run, the New Zealand batters became more daring and brought out their shots from the shelf, such as a clean hoist over mid-wicket for a six off left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep.The defining moment came when Will Young turned Jadeja for two to collect the winning runs as Kiwis dressing room turned into a hub of celebration.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Under overcast skies, the ball seamed around appreciably, Jasprit Bumrah threatened to pick a wicket every second delivery, and the crowd appealed almost every ball, but New Zealand absorbed it all to ease their way to the target of 107 once things settled down a touch.Will Young was the calming influence after Bumrah got Tom Latham second ball of the day, but Devon Conway did his bit - jumping around, wearing blows on the body, but not playing loose shots. By the time Bumrah finally got Conway for 17 off 39 balls, he was at the fag end of his spell and New Zealand had got 35 on the board already. The fielders did their bit, having saved at least 11 runs by then.Thereupon, though, India's misreading of the pitch came back to hurt them. They didn't have a third seamer to use the conditions, and Young and Rachin Ravindra knocked off the remaining runs with relative ease.While Bumrah bowled, though, you struggled to see where the next run would come from. He drew 22 false shots in eight overs, consistently drawing movement off the surface. Latham might have thought he had the accurate inswinger covered, but the ball pitched and nipped in even further to get him. Conway thought he had the angle covered from around the wicket, but this one swung after pitching, beginning to change its path halfway between pitching and reaching Conway, beating the outside edge and trapping him in front.Bumrah was in his seventh over now, and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, all but sealed the deal when he got two boundaries off the first three balls he faced. He steered the first one behind square, and then got the rare loose ball from Bumrah - a full one on the pads.Young then paddled and punched Ravindra Jadeja for boundaries in his first over to get the package ready. Not trusting the Bengaluru weather to hold up after lunch, the two batters attacked the spinners to put a nice little bow on the top. Young's drop-kicked six off Kuldeep Yadav was even Mark Waugh-like.India made a remarkable comeback from being bowled out for 46 in the first innings, but in the end, New Zealand hung in long enough to seal only their third Test win in India.\r\n\r\nSource link",

On day two of the game, after the opening day was washed out due to rain, India were shot out for 46 -- their third-lowest Test score overall and the fewest they ever posted in a Test match at home. Under overcast skies, India were undone by grand exhibition of seam bowling from Matt Henry (5/15) and Will O'Rourke (4/22), which eventually played a big part in them losing the match.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"I said it at the press conference after day 2, we knew it'd be a challenge, with overcast conditions and tricky pitch. We didn't think we'll be 46 all out but due credit to NZ. It set us back and games like this will happen.\"Gotta take the good things forward. We've been here before, conceding home losses; these things happen. Two Tests to go, we know what it takes and will give it all in the next two Tests,\" said Rohit after the match.Though India made 426 in the second innings, thanks to a counter-attacking 177-run stand for the fourth wicket between Sarfaraz Khan (150) and Rishabh Pant (99), Rohit remarked he was proud of how the two young batters played.\"It was a good effort in the second innings with the bat. We knew what lies ahead, get as many as possible. A couple of guys stood out, was great to watch. When you're 350 behind, you can't think too much. Just have to try and bat the ball and see where the game goes. Was exciting to watch partnerships get us into the game.\"We could've easily been bowled under 350, it's something we're proud of. Everyone's on the edge of their seats when Pant and Sarfaraz bat. Pant's was a mature innings; he's done it for a while, and he played his shots too. Sarfaraz was very clear and mature in just his third or fourth Test.\"India, now 1-0 behind in the three-match series, will now travel to Pune to play the second Test against New Zealand from October 24-28, followed by the third and final game of the series at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai from November 1-5.",

Both teams have surpassed expectations, displaying resilience, skill, and determination throughout the tournament.Bates, Devine, and Tahuhu collectively boast an impressive 402 Women\u2019s T20I appearances between them.Moments after New Zealand\u2019s stunning win over West Indies in the semi-finals of the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024, there was a heartwarming moment as three of New Zealand\u2019s most experienced players embraced and posed for the cameras.\u201cWe are the grandmas of the team,\u201d Bates remarked a day ahead of the final, referring to herself, Sophie Devine, and Lea Tahuhu, as quoted by the ICC.\u201cWe are still standing, I think. Lea with her bionic knee, Sophie having dealt with a lot as captain over the past few years, and me just keeping on going.\u201d\u201cIt was a really special moment, knowing we\u2019ve been through some tough times. The three of us, in particular, have experienced the ups and downs. To have that moment, realising we had made the semi-finals and given ourselves a chance, was really special. We old girls look after each other and try to keep up with the younger players,\u201d she added.Bates and Tahuhu played pivotal roles in the semi-final win. Bates delivered the final over, with 14 runs to defend, after contributing a crucial knock at the top of the order, while Tahuhu claimed the vital wicket of Hayley Matthews when the match was on a knife-edge.Devine, as captain, has been outstanding and will step down from the role after the tournament, hoping to sign off on Sunday with the trophy in hand.\u201cI think she has been absolutely brilliant in her captaincy,\u201d Bates said.\u201cShe\u2019s been so calm. The decisions she has made in these conditions have been excellent. It\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s stepping down, but thankfully it\u2019s just as captain,\u201d she added.A title win would not only be a fantastic way for the trio to cap off a successful tournament, but it would also send an inspiring message to women in their 30s, says Bates, who is set to become the most-capped player in women\u2019s international cricket.\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m over 35 and still competing, and that I\u2019ve never given up on my dream, I think, sends a message. As women, there\u2019s often societal pressure to give up on pursuing your dreams,\u201d Bates said.\u201cPeople expect you to do other things at a certain age, and that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about women\u2019s sport\u2013it\u2019s growing every day, breaking down barriers. It\u2019s not just young players; we have players in our team returning after having children,\u201d she concluded.Sunday\u2019s final is scheduled for 18:00 local time at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

        "text": "Fort Lauderdale: Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will feature in next year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced on Saturday. Messi and his team-mates will kick-off the tournament in the opening game at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, on Sunday, June 15, Infantino added. The FIFA president was speaking on the field at Inter's Chase Stadium moments after Messi scored a hat-trick as the team broke the MLS regular season points record with a 6-2 win over the New England Revolution. Miami, who this month won Major League Soccer's Supporters' Shield for the best regular season record, will take the qualification slot designated for the host nation. \"Inter Miami qualifies as the host country representative team on the basis of the club's outstanding and consistent 34-match campaign that saw them secure the shield with two MLS matches to play,\" FIFA said in a statement. The official champions of MLS are determined by the MLS Cup playoffs which begin next week and conclude with the final on December 7. Miami are the favourites to win the playoffs but the FIFA decision to select the regular season winners ensures the involvement of the Argentine superstar. The participation of the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi is a much-needed boost to the profile of the new-look tournament, which FIFA hope will capture the imagination of the global television audience as well as fans in the United States ahead of the World Cup in 2026. The competition could pit Messi against top European club opposition for the first time since he left Paris Saint Germain last year to move to Miami. The 32-team tournament will feature title winning teams from each of FIFA's continental confederations. Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich are among the 12 European teams who have qualified for the tournament while Argentina's River Plate and Boca Juniors and Brazil's Flamengo are among six South American teams. FIFA has yet to announce any broadcast deals or sponsorship contracts for the tournament and the competition has faced some opposition within the game. Players union FIFpro and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar. Opponents of the new tournament have said it adds further congestion to an already crowded schedule and increases the workload of players. The last version of the Club World Cup featured seven teams in a knockout format and was won by Manchester City who beat Brazil's Fluminense in the final in Saudi Arabia. FIFA plan to hold the expanded tournament every four years although no host as yet to be chosen for the 2029 edition.",

With Steve Smith returning to number four after a mixed outing as an opener and all-rounder Cameron Green ruled out of the Test summer due to back issues for which he has opted to undergo a surgery, Australia could see a new opening partner for Usman Khawaja, be it Head or all-rounder Mitchell Marsh from within the team or anyone from trio of Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw, who have been scoring well in domestic cricket. Speaking as quoted by cricket.com.au Head said, \u201cI think it is going to be an old-fashioned bat-off (the BGT series) and I am looking forward to seeing what everyone thinks over the next couple of weeks. From my side of things, I have got no favourite position. I have only got a position that is best for the team and what the team needs from me. I could not care less if I bat (anywhere) from one to seven, if I bat at nine, I do not care. I have said that in the past, I just want to play in the Australian cricket team and any position in the Australian cricket team you take.\u201dHead is one of the contenders to take the opening spot due to the success he has witnessed as one in white-ball cricket. His opening contributions in Tests have been decent, making 223 runs in five Tests and five innings with a fifty to his name. With Head set to miss the upcoming ODI series of three matches against Pakistan starting from November 4 due to paternity leave, Head said that he will make his decisions around his family more and it is his teammates and family who drive him to play. \u201cI am not really interested in the individual stuff or where my career might go to, aspirations from an individual perspective.

Over 200 practising gynaecologists, radiologists, pathologists, postgraduates in obstetrics and gynaecology, and trainees in gynaecological ultrasound attended the symposium from across India.Ultrasound plays a critical role in identifying and managing a wide range of conditions, including gynaecological cancers. By using high-resolution imaging, doctors can accurately detect abnormalities in the reproductive system, such as ovarian cysts or growths in the uterus, which may indicate early signs of cancer. This early detection is crucial because it allows for timely intervention, significantly improving patient outcomes.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mala Sibal said, \u201cUltrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice in gynaecology, including detecting gynaecological cancers. Despite advances in ultrasound technology, emerging literature in the field, and the tremendous impact of accurate and early diagnosis on appropriate medical management, quality ultrasound services are still scarce in many parts of the world. There is significant potential for its expanded use in improving women's healthcare both nationally and globally\u2014 a goal that can be achieved through dedicated teaching, training, and knowledge sharing, which was the key objectives of today\u2019s symposium.\u201dThe symposium highlighted the importance of using ultrasound to differentiate between benign and malignant growths. Specialists discussed how specific markers, visible on ultrasounds, can indicate whether a mass is likely to be cancerous. This level of detail helps doctors make faster, more accurate diagnoses, reducing the need for more invasive procedures.",

Khvicha Kvaratskhelia struck the only goal of the game, and his fourth of the season, from the penalty spot in the 63rd minute to give Napoli their fourth straight win in all competitions.

We just need to keep doing what we're doing.\"We're trying to build something here, something that isn't just a flash in the pan but lasts long-term.\"Empoli beat Napoli home and away last season and their victory in Naples last November cost Rudi Garcia his job as coach, as a disastrous league title defence ended with southern Italy's biggest club in 10th.And the hosts were the better team for large portions of the match, with Kvaratskhelia's winning spot-kick Napoli's only shot on target in front of thousands of enthusiastic travelling supporters.\"I don't know if it's our history here but I wasn't happy with how we played in the first half. If they had scored we couldn't have said anything,\" said Conte.Napoli don't have European football as a result of their collapse following a first Scudetto since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona.And under Conte they have quickly re-established themselves as title challengers, with the advantage of not having the expanded Champions League jamming up their schedule.Kvaratskhelia is key to Conte's plans but the Georgia winger is yet to sign a contract extension, with his current deal expiring in 2027.Italian media report that Kvaratskhelia is aiming for eight million euros ($8.7 million) a season, significantly more than Napoli are willing to offer the breakout star of their historic 2023 title triumph.",

It is apparently a tradition to do a photo ceremony on a newly-weds\u2019 first Karwa Chauth.Karwa Chauth is a Hindu festival celebrated largely by Hindu women coming from the northern and western parts of India. Most women observe a fast without consuming any food and water and the fast is mainly done to seek divine blessings for their husband\u2019s long life and prosperity.However, while the tradition initially involved just women fasting, praying for the long life of their husbands, now even the husbands fast for their wives. A newly-wed couple said, \u201cMy husband has been fasting because he believes both of us should be blessed with good health and long life. Also because he has grown up seeing his mother wait for hours together for the moon to come to break her fast, he feels fasting together will decrease the burden a bit.\u201dA 45-year-old woman put a completely different view forward. She said, \u201cAfter a certain age, ensuring that one has to do a fast despite not being in a position to, is not possible. The way out is to distribute a hamper to a few women, consisting of some sweets and some gifts. That would make one be on the safer end.\u201d",

        "text": "Following New Zealand\u2019s historic eight-wicket win in the first Test match against India in Bengaluru, Kiwi skipper Tom Latham heaped praise on youngster Rachin Ravindra for his ability to calm the dressing room. During New Zealand\u2019s first inning, Ravindra displayed a stupendous performance. The 24-year-old played a 134-run knock from 157 balls at a strike rate of 85.35. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Latham hailed Ravindra for making a 137-run partnership with a number 9 batter Tim Southee. \u201cThe way he [Ravindra] played the situation of the game was really important for us. A 137-run partnership with a No. 9 batter is awesome. I think the way he played leading up to that [second] new ball was really important. Even this morning, the way he came out with the game in the balance where another couple of wickets there and it could have been a nervy 50-60 runs, but I think the way he calmed the dressing room with his composure out there for a young guy in his ninth or tenth Test to play in that fashion is obviously exciting,\u201d Latham was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying. The Kiwi skipper also praised pacer William O\u2019Rourke for his \u201coutstanding\u201d bowling in the Bengaluru Test.\u201cWe\u2019re blessed with a couple of guys on our side, a couple of young guys that have stepped up in this match. I think the way Will [O\u2019Rourke] bowled was outstanding, but I think I also look at the other two seamers, Tim Southee and Matt Henry, the pressure they were able to apply with that new ball on day one was outstanding. Matt got the rewards and Will got the rewards in that first innings,\u201d he added.He added that the victory over India in Bengaluru was a proud moment for the Kiwi side and they will celebrate it.\u201cIt was a combination of everything. [It is] a really special feeling to be in this position. I think the work we did in the first and second innings with the ball and then obviously with the bat, really set the game up for us. It\u2019s obviously a proud moment for this group and the one we will celebrate,\u201d he further added.Chasing a total of 107 runs, Jasprit Bumrah (2/29) showed some fight for India, but Will Young (48*) and Rachin (39*) helped the Kiwis complete a comprehensive win. Earlier, India had taken a 106-run lead in the second innings, scoring 462/10 in response to New Zealand\u2019s total of 402/10 in the first innings. Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (35 from 52 balls, with six fours) and skipper Rohit Sharma (52 from 63 balls, with eight fours and a six) gave India a solid start with a 72-run opening stand.Sarfaraz then took charge, first forming a 136-run partnership with Virat Kohli (70 from 102 balls, with eight fours and a six) and later a 177-run stand with Pant (99 from 105 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) to put India in the lead. However, the introduction of the new ball saw India lose seven wickets for just 54 runs, with the middle order failing to contribute significantly. William O\u2019Rourke (3/92) and Matt Henry (3/102) took full advantage of the new ball, dismantling the Indian batting line-up just when a massive lead seemed likely. Spinner Ajaz Patel took two wickets, while Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee chipped in with one each. In their first innings, New Zealand posted 402 in response to India\u2019s 356. A magnificent century from Rachin Ravindra (134 from 157 balls, with 13 fours and four sixes) and a quickfire 65 from Southee (73 balls, eight fours, and four sixes) helped lift New Zealand from 233/7 to 402, thanks to a 137-run stand for the eighth wicket. Devon Conway (91 from 105 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes) also made a valuable contribution at the top. Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99) bowled well for India, while Mohammed Siraj picked up two wickets, and Ravichandran Ashwin and Bumrah took one each. Earlier, after electing to bat, India had a nightmare start under overcast, pace-friendly conditions. Henry (5/15) and O\u2019Rourke (4/22) ran through the Indian batting order, bundling them out for just 46 runs in 31.2 overs. Only Jaiswal (13) and Pant (20) managed to reach double figures. (ANI)",

The Jaipur Pink Panthers had to work hard, and eventually managed to win the contest with a 39-34 scoreline. For the Jaipur Pink Panthers, captain Arjun Deshwal scored 15 points, while Nitin Dhankar registered 13 points of his own for the Bengal Warriorz.Fazel Atrachali and the Bengal Warriorz began the game very well, with the defensive unit working in tandem to foil a flurry of Jaipur Pink Panther attacks in the early exchanges. Both sides were patient in the first phase of play, with the Bengal Warriorz working hard to hold onto a slender lead.But at the midway stage of the first half, the Jaipur Pink Panthers captain Arjun Deshwal wrestled the momentum away from the Bengal Warriorz. Shortly after, a solid tackle by Abhijeet Malik helped inflict an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers storm into the lead. And even though the Bengal Warriorz fought hard after that, it was the Jaipur Pink Panthers who finished the first half with a 3-point lead. At the half-time break, the Jaipur Pink Panthers led 21-18.The two sides began cautiously in the second half as well as they weren\u2019t keen on conceding any ground. While Fazel Atrachali led the Bengal Warriorz defence brilliantly, Arjun Deshwal was his talismanic self for the Jaipur Pink Panthers.With just under 10 minutes left in the contest, Abhijeet Malik inflicted an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers extend the lead to a 4-point one. At this point, the score read 29-25 in favour of the Jaipur Pink Panthers. It was an action-packed final phase of the game as Nitin Dhankar brought Bengal Warriorz right back into the contest. The Jaipur Pink Panthers, who seemed to be one step ahead all through up until then, were suddenly on the backfoot.But it was Abhishek KS\u2019s super tackle that sealed the contest for the Jaipur Pink Panthers, who walked off the mat with a closely contested win.",

Their current form sees them sitting on nine points after four games, their best-ever start to a season.\n\nThe Red Miners (JFC) have had the upper hand in recent meetings, winning their last three encounters against Hyderabad FC. A victory in this match would see them equal their record of four consecutive wins against any team in ISL history, matching their streak against NorthEast United FC.On the other hand, Hyderabad FC secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC, breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on this, aiming for back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023. However, their attack will need to step up as they remain winless this season.Hyderabad FC is in need of consecutive positive results to build momentum this season. After securing a draw against Chennaiyin FC, Thangboi Singto\u2019s side now has the chance to go unbeaten in back-to-back ISL matches for the first time since their four-game streak from December 2022 to February 2023.The two teams have played 10 matches against each other in the ISL. Jamshedpur FC have won five games and Hyderabad FC have emerged victorious once. Four games have resulted in a draw.Jamshedpur FC head coach Khalid Jamil acknowledged the importance of this match and also the improved strength of Hyderabad FC of late. He backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.\u201cIt is a very important game for us. We are playing in front of our home crowd. They\u2019re a good team. They\u2019re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,\u201d Jamil said in the pre-match press conference, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.Hyderabad FC tactician Thangboi Singto mentioned that the team has become better collectively in the last couple of weeks. He is hoping for that to translate into positive results on the field.\u201cThe players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,\u201d Singto said, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.\n\nJamshedpur FC\u2019s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leads the charts for producing most goal-scoring chances (9) amongst Indian players in ISL 2024-25. With all of his opportunities coming from open play, Jamil\u2019s men have never had to deal with a paucity of chances to convert upfront.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s striker Devendra Murgaonkar stands on the brink of a personal milestone as he could complete the feat of 50 ISL appearances in the coming match. His expected goal value of 0.65 is the highest amongst the team\u2019s players this season, reflecting that he\u2019s consistently at the centre of their goal-scoring endeavours.\n\nJamshedpur FC defender Stephen Eze has averaged 7.5 clearances in every appearance in ISL 2024-25. His ability to be vigilant and aware of any offensive moves transpiring in their backline and responding in a timely manner to the same has ensured that the home team has managed to have a disciplined defence.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s Leander D\u2019Cunha has won the possession back 5.5 times on average per match in the defensive third this season. He has single-handedly helped Hyderabad FC break plenty of attacks in the backend, and the Jamshedpur FC attacking unit will have to come up with rather unique, coordinated efforts to get past him.\n\nBoth teams will be eager for three points \u2013 Jamshedpur to solidify their top-tier form, and Hyderabad to break their winless run.",

Kerr starred with her leg-spin as well, ending with three wickets for 24 runs in four overs.It was a remarkable change of fortunes for New Zealand, who had come into the tournament with the baggage of 10 losses in a row.

There was no coming back from South Africa after they lost their gutsy leader Wolvaardt in the 10th over. Kerr got the prized wicket as Wolvaardt, in her attempt to accelerate the scoring rate, found Suzie Bates at cover.When the hero of the semifinal, Anneke Bosch, perished five balls later, the writing was on the wall.

        "text": "Dubai, Oct 20 (IANS) Clinical bowling by Amelia Kerr and Rosemary Mair helped New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs to lift their maiden title in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Stadium here on Sunday. Kerr and Mair picked three wickets each to restrict the Proteas to 126/9 in the second innings after New Zealand had posted a challenging 158/5 after they were asked to bat first in the final.\n\nNew Zealand women erased the bitter memories of the heartbreaks of their past T20 World Cup finals as they eventually triumphed in their third trip to the finals. The Proteas on the other hand have lost in the final for a second year running after having lost to Australia in the 2023 Women\u2019s T20 WC.\n\nAsked to bat first, Amelia Kerr, Brooke Halliday, and Suzi Bates helped New Zealand post 158/5 in 20 overs. Georgia Plimmer and Bates opened with a strong start, but Plimmer\u2019s attempted six off Marizanne Kapp was caught by Sune Luus. Bates soon followed, bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba. Captain Sophie Devine was removed for six after a successful review by Nadine de Klerk.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s bowlers tightened control, with no boundaries hit between overs 5.4 and 13.5. Halliday (38) broke the shackles, raised a 57-run stand with Kerr before being caught by Anneke Bosch. Kerr hit consecutive boundaries before falling in the penultimate over to Nonkululeko Mlaba, the only bowler with multiple wickets. Maddy Green\u2019s late six helped New Zealand set a 159-run target for SA.\n\nWith a massive target ahead of them and with the pressure at an absolute high, skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33) and Tazmin Brits (17), the two highest scorers of the edition, gave South Africa a great start.\n\nThe team racked up 47 runs in the powerplay and looked to build on the great start until Tazmin was dismissed by Fran Jonas in the very next over. In attempts to help her skipper continue the onslaught, Tazmin attempted to go big but a miscue of her shot saw Green take a simple catch at long on which rejuvenated the New Zealand side.\n\nThe fall of the wicket saw the Kiwis regain control of the game and built heavy pressure on their opponents in the following overs which saw the required run rate climb past nine runs an over. The ninth over saw New Zealand concede only one run and had five dot balls in the row which saw Wolvaardt try and relieve pressure on the first ball of the next over. In her attempts to take on Kerr, the South Africa skipper was caught at extra cover with Suzie taking the simple catch.\n\nThe removal of the skipper sprung life into the New Zealand bowling attack as a mini-collapse followed soon after. Kerr ended up removing Anneke Bosch (9), on the last ball of the same over in which Wolvaardt was dismissed when she missed an attempt to sweep the ball which resulted in a loud appeal that was rejected by the umpire. Upon further review, Bosch had indeed nicked the ball to reduce South Africa to 64/3 at the halfway mark.\n\nWhat followed was a mini collapse as Marizanne Kapp (8), Nadine de Klerk (6) and Sune Luus (8) fell in quick succession.\n\nKerr, who set the record for most wickets in a single edition of the women\u2019s T20 World Cup on the night, returned to take the scalp of Annerie Dercksen to further add to a historic campaign. With the game going out of South Africa\u2019s reach with each passing over, Mair struck twice in the penultimate over before Carson wrapped up the victory for New Zealand.\n\nThe Proteas once again suffered heartbreak and lost by 32 runs.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nNew Zealand 158/5 in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 43, Brooke Halliday 38, Suzie Bates 32; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2-31) beat South Africa 126/9 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 33; Amelia Kerr 3-24, Rosemary Mair 3-25) by 32 runs.",

Mohamed Salah's penalty and Curtis Jones' winner made it 10 wins in 11 games for the Reds since Arne Slot took charge. Nicolas Jackson briefly levelled for Chelsea in the second half, but they slipped to a first league defeat since losing to Manchester City on the opening weekend of the season. Victory takes Liverpool one point ahead of City and four clear of Arsenal, who they face at the Emirates next weekend.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Chelsea are now seven points off the top down in sixth, but there was plenty cause for optimism for the Blues from a performance that stretched Liverpool to their limits.Liverpool's only defeat under Slot came to Nottingham Forest following September's international break.The Dutchman responded by this time leaving all of his South American internationals -- Alexis Mac Allister, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez -- on the bench after their exertions in recent days across the Atlantic.The decision to hand Jones just his second league start of the season proved an inspired one as the England international won Liverpool's penalty and scored the decisive goal.Chelsea were fortunate still to have 11 men on the field after just six minutes when Tosin Adarabioyo hauled down Diogo Jota.The Portugal international was still a long way from goal but the incident was almost identical to the one that saw Arsenal defender William Saliba sent-off in a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday.Having survived that scare, Chelsea settled nicely into their rhythm and pushed the home side back by dominating possession.However, Liverpool's pace on the break was a constant threat and Chelsea were caught out when Salah fed Jones, who was chopped down by Levi Colwill.Salah slammed home his 10th goal against his former club from the resulting penalty.Moments later, Cody Gakpo slotted in at the end of a lightning Liverpool counter-attack, but Salah had strayed offside before delivering the assist.At the other end, Jackson smashed off the angle of post and bar in the first sign that Chelsea had some punch to their possession football.Chelsea, though, had another escape just before half-time when referee John Brooks intially pointed to the spot once more when Jones went down under a challenge from Robert Sanchez.VAR intervened, however, as the Spanish goalkeeper got a touch on the ball before making contact with Jones.Within three minutes of the restart for the second half, the Blues were back level as VAR played another helping hand for the visitors.Jackson latched onto Moises Caicedo's through ball and coolly slotted past Caoimhin Kelleher for his fifth goal in eight Premier League games.The Senegalese striker was ruled offside on the field, but was shown to be played on by Ibrahima Konate on replay.Liverpool took just three minutes to restore their lead as Jones timed his run perfectly to control and flick in Salah's cross.Chelsea forced Slot's men to defend their lead for the final 40 minutes but struggled to create clear-cut chances for the equaliser until seven minutes of stoppage time.Renato Vega headed over Cole Palmer's free-kick before Christopher Nkunku failed to get a telling touch to Pedro Neto's teasing cross.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC (KBFC) achieved a remarkable 2-1 victory against Mohammedan SC (MSC) at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday. This win marks the first time in 27 games that Kerala Blasters have triumphed in an away match after conceding the first goal in the Indian Super League (ISL). Two second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition. Mirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory, as per a press release by the ISL. The visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan SC backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match\u2019s tempo.In the 20th minute, Mohammedan SC\u2019s pillar in defense, Joseph Adjei had to be substituted after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian.The next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters FC\u2019s debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan SC. Mirjalol Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.Mikael Stahre\u2019s men didn\u2019t bog down after conceding the goal infact they were more spurred on to equalize. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to do so as Jesus Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan SC defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s long-range effort was denied by the crossbar.The second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield but the game swayed in the favour of KBFC by Kwame Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Noah. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, leaving his marker, Zodingliana Ralte in complete awe before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal.Riding on the positive momentum of scoring an equalizer, the Blasters (KBFC) enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri.Mohammedan SC\u2019s best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala Blasters FC home as they clinched their second win of the season, as per a press release by the ISL.While Kwame Peprah just played 26 minutes, his impact from the bench was such that it helped the team secure a great comeback win. He scored a crucial goal and completed 11 out of his 14 attempted passes. His introduction also allowed Jimenez more space in the box, resulting in the second goal. He was adjudged the Player of the Match.Mohammedan SC will host Hyderabad FC at home on October 26 while Kerala Blasters FC will be in action on October 25 against rivals Bengaluru FC in Kochi.",

She then came back to claim 3-25 and with a three-wicket haul by Rosemary Mair, helped New Zealand defend the score and win the title.\n\n\u201cI started to dream last night about what it feels to hold the trophy with this team, didn\u2019t want to get too ahead of us. This group, Suze and Lea, and for New Zealand cricket, it has been a long time. The great thing about this group is we know what we have been trying to achieve in the last 15, 18, 24 months,\u201d Devine said in the post-match presentation after the final on Sunday.\n\nHailing it as a team performance, the New Zealand skipper said they kept following their processes despite coming into the T20 World Cup after losing 10 successive matches.\n\n\u201cWe kept taking steps in the right direction, you want momentum and we came to the World Cup on the back of 10 successive losses. But everyone starts on zero,\u201d she said.\n\nDevine hailed star player Suzie Bates for her brilliant performance throughout the event.\n\n\u201cSpeaks volumes of who Suze (Suzie Bates) is as a player. The most capped player in the history of women\u2019s game, to think she can go out and play with such aggression and fearlessness. To have her in the side, it is just special, to lift it for her.\n\nDevine also praised Halliday and Kerr for their performance in the knockout phase. \u201cOutstanding. Brooke was outstanding against the West Indies. Spoke about backing our strengths, she backed her strengths, found those pockets, and ran hard. Helped us get to a competitive total.\n\n\u201cWe all know she is a once-in-a-generation player. What she was able to do tonight was incredible. Physically to do what she did with the bat, I think she can\u2019t feel her legs. She is not a bad cricketer but the person that she is, the world is her oyster and is great. South Africa were great, and the semifinal against Australia was unbelievable,\u201d said the New Zealand skipper.\n\nShe also highlighted the performance of bowler Lea Tahuhu, who kept things quiet for South Africa in the middle overs.\n\n\u201cI have spoken about her at length. You want a person like her in the team, she will scrape and fight for you. It is not always about the wickets, but it is about the work that goes behind it and working hard for your mates,\u201d Devine said.",

As a part of the exercise, the corporation is taking the assistance of institutions like ASCI, OU, JNTU Hyderabad and other universities to do a feasibility study in the ORR region. There are 5.48 lakh LED streetlights in GHMC jurisdiction and these institutions will offer consultancy services for validation and verification of street Lights and their Central Control and Monitoring System (CCMS) status. \u201cThey will also prepare the request for proposal (RFP) based on which tenders will be invited,\u201d said an official from the corporation. With educational institutions having students, the GHMC is utilising their services and most of these works which include making a note of the growing rate of streetlights should be done in the night. \u201cWith universities having a large number of students, they can execute the project, it is cost- effective for us,\u201d said a GHMC official. Another official said that based on their study the corporation will also decide whether tenders need to be invited zone-wise or as per urban local body (ULB) wise or based on the direction of areas in the Hyderabad-north, south, east and west. The existing street light maintenance and providing of new LED fixtures, including CCMS, is currently being handled by the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) stringing of cable is done by the GHMC .

        "text": "Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot. McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth. Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane. Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams. For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006. \"It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race,\" said Leclerc.\"I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better.\"Verstappen said: \"It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer. It was a tough battle and tough to keep him (Norris) behind but it's a great result. \"I have my opinion about his move, but I'll leave it to the stewards. I dont need to say anything here.\" Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. Norris fell to fourth as Sainz also passed him on an eventful opening lap that saw Lewis Hamilton rise from 17th to 12th before he went off at Turn 19 on lap three, prompting an early Safety Car intervention. The Mercedes star had never previously failed to finish in 11 races in Austin. The race resumed on lap five, Leclerc pulling away to build his lead to three seconds by lap 10 with Verstappen resisting Sainz, who reported possible fuel problems and a loss of power. Norris stayed fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Piastri. By lap 20, as first the pit-stops began, Leclerc was 8.3 seconds clear of Verstappen with Sainz third, 1.3 adrift of the Dutchman. Norris was 3.6 adrift In fourth. Sainz came in on lap 21 for hards, rejoining sixth. Verstappen stayed out until lap 26 rejoining fifth, Ferrari having executed their undercut. Leclerc then came in on lap 27 for hards, leaving Norris and Piastri leading the way. He was third. As Norris pulled clear, Piastri frustrated Leclerc until lap 31 when Norris pitted. He rejoined fifth behind Verstappen and ahead of sixth-placed Russell who had not stopped. A lap later, Piastri pitted and order was restored with the Ferraris, led by Leclerc, in control ahead of Verstappen and both McLarens. \"These tyres aren't good, I can't brake or attack,\" reported Verstappen.Russell finally pitted on lap 41, rejoining eighth on mediums for the final stint as Norris closed in on Verstappen and they fought for third and vital points in their title scrap. The duo battled fiercely for a dozen laps, the champion defending adroitly each time Norris attacked until lap 53 when, pushed wide and off-track, the Briton finally made his move stick to take third. \"He needs to give me it back,\" complained Verstappen on team radio as they battled on and the stewards studied the move before hitting Norris with a five-second penalty for gaining an advantage.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Jude Bellingham's first season at Real Madrid started with a glut of goals and ended with a dream double, but his second is yet to take off. The England international faces his former side Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu in a rematch of last season's Champions League final, which Bellingham and Los Blancos triumphed in to win the competition for a record 15th time. The 21-year-old has shown signs of frustration in his sophomore year at Madrid, tasked with more defensive responsibility in midfield than at many times last season following the arrival of French superstar Kylian Mbappe.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti used the hard-working Bellingham on the right of midfield in a 2-1 La Liga win at Celta Vigo on Saturday, another new role for the 103 million euro ($112 million) man.Bellingham started last season as a key figure in the centre of Madrid's attack, scoring 10 goals in his first 10 games across La Liga and the Champions League.Thrust into the position after Karim Benzema departed with Madrid still waiting for then Paris Saint-Germain striker Mbappe to arrive, Bellingham thrived.After nine games this season in all competitions, Bellingham is yet to find the net.During the win over Celta, Bellingham appeared furious with Brazilian team-mate Vinicius Junior after the forward did not pass him the ball when he was well placed to score and instead lashed over.\"I haven't seen that (moment) you're talking about, but if it happened, it means that he has balls, character, and seems good to me,\" said Ancelotti on Saturday, defending Bellingham.\"Honestly, I didn't realise (it had happened), I'll watch it, but if he has reacted... let's be calm, after the game they were talking, laughing -- they have no problems.\"What's to our merit is that we always compete well, until the end.\"Ancelotti looked to shore up Madrid's defence during the second half of last season by getting Bellingham to play a hybrid role which saw him drop to the left of midfield at frequent intervals.The midfielder looked exhausted in the final months of the campaign and struggled with shoulder and ankle issues.Sharp riseBellingham was also below his best for England at Euro 2024 despite the Three Lions reaching the final, with the exception of his stunning bicycle kick goal against Slovakia in the last 16.He has been on a sharp upwards trajectory since breaking into the Birmingham City first team as a teenager, with the club retiring his number 22 shirt after he joined Borussia Dortmund at 17.Bellingham became the club's youngest captain at 19 and led them to the brink of the league title before Bayern Munich claimed victory on the final day of the 2022-23 campaign.He was named player of the season and also shone for England at the 2022 World Cup before elimination by France in the quarter-finals.Madrid fans quickly fell in love with Bellingham as he proved their saviour time and time again, including with a brace in his first Clasico against Barcelona.His goals turned him into the sort of star it might have otherwise taken years at Madrid to become and that has proven a hard bar to consistently live up to.Ancelotti has repeatedly emphasised Bellingham's job has changed and he should be appreciated for what he is still bringing to the team, in a midfield role now similar to what he was accustomed to before joining Los Blancos.With Mbappe, Vinicius and sometimes Rodrygo Goes selected in attack, Ancelotti and Madrid have struggled to find the perfect balance this season.New England coach Thomas Tuchel will also have to decide how best to fit Bellingham in with Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer vying for attacking midfield positions behind Harry Kane.Madrid are still searching for the right formula ahead of a vital week, facing Dortmund and then La Liga leaders Barcelona, and Bellingham will be determined to contribute whether that includes him scoring or not.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

A five-second penalty given to Norris, who finished third on track at the flag, pushed him back to fourth behind the series leader and dealt a blow in his bid to catch and pass the Dutch driver in this year's title race.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Norris was adjudged to have gained an advantage by running off the track when he swept outside Verstappen on lap 53 or the 56-lap race.The incident cost Norris valuable points and helped lift Verstappen to a 57-point lead in the title race with 354 to Norris's 297 with five races left.\"My view is that the way the stewards interfered with a beautiful piece of motorsport was inappropriate because both cars went off track so both cars gained an advantage,\" said McLaren team chief Andrea Stella.\"It's a shame because it cost us a podium, it cost us a race where we stayed patient after we were pushed off in the first lap, at the first corner. We accepted it.\"Having said very clearly our position, this kind of position by the stewards, this kind of decision cannot be appealed. For us the chapter is now closed and we move on to the next race.\"But both cars went off track so for us there was no doubt that the manoeuvre was correct.\"Norris was philosophical about his plight after a feisty drive, having recovered from a poor first lap when he wasted his fourth pole in five races and fell to fourth.\"Not my best race,\" he said. \"With the loss in turn one and just the racing at the end, it clearly wasn't enough -- so that's life. I didn't do a good enough job, but I gave it a good shot so I'm doing my best.\"My best isn't good enough sometimes. It just wasn't our day today.\"He added that he was considering talking to the stewards about their decision, but felt \"there's plenty of scenarios where people wouldn't get a penalty in cases like what happened.\"He said it was difficult to know if he should have given his place back immediately during the race.\"It's tough to know, but maybe that was my one opportunity that I had. Max was defending well and it wasn't easy to overtake.\"Verstappen said he had endured a difficult race without the pace in his car to attack.\"It was tough, a tough battle and I tried everything to keep him behind me. But it was fun, too,\" he said.'Worked like crazy'\"A podium is a good result. I have my own opinion on the move, but I dont need to say anything. I'll let the stewards do their thing.\"The race was won buy Charles Leclerc who led home Carlos Sainz in a Ferrari one-two. Leclerc's win lifted him to 275 points in third place in the championship.\"We did a great job and the pace of the car was really good and that's thanks to the engineers and the team,\" said Leclerc.\"They've worked like crazy for the upgrades and it is paying off now. We could not have dreamed for anything better.\"It all worked and we are very happy. Now we are targeting the constructors title.\"It was Leclerc's first win in America, his third this year and the eighth of his career as Ferrari revelled in their first US Grand Prix one-two since 2006.Ferrari's success at the Circuit of the Americas lifted them to 496 points in the teams' title race behind McLaren on 544 and Red Bull on 504 with the Mexican and Brazilian Grands Prix to come on the next two successive weekends.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Amelia Kerr shone with bat and ball as New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs to win the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup for the first time.\n\nKerr top-scored with 43 as the White Ferns posted an imposing 158 for five in Dubai, combining with Brooke Halliday (38) to help her side to the second-highest score in an ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final.\n\nShe then took three wickets in reply, including both Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch in a decisive 10th over which turned the game in New Zealand\u2019s favour.\n\nSouth Africa could not recover and finished comfortably adrift on 126 for nine, ensuring Sophie Devine finished her stint as New Zealand\u2019s T20 skipper with her hands on the trophy.\n\nHaving been put in upon losing the toss, New Zealand announced their intent from the outset as Georgia Plimmer struck two boundaries in the opening over of the innings.\n\nShe soon fell going for another, lofting Ayabonga Khaka to Sune Luus at long-on, but Kerr and Suzie Bates kept the White Ferns\u2019 momentum going as they reached 43 for one by the end of the powerplay \u2013 the highest total conceded by South Africa at the six-over mark across the tournament.\n\nBates was making history as the most capped women\u2019s cricketer in international history, with the final marking her 334th match for the White Ferns, but her innings ended on 32 as she was bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba having shuffled across her stumps.\n\nKerr and Devine carried the score to 70 for two at the halfway stage but Devine departed in the next over, trapped in front by Nadine de Klerk after Wolvaardt successfully reviewed the decision with moments to spare.\n\nThat brought Halliday to the crease and she and Kerr went on to add 57 in seven overs in a pivotal partnership.\n\nHalliday struck consecutive boundaries off Sune Luus and looked fluent in her 28-ball 38 before picking out Bosch at deep square leg off the bowling of Chloe Tryon.\n\nKerr kept up the charge with back-to-back boundaries of her own at the start of the 18th over, only to follow her partner by being caught in the deep, but Maddy Green ensured there were still fireworks to come.\n\nGreen blasted the penultimate ball of the innings for six before being dropped by Luus from the final delivery as New Zealand set the Proteas 159 to win, with 48 coming from the final five overs.\n\nSouth Africa needed a strong start to give them a chance and in-form opening pair Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits provided it.\n\nThe two highest run-scorers in the competition combined to take their side to 47 without loss at the end of the powerplay but the breakthrough came in the next over as Brits holed out to long-on off the bowling of Fran Jonas.\n\nKerr, the competition\u2019s leading wicket-taker, then took centre stage. Despite limping due to the effects of cramp, her second over began with the vital wicket of Wolvaardt, caught by Bates at cover for 33, and ended with Bosch caught behind on review.\n\nAnother quickfire double breakthrough then all but decided the outcome as New Zealand turned the screw.\n\nMarizanne Kapp picked out Plimmer at deep square leg off Eden Carson from the final ball of the 12th over and the 13th started with de Klerk swiping Rosemary Mair to Kerr at backward point.\n\nKerr returned to dismiss Annerie Dercksen, taking her tournament tally to 15, and Mair picked up two wickets in the penultimate over to finish with three for 25.\n\nIt was left to Carson to bowl the final over and conclude a historic weekend for cricket in New Zealand, with the men\u2019s team securing a first Test win in India for 36 years earlier in the day.\n\nNew Zealand: 158/5 in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 43, Brooke Halliday 38; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2/31, Nadine de Klerk 1/17)South Africa: 126/9 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 33, Tazmin Brits 17; Amelia Kerr 3/24, Rosemary Mair 3/25)\n\nContent courtesy: ICC Business Corporation FZ LLC 2020 via Online Media Zone.",

The 24-year-old leg-spinner top-scored with 43 in the New Zealand total of 158-5 and then took 3-24 as South Africa fell short by 32 runs.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Kerr finished the tournament as the leading wicket-taker with 15 and collected both the Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament Awards.But 14 years ago, Kerr watched forlornly on television as New Zealand, with current skipper Devine and opening bat Bates in the side, lost the 2010 final to Australia by just three runs.It was a moment that triggered a love for the game and a desire to put the record right.\"I was inspired to be a White Fern watching that 2010 World Cup which Sophie was at,\" said Kerr who made her international debut when she was just 16.\"From that moment I was at the nets with my dad pretending I was batting with Sophie and Suzie.\"And I was in the team so young and playing with my role models who have been so good to me, two of New Zealand's greatest ever cricketers.\"I just think back to myself as a kid. When I was at primary school in creative writing, I wrote about winning a World Cup with Sophie and Suzie.\"I don't necessarily believe you deserve things in sport, but if any two people do, it's Sophie and Suzie.\"Devine, 35, and Bates, 37, are two of the elder stateswomen in the side along with 34-year-old Lea Tahuhu.Each of them made their mark on the final. Bates made 32 and took three catches while fast bowler Tahuhu squeezed the South African middle order.Devine only made six but her leadership was outstanding, bringing out the best in the younger players in the team, like Kerr.'Heartbreak and happiness'\"We joke about being grandmas and mums and whatnot but you feel a real sense of pride at seeing them stand up and take opportunities. Melie (Kerr) today was unbelievable,\" said the skipper.\"For us to be able to win it, it's just nice to have that. It's always something that you want to have when you finish your career.\"Devine's first action after winning was to embrace her fellow 'grandma' Bates who has now played 334 white ball internationals since making her debut back in 2006.\"Me and Suze have been through a lot together,\" she said.\"We've been through a lot of hairstyles together, hers a lot worse than mine.\"But to be able to share it, to be fielding close together as well and to share that moment, that embrace, that's 17, 18 years of joy and heartbreak and happiness shared in that moment. It's just been awesome to share that with her.\"With the men's cricket team also completing a spectacular win in Bengaluru earlier in the day, their first Test win in India since 1988, Sunday was arguably New Zealand's finest ever day on the cricket field, although Devine hopes there is more to come.\"I'm really hopeful that tonight's victory can inspire that next generation of not just young girls but young boys as well to pick up a cricket bat, a cricket ball,\" she said.\"It still feels pretty surreal at the moment and hopefully the impact of what we've been able to achieve is going to be long-standing and long-reaching.

        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC pulled off a memorable 2-1 victory over Mohammedan SC at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday, marking the first time in 27 games that they have won an away match after conceding first in the Indian Super League. \n\nTwo second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition.\n\nMirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory.\n\nThe visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match's tempo. \n\nIn the 20th minute, Mohammedan defender Joseph Adjei had to be substituted out after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian. \n\nThe next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan. Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.\n\nThe Blasters weren\u2019t bogged down after conceding the goal. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to level the scores as Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s effort was crashed onto crossbar. \n\nThe second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield. But the game swayed in the favour of the Blasters by Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Sadaoui. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, evading his marker before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal. \n\nThere was controversy in the 70th minute as Mohammedan were denied a penalty after Franca was bundled over from behind by Hormipam Ruivah after being put through on goal. The home crowd was furious with the decision and expressed their displeasure by throwing water bottles on the pitch.\n\nThe Blasters enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri. \n\nMohammedan best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala BlastersFC home as they clinched their second win of the season.",

        "text": "Star Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry congratulated New Zealand\u2019s veteran trio of Suzie Bates, skipper Sophie Devine, and pacer Lea Tahuhu for finally securing the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title, beating South Africa in the final. For three of the most experienced White Ferns stars, it was a Sunday to remember as they ended a 15-year wait for their first-ever ICC Women\u2019s T20 WC title. The hard work, pain, blood, sweat, and tears worth 410 T20Is combined finally proved to be worth it as they made key contributions to this historic title win. Perry took to Instagram and posted in a story that she could not think of a group of players more deserving of success for their country and congratulated them. Notably, Australia\u2019s title defence ended in the semifinals after an eight-wicket loss to South Africa. This marked the first T20 WC after 2009 in which Australia was not in the finals. NZ reached the finals after a thrilling eight-run win over West Indies in the other semifinal. The White Ferns veterans made key contributions throughout the tournament. Bates was the fourth-highest run-getter with 150 runs in six innings at an average of 25.00, with a strike rate of around 93 and best score of 32. Despite not scoring a half-century, she made important contributions up the order in every match. She also took a wicket. Skipper Devine made 114 runs in six innings at an average of 28.50, with a strike rate of 107.54. Her best score of 57* came against India in the opening clash and set the tone for the Kiwis\u2019 brilliant run in the tournament. Tahuhu took five wickets in six games at an average of 22.80, with best bowling figures of 3/15 that came against India. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*. She has also taken 59 wickets with the best figures of 4/26. Devine is the sixth-highest run-getter in women\u2019s T20Is and White Ferns\u2019 second-highest run-maker, scoring 3,391 runs in 143 matches and 139 innings at an average of 28.25, with a strike rate of 120.93. She has scored a century and 21 fifties, with the best score of 105. She has also taken 117 wickets with the best figures of 4/22. Tahuhu is also an established veteran with 96 T20I appearances, in which she has taken 93 wickets at an average of 19.79, with the best figures of 4/6. Coming to the match, SA won the toss and elected to field first. Bates played a crucial knock of 32 in 31 balls, with three fours at the top. After being reduced to 70/3, it was a 57-run stand between Amelia Kerr (43 in 38 balls, with four boundaries) and Brooke Halliday (38 in 28 balls, with three fours) that played a crucial role in NZ reaching 158/5 in their 20 overs. Nonkululeko Mlaba (2/31) was the pick of the bowlers for White Ferns. In the run-chase of 159 runs, despite a brisk start by skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33 in 27 balls, with five fours), SA and a 51-run stand with Tazmin Brits (17 in 18 balls, with one four), SA lost wickets quickly and never found their rhythm following the dismissal of their openers. They were restricted to 126/9 in their 20 overs, with Kerr (3/24) and Rosemary Mair (3/25) shining the most with the ball for NZ. Kerr was given the \u2018Player of the Match\u2019 award for her all-round show. (ANI)",

        "text": "New Zealand veteran Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine and Lea Tahuhu, the three \u201cgrandmas\u201d of their team, finally got the crowning moment of their T20I career on Sunday as an all-round White Ferns side defeated South Africa by 32 runs to secure their maiden ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title. NZ captain Devine had described the trio as \u201cthree grandmas\u201d, and it was the veterans who finally got their moment on Sunday.For 37-year-old Bates and 35-year-old skipper Devine, this was the third time lucky, with the long-serving pair both having played in their country\u2019s previous two appearances in Women\u2019s T20 World Cup finals, way back in 2009 and 2010, ending in losses to England and Australia. Those defeats at Lord\u2019s and in Bridgetown threatened to be the closest the pair came to World Cup glory, but Dubai 2024 has proved a fitting finale for two of the game\u2019s greats.Bates, who had bowled the crucial final over against West Indies in the semi-final, was at her belligerent best with the bat in the first innings against South Africa.It was Bates (334 international matches) who got the ball rolling for her team in the final, showing her class on the day when she surpassed Mithali Raj (333 international appearances) as the most-capped player in the history of women\u2019s international cricket.Her 32 from 31 deliveries gave the White Ferns the perfect platform on which to build, which her teammates duly did to reach a winning total of 158/5.\u201cIt is just outstanding, and just speaks to the volume of who Suzie is as a player,\u201d Devine said of her teammate. \u201cShe is now the most capped player in the history of the game on the woman\u2019s side, and it is unbelievable to think that she can go out there and play with such aggression and such fearlessness. I think it set the tone for the rest of the batting lineup. I think everyone knows how special I find Suze and what she has been able to achieve. So, I am just so stoked for her that we are able to lift it for her,\u201d she added, Devine captained her side with aplomb throughout the tournament, even lightening the mood just moments before the final began by telling some jokes to relieve some tension \u2013 jokes that she later said \u201cshe was not sure she could repeat,\u201d. And while her own individual contribution with the bat in the final (6) was not her best, it was her simply brilliant 57* from 36 balls right back at the start of the tournament against India that had got her team off to the perfect start in their winning campaign.\u201cI started to dream last night about what it would feel like to hold the trophy with this team, but I did not want to get to ahead of us,\u201d said Devine after the title win. \u201cThe great thing about this group is we know what we have been trying to achieve in the last 15, 18, 24 months. We kept taking steps in the right direction. You want momentum and we came to the World Cup on the back of 10 successive losses, but everyone starts on zero,\u201d she added. The 34-year-old Tahuhu often flies under the radar compared to her two experienced teammates, but bowled tidily in the final once again, and has now moved up to 93 career wickets in T20 Internationals, second only to Devine for New Zealand and up with some of the legendary names of the sport.\u201cI have spoken about it at length before, Lea\u2019s the sort of person that you want in your team, because you know that she is going to get in the fight, she is going to compete and scrap for you, and I knew if I threw her the ball, that she is going to make something happen. And she did just that,\u201d said Devine. \u201cIt is not always the person that takes the wickets or the catches. It is the work that goes on behind it, the teamwork. It is sort of working hard for your mate out in the middle there. And Leah was fantastic today, and helped change the outcome of the game I thought,\u201d she concluded. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*.

After being reduced to 70/3, it was a 57-run stand between Amelia Kerr (43 in 38 balls, with four boundaries) and Brooke Halliday (38 in 28 balls, with three fours) that played a crucial role in NZ reaching 158/5 in their 20 overs. Nonkululeko Mlaba (2/31) was the pick of the bowlers for White Ferns. In the run-chase of 159 runs, despite a brisk start by skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33 in 27 balls, with five fours), SA and a 51-run stand with Tazmin Brits (17 in 18 balls, with one four), SA lost wickets quickly and never ever found their rhythm following dismissal of their openers. They were restricted to 126/9 in their 20 overs, with Kerr (3/24) and Rosemary Mair (3/25) shining the most with the ball for NZ. Kerr was given the \u2018Player of the Match\u2019 award for her all-round show. (ANI)",

Returning to the World Cup Final after three years following the birth of her daughter in December 2022, four-time Olympian Deepika was seeded third in the eight-archer field.She had a smooth run through the semifinals but probably the pressure of gold medal match got to her against fourth-seed Li Jiaman, a team silver medalist from the Paris Olympics.It was Deepika's ninth appearance at the World Cup Final where she has also bagged a bronze. Dola Banerjee is the only Indian archer to have won a gold in the World Cup Final, having topped the podium in Dubai 2007.In the men's recurve section, Dhiraj Bommadevara, despite leading 4-2, could not hold off the challenge from South Korea's Paris Olympics bronze medallist, Lee Woo Seok in the opening round and made an early exit .The pressure once again seemed to affect the Indian archers, who have often struggled in high-stakes matches.The five-member Indian contingent, comprising three compound and two recurve archers, thus concluded their season-ending World Cup Final campaign with just one medal.After a stellar semifinal win against Mexico's Alejandra Valencia, Deepika couldn't maintain momentum.She dropped the first set by a single point (26-27). Despite improving in the second set, Li's flawless 30, including an X-ring shot, gave the Chinese archer a commanding a 2-0 lead (30-28).The third set proved decisive as Deepika's second arrow landed in the red 7-ring, allowing Li to claim victory with three solid 9s, taking the set 27-25 and sealing the gold on her debut World Cup Final appearance.In the semifinals, Deepika triumphed over home favourite and Paris Olympics bronze medalist Valencia, edging her out 6-4 (29-28, 26-26, 26-29, 28-28, 28-27). It also avenged Deepika's bronze medal loss to Valencia from the Yecheon World Cup earlier this year.Deepika's campaign had begun with a dominant 6-0 victory over China's Yang Xiaolei (27-23, 29-22, 29-27).In the men's recurve, third-seeded Dhiraj was India's sole qualifier.Facing second seed Lee Woo Seok, Dhiraj started strongly, drawing the first set and winning the second.However, he missed the opportunity to close out the match in the third by just one point with the South Korean drawing level before delivering flawless performances in the fourth and fifth sets.Dhiraj eventually lost 4-6 (28-28, 29-26, 28-28, 26-30, 28-29).On the compound side, the three-member Indian contingent returned empty-handed ending their campaign on Saturday.Prathamesh Fuge finished fourth after a tense semifinal loss, while Priyansh and Jyothi Surekha Vennam failed to reach the medal rounds.",

In the final match of the T20 World Cup 2024 (Women\u2019s T20 World Cup) played on Sunday 20 October at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, New Zealand won its first title by defeating South Africa by 32 runs. Sunday was a historic day for New Zealand cricket.\n\nWhile the New Zealand men\u2019s team registered its first Test win in India after 36 years, a few hours later the women\u2019s team gave the country the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup trophy for the first time. After defeating South Africa in the final, the Kiwi team did this tremendous celebration. All-rounder Amelia Kerr, who was chosen Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament, played the guitar and the entire team standing behind kept singing songs.\n\nInternational Cricket Council has posted this video on Instagram, which everyone is liking. On the other hand, South Africa\u2019s heart was broken again. South Africa once again proved to be \u2018chokers\u2019. South Africa, which had reached the finals thrice, had to be satisfied with the second prize. Runner-up in Cape Town last year, runner-up in the men\u2019s final in Barbados and now again in Dubai.\n\nHowever, South Africa performed brilliantly and defeated defending champion Australia in the semi-finals and made it to the finals for the second consecutive time. Talking about the final match, South African captain Laura Wolvaardt won the toss and decided to bowl. New Zealand scored 158 runs for 5 wickets in 20 overs.

        "text": "Wellington: Members of the New Zealand White Ferns cricket team which beat South Africa by 32 runs in the final of the women's Twenty20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday will split prize money of around USD 2.3 million.That works out at around USD 155,000 or NZD 256,000 per team member, a life-changing windfall for players who for years have struggled for years to achieve financial parity with their male counterparts.New Zealand's first-ever victory in the World Cup of cricket's shortest format was a massive surprise. The White Ferns had lost 10 consecutive T20 matches before beating South Africa in a warm-up match.That pre-tournament success proved a turning point for New Zealand who beat India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing only to Australia on the way to the semifinals.South Africa ousted six-time champion Australia in a massive upset in the semi in which New Zealand beat the West Indies.New Zealand made 158-5, batting first in the final, helped by Suzy Bates who made 32, Amelia Kerr who made 43 and Brooke Halliday who made 38. Kerr then took 3-24 and Rosemary Mair 3-25 as New Zealand restricted South Africa to 126-9.\"Pretty unbelievable to be honest,\ufffd Mair said. \ufffdComing into the tournament all the odds were against us so for the group to bounce back like they have is unbelievable.\"We just care so much about each other. We've been through a lot of lows in the last 18 months, and we've just stuck by each other and kept working hard for each other.\"Captain Sophie Devine was leading the New Zealand team for the last time. She and Bates have played in all nine T20 World Cups since the first in 2009. New Zealand reached the final of the first two tournaments in 2009 and 2010, losing to Australia on both occasions.\"This means everything to us,\" Bates said. \"When you play team sport, you want to be a world champion.\"We've fought our way back to the top. (Devie) has been so outstanding leading this team... so calm and believing in us. We'll probably have a cuddle for even longer later because there's been some dark times that only the people in the (locker room) understand.\"New Zealand was coached to victory by Australian Ben Sawyer and former Black Caps batters Dean Brownlie and Craig McMillan.The White Ferns' success was praised Monday by New Zealand Sports Minister Chris Bishop. It came at the end of a weekend in which New Zealand also retained sailing's America's Cup and in which the New Zealand men's cricket team beat India in a test in India for the first time in 36 years.\"And then to round out a truly amazing sporting weekend, at 3am Monday morning (NZT) the White Ferns, led by Sophie Devine, stepped up to face South Africa in the women's T20 World Cup final in Dubai and absolutely smashed it, bringing home their first World Cup since the One Day International in 2000,\" Bishop said.\"Amelia Kerr's 43 runs off 38 balls and then taking 3 wickets for 24 set our team up for their magnificent performance.\"",

Returning to the World Cup Final after three years following the birth of her daughter in December 2022, four-time Olympian Deepika was seeded third in the eight-archer field.\n\nShe had a smooth run through the semifinals but probably the pressure of gold medal match got to her against fourth-seed Li Jiaman, a team silver medalist from the Paris Olympics. It was Deepika's ninth appearance at the World Cup Final where she has also bagged a bronze.

She dropped the first set by a single point (26-27). Despite improving in the second set, Li's flawless 30, including an X-ring shot, gave the Chinese archer a commanding a 2-0 lead (30-28).\n\n'Why Is OLA a Public Issue': Comedian Kunal Kamra\u2019s Feud With Bhavish Aggarwal Heats Up Again - Accusations, Bouncers, & Netizens React\n\n'No Rest, No relaxation In The Path We Have Chosen For Developed India,' Says PM Modi\n\nRajasthan: Man Gets Beaten Up With Rod By Wife & Daughter Over Domestic Dispute In Bikaner; Shocking Video Surfaces\n\nDiwali 2024 Calendar: Know When Is Deepavali, Choti Diwali, Dhanteras, Lakshmi Puja & Other Key Dates\n\nThe third set proved decisive as Deepika's second arrow landed in the red 7-ring, allowing Li to claim victory with three solid 9s, taking the set 27-25 and sealing the gold on her debut World Cup Final appearance.\n\nIn the semifinals, Deepika triumphed over home favourite and Paris Olympics bronze medalist Valencia, edging her out 6-4 (29-28, 26-26, 26-29, 28-28, 28-27). It also avenged Deepika's bronze medal loss to Valencia from the Yecheon World Cup earlier this year.

        "text": "Indian Premier League (IPL) defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are in a precarious position ahead of the upcoming season as they would be without the services of previous season's mentor Gautam Gambhir, assistant coach and academy head Abhishek Nayar and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate. The trio have joined the Indian cricket team as head coach and assistant coaches respectively, and certainly leave a void in the KKR dugout. While Dwayne Bravo has joined the side as mentor, other positions need to be filled.In addition to the backroom staff, early indications are that the captaincy role is not straightforward either. Shreyas Iyer joined KKR when he was bought for Rs 12.25 crore at the 2022 auction and it's understood that the franchise is willing to retain the Mumbai batter but not as their top retention.Ahead of October 31 deadline, Andre Russell is the front runner to be retained with a hefty price tag. The all-rounder was earlier retained for Rs 12 crore by KKR and is very likely to get a substantial raise.If things don't go per Iyer's liking, will he explore different options? In case he looks that way, the right-hander is expected to set the auction on fire because many teams - Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings, Delhi Capitals - are in the need of a captain. And an Indian captain is always sought after.Punjab won't mind loosening their purse strings for the right-hander considering he had a successful partnership with Ricky Ponting, now PBKS head coach, at DC and the two were together when they reached the final in 2020.Equally, don't be surprised if DC explore the Iyer option, too, because he was a proven leader for them and Rishabh Pant has asked to not be considered as skipper.Even last year, when Iyer was returning from injury lay-off, there was a section in the KKR camp which wanted to continue with Nitish Rana, who was standby captain in Iyer's absence, as leader for 2024 season.The franchise, however, \"announced\" Iyer as captain before the tournament got underway. The statement did raise a few eyebrows as Iyer was the original captain and Rana was only doing the job in his absence, and many felt the announcement was absolutely unnecessary.Shah Rukh Khan co-owned KKR are one of the franchises who advocated for a smaller auction, and pushed for more Right to Match (RTM). It's a strategy they are likely to use at the upcoming auction.There are more tempting retention options in Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana (uncapped), Mitchell Starc and Varun Chakravarthy but it will be interesting to see how much the defending champs are willing to spend.They have a problem of plenty on that front but it's their captaincy piece which would be keenly followed by other franchises too.",
        "summary": "Champions KKR are in a critical position as they face the upcoming IPL season without top staff including former mentor Gautam Gambhir. Shreyas Iyer's captaincy is uncertain, with all-rounder Andre Russell likely to be retained, as other teams explore the possibility of acquiring the KKR skipper.",

        "title": "EA Sports FC 25 Review: Minor League Upgrades",
        "text": "It's difficult to recognise granular changes in seemingly constant things. You don't really notice a tree growing every year, but when you put those years together, the difference becomes apparent to the naked eye. The erstwhile FIFA series of football sims is somewhat like that. With a new edition released every year, the changes to the long-running and ridiculously popular sports franchise can be imperceptible over a year, or even more. These games only start feeling new after three or four subsequent editions when Electronic Arts is compelled to re-energise the series after a run of games becomes undeniably stale. To me, FIFA has always existed in eras. A spate of games follows the same language with minor improvements and tunings, before EA decides to freshen things up.\n\nThe franchise's latest era began last year when it shed its decades-old FIFA identity and rechristened itself as EA Sports FC. But a new name didn't bring a promised new beginning with FC 24. There was a new coat of paint, but underneath, the game was very much carved out of the same wood that has long been showing cracks. No one expected EA to upend a successful formula and re-imagine the game in a new light, but EA Sports FC 24 was desperately lacking fresh ideas. One year later, EA Sports FC 25, the second entry in EA's new football video game timeline, is still very much a fruit from the same tree. But there are a few new ideas this time around, some of which elevate the game from its swamp of familiarity. On a visual level, there's not much that differentiates FC 25 from its predecessor. You could boot it up and your flatmate might walk in on you playing and think its FC 24. But if they'd pick up the controller and jump in a game, the differences are likely to become a little more apparent.\n\nTo begin with, EA Sports FC 25 is harder, especially for those who are used to running at defences with a pacy winger, cutting through the entire opponent half and scoring a worldie \u2013\u2013 that's harder to pull off here. There's a greater (and much needed) emphasis on defending in FC 25 that hands players a little more power to dictate play when they are off the ball. Defenders and defensive midfielders have more of a commanding presence and are clearly more empowered to disrupt quick offensive moves. At first, this is a bit jarring. When attacking, you tend to lose the ball often and quickly if you're not carefully constructing your passes and relying on a single player to break down the defence. Defenders pick your pocket or win the second ball before you have the time to adjust, turn or take a second touch. This forces you to craft more considered plays and graft for your goals.\n\nDefenders can now also make a tactical foul in a last-ditch attempt to nullify an attack. These are fun to pull off in the game and of course will result in your player being penalised, but the new ability is only useful in certain circumstances and doesn't strengthen defences as a whole. Even with their newfound powers, however, defenders still seem to be playing with their hands tied behind their backs. When facing up to an oncoming attacker, big centre-backs are potent in their tackling. But if a pacy forward slips past them, you could kiss defensive recovery goodbye. There's little that's stopping the forward from scoring at that point as defenders are woefully inept when chasing down attackers and making recoveries. This has long been an issue in EA's football games, and FC 25 doesn't address the glaring defensive weakness either.\n\nDefenders still struggle to make recoveries against pacy forwardsPhoto Credit: EA\n\nEA's football franchise has always favoured an arcade-style recreation of the world's game. It's faster, leaner, and meaner. For a more authentic on-pitch gameplay, purists like me have preferred the more deliberate playstyle and pacing of Pro Evolution Soccer (rest in peace). But EA Sports FC25, to its credit, attempts to bring a bit of realism to its otherwise hyper-kinetic simulacrum of football made for 16-year-olds brought up on TikTok and Twitter (also, RIP). EA has burned in a Simulation Settings master switch in the game this time, that lets you swap out the classic FIFA experience \u2013\u2013 akin to a run-and-gun sort of playstyle \u2013\u2013 for a more grounded simulation of the sport \u2013\u2013 much like a tactical shooter. EA says that the Simulation gameplay type is \u201ccloser to what you'd see in a live football match.\u201d While that's an exaggeration, the option does slow down things on the pitch, underscoring the action with real-time decision making. Once I toggled the Simulation mode on, I never went back.\n\nThis change isn't just apparent on the defensive third of the field; attacking now seems beholden to gravity and you can't simply fly around with the ball glued to your toes. Players are more prone to bad touches, more susceptible to losing one-on-one battles, and more unlikely to knock the ball past the opponent in a sudden burst of pace. Passing, too, is now a little less video gamey. It doesn't seem hard coded to be precise, and I found myself struggling to pass my way out of tight spaces in the midfield early on. With time, however, you grow into the rhythms of the sim and find solutions that help you build up efficient plays. This experience, of course, is subject to user customisation. If you prefer the manic intensity of classic FIFA gameplay, then you can stick to the default simulation setting or fine tune it the way you like by adjusting individual sliders for different gameplay elements.\n\nWith the simulation setting on, the gameplay is more realistic and consideredPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe altered on-pitch experience is underpinned by an overhaul of tactical foundations across FC 25. This applies to how you tactically set up your team, assign player roles, and decide how they will play together on the pitch. When you head to team management in any mode, you're greeted by a revamped and streamlined tactics menu, where you can choose a tactical preset, pick a formation, a build-up style, and a defensive approach. All of this is a neater, but also a leaner experience. Some specific tactical adjustments present in past games have been stripped away, in essence giving you less control over your team's tactical set up. You also can't manually adjust the position of your players on the pitch and create your own formations like you were able to in previous games. These changes make for a less flexible, more guided tactical experience in FC 25.\n\nThe tactical streamlining, however, is counter-balanced by a deeper focus on individual player roles in your starting XI. Each position on the pitch comes with distinct positional role that can be assigned to the player. These player roles govern how individual members of your team will think, act and move on the pitch. For instance, you could set up you right-back as a Falseback; this role will task your right-back to push into the central midfield rather than staying out wide \u2014 Pep Guardiola style. Or you could play them as an Attacking Wingback, prioritising wide attacking output over defensive duties. Each Player Role comes with its unique benefits and drawbacks; you may get an extra pair of legs on the offensive side of the pitch to provide options when attacking, but that player will likely be stranded out of position when you lose the ball, making you susceptible to counters.\n\nPlayer Roles add depth to the tactical set up of your teamPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nEach player on your team also comes with specific level of Role Familiarity, denoted by \u2018plus' signs. A player's familiarity to a position and its corresponding roles and responsibilities guides how good they will be when starting from that position. A single plus sign next to a role indicates the player has mastered the position, while a double plus sign \u2014 only available for certain players \u2014 tells you that they are one of the world's best in that role. These options are quite helpful in guiding player-level behaviour on the pitch and offer you the freedom to tweak around and see what's working for you. The more role-familiar players you have in your starting XI, the more your team is likely to actually play like team.\n\nBeyond menus and inputs, the AI-driven tactical core of EA Sports FC 25, however, remains annoyingly broken. EA says there's a new AI model guiding positional awareness and player behaviour in the game that utilises real-world data. And the new iteration of the Hypermotion technology claims to bring more authentic on-pitch player interactions, animations and visuals. But, when playing a match in FC 25, these changes are frankly imperceptible. There's barely any noticeable shift in visual fidelity from FC 24, and while there are newer animations for player actions in the game, AI player behaviour remains woeful. Despite spending hours setting up your tactics, it is often a struggle to get your team to behave like a real-life football club. You see glaring gaps in the midfield, AI-controlled defenders not rushing to mark attackers in space, and AI players constantly failing to adapt to evolving situations in a match.\n\nFC 25 features Smart Tactics options that can be accessed with the D-padPhoto Credit: EA\n\nAnd it isn't just the on-pitch flaws that are carried over from previous games; general UI clunk, unresponsive inputs in menus, and stuttering transitions between screens are alive and well in FC 25. These recurring frustrations point to a callous approach from EA that mandates rushing out a new edition in time for a new football season over hammering out the dents in the chassis to deliver a polished product. You can also never quite shake the feeling that EA Sports FC 25 is residing under the skin of its predecessor. The main menu here is the clone of the new one seen last year. As is the lazy tradition, this will continue for a few editions before EA knows it's time to switch things up. The familiar DNA pervades every other screen in the game, with only a few strands swapped around to make sure players can see what's changed if they bring a magnifying glass.\n\nLet's talk about the manager mode. The trademark Career mode, where I've sunk most of my time in my decades of playing FIFA, is as usual split between Manager and Player careers \u2014 I'll mostly be talking about the former. In FC 24, the Career mode felt largely ignored, with EA only bringing minor and cosmetic changes to the tired formula. In FC 25, the changes, unfortunately, remain aesthetic and stop way short of overhauling the manager mode experience. The ability to set an overarching tactical vision for your club, introduced last year, has been retained, and there are some tweaks across different aspects of the mode, but little is new in terms of impactful additions. The Career mode homepage now shows a rolling list of your tasks as a manager and a social media feed on the side providing updates on player transfers from football gossip god Fabrizio Romano and club and player news from The Athletic. After the initial novelty of checking every item off your list before you head to matchday, you start to groan at the repetitive tasks and eventually start ignoring them.\n\nThe new manager mode homescreen comes with a task list and a social media feedPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe new tactics system makes its way to the Career mode, changing the way you set up your club to win matches, but the all-important transfer hub remains the same for practical purposes. The way you set up your scouts, find players you need, engage in transfer negotiations is completely unchanged, following the set formats we've seen for years now. And there is still no VAR in EA Sports FC 25. I understand that implementing a video review system in online matches is not feasible, but playing manager mode in 2024 without VAR affecting matches and their outcomes seems outlandish. There is a greater focus on youth development and scouting; manager mode even lets you play bi-monthly five-a-side youth tournaments to accelerate the growth of your youth team. And now there's an option to embark on a manager career for a women's team from some of the top licensed leagues. While these additions are appreciated, EA has frustratingly again overlooked a core overhaul of the manager mode that fans have long demanded.\n\nAs expected, however, the money-spinning Ultimate Team mode gets the spotlight again. EA's biggest addition this time around is a quickfire 5v5 Rush mode, that in essence replaces the Volta street football mode. Rush comes with its own set of rules for offside, player penalties and set pieces, all of which fit naturally within the seven-minute match format. The new feature, available across different game modes, strips away the contrived \u201ccoolness\u201d of Volta with simple, fun five-a-side matches that truly shine in the Ultimate Team mode. With Rush, EA is basically cribbing from Rocket League. In Ultimate Team Rush, you can either team up with friends or play with strangers online \u2014 each user controlling a player \u2014 and take on other teams of five online. As a former Rocket League addict, I can confirm that Rush has the same effect. It's fast, engaging and often frustrating \u2014 but never not fun.\n\nRocket league-style five-a-side Rush mode is fun and addictivePhoto Credit: EA\n\nPlaying with friends online naturally brings more cohesion to your game, but jumping into a match with strangers is as unpredictable as you'd expect it to be. If you're lucky, you'll match with players who want to work as a team, construct selfless plays and win together. Most of the time, however, you'll find yourself playing with pre-pubescent idiots who're in the habit of shouting \u201cSiuuuuu\u201d after eating their morning cereal. Nevertheless, Rush is cool, if derivative addition to EA Sports FC 25, and I found myself playing quickfire games online again and again. In fact, despite getting a good Ultimate Team together on paper, I played more Rush games than the traditional 11v11 matches in Ultimate Team Rivals.\n\nThe familiar stuff from Ultimate Team, like squad-building challenges and online competitions, are all here \u2014 and so is in-your-face case for microtransactions. The new tactical system and player roles make their way into mode, too. In addition to introducing the all-new Rush mode, FC 25 expands the Evolutions feature, which brings cosmetic and stat upgrades to your player cards in Ultimate Team. You can select an eligible player from your team and graft to complete challenges that upgrade your player cards. Or you can give EA more money and spend in-game currency to buy upgrades.\n\nUltimate Team remains the focus for EAPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nAside from Ultimate Team, other familiar modes like online Seasons, Clubs and Co-op Seasons are all here in the same form we've seen for years. As with all EA Sports football games, the comfort of consistency remains key. There are no radical changes, no upending of norms, no risk-taking. But one can hardly begrudge EA to rip apart things that have continued to work for years for reasons as flimsy as creativity and innovation. But it's the minor visual upgrades that leave a bad taste in the mouth. EA Sports FC 25 runs and looks as we've come to expect games in the series to run and look for the past few years.\n\nAs I mentioned, when it comes to the naked eye test, there's little that differentiates the game from its predecessor. Sure, certain player faces are more detailed now, as is the norm with every new edition, and a fresh set of animations try and add a bit more realism to player movement, but these don't amount to a perceptible visual upgrade on the pitch. Annoyingly though, cloth physics gets an upgrade that makes player kits comedically bouncy. Shirts and shorts look like they are going through a panic attack, wiggling as if they have a mind of their own. The ever-present general layer of visual glitches and jank hasn't been ironed out, as well. Whether you're on the pitch or in the menus, EA Sports FC 25 will often refuse to follow your lead.\n\nCertain player faces and animations are improved in FC 25Photo Credit: EA\n\nWhen you put all of its new tricks and familiar frustrations into a bag, EA Sports FC 25 fails to offer an experience that makes you look at the series in a new light. And that seems to be the recurring problem with the franchise as a whole. EA has constantly favoured reiteration over rejuvenation, and sadly that approach has only led to regurgitation. Every new edition of its annual football sim feels like meeting an old friend, asking \u201chow you've been\u201d and getting \u201csame old, same old\u201d in reply. There are some new ideas, most notably the Rocket League-style Rush mode that adds a much needed, well, rush to an otherwise stale table of contents. And while the tactical overhaul brings a new way to engage with team strategy and player instructions, it does so at the cost of mechanical flexibility.\n\nThe on-pitch gameplay takes a few steps forward in the right direction, empowering the defensive side of the game, but FC 25 stops short of taking necessary strides towards meaningful upgrades that could change the game for good. The continued apathy towards career mode, however, remains the biggest complaint. Gaping cracks in the quintessential mode have repeatedly been ignored for surface-level improvements \u2014 as if a new coat of paint would change the fact that the underlying wall is rotting. EA Sports FC 25, disappointingly, opts to do the same, even though a foundational change is long overdue. Over the past few years, EA's long-running football franchise has essentially embraced a live service strategy, with minor seasonal upgrades rolled out annually to an audience hooked to its unethical commercial model. The only difference is that EA asks you to pay full price every year for a \u201cnew\u201d game.\n\n Engaging and addictive Rush mode Deeper tactical control with Player Roles Greater emphasis on defending Focus on realism with Simulation setting Improved animations\n\n Minor changes to career mode UI and gameplay jank Lack of noticeable visual upgrades Rigid new tactics system Frustrating AI player behaviour\n\nRating (out of 10): 6\n\nEA Sports FC 25 released September 27 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X and Nintendo Switch.\n\nPricing starts at Rs. 3,999 for the Standard Edition on Steam and Epic Games Store for PC, and Rs. 4,499 on PlayStation Store for PS5 and PS4, and Microsoft Store for Xbox Series S/X and Xbox One.",
