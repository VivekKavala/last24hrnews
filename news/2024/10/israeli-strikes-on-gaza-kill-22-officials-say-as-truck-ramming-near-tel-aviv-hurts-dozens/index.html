                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>TEL AVIV (Israel ): Israeli strikes on northern Gaza have killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Sunday, as the Israeli offensive in the hard-hit and isolated north entered a third week and aid groups described a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Israel said it targeted militants.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In a separate development, a truck rammed into a bus stop near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, wounding 35 people, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The circumstances were not immediately clear, but Palestinians have carried out dozens of vehicle-ramming attacks over the years.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Iran's supreme leader, meanwhile, said Israeli strikes on the country over the weekend “should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,” while stopping short of calling for retaliation, suggesting Iran is carefully weighing its response to the attack.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> On Saturday, Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>" The exchanges of fire have raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which include Hamas and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion earlier this month after nearly a year of lower-level conflict.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Apparent attack near Tel Aviv MDA released footage of a large truck with a mostly empty bed that appeared to have slammed into a bus.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In addition to being near the Mossad headquarters, the bus stop is also close to a central highway junction, and the incident came as Israelis were returning to work after a weeklong holiday.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Asi Aharoni, an Israeli police spokesperson, told Israeli public broadcaster Kan that the “attacker was neutralized,” indicating police were treating the incident as an attack.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Aharoni said a truck had slammed into a bus and individuals waiting at the stop, and that there were wounded people stuck under the vehicle.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> MDA Director Eli Bin said six of the wounded were in serious condition.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Tensions have soared since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, as Israel has carried out regular military raids into the occupied West Bank that have left hundreds dead.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Most appear to have been militants killed during shootouts with Israeli forces, but Palestinians taking part in violent protests and civilian bystanders have also been killed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Red Cross describes ‘horrific circumstances’ in northern Gaza The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said that 11 women and two children were among the 22 killed in the strikes late Saturday on several homes and buildings in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It said a further 15 people were wounded and that the death toll could rise.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on militants in a structure in Beit Lahiya and took steps to avoid harming civilians.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It disputed what it said were “numbers published by the media,” without elaborating or providing evidence for its own account.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Israel has been waging a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza since Oct.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Israel says its strikes on Gaza only target militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in densely populated areas.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.</p>
