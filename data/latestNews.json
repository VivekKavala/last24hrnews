        "title": "Secularism Held To Be Part Of Basic Structure Of Constitution: SC On Preamble Petitions",
        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday said secularism had always been held to be part and parcel of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution.\nA bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar passed the remark while hearing a batch of petitions filed by former Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain and others, who have challenged the inclusion of words \u201dsocialist\u201d and \u201dsecular\u201d in the Preamble of the Constitution.\n\u201dThis court has in a number of judgments held that secularism was always part of the basic structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and the word \u2019fraternity\u2019 used in the Constitution, there is a clear indication that secularism has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,\u201d the bench said.\nThe words \u201dsocialist\u2019 and \u201dsecular\u201d were inserted into the Preamble of the Constitution under the 42nd Constitutional amendment moved by the Indira Gandhi government in 1976.\nThe amendment changed the description of India in the Preamble from a \u201dsovereign, democratic republic\u201d to a \u201dsovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\u201d.\nDuring the hearing, Jain submitted that Dr B R Ambedkar had opined that the inclusion of the word \u201dsocialism\u201d would curtail personal liberty. He added that preamble cannot be amended through amendments.\nJustice Khanna said there were different meanings of socialism and one \u201dshould not take the meaning adopted in Western countries\u201d.\n\u201dSocialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of the country should be distributed equally,\u201d the bench said.\nAdvocate Ashwini Upadhyay, who too had filed a petition, said he was neither against the words \u201dsocialist, secular and integrity\u201d nor their insertion in the Constitution but against the insertion of these words into the Preamble in 1976 and that too with a retrospective effect from November 26, 1949.\nHe said adding a word did not have any real effect in the country but opened a pandora\u2019s box for the future governments, who can play with it and may remove a word from the Preamble.\nSwamy, on other hand, submitted the Preamble was a declaration made on November 26, 1949, and therefore adding further words to it, through a subsequent amendment, was arbitrary.\nHe said it was wrong to depict that as per the present Preamble, the Indian people agreed on November 26, 1949, to make India a socialist and secular republic. The bench said it would examine the matter and posted it for further hearing on November 18.\nOn February 9, the top court had questioned whether the Preamble of the Constitution could be amended while keeping the date of adoption, November 26, 1949 intact.\n\u201dFor the academic purpose, can a Preamble that has the date mentioned, be changed without altering the date of adoption. Otherwise, yes the Preamble can be amended. There is no problem with that,\u201d Justice Datta had remarked.\nJain said that the Preamble of the Constitution of India comes with a specific date, therefore, it cannot be amended without a discussion.\nSwamy said the 42nd Amendment Act was passed during the emergency (1975-77).\nOn September 2, 2022, the top court had tagged Swamy\u2019s plea with other pending matter \u2014 filed by one Balram Singh and others \u2014 for hearing.\nBoth Swamy and Singh has sought deletion of \u201dsocialist\u201d and \u201dsecular\u201d from the Preamble.\nSwamy in his plea has contended that Preamble cannot be altered, varied, or repealed.\nHe said the Preamble not only indicated the essential features of the Constitution but also the fundamental conditions based on which it was adopted to create a unified integrated community.",

        "text": "It was on October 21, 2023, that the first passenger service on the priority section of the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (Delhi-Meerut RRTS) began. On Monday, India\u2019s first RRTS service completed one year of operations and in the last 365 days, it has served more than 40 lakh passengers. This is the first-of-its-kind train service in India connecting Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut.\n\u201c.. Since the launch on October 21, 2023, Namo Bharat trains have significantly transformed commuting across Ghaziabad, Sahibabad, and the surrounding regions, successfully serving over 40 lakh passengers in their first year of operations. Ghaziabad RRTS Station registered the highest footfall over the past year, followed closely by Sahibabad and Modinagar North RRTS Stations,\u201d an official statement from National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) reads.\nThe 17-km priority section connected Sahibabad to Duhai Depot with stations at Ghaziabad, Guldhar, and Duhai on the way. \nIn March 2024, the service was extended on additional 17 kilometres up to Modinagar. It connected Murad Nagar, Modinagar South, and Modinagar North.\nIn August, the service entered Meerut with the starting of the Meerut South station. \nEarlier this month, a trial run for the service in Delhi also started to connect New Ashok Nagar and Anand Vihar RRTS station with the already operational Sahibabad station. \nOn Monday, to mark the one-year anniversary, minister of housing and urban affairs and minister of power Manohar Lal Khattar took a ride on the service and visited key stations along the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor. He boarded the Namo Bharat train from Sahibabad station \u2014 the first operational station from Delhi side. \nThe minister also visited the under-construction Anand Vihar RRTS station. With its proximity to two Metro lines, a railway station, and two inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi and Kaushambi, Uttar Pradesh, Anand Vihar is set to become one of the region\u2019s busiest transit hubs. The station\u2019s multimodal connectivity facilitates smooth transitions between various modes of transportation, enhancing convenience and accessibility for daily commuters and creating a comprehensive network of networks.\nCurrently, Namo Bharat services operate on a 42-kilometer stretch covering nine stations \u2014 Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai, Duhai Depot, Muradnagar, Modi Nagar South, Modi Nagar North, and Meerut South. The corridor will soon extend to 54 kilometres with the addition of the Sahibabad to New Ashok Nagar section, which includes key stations of Anand Vihar and New Ashok Nagar.\nHigh-speed connectivity between suburban areas\nRRTS is the first-of-its-kind train service in India. These are not metro trains and are also not regular railway services. While it offers comfort like a metro train, it has the reach of the railways. \nThe service distinguishes itself from other modes of transport by providing high-speed connectivity between suburban areas, significantly reducing commuting times for longer distances. \nThis system is especially effective in addressing the challenges posed by urban expansion into new regions, such as the National Capital Region (NCR). \nBy enabling travellers to cover greater distances in a shorter time frame, RRTS enhances accessibility and convenience, making it an ideal solution for commuters navigating the growing urban landscape.\nOnce the entire 82-kilometer corridor is completed by June 2025, passengers will be able to travel from Delhi to Meerut in under an hour, revolutionising regional connectivity and enhancing the overall commuter experience.",

        "text": "In Madhya Pradesh, a significant debate has emerged regarding the use of loudspeakers in temples, ignited by a recent social media post from IAS officer Shailbala Martin. The 2009-batch officer, currently serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department, raised pertinent questions that garnered widespread attention.\nWho Is Shailbala Martin?\nShailbala Martin, originally from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, was born on April 9, 1965. According to the state government website, she began her career in the State Civil Service (SCS) before being promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) on June 12, 2017. With a BA and an MA in Arts from Holkar Science College in Indore, Martin joined the State Civil Service in 2009.\nThroughout her career, Martin has held various positions, including roles in the Health Department in 2014, Municipal Commissioner of Burhanpur in 2019, and Collector of Niwari district the same year. Since January 25, 2022, she has been serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department.\nThe Loudspeaker Controversy\nThe recent controversy can be traced back to guidelines issued by the state government last year to mitigate noise pollution, which specifically aimed to regulate loudspeakers in religious venues. A journalist on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) questioned the disparity in enforcement, focusing on the use of loudspeakers in mosques and the prevalence of DJs playing music outside these spaces.\nIn response, Martin highlighted the noise pollution caused by loudspeakers in temples, questioning why such disturbances, which can be heard several streets away and continue late into the night, are often overlooked. Her tweet sparked a mix of reactions, with some users supporting her stance while others criticised her for raising the issue.",

        "text": "The time, date, and venue of Sunday\u2019s blast at a CRPF school in Rohini\u2019s Prashant Vihar area was selected to cause minimum damage, top intelligence sources have told CNN-News18 even as agencies look for clues to understand the motive behind the incident.\n\u201cPost-facto claims have become the norm and we are verifying those. There were no clues available from the spot and analysis is going on,\u201d they said.\nThe sources added: \u201cThe place is insignificant in terms of being picked as a target for a bomb blast. This is a busy area in terms of car parking and residential locality but the logistics ensured that no damage occurred. What is most surprising is that no bomb blast material is available and neither was any device found. In this case, it becomes a crude bomb.\u201d\nCrude bomb is used in Bengal and other parts of India, sources said, adding that they had never been used in the national capital.\n\u201cThe CCTV footage examination is crucial. There is no clue in CCTVs so far as no one is seen going closer to the spot where the blast took place.\u201d\nOn Monday, Delhi Police said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to the blast. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform.\nThe purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents. The claim was made by Justice League India using a clip of the blast with a \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d watermark at the bottom, and circulated on social media platforms.\nThe blast, which destroyed a portion of the school wall, window panes of nearby shops, and damaged a few cars parked nearby, was captured in a CCTV camera. Police suspect that the bomb might have been placed late at night as local residents said it went off between 7.35 am and 7.40 am.\nThe sound of the blast was heard several hundred metres away. Videos from the spot showed thick plumes rising from the site. Residents called the explosion \u201cintense\u201d and reported a foul smell in the area.\nPolice have filed a case under sections of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on charges of \u201cmischief through explosion\u201d and under the Explosives Act.",
