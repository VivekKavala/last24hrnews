                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Epilepsy can attack someone when there is damage or changes in the brain.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In the human brain, there are neurons or nerve cells that are part of the nervous system.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Each nerve cell communicates with each other using electrical impulses.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In cases of epilepsy, seizures occur when these electrical impulses are produced excessively, causing uncontrolled behavior or body movements.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In fact, epilepsy can happen to anyone.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This disease can affect people of all ages and all genders.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> According to WHO, around 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological diseases in the world.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Symptoms of Epilepsy Recurrent seizures are the main symptom of epilepsy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The characteristics of the seizures will vary and depend on which part of the brain is first affected and how far the damage has progressed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Types of epileptic seizures are divided into two based on the disturbance in the brain, namely: 1.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Symptoms can include jerking limbs, or tingling sensations, dizziness, and flashes of light.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The part of the body that experiences seizures depends on which part of the brain is affected.</p>
