                                </h1>

                                
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>It has been a year since actor Kiran Abbavaram has had a film release.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> KA, the Telugu thriller releasing on October 31 in Telugu and a week later in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada, has demanded all his attention.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “We have attempted something new.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I was very taken in by an important point that directors Sujith and Sandeep intended to convey through their story, written in a thriller format,” he says, speaking for this interview in between promotional activities in Hyderabad.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kiran exudes confidence but admits to a tinge of nervousness as the release day draws closer.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In KA, set in the 1970s in a fictional village named Krishnagiri, Kiran plays Vasudev, a postman, but there is more to his seemingly-innocent character.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He says, “So far I have never portrayed a part with shades of grey.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This has been a new learning.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” 

Trekking into the forests

KA was filmed in the vicinity of forest areas; the crew scouted for locations that would be apt for a fictional village surrounded by hills, where light fades by 3pm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “Around 60% of the film takes place in darkness.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> We had heard of a village in Telangana where it gets dark around 4.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>30pm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For this film we wanted an earlier time,” he says, adding that the dialect in KA is not specific to any region in Telangana or Andhra Pradesh.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Kiran brightens up while discussing the filming process in the forest zones.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The crew would walk for nearly a kilometre, carrying cameras, lights and other equipment, to reach the shooting spots in the jungles near Thirthahalli and Agumbe in Karnataka.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “This region is home to several snakes, so we had medical kits handy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Once we got used to the location, we had a good time; it was beautiful to be one with Nature.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Some portions were filmed in Muchintal and Vikarabad in Telangana; eight sets were constructed at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad, pertaining to the village areas, and one set with a few interior portions was constructed at Sarathi Studios, Ameerpet.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Kiran hails from a village in Rayachoti in Andhra Pradesh and recalls how he had no exposure to urban lifestyle until he completed Class X.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “That childhood experience helped me get in sync with this film easily.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It was like going back in time.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” 

The USP of KA, Kiran explains, is its unpredictability.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “I listen to a number of narrations and read scripts, so when Sujith and Sandeep began narrating this story, I thought I had figured it out in the first few minutes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The story took me by surprise at each turn and I was shocked after listening to the climax.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I hope the audiences find it equally interesting.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The period setting will give people something new and immersive.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” 

In the past, Kiran has also been a co-writer for his films such as SR Kalyanamandapam and Nenu Meeku Baaga Kavalsinavaadini.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In the case of KA, he was content being only an actor.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He cites the production design (by Sudheer) and sound (mixing by Aravind Menon) as assets to the film.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

KA also features extensive sequences with animals.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kiran mentions how a street dog from Kurnool was trained for six months and became a favourite with the unit members.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The same is the case with the bulls in the climax.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “We ensured that all precautions were taken for animal safety.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” 

Time for reflection

Through the conversation, Kiran repeatedly mentions his debut film Raja Vaaru Rani Gaaruand SR Kalyanamandapam as being received well by the audience and how he hopes for a repeat of the same with KA, which was pitched to him in January 2022.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In 2022 and 2023, he had a bunch of releases of which only Vinaro Bhagyamu Vishnu Katha stood out; the other films came in for criticism and did not fare well at the box office.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Looking back, Kiran says there were times when he could sense that a film was not shaping up well, but he had to fulfil his commitment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “I also think maybe I should have discussed it better with the respective directors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> While working on KA, I have reflected on my choices and the need to be more careful.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Next, he has a film with Saregama, which is foraying into Telugu film production, and two other films are in pre-production stages.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>.</p>
