Aisa laga ke yeh kya hua? (The wound was deep, but I couldn\u2019t believe it had happened. I was thinking, \u2018What just happened?\u2019).\"According to the Indian Express, Govinda recounted the shocking incident, which took place early in the morning, around 4:45-5:00 a.m., while he was preparing to leave for a show in Kolkata.

It is like fire when you become successful, and you have to tread carefully,\" he stated. While he acknowledges the love and support from many, he also recognizes the presence of competition and jealousy. However, he urged that no misconceptions or misunderstandings should arise from the incident, and it should not be linked to anyone or anything else.\"I would like to say that this incident should not be attached to anyone or anything.

In a recent interview, Ananya revealed that she gets her \u201cnazar\u201d taken out every week to ward off negativity. \u201cI take out my nazar every week. The help at my house does the mirchi thing. You know the Mirchi thing? So, if it smells a lot, it means you have nazar. If the mirchi burns a lot, you have nazar. I don't know the science behind it,\u201d Ananya said in a video shared on Netflix India's YouTube channel. The actress also mentioned that her mother, Bhavana Panday, often puts \u201ckaala teeka\u201d behind her ear to shield her from the evil eye. She said, \u201cMy mom put two black dots behind my ear before I came here. Everyone thinks I don't shower or have something dirty behind my ear, but my mom keeps putting it again and again.\u201d(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Last month, Netflix dropped the trailer for CTRL. The story follows Ananya Panday's character Nella and her seemingly perfect life. She stumbles onto Control Your Life, an AI-based program. Her life changes after logging into the app. Nella's relationship with her boyfriend Joe (Vihaan Samat) comes to an end after he cheats on her but everyone blames her. In resentment, Nella says to CTRL, \u201cI just want to erase my ex.\u201d While Nella wants to take away her suffering, the app has different ideas. Soon after, Joe's presence in the real world starts fading along with his social media blueprint. After a phone conversation, Nella learns that Joe has gone missing. \"But isn't that what you wanted?\" an AI-generated character asks Nella in the last few seconds of the trailer.Sharing her thoughts on playing Nella, Ananya Panday said in a statement, \u201cMy character Nella is like any of us. She's caught up in a world dominated by technology and social media. CTRL explores how we navigate the fine line between our online presence and who we are in real life. Working with Vikram sir and Nikhil sir has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait for you to watch it on Netflix and uncover the connection between Nella and Allen,\u201d reported News18.

        "text": "The media is buzzing with tales of a whopping Rs 50 crore heist from a retired IAS officer\u2019s high residence in the tranquil hills of Uttarakhand. What\u2019s drawing attention is not just the theft, but also the great question\u2014how did such a hefty sum of money get there in the first place? The babu, once a powerful figure in a nearby state government and still considered very close to the Chief Minister there, has now become the focus of suspicion on social media, where rumours are spreading quickly. What makes this case even more intriguing is the fact that no formal FIR has been lodged, despite the scale of the theft. Some media outlets have meanwhile received notices, we\u2019re hearing. Neither the authorities nor anyone associated with the officer appears prepared to speak out, adding to the mystery. A Lucknow-based daily broke the story, alleging ties to a powerful ex-bureaucrat but not naming any names. As expected, the story has since gone viral, with social media users spreading the word and speculating about the officer\u2019s identity. Many people question why the authorities are so tight-lipped. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the officer\u2019s wife was emotionally affected by the occurrence, adding another layer of personal drama to an already sensational case. What\u2019s really going on here? Some argue that this is yet another example of how certain public officials stash illicit wealth in cash to avoid detection by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Cash is harder to trace, making it a convenient way to fly under the radar of anti-corruption bodies. If the stolen money is found, experts warn that any attempt by the officer to reclaim it could trigger a new legal firestorm under the Prevention of Corruption Act. For now, the silence around the case only seems to intensify public curiosity. The lack of an official statement, whispers about who the officer might be, and the staggering amount of money involved have everyone waiting for more details to surface. The case may even impact the prevailing tensions between the Centre and the state chief minister. Watch this space for updates. Delhi DMs get more powers, ruffle feathers The Delhi government\u2019s recent move to form \u2018working groups\u2019 of District Magistrates (DMs) to assess and improve the functioning of various departments has raised eyebrows, especially among senior babus. These groups are tasked with reviewing departmental operations and submitting actionable recommendations by October 5. They\u2019ve also been empowered to hold meetings with concerned officials\u2014which is the tricky part. Many in the administration are questioning the practicality of junior DMs overseeing and advising more experienced senior officials. Some see this as an unusual situation, with younger IAS officers from recent batches being asked to recommend improvements to departments headed by officials with decades of experience. This bold move comes at a time of transition for Delhi, with newly appointed Chief Minister Atishi stepping into the shoes of Arvind Kejriwal. Known for her focus on education reforms, Atishi now faces the challenge of managing the city\u2019s broader governance issues. This initiative is likely part of her broader strategy to improve inter-departmental synergy and bring fresh perspectives to long-standing administrative processes. A senior official explained that this initiative aligns with Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena\u2019s vision of making DMs more active and dynamic. Take that with a pinch of salt! The order coincides with a renewed push for cohesion between Atishi, AAP ministers, and senior babus, aiming for better coordination across key departments like transport, health, and education. Whether this approach will foster the intended inter-departmental synergy or cause further friction remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly a shake-up in Delhi\u2019s administrative corridors. Why merging DIPAM and DPE makes sense The government is once again considering the merger of two important departments: the Department of Investment & Public Asset Management (DIPAM) and the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). Both play crucial roles in managing Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and if all goes according to plan, they could soon be working together under the Ministry of Finance. The idea behind the merger is to create more synergy and liquidity for the NDA government\u2019s ambitious investment projects, particularly as it prepares for major reforms aimed at boosting growth and employment. This proposal isn\u2019t entirely new. It was first floated during the NaMo 2.0 era but didn\u2019t materialize for various reasons. The project was revived again in the list of \u201c100 days programme\u201d conceived by the Modi sarkar before the May 2024 Lok Sabha polls. So why merge these two departments? DIPAM deals with investment and disinvestment in CPSUs, while DPE focuses on the management and performance of these enterprises. When a CPSU is up for closure or divestment, DIPAM initiates the process, and DPE handles the final closure. A merger could streamline this process and make things more efficient. It seems the government is banking on this move to bring much-needed agility to its public sector investment strategy ahead of 2024. By Dilip Cherian",

I want to spend the year doing 50 remarkable things, whether that\u2019s a particular hike I\u2019ve never done, or a place I\u2019ve never been, acts of kindness \u2014 I\u2019m gathering a little list,\" she told people.com.

One of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, Winslet feels women should be able to \"stand with pride\" and look back on the things that they have achieved in life without coming across as arrogant, reports femalefirst.co.uk. She said: \"The pride I feel is enormous in the things that I have been able to do. And to be able to say that I'm proud of myself matters, because I think that that's something else I hope to put out there \u2014 that women should be able to stand with pride and acknowledge that and not feel like they are bigging themselves up. \"It's a self-acceptance and an awareness of doing something that is challenging and that feels impactful and takes effort like you wouldn't believe.\" Last month, the actress spoke about the different standards set for male and female actors. According to deadline.com, Winslet\u2019s comments have included pushing back when a crew member advised her to suck in her stomach to hide her \u201cbelly rolls\u201d during a topless scene and subsequently dismissing her reaction being hailed as \u201cbravery.\u201d Winslet went on to speak on the topic in an interview during History Channel\u2019s \u201cHistory Talks\u201d at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on Saturday, \u201cI quite like making statements.

        "text": "Los Angeles: Hollywood star Anne Hathaway is set to return to the coming-of-age comedy franchise film Princess Diaries with its third instalment. The development on Princess Diaries 3 is moving at a brisk pace with Adele Lim signing on to direct, reports Variety. \"As a diehard fan of the original Princess Diaries, I'm beyond excited to be a part of bringing the third iteration of this beloved franchise to life,\" Lim said in a statement. \"We look forward to celebrating its core tenants of female power, joy and mentorship with audiences worldwide.\" As per Variety, the film is produced by Debra Martin Chase, who originated the film franchise starring Hathaway as Mia Thermopolis, the down-to-earth teen-turned-queen of the fictional kingdom of Genovia, and Julie Andrews as her regal grandmother. Hathaway will also produce under her Somewhere Pictures banner. Naia Cucukov, Lim's producing partner at 100 Tigers, will executive produce the film alongside Melissa Stack. Princess Diaries 3 has been in development since 2022 and, last year, Hathaway shared an update about the long-awaited movie's progress in an interview with V Magazine. \"We're in a good place,\" Hathaway teased. \"There's nothing to announce yet. But we're in a good place,\" she had said. Flora Greeson is writing the script. Plot details haven't been confirmed, but the threequel is expected to continue the story in 2001's The Princess Diaries and the 2004 sequel Royal Engagement rather than rebooting the series. Lim is best known for penning the mega-hit movie Crazy Rich Asians, which grossed $174 million domestically for Warner Bros.",

        "text": "Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL), a Central Public Sector Enterprise, has officially been classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) by the State Bank of India (SBI), the telecom firm confirmed in an exchange filing. The bank added that MTNL now owed a total of Rs 325.53 crore as of September 30. This declaration follows a similar downgrade by Punjab National Bank (PNB) on September 9 and other public sector banks.In a letter addressing MTNL, SBI wrote, \u201cYou have been enjoying credit facilities in the nature of a Term Loan from the bank, with the Term Loan Account Number 367266589**. The instalment and interest payments for this account became overdue as of June 30, 2024, due to non-payment. As 90 days have passed, the account is categorised as an NPA (sub-standard) effective September 28, 2024.\u201dAs of September 30, 2024, the total outstanding debt of MTNL to SBI stands at Rs 325.52 crore, with rs 281.62 crore classified as \u2018overdue\u2019. SBI has called for immediate payment of this overdue sum to regularise the account and cautioned that failure to comply would lead to the imposition of a penal interest rate on the outstanding balance.Following SBI\u2019s classification of MTNL as an NPA, other banks such as Union Bank of India and Bank of India have already categorised the company\u2019s debt in the same manner. It is anticipated that additional lenders, including Punjab & Sind Bank and UCO Bank, may soon follow suit.MTNL\u2019s mounting debtMTNL\u2019s financial situation has been deteriorating, with total debt reported at Rs 31,944.51 crore as of August 30, 2024. At the beginning of August, MTNL informed the stock exchanges that it had defaulted on bank loan payments worth Rs 422.05 crore. This includes payment of Rs 155.76 crore on debt raised from Union Bank of India, Rs 40.33 crore from Bank of India, Rs 40.01 crore from Punjab & Sind Bank, Rs 41.54 crore from Punjab National Bank, and Rs 4.04 crore from UCO Bank.ALSO READ: Union Bank freezes accounts of telecom firm MTNL over non-payment of duesSBI seeks details on MTNL\u2019s land monetisation planAdditionally, SBI is seeking details on MTNL\u2019s land monetisation plan, which had previously been submitted with detailed year-wise cash flows. The bank asked for the current status of this plan, especially concerning the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to develop a 13.88-acre land parcel on Pankha Road, New Delhi, for residential and commercial purposes. SBI specifically inquired whether the proceeds from this project would be used to repay outstanding loans.MTNL has identified 158 properties in prime locations across Mumbai and Delhi for outright sale, with an additional 137 vacant properties available for rent \u2013 103 in Mumbai and 34 in Delhi.SBI has cautioned that if MTNL fails to meet its payment obligations within the timeframe, the bank will have no choice but to initiate legal proceedings to recover the full loan amount along with interest, and may proceed with \u2018enforcement of securities\u2019 without further reference to MTNL..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Heritage Circles or Hoardings ?",
        "text": "This year\u2019s Dasara illumination is mediocre but the Circles are worse. Mysuru has turned into \u2018flexuru\u2019, thanks to the Government\u2019s decision to hand over key Circles to private players. What used to be iconic landmarks are now little more than giant hoardings. Interestingly, according to sources, most of these companies were not interested to take over the Circles as they did not have enough time to create aesthetic designs but agreed to sponsor so as to not \u2018upset\u2019 the administration. But here\u2019s the burning question: If the Government is intent on selling off our public spaces to the highest bidder, then why did they bother increasing the Dasara budget? And they did this while creatively sidestepping public tenders by invoking the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act. For those not in the know, the KTPP Act allows the Government to bypass open bidding when it claims it \u2018ran out of time.\u2019 How convenient. So, we\u2019re left wondering \u2014 was the whole Dasara preparation process conveniently delayed just to activate this loophole and handpick the \u2018right\u2019 contractors? Here\u2019s where it gets truly puzzling: The Dasara budget ballooned from Rs. 29 crore last year to Rs. 40 crore this year. That\u2019s a whopping Rs. 11 crore more, and yet, somehow, they still felt the need to hand over our beautiful Circles to private companies. Now, instead of historic monuments, we\u2019re greeted by enormous sponsor logos and political banners. The District Administration appears to have forgotten that Mysuru is not just any city; it is a heritage city, where even a traffic Circle has historical significance, whether in its name, its design, or its location, which is meant to reflect the unique character of the city. But now, under a barrage of gaudy lights, sponsor logos and political banners, these once-distinguished Circles are telling a different story \u2014 a story of administrative neglect, lack of imagination, and unbridled greed. It is truly disheartening that the first impression tourists arriving from Bengaluru by road receive is no longer one of beauty or history, but of consumer products and political personalities. This unregulated give-away of public spaces without the establishment of any proper guidelines has led to what can only be described as a visual assault. Seeking sponsorship to improve public spaces isn\u2019t inherently a bad idea. Done right, it can be a win-win situation \u2014 enhancing the city\u2019s beauty while also attracting investment. But the way it\u2019s been executed here is anything but right. To begin with, the administration did not give sponsors enough time to plan and design their campaign. Next, if public spaces like Circles or medians are to be leased to sponsors, there must be clear and enforceable ground rules, which we don\u2019t have. Other countries have stringent design approval committees for such purposes, often comprising experts from renowned advertising agencies or design institutions. Why can\u2019t Mysuru do the same? We could have a \u2018Dasara Public Space Design\u2019 Approval Committee which MUST comprise people from reputed design firms and schools such as the National Institute of Design or Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. Such a Committee would ensure that sponsors adhere to basic aesthetic principles, like limiting the sponsor\u2019s logo to no more than 20 percent of the space and ensuring that the advertisement blends harmoniously with the theme of Dasara and surrounding architecture. Additionally, it could enforce rules that protect the physical structure of these heritage sites, ensuring that nothing is permanently damaged. What we have now, however, is a chaotic free-for-all, where anyone with a banner can turn our historical Circles into personal billboards. For years now, the city\u2019s once-pristine Circles have been turned into medieval town squares, plastered with garish posters announcing everything from elections to festivals to, morbidly, even deaths. But MCC does nothing to stop this vandalism. Way back in 2006, the MCC proposed to declare K.R. Circle, Five-Lights Circle, Ramaswamy Circle etc., as \u2018hoarding-free\u2019 zones and ban commercial hoardings within 100 metres of heritage sites. What happened? Nothing. In 2009, MCC started an \u2018illegal hoarding drive\u2019, what happened? Nothing. In 2011, MCC Commissioner K.S. Raikar made a grand announcement: \u201cWe held discussions with the City Police Commissioner and cases will be filed against those violating the MCC directive on flex boards.\u201d What happened? Nothing. Earlier this year, in 2024 the MCC Commissioner said that they have issued notices and asked the Zonal Commissioners to clear out the flex\u2026 what happened? Nothing. Today, flex posters not only remain all around heritage Circles and buildings, but they have also now become part of the structure and with that part of Dasara too! What a sad reflection of incompetence, of a District Administration, of a Royal Heritage City, one that hosts a world-famous festival! Unless the MCC really flexes its muscles against flex, our city will become \u2018Flex City\u2019 and unless they make rules for sponsors of Circles during Dasara, then Historic Circles will end up as \u2018Billboards.\u2019 At this rate of callousness, myopic vision and greed, Mysore Palace may be the next big Dasara hoarding with sponsors\u2019 logo adorning the Palace domes. We are doomed. e-mail: [email protected]",

        "text": "RFK Jr's wife actor Cheryl Hines is reportedly embarrassed by the barrage of cheating scandals against her husband including the episode of reporter Olivia Nuzzi. PEOPLE reported that things are rocky between Cheryl Hines and Kennedy Jr and they have barely spoken. 'She's embarrassed because he got caught,\" a source told PEOPLE. Hines has been in Europe since shortly after the news broke.Olivia Nuzzi was placed on leave after she acknowledged that her relationship with Kennedy Jr (she didn't name him) turned personal. Kennedy camp vehemently rejected it and asserted that he only met Nuzzi once during the interview last year. But the two camps did not let things be. Kennedy camp claimed Olivia Nuzzi bombarded him with her nudes while Nuzzi camp claimed Kennedy Jr grabbed her arm during the interview in a very creepy way. Nuzzi accused her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza of playing a role in leaking the allegations and Lizza denied those. In a court filing, Nuzzi said Lizza explicitly threatened to make public personal information about her to destroy her life, career and reputation. Amid this controversy, three more women claimed that they have been romantically involved with Kennedy Jr over the past year. According to reports, these three women came in contact with Kennedy Jr through Children's Health Defense -- the advocacy group founded by Kennedy. \u201cThere are a number of women in the \u2018health freedom\u2019 movement who thought of themselves as Bobby\u2019s only one, and I\u2019m quite sure they are angry and shocked to find out they weren\u2019t,\u201d a source told Mediaite. \u201cAfter talking to some of these women, I think what he does is just love bombs them. He makes them feel important, even tells them he loves them, and so they all feel special and wanted.\u201dKennedy's spokesperson did not comment on the fresh allegations. As Kennedy is facing storms one after another, Hines has been in Europe attending several shows during Milan Fashion Week. But there are rumors that Hines is seething in anger and contemplating divorce from Kennedy Jr who is the most prominent aide of Donald Trump -- this election season.",

        "title": "The frustrated pursuit of happiness",
        "text": "Pain and disappointment writ large in his face, Sunil, 40, sat down to narrate his story at a lodge on Anna Salai in Chennai. Hailing from Malappuram, he began driving an autorickshaw at his hometown after completing Class X. Since he was struggling to make ends meet, and inspired by tales of people from his district going abroad, he began dreaming of a better life in a foreign country. He was directed to an agent at Palavakkam in Chennai. In the very first meeting, the agent claimed that he had successfully sent many abroad for jobs, and Sunil was quickly convinced. He paid \u20b940,000 to him in processing fees for a job in Israel. However, thereafter, there was no progress at all for months. Sunil met the agent frequently to push his case. Every time, the agent collected more money, and altogether Sunil ended up paying \u20b97 lakh, which he mopped up by mortgaging his house, pledging his wife\u2019s jewellery, and borrowing from relatives. The agent claimed he had tied up with a tour operator in Israel for sending 46 men and women en masse as tourists. Tickets for onward and return journeys and hotel rooms were booked in their names. The plan was that they would travel like tourists and on reaching a famous church in Jerusalem, would disappear amid the crowd. Later, they would stay in the houses of relatives or friends who had already settled down as migrant workers and seek jobs. A plan fraught with danger and rejection, but Sunil went ahead because he was desperate to \u201cgo abroad\u201d. However, the visa was rejected. Neither could he leave Chennai nor was his money repaid. The agent advised him to stay back and wait for another opportunity, promising this time a job in Canada. He demanded a further \u20b98 lakh, and Sunil coughed it up too, borrowing from every one he knew. Forged ID cards On May 1, the agent sent Sunil forged ID cards and documents identifying him as a senior scientist in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) attending a conference of scientists in Canada. This time the visa came through, but as Sunil tried to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the authorities came to know that there was no such conference happening and stopped him. \u201cMy dreams are gone. I had to come back and begged the agent to return the money. Instead of returning the money, he threatened me. I am staying at a cheap lodge for five months now, and I\u2019ve been starving. If I go back home, all the people who lent me money will be at my door. So I am hiding in Chennai. My aged father is down with a terminal illness and my wife is unable to bear this life any more.\u201d Later, investigation revealed that his agent was running an office as a registered bus travel operator. His modus operandi was the same: sending people abroad with forged documents and ID cards as scientists from prestigious research institutions. But Sunil is far from alone in his predicament. The police say there has been a huge increase in the number of overseas job-seekers being cheated by unscrupulous recruitment agents. Once Gulf countries were the most sought-after, but the pattern of migration by unskilled and semi-skilled aspirants indicates that eastern European nations, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, Lithuania and Armenia, are popular. South Korea, Israel, and Canada have also come into the picture. Recently, it came to light that job-seekers from several districts, especially from South India, were recruited through illegal manpower agencies and sent to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar on tourist visas. Victims are then held captive in Cambodia or Laos for work in harsh and restrictive conditions. They are forced to commit online cyber frauds, which is known as \u201ccyber slavery\u201d. These agents do not have a licence from the Ministry of External Affairs, which is mandatory to be involved in any recruitment for work abroad. Typically, they target job-seekers through advertisements posted on social media platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. In 2023, G. Mohan, an engineer from Erode, saw an advertisement on Facebook. Out of curiosity, he clicked the link and entered all details sought. Immediately, he received a call from an agent offering a job in Canada and even permanent residentship. They first collected \u20b950,000 for processing papers, and subsequently, he had to pay \u20b94.5 lakh. Later, they called him, informing there was some delay in getting a visa owing to the India-Canada diplomatic row. \u201cThey asked me to go to any European country and work for some time there. It would be easier to migrate to Canada then. They told me that they would arrange a visa from the Slovakian embassy. Days went by, but there was no progress towards travelling to any country or obtaining a visa. They said they would get a visa for another country and demanded more money. The money I paid has still not been returned,\u201d he recounted. The police later discovered that Akil, 25, of Ernakulam, and S. Veeraragavan, 29, of Tindivanam, also had similar experiences. Irrespective of whom they approached, the police found that some traits were similar. Tutoring the applicants These unregistered agents run their illegal operation from outlets such as browsing centres, tea shops, or petty shops, while some of them have swanky offices, creating the impression of a travel agency. They also tutored applicants on how to approach visa officers in embassies, besides supplying forged documents to them. They even tutored them on how to seek asylum in a foreign country, if they managed to get there. Many of those who were cheated did not file complaints because they were hoping to get their money back. Then how could the police zero in on this racket? Only if the forgery was detected at the processing stage. In September, last year, Mohammed Irfan Khan of Andhra Pradesh appeared with documents before the visa processing staff in the U.S. Consulate in Chennai and claimed that he was a medical professional and wanted a visa to attend a medical expo. All his documents were found to be fake. In November, Rusheekesh Reddy and Dhivakar Reddy of Andhra Pradesh were caught when they produced fake documents for visa processing for Kallem Sai Ram Reddy. Following this trail, the police found out that all fake certificates were generated at a centre at Villivakkam in Chennai, run by Mohammed Riyas and Mageshwaran since 2019. Thirumurthy, 30, of Thanjavur, was one of the victims rescued by Indian authorities recently. He recounted, \u201cWe paid \u20b94.5 lakh to the middleman who arranged this job for a salary of $2,000 a month. Eight of us were taken to Sihanoukville, Cambodia, by road from Bangkok. Our passports were collected by them. Only after landing at the workplace did we realise that it was a scam. We were detained in wire-fenced buildings. When we refused to do their bidding, they would beat us up and even give electric shocks.\u201d He adds, \u201cOur phone and WhatsApp conversations were scrutinised by them constantly. At last, we managed to send a mail to family members. With the help of a native lawyer, we sought the assistance of the Indian High Commission, and were rescued.\u201d R. Viswanathan, vice-president of the Tamil Association in Cambodia, said that based on a series of complaints from the affected persons, the Indian authorities, with the help of local officials, rescued the workers, and were trying to put an end to the illegal recruitment and confinement camps. Recently, the CB-CID registered nine cases and arrested 10 illegal recruitment agents. Similarly, the Greater Chennai Police, along with the Emigration Department, raided 10 locations, registered nine cases, and arrested five persons who operated without licence. The Emigration Department has also identified certain districts as hotspots where people try to go abroad through illegal means. These include Tiruchi, Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Sivaganga, Madurai, Tiruvannamalai, Perambalur, and Thiruvarur. \u2018File complaints\u2019 Greater Chennai Police Commissioner A. Arun has advised people to be wary of fake advertisements of foreign employment. Anyone who has been cheated by unauthorised companies should file a complaint, he has said. Surender, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Job Racket Wing, says no individual or agency can recruit Indian citizens for overseas employment without a valid licence. \u201cHowever, job aspirants get connected to the agents under the radar. We are working on 60 cases of job rackets.\u201d The Emigration Department advises those seeking jobs overseas to engage only with licensed agents. Licensed agents are required to maintain a bank guarantee with the government, and their operations are monitored and regulated by the offices of Protector of Emigrants (PoE). These agents undergo stringent inspections and document verification before they are licensed. A valid job offer comes along with an employment contract duly signed by the foreign employer, recruitment agent, and the worker. The contract must mention the terms and conditions of the job and the salary and other emoluments. Valid offers must allow the worker to emigrate on the strength of employment or work visa or other similar visas, not on a tourist visa. As per the Emigration Act, 1983, no recruiting agent shall collect from the prospective emigrant service charges of more than \u20b930,000 plus GST (18%) for services, excluding airfare and other charges. A receipt has to be issued. M. Rajkumar, Protector of Emigrants, Chennai, says, \u201cWe have 200-odd licensed agents registered with us. People can see the list of licensed agents on www.emigrate.gov.in and check whether their agents are licensed or not. We have also opened a column called job opportunities as of now for ECR (Emigration Clearance Required) countries. Wherever the licensed agents conduct the interviews, it will be posted here.\u201d He adds that aspirants would be safe when they go through licensed agents. \u201cWhen ECR passport-holders go to ECR countries, we verify everything for them and give them emigration clearance.\u201d Job-seekers can dial the PoE helpline 9042149222 for more information.",

        "text": "As Prince Harry is on a solo trip and rumors of Harry-Meghan divorce are rife, it has now come to be reported that Harry did not spend the night of his 40th birthday with Meghan though he was in the US at that time. While many reports call it the \"latest blow to their marriage\", their friends claim that it was actually a gift from Meghan and the couple are not separating -- they are professionally choosing different paths. Meghan was last seen before Harry's birthday. The Duchess of Sussex reportedly booked the trip for Harry so that he could spend the night of his 40th birthday doing a hike on the Montecito peak -- which is part of the Cold Spring Trail in California. It is near Harry-Meghan's mansion.Soon after Harry's birthday, he started his solo tour which has now been extended by a few days and Harry has scheduled some secret meetings. Reports claimed Harry and Meghan have been staying apart and Harry was found moping around by himself at a local cafe. It was when reports of his longing to be back to the Royal Family emerged. It was reported that Harry was feeling homesick as Meghan was busy with her Hollywood and entrepreneurial projects. Sources close to the couple who emphasize that they are not splitting claimed that the phase of Harry moping is over and now he has immersed himself in work according to his liking. Meghan was supposed to accompany him on his tour to New York but she was unwell. From New York, Harry flew to the UK and it was obvious that Meghan would not accompany him there. From UK, Harry went to Africa for a charity event but now Harry has extended his solo trip. Harry was initially scheduled to be back in California this weekend, UK Express reported. But he has chosen to prolong his solo trip. The Duke will likely head to Johannesburg and Cape Town for \"private time\" with family and friends. Another secret visit is also planned but it has been kept out of his official diary, the report said.",

        "title": "Hamas confirms Yahya Sinwar\u2019s death",
        "text": "Jerusalem: Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar , was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza, and the militant group reiterated its stance that hostages taken from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. \u201cThose prisoners will not return to you before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza,\u201d said Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar's Qatar-based deputy and headed up the grou's delegation during several rounds of cease-fire negotiations mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. In a statement, Hamas heralded Sinwar as a hero who \u201cascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.\u201d The statement appeared to refer to a video the Israeli military circulated of Sinwar\u2019s apparent last moments in which a man sits on a chair in severely damaged building, badly wounded and covered in dust. In the video, the man raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli drone. Sinwar\u2019s killing, in what appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, could shift the dynamics of the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas war began. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran , which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be him, half-buried in rubble and with a gaping wound in his head. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that \u201cour war is not yet ended.\u201d But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar\u2019s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar\u2019s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. \u201cWe are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,\u201d Ronen Neutra, father of the Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra, said in a video statement. \u201cSinwar, who was described as a major obstacle to a deal, is no longer alive.\" Netanyahu was planning to convene a special meeting Friday to discuss hostage negotiations, an Israeli official with knowledge of the negotiations said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the their former enemy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. \u201cWhen U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield \u2014 in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy \u2014 the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.\u201d More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza erupted in October last year, issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. Hezbollah's statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel\u2019s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it would activate an additional reserve brigade to the north of its country to support troops battling in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to \u201cplans prepared in advance\u201d to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced...",

        "title": "Sakshi Malik\u2019s memoir \u2018Witness\u2019: The wrestler sees an unsparing image of herself in her own mirror",
        "text": "\u201cIt is indisputable,\u201d reads a line in the autobiography of an Indian cricket icon co-written by a journalist, \u201cthat my parents were very supportive.\u201d\n\nThere is a reason (auto)biographies of Indian sportspersons are almost uniformly inane \u2013 a reason explained by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and memoirist JR Moehringer in a May 2023 piece in The New Yorker.\n\nMoehringer, whose own coming-of-age story The Tender Bar ranks as a classic of the memoirist\u2019s art, and who has co-written the bestselling autobiographies of tennis legend Andre Agassi, Nike founder Phil Knight, and England\u2019s estranged Prince Harry, recounts a conversation he had with the latter during a pre-writing session that did not end well.\n\nA story, carved from a life\n\nAfter a long discussion with Harry, Moehringer refused the offer to co-write the book. Why? \u201cBecause, I told him, everything you just said is about you. You want the world to know that you did a good job, that you were smart. But, strange as it may seem, a memoir isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s not even the story of your life. It\u2019s a story carved from your life, a particular series of events chosen because they have the greatest resonance for the widest range of people\u2026\u201d\n\nThe art of memoir, encapsulated in six words: A story, carved from a life.\n\nThat is the problem with autobiographies of Indian sportspersons \u2013 they tend, more often than not, to be a highlights reel of their careers as they lived it \u2013 or, often, as they want you to think they lived it. What you get is a one-dimensional portrait \u2013 scorecards and career graphs rendered in prose and wallpapered with a litany of clich\u00e9s; what you don\u2019t get is insight into the living, breathing human being behind those accomplishments; the stories carved from their lives.\n\nThere are exceptions. A Shot At History by Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, co-authored by Rohit Brijnath, is one; the more recent I Have The Streets by India\u2019s ace off-spinner R Ashwin, written with Sidharth Monga, is another. To that sparse canon add Witness, the autobiography of champion wrestler Sakshi Malik co-written with veteran sports journalist Jonathan Selvaraj.\n\nWhen the book hits the shelves, the large-type headlines and the buzz in the social media echo chamber will be about Malik\u2019s first up-close experience of sexual harassment and her ongoing battle to bring BJP politician and former Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to book for the serial sexual abuses he is accused of. And that will be a pity, because there is so much more to Malik\u2019s story as both a champion wrestler and an insurgent fighting injustice.\n\nThe battle against Brij Bhushan and his backers in politics \u2013 and, by extension, against the strong arm of the police force \u2013 bookends the story of Malik as an insecure girl from a small village in Haryana; her early, occasionally risible forays into various sports; her discovery of wrestling as the career she always wanted and never knew it till her wandering footsteps led her to the mat.\n\nThe book is hung on the tick-tock timeline of her life and times, both in the ring and out of it, and it is a story of stark contrasts. There is the self-assured sportsperson juxtaposed with the awkward, unsure woman in the throes of a first, and lasting, love. She is the ace wrestler, proud of the painfully acquired strength of thighs and biceps, but also the woman who hates how those same biceps look when she is forced to wear high fashion. She is the gawky village girl who leans heavily on parental support and encouragement in a rigidly patriarchal environment that frowns on women \u201cdisplaying\u201d themselves in skimpy sports costumes but equally, the mature woman battling the realisation that the love of even the most supportive of parents can be subsumed by the lure of the money their accomplished daughter brings in\u2026\n\nSakshi Malik, the person\n\nMalik\u2019s story is layered; it lends what we know of her life a larger frame and a deeper context. Through the pages of Witness, a Sakshi Malik emerges who is no longer just a champion wrestler, or a leader in an ongoing battle against a political strongman and accused sexual abuser \u2013 she is a human being in the true sense of the word, with all the fears and uncertainties, the faults and the foibles that being human entails.\n\nAnd it is all down to a clear-eyed awareness of her own self, abetted by honesty as unsparing of herself as it is of everyone in her orbit. Thus, if she is open about her parents\u2019 unconditional love turning into unbridled greed as the money begins to pour in, or about the politicking of farmer leader Naresh Tikait who insinuated himself into the wrestlers\u2019 protests for his own ends, or about her disenchantment with what she sees as the self-interest of her comrades-in-arms Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, she is equally forthright about her own early forays into petty theft and, more startlingly, about her deepest insecurities.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Moehringer said in an interview where he discussed the art of the memoir, \u201cin order to tell the truth, you simply cannot avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings. It goes down easier if you are equally unsparing of yourself.\u201d\n\nParts of Witness will hurt. Parents, siblings, former opponents, and present comrades will all find reflections of themselves that they would far rather have hidden from the world \u2013 but there is no part of the book that cuts as deep, and is as unsparing, as the image Malik sees in her own mirror.\n\nIn an early chapter, she talks of the paralysing dread that envelops her before every bout, and about how she has \u201cnever enjoyed the actual act of confrontation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany wrestlers have a little bit of nervousness before their bout starts, which helps them get focused for the contest,\u201d Malik writes. \u201cI have come across contestants who tell me they are excited before a bout. They enjoy that feeling of getting into a fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that. I\u2019ve always been afraid, sometimes almost sick with worry.\u201d\n\nWho knew? As one accustomed to reading, and listening to, sportspersons natter on about \u201cembracing the challenge\u201d, \u201csoaking up the pressure\u201d and suchlike inanities, it came as a refreshing change to read an elite sportsperson \u2013 a practitioner of one of the most physically confrontational of all sports \u2013 talk with such openness about the crippling grip of fear that she had to confront, even before she confronted her opponent on the mat, right through her career.\n\nIf being honest \u2013 with oneself first, and then with the reader \u2013 is hard for sportspersons, it is equally difficult for them to talk in an accessible fashion about the nuances of their sport. And there is a reason for this: in her formative years, the sportsperson practices the mechanics of her sport for countless hours until it becomes part of muscle memory. In the heat of competition, she instinctively does what all that practice has prepared her for. Asking her to relieve a bout, to explain the mechanics of a takedown, is akin to asking a pilot how she flies a plane, or a writer how she organises her material and engages her reader.\n\nHere, again, Malik scores \u2013 a favourite section, one that I went back to after a first read-through of the entire book, is chapter ten where Malik delves into the arcana of \u201cweight cutting\u201d, a phrase that entered the public consciousness thanks to the fiasco of Vinesh Phogat failing, by 100 grams \u2013 one third the weight of an adult human heart \u2013 to qualify for the final of the 50kg wrestling competition in the Paris Olympics.\n\nElsewhere, there are illuminating details about the mechanics of various forms of takedowns, insights into how a wrestler reads and counters an opponent\u2019s strategy \u2013 a wealth of detail, told in accessible form, that made me go back to YouTube videos of her various bouts, including the Rio Olympics bronze medal match in the 58-kg category that made her India\u2019s first woman Olympic medallist in wrestling, with a new awareness and appreciation of the sport.\n\nWe consume sport in boxes \u2013 the playing field, the wrestling ring, the boundaries of our television screens. And yet the real story, unseen by us, lies outside these boundaries, in what ace sportswriter Gary Smith calls \u201cthe psyche of the sporting spirit.\u201d\n\nWriting an energising memoir\n\nThe likes of Andre Agassi, Phil Knight and Prince Harry needed a Moehringer to go outside those boxes, to delve into and unearth the stories hidden behind those medals, the fame, the public persona. Malik finds the ideal amanuensis in Jonathan Selvaraj, a veteran sportswriter who has spent decades covering those sports, including wrestling, that play out in the nearly impenetrable shadow cast by cricket.\n\nOn the evidence of this book, Selvaraj has mastered sprezzatura, the ability to conceal art. Selvaraj brings to the book the art and the craft of a skilled storyteller \u2013 a mastery of narrative arc and of pacing, the ability to focus on what is important, the minute attention to the telling detail. Rather than chisel and sand and buff and polish the story to death, Selvaraj helps Malik embrace the volatility, the insecurities, integral to the human condition.\n\nWhere Selvaraj really excels though is in his ability to step back and let Malik\u2019s natural voice, with which we have become familiar through the many press conferences and interviews she has given in the course of her battle against Brij Bhushan, shine through. It is Selvaraj who writes, but it is Malik we hear.\n\nMalik\u2019s lived experiences and refreshing honesty combine seamlessly with Selvaraj\u2019s self-effacing pen to produce a sports biography that is energising, and compellingly readable.\n\nWitness, Sakshi Malik with Jonathan Selvaraj, Juggernaut.",

The two cases, though separate, have brought attention to growing criminal activities in the region, prompting swift action from local law enforcement.\n\nThe first case involves a 52-year-old mushroom trader from Tanda Rajpur, Palampur. He lodged a complaint against four individuals\u2014two women and two men\u2014accusing them of extortion and blackmail. According to the victim, the incident began when he received a call from a woman in Ram Chowk, Palampur, asking to purchase mushrooms. Upon arriving at her house, he found two women inside. They gave him water, locked the door, and then engaged in obscene acts. Shortly after, two men entered the room, assaulted him, and forcibly filmed an obscene video.\n\nThe victim claimed the group demanded \u20b91.5 lakh, threatening to release the video if he didn\u2019t pay. Terrified, he approached the Palampur police station, where a formal case was registered. Station in-charge Bhupendra Singh Thakur confirmed that an investigation is underway, with the accused currently being tracked by the police.\n\nMeanwhile, in Manali, local police exposed a gang involved in prostitution-related fraud after receiving a complaint from Pradeep Bagati, a resident of Jharkhand. Bagati reported that he was tricked by a woman at the Manali bus stand, who promised him a room at a cheap rate. When he followed her to Aleu, she demanded \u20b92000 for engaging in sexual activity. As soon as he undressed, she took photographs and summoned her accomplices. A second woman and two men then entered, robbing him of \u20b95000 in cash, taking his ATM card, and withdrawing \u20b910,000.\n\nThe gang threatened Bagati, demanding an additional \u20b950,000 to ensure his release. Bagati managed to escape and alerted the Manali police. Acting swiftly, the police arrested the suspects and recovered 12 mobile phones, ATM cards, and cash. The arrested individuals were identified as Vishal from Shimla, Deepak from Chandigarh, and two women from Kullu and Manimajra.\n\nManali police station in-charge Manish Sharma stated that this gang had been operating for over two years, targeting unsuspecting individuals. The gang\u2019s network is now under further investigation, with more arrests likely.\n\nThese two cases underline the growing concern over extortion and organized fraud in Himachal Pradesh, as police intensify efforts to combat such criminal activities.",

        "text": "Vedang Raina and Alia Bhatt's Jigra was released in theatres on October 11. Recently, the actor spoke about the emotionally charged whiplashing scene. The actor who was appreciated for his performance, said, \"The lashing scene was tricky, but Vasan Bala sir gave me some really great advice right before the scene, which made my approach clearer. It was still very hard to put my mind through that. I'm happy that there was appreciation for that scene.\"He also spoke about how transformative the entire Jigra experience has been for him. He said, \"Jigra changed my life way before it was even released. I'm just grateful I was part of this project and got to work alongside some really great minds. I feel blessed to be in this position so early in my career and at such a young age.\"Jigra faced competition from Vicky Aur Vidya Ki Woh Wala Video, starring Rajkummar Rao and Triptii Dimri, which opened with Rs 5 crore and had about 3,500 shows, giving it a slight edge over Alia's film. Notably, Jigra is Alia's only release for 2024. Directed by Vasan Bala, the movie narrates the story of a sister who will go to extreme lengths to protect her brother.On the work front, Vedang Raina made his acting debut with Zoya Akhtar's The Archies.

        "text": "Air pollution is back to haunt the national capital with the onset of winter and early morning and late-night fog. \nOn Saturday, Delhi\u2019s Anand Vihar reported PM 2.5 of 326 and PM 10 levels of 654, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to activate Stage 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan from October 15. GRAP includes measures to control dust, waste management, and ensure vehicular restrictions, with mist-spraying drones to monitor and tackle pollution hotspots.\nThe Delhi government on Monday also imposed a blanket ban on the sale and use of firecrackers till January 1, 2025, in view of the likely deterioration of air quality in the city during the winter.\nTo further understand the effects of the deteriorating air quality, LocalCircles conducted a survey which revealed that 36 per cent Delhi-NCR families have one or more members with sore throat, cough and breathing difficulty/asthma due to rising levels of pollution, while 27 per cent have someone with a runny nose/congestion.\nThe survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. A total of 61 per cent respondents were men while 39 per cent were women.\nThe survey also sought to know the steps Delhiites were taking or planning to take to combat the issue of air pollution. While only 18 per cent citizens of Delhi-NCR said they will use air purifiers to reduce the impact of pollution, a large majority said they would just live with it by increasing the intake of immunity foods and drinks. A total of 22 per cent respondents are planning to travel for some part of the next one month. It is also likely that many have planned travels for Diwali which also allows them to get away from peak pollution days in Delhi-NCR when AQI has touched 1000 in the past.\nYear after year for the last decade, AQI levels in the region have been touching 500-1000 between October 15 and December 1, causing devastating long-term impact on the health of residents and no concrete solutions have been implemented to address this at a structural, policy and enforcement level.\nEmissions from transportation account for approximately 19.2 per cent of Delhi\u2019s air pollution, according to the Centre\u2019s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management in Delhi.\nAnother major contributor to the worsening air quality is stubble burning in neighbouring states. Satellite data on Wednesday reported 99 fire incidents in Punjab, 14 in Haryana, 59 in Uttar Pradesh, and one in Delhi.\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered \u201cgood\u201d, 51 and 100 \u201csatisfactory\u201d, 101 and 200 \u201cmoderate\u201d, 201 and 300 \u201cpoor\u201d, 301 and 400 \u201cvery poor\u201d, and 401 and 500 \u201csevere\u201d.",

Eight were found alive on Wednesday after being reported missing after an avalanche on Sunday, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nAn avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, such as a hill or mountain. Avalanches can be triggered spontaneously, by factors such as increased precipitation or snowpack weakening, or by external means such as humans, other animals, and earthquakes.\n\nPrimarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches have the capability to capture and move ice, rocks, and trees.\n\nAvalanches occur in two general forms, or combinations of slab avalanches made of tightly packed snow, triggered by a collapse of an underlying weak snow layer, and loose snow avalanches made of looser snow.\n\nAfter being set off, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they capture more snow. If an avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air, forming a powder snow avalanche.\n\nThough they appear to share similarities, avalanches are distinct from slush flows, mudslides, rock slides, and serac collapses. They are also different from large-scale movements of ice.\n\nAvalanches can happen in any mountain range that has an enduring snowpack. They are most frequent in winter or spring but may occur at any time of the year. In mountainous areas, avalanches are among the most serious natural hazards to life and property, so great efforts are made in avalanche control.",

        "text": "When Prince Harry and Meghan shifted to California leaving their royal duties, they were not very welcome there. Four years down the line, their Montecito neighbors are not very happy about the royals settling at their place. A similar situation is brewing for Harry and Meghan as they are purchasing a house in Comporta, Portugal. The residents are expressing frustration that the coastline is now becoming exclusive to wealthy property owners. UK Express reported that restricting access to public beaches was illegal in Portugal until recently but new regulations now allow local councils and government agencies to designate certain beaches as \"private\". \"Worst thing to happen to the Portuguese coast, typical greed situation. Taking land and property from locals who have been enjoying it for years,\" one wrote. \"I am very upset by this massive piece of Portuguese land destroyed for the rich, removed from the average local that had been creating memories in this place for generations and generations,\" another said. \"I have been going to this place for years, camped there several times and, because of this company, this is no longer possible,\" another said. Reports said Harry and Meghan chose Portugal to be close to Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank who own a home at the Costa Terra Gold and Ocean Club in Melides. Harry and Meghan will not be shifting out of the US and their Portuguese resort will be more like a holiday home for them. Reports said the resort is on a picturesque and unexplored beach in the Algarve and has become a popular holiday destination. Once completed, the resort is set to have 300 homes, with prices starting at a whopping \u00a33.6million.The news has put speculations over Harry-Meghan divorce to sleep following their individual engagements. When Harry was on his solo trip to UK and then South Africa, Meghan made solo appearances back home triggering speculations that they are already living separately though their friends said they are only separating their professional paths and their relationship is rock-solid.",

The British monarch arrived in Sydney late on Friday evening for their 9-day Australia tour.Later, Charles will address the New South Wales state parliament and visit the Admiralty House for a series of private meetings with top officials.Royal watchers will have another opportunity to see the king on Monday when he arrives in Canberra with Queen Camilla for the busiest portion of his streamlined schedule.In the past, visiting British royals would undertake extended tours, drawing large crowds of excited, flag-waving supporters. However, due to the king's fragile health, much of the usual pomp and grandeur has been scaled back this time.Aside from a community barbecue in Sydney and an event at the city's iconic opera house, large public gatherings will be limited.On Sunday, a small group of protesters gathered near a church, calling for Australia to \"decolonise.\"While Australians are slightly in favour of maintaining the monarchy, the enthusiasm is far from what it was in 2011 when thousands turned out to see Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, wave to the crowds.",

        "text": "After a disaster like \u2018Jigra\u2019 featuring Alia Bhatt, some Telugu distributors are wary about distributing another Bollywood actress film in the two Telugu states. \u201cWomen centric movies are not fetching even bare minimums openings and it would be difficult for Kangana to release her film \u2018Emergency\u2019 without much fuss,\u201d says a distributor. \u201cProbably, she has to tour Hyderabad and promote her political thriller by hosting big events, only then it could create some buzz in trade circles,\" he adds. Earlier, Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut's much-anticipated film \u2018Emergency\u2019 has cleared a significant hurdle as it recently received certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The film, which portrays the controversial political period of the 1975 Emergency in India, has been under scrutiny for its depiction of historical events and figures, particularly former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who is portrayed by Ranaut. Of course, Bollywood teams are reportedly in discussions with Telugu distributors but no agreements have been finalized for the film to hit theaters. \u201cKangana's recent films \"Chandramukhi 2\" and \"Dhakkad,\" had underperformed in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In all likelihood \"Emergency\" would be released on a commission basis. In which, the film would release in theatres. Then all the collections are garnered and given back to makers, after deducting theatre rentals and 8 to 10% commission,\u201d he informs. He believes the film would attract more viewers in Telangana, particularly in the Nizam region, compared to Andhra Pradesh, where Hindi films generally receive less patronage.",

Earlier, comedy kings like Brahmanandam, M S Narayana, and Vennela Kishore managed to draw more applause than heroes in some of their movies. Now, it is the turn of young comedian Satya to make his presence felt in his latest release 'Mathu Vadalara 2'. \"No doubt, Satya stole the show with his comic one-liners and unique mannerisms and has become the flavor of the season,\" adds the source. He claims that Satya would be roped in by other producers since few distributors are insisting for his comedy and few ongoing films could have his comedy track to cash in on his popularity. \"He will be doing comedy in another big star movie and discussions are underway, \" he adds. He also claims that probably by now, few producers would have reached him to cast him as a \u2018hero\u2019 in the films since the laugh-riot has set cash registers ringing in two Telugu states. \u201cHe may soon turn a protagonist and is surely grabbing plum comic roles too,\u201d he concludes.",

        "text": "Riddhima Kapoor recently made her on-screen debut on the Netflix show Fabulous Lives Vs Bollywood Wives after staying away from the camera for years. While promoting the show, she appeared in an interview with YouTuber Siddharth Kanan, where she opened up about a deeply personal chapter in her life after Rishi Kapoor's death. She revealed how each member in the family dealt with it in their own way and never showed their emotions to each other. Reminiscing about that dark phase in their lives Riddhima said, \"When my dad passed away we never showed emotions to each other. We used to go to separate rooms and cry like take it all out and then come and then just be normal or act normal, but it has got us really close.\" Ridhhima further added that even though her family does not express their grief, but \"deep down\" they always carry the pain in their hearts. Earlier in another interview, Riddhima had also shared that ever since Rishi Kapoor's death, Ranbir, she and their mother also look after each other more than before. Rishi Kapoor was diagnosed with leukaemia and spent a lot of time in New York for his treatment. He came back to India in 2019. The veteran actor died on April 30, 2020.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Coming back to Riddhima's work front, both Ranbir and Neetu Kapoor showed her their support on her first on-screen stint. Ranbir also hyped his sister up and forewarned the other members of the cast to not take her lightly. \"Riddhima, beyond the politeness and you know, the softness, she's a fighter. So the OG wives and the new wives, they're definitely in for a shock. Because I would tell them don't take Riddhima lightly,\" he said.He also showered love and praises on her, and showed her his unwavering. \"I don't tell her this often, but Riddhima, I love you deeply. You are somebody I look up to. Even when you were not doing a show like this, I was always rooting for you. And I'm gonna root more for you,\" he concluded.&nbsp",

The streets buzzed with excitement as women prepared for this special day dedicated to the well-being and long life of their husbands. Various organisations and local communities came together to organise programmes and gatherings for the cultural celebrations. Women dressed in vibrant, traditional attire were the centre of attraction of the festival. Their hands were adorned with intricate mehndi designs, symbolising love and devotion.\n\nFrom dawn, the women observed a day-long fast, refraining from food and water. This fast is a key ritual of Karva Chauth and is kept until the moon appears in the night sky. The day began with Sargi, a pre-dawn meal given by mothers-in-law to their daughters-in-law, symbolising the bond between them. As the day progressed, groups of women gathered in homes or community centres, sharing stories and songs related to the significance of the festival. They passed the Karva (a clay pot) around in a circle, singing traditional songs of marital bliss.\n\nKarwa Chauth Moon Rise Timings In MP: Moon Will Be First Seen In Bhopal Followed By Indore; Check...\n\nIn the evening, as twilight fell, the anticipation grew. Women sat in beautifully decorated spaces, their thalis prepared with diya, rice and sweets, waiting for the moon to rise. Once the moon appeared, they gathered on rooftops or terraces, gazing at it through a sieve, symbolising the filtering of negativity. They then offered water to the moon, seeking its blessings before breaking their fast by sipping water and eating a sweet from their husband's hands. Throughout the city, the sounds of laughter, music and blessings filled the air, as families gathered to celebrate the bond of love and the strength of relationships, making the night of Karva Chauth a truly magical and heart-warming experience.\n\nOne unique programme took place in the Pashupatinath Porwal Social Group. They celebrated the Karva Chauth festival at The Meera Garden, Rajiv Gandhi Square, Indore. Over 250 people participated in the event and passed a message to observe No Car Day once a week. The males of the group were seen holding placards and they also took a pledge to keep the environment safe.\n\nMaharashtra: NCP-Ajit Pawar Faction Appoints Ashish Damle As Chairman Of New Brahmin Economic Development Body\n\nMumbai: Doctor Dupes Colleague Of \u20b934.97 Lakh In Medical Camp Scam\n\nMumbai: Peon Arrested For Sexually Assaulting Minor At School Premises\n\nMaharashtra: ACB Files 26 Disproportionate Assets Cases Involving \u20b929 Crore\n\nFollow us on",

Snakes have flexible jaws, which are not rigidly attached like in many other animals. This flexibility allows them to stretch their jaws wide open to accommodate prey much larger than their head. In the case of an egg, the snake carefully manoeuvres it into its mouth and gradually swallows it whole. Once inside, special muscles in the snake's bodywork to break the egg's shell, after which the contents are digested, and the shell is later regurgitated. This incredible ability showcases the snake's evolutionary adaptations for survival.''\n\nAnother said, ''That's a remarkable sight!

The cast, Bhavana Pandey, Maheep Kapoor, Neelam Kothari Soni, Seema Kiran Sajdeh, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, Shalini Passi, and Kalyani Saha Chawla recently came on The Great Indian Kapil Show to promote their show, and shared funny anecdotes with Kapil. Bhavana Pandey shared a particularly hilarious incident that happened during a Karwa Chauth function at Anil Kapoor's house, which left everyone in splits. Recalling the event, she said, \"We go to Sunita Kapoor's house, Anil Kapoor's wife. So all of us go there and break the fast together. We have to go to the terrace to see the moon. So all of us go together. So we got the channi (strainer) and placed the diyas there. I told Chunky to hold his position because we were waiting to eat.\" Bhavana then complained how Chunky Pandey's old habits landed her in an awkward situation. \"Chunky has this old habit. I prepared everything and the moment I turned around he was gone. I don't know whether he got a call or something else happened, and the channi landed straight on the face of Boney Kapoor! I instantly turned around and yelled, 'Chunky, where are you?' He came back and took his position. Then I did the ritual properly,\" she concluded. This made everyone burst into laughter, leading Kapil to a witty comeback. He joked that Boney Kapoor must have been wondering why Sridevi (his late wife) looked so different that day.

        "text": "Seema Sajdeh confirmed her new relationship on the third season of Fabulous Lives Vs Bollywood Wives with ex-fiance Vikram Ahuja. While the internet is buzzing with congratulatory messages, her son Nirvaan Khan had a mature response to it. On the last episode of the show, Seema spoke to Nirvaan about moving on in life after her much-talked about divorce from actor Sohail Khan and also the new man in her life, who she is currently dating. She also asked him if he held any grudges against her. \"Everyone is talking about me moving out because I have moved on in my life. Do you have a grudge on me for moving on in my life?\" she asked. In the last episode of the show, Seema moved back to Bandra after Nirvaan insisted her to. \"No, absolutely not. Mumma, at some point, you will move on. At some point, you will need a companion or a partner or something or the other and that's acceptable,\" Nirvaan reassured her. Seema also asked him next if he approved of Vikram. Nirvaan asked, \"Is he older than you?\" to which Seema replied, \"Yeah, a year older to me.\" This got Nirvaan's nod of approval for his mom's relationship. \"Yeah, then that's fine. I am okay with him. If you are happy, we are happy for you. How long will you be in that stressful environment? It's stressful for me, you, and Yohan. Be happier.\"Seema got candid about Vikram on the show and shared how she feels about him. \"He knows me like no one else. If anybody knows us in town, they all know the story of Seema and Vikram,\" she said. Adding some trivia about her relationship, Seema added, \"Vikram is the one that I was engaged to before I met Sohail, and here we are. Life comes full circle.\" &nbsp",
