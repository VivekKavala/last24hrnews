                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>What is a Cleft Lip?

The cleft lip and cleft palate are openings or splits that occur in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth, or both.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This condition occurs when the facial structures that develop in a baby in the womb do not close completely.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In addition, this condition is one of the most common birth defects.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This disorder most often occurs as an isolated birth defect but is also associated with many inherited genetic conditions or syndromes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Symptoms of Cleft Lip

Usually, a cleft lip or palate can be noticed as soon as the baby is born.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition can appear in the form of:

A split in the lip and roof of the mouth that affects one or both sides of the face.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
A split in the lip that is only visible as a small indentation in the lip, or extends from the lip through the upper gum and palate to the bottom of the nose.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The presence of a cleft in the roof of the mouth that does not affect the appearance of the face

Less commonly, a cleft occurs only in the muscles of the soft palate (submucous cleft palate), which is at the back of the mouth and is covered by the lining of the mouth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This type of cleft is often not noticed at birth and may not be diagnosed until later when symptoms appear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The symptoms of submucous cleft palate include:

Difficulty feeding.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Difficulty swallowing with the potential for liquid or food to come out of the nose.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Chronic ear infection

Causes of Cleft Lip

This condition occurs when the tissues in a baby’s face and mouth do not fuse together properly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Normally, the tissues that form the lips and palate fuse together in the second and third months of pregnancy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, in babies with this condition, fusion does not occur or occurs only partially, forming a gap.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Experts believe that most cases of cleft lip and palate occur due to interactions between genetic and environmental factors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, no one knows for sure the exact cause of this abnormality in babies.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The mother or father can inherit the gene that causes this condition, either alone or as part of a genetic syndrome that includes cleft lip or cleft palate as one of its symptoms.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In some cases, babies inherit genes that make them more likely to develop a cleft along with other environmental factors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Cleft Lip Risk Factors

Several factors can increase the chances of a baby having this birth defect, including:

Family health history.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> People who have this condition are at risk of passing it on to their offspring.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Exposure to certain substances during pregnancy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition is more likely to occur in pregnant women who smoke, drink alcohol, or take certain medications.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Having diabetes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Women who are diagnosed with diabetes before pregnancy are at higher risk of having a baby with the condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Obesity during pregnancy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Babies born to obese mothers may have an increased risk of cleft lip and palate.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Male babies are more likely to have this condition with or without a cleft palate.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, cleft palate without cleft lip is more common in women.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Cleft Lip Diagnosis

Most cases of cleft lip and palate are immediately recognized by doctors at birth and do not require special tests for diagnosis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, over time these abnormalities can be seen on ultrasound before the baby is born.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This is why routinely checking your pregnancy with an ultrasound is an important thing to do.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

You can detect this condition with an ultrasound, which you can start around the 13th week of pregnancy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

As the fetus continues to develop, it may become easier to accurately diagnose these birth defects.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If a prenatal ultrasound shows a rupture, the doctor may offer a procedure to take a sample of amniotic fluid from the uterus or amniocentesis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This test may show that the fetus has inherited a genetic syndrome that results in other birth defects.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Cleft Lip Treatment

The goal of treatment is to improve the child’s ability to eat, speak, and hear normally and to have a normal facial appearance.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Treatment for children with this condition often involves many doctors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Starting from plastic surgeons, oral surgeons, ENT doctors, pediatricians, pediatric dentists, to speech therapists, and genetic counselors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Treatment involves surgical procedures to correct abnormalities and therapy to help manage other conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

For more optimal and appropriate treatment according to the conditions experienced, you can contact a doctor.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Surgery to repair a cleft lip and palate will be based on the child’s overall condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

After initial improvement, the doctor may recommend further surgery.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The goal is to improve speaking ability or improve the appearance of the lips and nose,

The operations will usually be carried out in the following order:

Lip repair — in the first 3 to 6 months of age.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Cleft palate repair — at 12 months of age or earlier if possible.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Follow-up operations — between age 2 and the late teenage years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In the first stage of surgery, the doctor will make incisions on both sides of the gap and fold the tissue which is then stitched to join it together.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The second stage of surgery will be performed on the cleft palate, aiming to close the gap, repair the palate, prevent fluid buildup in the middle ear, and assist the development of teeth and facial bones.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In the second stage of surgery, the doctor will make incisions on both sides of the cleft, reposition the tissues and muscles of the palate, and then stitch them together.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Surgery for cleft palate can be performed when the baby is between 6 and 18 months old.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Advanced surgery for cleft palate can be performed when the child is 8 to 12 years old.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Well, this surgery involves bone grafting to strengthen the upper jaw structure and support speech articulation.</p>

For children with cleft lips who also have ear problems, the doctor will perform a third operation in the form of installing ear tubes, which can be done when the baby is 6 months old.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The purpose of this operation is to prevent fluid buildup in the middle ear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Additional surgery to improve the appearance of the mouth, lips, and nose will be performed as the child reaches adolescence and adulthood.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

After all stages of surgery are complete, the doctor will carry out monitoring and follow-up care until the child is 21 years old or until growth stops.</p>

Cleft Lip Prevention

After having a baby with a cleft lip or palate, it is natural for parents to feel concerned about the possibility of having another child with the same condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Although many cases of cleft lip and palate cannot be prevented.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Consider these steps to better understand the condition and lower your risk:

Consider genetic counseling.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If you have a family history of cleft lip and palate, tell your doctor before you decide to become pregnant.</p>
