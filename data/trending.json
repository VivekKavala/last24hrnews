It is scheduled to release on Diwali 2025. The film marks a departure for the universe by incorporating a love story element. It also stars Rashmika Mandanna, Paresh Rawal, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.\r\n\r\nAditya Sarpotdar directs from a screenplay by Niren Bhatt, Suresh Mathew, and Arun Fulara, with Dinesh Vijan and Amar Kaushik producing.\r\n\r\nThe actor emphasised the unique positioning of \u201cThama\u201d within the horror-comedy universe.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact that \u2018Thama\u2019 is the first love story of the horror comedy universe is all the more exciting,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe promise of it being a \u2018bloody\u2019 love story is also a supremely unique and a compelling pitch for today\u2019s audience who want clutter-breaking theatrical experiences. \u2018Thama\u2019 is that project, a total wildcard, a film that no one has seen in India. I\u2019m really pumped to join the sets of this film and create a huge big screen experience with Dinesh and his entire team of fellow visionaries like Amar Kaushik, my director Aditya Sarpotdar and the writing genius Niren Bhatt.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe actor is thrilled to be part of this universe\u2019s legacy as it moves forward and also feels responsible to give audiences a theatrical experience that they will remember for years to come.\r\n\r\nKhurrana, who previously collaborated with Vijan on \u201cBala,\u201d sees \u201cThama\u201d as another opportunity for innovation.\r\n\r\n\u201cDinesh and I have a similar passion for disruption. \u2018Thama\u2019 is our second collaboration and it is so new that I can\u2019t wait for the reaction of people when they see it in theaters next Diwali.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe manner in which Dinesh is crafting this universe\u2019s every beat is truly commendable and he deserves all the love and adulation that he is receiving. As a friend, collaborator and admirer of his work, I can only see this universe growing from strength to strength given the grand ideas of expansion that he has.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film follows Maddock\u2019s recent successes with \u201cStree 2\u201d and \u201cMunjya,\u201d further cementing the production house\u2019s reputation for blending horror and comedy elements.\r\n\r\nFor the actor, this represents an addition to his diverse filmography, reports variety.com.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thama\u2019 is a project of a lifetime for me and I know that I will give my heart and soul for people to hopefully shower it with unanimous love,\u201d he added.",

        "text": "New York: The famous election prognosticator, New York Times's 'Needle', was projecting an 84 per cent chance of a Donald Trump victory with about 295 electoral college votes based on its data at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday (9 a.m. Wednesday in India).\r\n\r\nThe 'Needle' swings as the data that comes in is analysed in real-time and makes the projection it considers valid at that time. A little before 10 p.m., it showed Trump at nearly 290 seats before swinging down five to 285 at 10 p.m. and rising 30 minutes later to 295.\r\n\r\nThe 'Needle' makes longer-range projections beyond those made by The Associated Press and networks like NBC and Fox News by combining the incoming polling trends with demographic and historical data.\r\n\r\nAt 10 p.m., the electoral college votes that have been called by the media were 198 for Trump to 112 for Kamala Harris. The New York Times was struggling with its computer systems because its union of technology workers was on strike over pay and working conditions.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper acknowledged the problem and wrote, \"Publishing the Needle live on election night relies on computer systems maintained by engineers across the company, including some who are currently on strike\u009d.\"\r\n\r\n\"How we display our election forecast will depend on those systems, as well as incoming data feeds, and we will only publish a live version of the 'Needle' if we are confident those systems are stable\u009d, it said.It is confident of the system's ability to handle the projections.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the election, the newspaper's poll had given Harris a 3 per cent lead over Trump. The RealClear Polling's aggregation had Trump with a 0.6 per cent lead, which is a virtual tie.",

        "text": "Mumbai: Actor Prabhas, whose movie 'Kalki 2898 AD' registered a solid success at the box-office, is moving up to the top of Maslow's hierarchy. The actor has launched The Script Craft, a platform dedicated to promoting and encouraging writers.\r\n\r\nThe initiative gives writers a platform where they can share their story ideas with a broad audience, showcase their creativity, and gain visibility. Writers can submit a 250-word synopsis of their story ideas. Audiences can then read and rate these submissions, with the highest-rated stories rising to the top.\r\n\r\nThe feedback system focuses on ratings rather than comments, creating a constructive environment that helps writers build confidence and receive positive support for their ideas.\r\n\r\nTo mark its launch, The Script Craft has introduced a special contest titled 'Imagine Your Favourite Hero with Superpowers.'\r\n\r\nWriters are invited to submit a maximum 3,500-word story reimagining a hero with superhuman abilities. The writer, selected based on audience engagement, will earn the opportunity to work as either an assistant writer or assistant director on a real project.\r\n\r\nIn addition, The Script Craft plans to expand with an audiobooks feature, allowing writers to turn their stories into immersive audio experiences.\r\n\r\nPrabhas's involvement in The Script Craft highlights his commitment to fostering a positive space for writers and encouraging unique storytelling.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the work front, Prabhas has a string of projects in the pipeline including 'The Raja Saab', 'Salaar: Part 2' 'Shouryanga Parvam' for which he is set to reunite with Prashanth Neel, 'Kalki 2', and an untitled project with Hanu Raghavpudi.",

        "text": "Nagpur, Nov 6 (IANS) Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, will begin his poll campaign for the Maharashtra Assembly elections on Wednesday in Nagpur, where he will attend a \u201cSamvidhan Sammelan\u201d (Conference on Constitution). \n\nLater in the day, Rahul Gandhi will attend a public meeting in Mumbai where the Maha Vikas Aghadi\u2019s (MVA) poll guarantees are expected to be announced.\n\nThe symbolism of choosing Nagpur is crucial as it is not just the headquarters of the RSS, the ideological parent of the BJP, but also the place where B.R. Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in 1956.\n\nNagpur is in the larger Vidarbha region which is of strategic importance in the battle for Maharashtra.\n\nOf the 76 constituencies where the BJP and the Congress are engaged in a direct contest, 36 are in Vidarbha, which is the state\u2019s cotton belt. Of all the regions in the state, the BJP has fielded the most in Vidarbha (47), and dealing it a blow here will go a long way in paving the way for the MVA\u2019s return to power in the state.\n\nVidarbha used to be a traditional Congress stronghold but the party lost its grip on it as the BJP won 44 of the 62 Assembly constituencies and the party was reduced to 10. Five years ago, the BJP\u2019s tally fell to 29 but the Congress\u2019s seat count rose to only 15. The party\u2019s performance in the Lok Sabha elections, in which it won four of the 10 parliamentary seats in the region, has also given it a reason to hope.\n\nThe INDIA alliance bagged seven Lok Sabha constituencies, with only three going to the MahaYuti.\n\nOne of the major reasons attributed to the Congress and the MVA\u2019s success was its campaign on the issues of the Constitution, reservation, and caste census. The Opposition had alleged that the BJP would pose a threat to the Constitution and the quota system if it returned to power with a bigger mandate than in 2019 when it won 303 seats overall. This resonated in Vidarbha, which has a vibrant and powerful Dalit movement and a sizable population of Other Backward Classes (OBCs).\n\nTwo of the Congress\u2019s top leaders, including its State party President Nana Patole, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar, are from Vidarbha. Apart from them, the party has several powerful second-rank leaders.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gandhi will visit the Deekshabhoomi, the site where Ambedkar converted to Buddhism, and then head to the Constitution conference organised by a non-political outfit called the OBC Yuva Manch.\n\n\u201cThe Maharashtra government was planning to introduce chapters of Manusmriti in the school curriculum. It is a bigger threat to Indian democracy. Safeguarding the Constitution, which has given rights to every Indian citizen, is our duty and the conference is organised for this aim,\u201d said Anil Jaihind, the organiser of the programme.\n\n\u201cIt is an apolitical event. Several organisations across the state are going to join it and the Model Code of Conduct will be observed,\u201d said Wadettiwar.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Gandhi, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, Shiv Sena (UBT) Chief Uddhav Thackeray, and Nationalist Congress Party (SP) President Sharad Pawar will address a \u201cSwabhiman Sabha\u201d in Mumbai. At the event, MVA\u2019s poll guarantees are expected to be announced.\n\nFarm loan waiver and caste census are likely to be among the major guarantees. The alliance could also announce a Universal Basic Income scheme to counter the Eknath Shinde government\u2019s Majhi Ladki Bahin scheme under which Rs 1,500 is deposited in the accounts of women below the poverty line.",

Namit Malhotra has been a key player in some of Hollywood's major productions, such as \"Dune\" and \"Inception\", along with recent releases like \"The Garfield Movie\". He also recently announced the upcoming \"Angry Birds 3.\"",

Soon after the woman levelled the allegations, 40-year-old Pauly denied the accusations, saying he had never seen nor spoken to the complainant.\r\n\r\nAfter two days, Pauly filed a complaint with the State Police Chief (SPC) seeking a probe into what he termed were \"baseless\" accusations.\r\n\r\nPauly said that he would fight it legally to prove his innocence. He said that he would fight the case not only for himself but also for people facing similar accusations by women.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, when the name of Pauly surfaced, it attracted a lot of traction as on August 19, the Justice Hema Committee report was made public and highlighted the pitiable conditions of women in the film industry including sexual exploitation.\r\n\r\nPauly, who has won two Kerala Film Awards, started as a software engineer before joining the film industry in 2010. He has worked in over 50 films, of which many were box-office hits.\r\n\r\nHe turned producer with 'Action Hero Biju' in 2016 under his banner Pauly Jr. Pictures, which turned out to be a super grosser.",

Preference will be given to students who are from government institutions and have opted for technical/ professional courses,\u201d according to a Cabinet note.\n\nAn outlay of Rs 3,600 crore has been made from 2024-25 to 2030-31, and seven lakh fresh students are expected to get the benefit of this interest subvention during the period. This is in addition to the full interest subvention already being offered to students with up to Rs 4.5 lakh annual family income.\n\nPM-Vidyalaxmi is another key initiative stemming from the National Education Policy, 2020, which had recommended that financial assistance should be made available to meritorious students through various measures in both public and private higher education institutions (HEIs).\n\nThe scheme will be applicable to the top quality higher educational institutions of the nation, as determined by the NIRF rankings \u2013 including all HEIs, government and private, that are ranked within the top 100 in NIRF in overall, category-specific and domain-specific rankings; state government HEIs ranked in 101-200 in NIRF, and all Central government governed institutions.\n\nThe Department of Higher Education will have a unified portal \u201cPM-Vidyalaxmi\u201d on which students will be able to apply for the education loan as well as interest subvention, through a simplified application process to be used by all banks. Payment of interest subvention will be made through E-vouchers and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) wallets.",

The intelligence agencies believe that the terror handlers sitting across the border in Pakistan have been frustrated due to people-participative and peaceful Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in J&K.\n\nOn November 2, a top commander of the LeT identified as Usman Bhai alias Chota Waleed of Pakistan was killed after a day-long gunfight in the old Srinagar city Khanyar area.\n\nTwo local policemen and two CRPF troopers were injured in the Khanyar gunfight.\n\nLast month, terrorists killed six workers of an infrastructure project company and a local doctor in the Gagangir area of Ganderbal district. The workers were building a tunnel from Gagangir to Sonamarg tourist resort to make the Srinagar-Sonamarg an all-weather road and generate economic growth and employment in the area.
