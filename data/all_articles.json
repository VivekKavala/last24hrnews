        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 21 (IANS) Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar says the Mahayuti-led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) remains unified with a clear and mutually-agreed seat sharing formula, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Congress, Shiv Sena(UBT) and NCP(SP) is facing internal squabbles over constituency allocation.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with IANS, Shelar claims that the Mahayuti government will come back to power after the elections. Here are some excerpts:\n\nIANS: Although the BJP has announced the first list, talks for seat sharing among the Mahayuti are not yet concluded. Is it due to differences? The MVA is also struggling to arrive at an understanding. What is your take?\n\nShelar: There is remarkable unity and discipline within the Mahayuti alliance. We have finalised our seat-sharing proportions and accordingly our list of candidates has also been declared. There is also clarity that the elections will be contested under the leadership of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. However, within the MVA, there is no consensus, no balanced seat-sharing arrangement and all their allied partners are embroiled in internal debates. Either before arriving at a consensus over seat sharing or immediately after the results, the MVA is sure to be in tatters after November 23. The MVA\u2019s expiry date is arriving soon.\n\nIANS: How confident are you about the Mahayuti forming the government once again in Maharashtra?\n\nShelar: Absolutely confident. Every election is different in terms of the prevailing issues, subjects, developments and the overall ecosystem. We, as the Mahayuti, are confident of winning the elections as we have only focussed on working for the development of the state. We have decided to go out to the people of Maharashtra with the list of development works and initiatives undertaken.\n\nIANS: Do you fear fake narratives will impact the results like during the Lok Sabha elections?\n\nShelar: Fake narratives were spread during the Lok Sabha elections which had impacted us. Today, once again, conspiracies to spread lies and fake narratives are being made. It is our job to stop the fake narrative and to speak in the interest of the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray alleged that 1,000-odd acres of land has been transferred in the name of Adani. I challenged him to give evidence to prove his statement. If Aaditya Thackeray has the courage, he should come forward for an open discussion and counter our questions. He is behaving like a spokesperson of urban Naxals and deliberately trying to spread lies, disturbance and unrest and create an image that there is anarchy in the state.\n\nIANS: You have been targeting the MVA over \u2018Vote Jihad\u2019. What is your comment?\n\nShelar: The MVA leaders are resorting to doing politics of appeasement. We have always believed in \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019. Our Hindutva also revolves around development of all elements of society. We believe in taking everybody together in our march of progress. Why should Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya get worried about it? The Mahayuti government is working towards ensuring homes for the poor in Dharavi. But they are making attempts to incite Dharavikars and spread fear in the minds of the poor Marathi, Muslim, Dalits making them believe that they will never get their rightful homes in Dharavi.\n\nIANS: What is the Mahayuti\u2019s agenda for the forthcoming Assembly elections?\n\nShelar: Our agenda is development. The Mahayuti government believes in delivering on its promises. The government launched the Coastal Road, the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg, the Mumbai-Delhi corridor, bullet train and much more. Through schemes like the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, the government started transferring money in the bank accounts of women, made ST travel free, deposited money in the bank accounts of senior citizens, and gave waivers to farmers over electricity bills. Today, the common citizen is concerned about the development of his city, state and the nation and we believe in favour of development.\n\n(Sanjay Jog can be reached at sanjay.j@ians.in)",

The clash led to the tragic death of Ram Gopal Mishra, a 22-year-old who succumbed to gunshot injuries.Following the incident, the area descended into chaos, with mobs engaging in widespread vandalism and arson, targeting homes, shops, showrooms, hospitals, and vehicles.Local authorities have responded by registering multiple FIRs against both unidentified rioters and some named individuals. As of now, the police have detained 55 suspects and increased security measures in the town, which has a mixed population.This marks the third major communal incident in Bahraich, following previous outbreaks in 2009 and 2014.In October 2009, violence erupted in the same area after rumors circulated about objectionable materials being thrown at a religious site, leading to arson and destruction. A similar incident occurred in January 2014, triggered by disputes over loud DJ music, which also affected the Nanpara area.",

        "text": "The Cyber Crime Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police has busted a six-member gang reportedly involved in running an online share trading scam and duping a person of \u20b914 crore. \n\nAdditional Director General of Police, Cyber Crime, Sandeep Mittal, said the online trading scam involved \u201cfraudulent individuals misleading victims into investing in fake share trading opportunities, promising high returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cCybercriminals, forming a group via WhatsApp, have created share investment apps, misleading people into believing they can earn up to 500 times their investment by trading shares online. They have circulated false information suggesting that many people are making significant profits through these apps, thereby cheating the public under the guise of online share trading,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\nThe police said the complainant in this case was contacted via WhatsApp by a member of the gang in April, introducing himself as someone who represented an institution called Black Rock Asset Management Business School. He falsely claimed that investing in Black Rock would yield a 500% profit within two months, while also stating that the company was SEBI-approved. \n\nThe man convinced the complainant to invest with a stipulation that he must pay a 20% service charge on the profits generated from the investment. The complainant was then persuaded to download a mobile app through a link and subsequently invested \u20b914 crore into various bank accounts, the police said. \n\nWhen the complainant realised that the invested money was not being returned, he filed a complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. Based on this, an FIR was registered at Cyber Crime Wing Headquarters, Chennai \u2013 SCCIC (State Cyber Crime Investigation Centre), and the police retrieved the money from 13 bank accounts. \n\nAfter analysing the call records and money trail, the special team of police arrested V. Subramanian, 39, from Chengalpattu, who is the first-layer beneficiary ICICI Bank account holder of the fraudulent transaction of \u20b921.5 lakh. \n\nBased on his confession, the other suspects were arrested. They are: M. Madan, 43, from Neelankarai, who owns a chit company in T. Nagar; R. Saravanapriyan, 34, from Thiruvallur, who is an associate producer in the film industry; Sathish Singh, 46, from Avadi, who is an associate of Saravanapriyan; Shafahed, 38, from Pulianthope, who owns a shop that converts currency; and D. Manikandan, 30, from Madurai, who previously worked at a cine producer\u2019s office in Chennai.\n\nAdditionally, two cryptocurrency wallet accounts were frozen. Action is being taken to arrest a gang based in north India that allegedly masterminded these cybercrimes and recover the defrauded money, said Mr. Mittal.",

Similar to earlier reports, the House findings do not pinpoint any specific individuals responsible for the failures.The preliminary findings are based on thousands of pages of documents, nearly twenty transcribed interviews with state and local officials, and a range of briefings\u2014both classified and unclassified\u2014from senior officials at the Secret Service and FBI.Meanwhile, the task force has initiated an investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump from last month, involving an individual with a rifle who was found camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.",

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chiefs Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will be present on the occasion, they said.Ahead of her nomination filing, Priyanka Gandhi met party chief Kharge here on Monday and took his blessings. On Wednesady, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will also lead a roadshow from Kalpetta New Bus Stand at 11 AM. The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.Priyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary byeelection. \"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.Congress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said. With the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.Soon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, the Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate from the seat in Kerala. With the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.Days after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.If elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.The EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies. The bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.Since her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.However, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.She emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year. After her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi had said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\"\"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both the constituencies.Priyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.",

This arrangement could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started back in May 2020 and moving towards peace.\n\n BREAKING: India, China agree on patrolling along LAC, leading to disengagement ahead of BRICS meet in Russia \n\n New Delhi: In a major development, India and China have agreed on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas of the Himalayas, informed Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday. This development has come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia to attend the crucial BRICS summit. The patrolling arrangement between both countries can lead to disengagement and could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started in May 2020.\n\nWhile addressing the media during a special MEA briefing, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that diplomatic and military officials from both countries were in talks with each other. \u201cOver the last few weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums and as a result of these discussions, an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border area, leading to disengagement and resolution,\u201d he stated. \nResponding to a media question on possible meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS in Russia, Misri stated that there are chances of a bilateral meeting between both the leaders. \n\u201cAs far as the question on the bilateral meetings is concerned, this is a multilateral event, though there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking over the overall program of the prime minister. There are a lot of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update on the bilaterals as they evolve,\u201d Misri stated. \nPM Modi, will attend the BRICS summit in Kazan this week. Starting from Tuesday, his short, two-day journey comes as a response to the invitation extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a recent statement on Friday, Denis Alipov, who represents Russia as its ambassador to India, teased the possibility of welcoming new entrants into the BRICS assembly. Such an addition could hugely amplify the group\u2019s capacity as an influential frontier, upholding the interests of the Global South. \nAt an online \u2018BRICS 2.0 meet: New Members, New Horizons\u2019, this comment was made looking forward to the soon-to-be-held BRICS convention in Kazan, next week. At the moment, the holding of BRICS\u2019 chair position is in Russia\u2019s hands. This significant alliance brings together the advanced developing economies of the world. Initially, the four original countries were Brazil, Russia, India, and China, hence the name BRIC. South Africa hopped on board in 2010, sparking the change to the currently known name, BRICS. \n(Note: This is a developing story and further details will be added.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "New Delhi:Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will file her nomination for the Wayanad Lok Sabha bypoll on Wednesday, party sources said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chiefs Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will be present on the occasion, they said. Ahead of her nomination filing, Priyanka Gandhi met party chief Kharge here on Monday and took his blessings. On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will also lead a roadshow from Kalpetta New Bus Stand at 11 AM. The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said. Priyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary byeelection. \"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said. Congress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said. With the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics. Soon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, the Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate from the seat in Kerala. With the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it. Days after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut. If elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together. The EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies. The bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23. Since her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli. However, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh. She emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year. After her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi had said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both the constituencies. Priyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.",

        "text": "The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Friday rejected the bail and anticipatory bail applications filed by suspended Janata Dal (S) leader Prajwal Revanna, who is accused of rape and sexual assault. The HC also dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking legal action against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged comments against former Hassan MP Prajwal during a Lok Sabha campaign speech in Karnataka earlier this year.\nThe All India Dalit Action Committee had filed the PIL, requesting the court to direct Gandhi to issue an unconditional apology to women for his statements, and disrespecting the Constitution. The petition claimed that Gandhi made the remarks on May 2 during election rallies in Shivamogga and Raichur, just prior to the polls on May 7, 2024.\nThe bench stated that the court must uphold a standard when determining whether a matter qualifies as a public interest issue, noting that not every grievance can be raised in court via a PIL. They acknowledged that Gandhi\u2019s remarks, while potentially controversial, do not meet the criteria for a PIL.\nIn dismissing the case, the court reiterated the importance of careful consideration regarding what constitutes a public interest issue, affirming its discretion in handling such petitions.\nAdditionally, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on the petitioner while dismissing the case.\nThe counsel representing the All India Dalit Action Committee argued that Gandhi\u2019s statements outraged the modesty of women and constituted fabricated accusations against Revanna. They contended that such speeches were damaging in a small town like Hassan, creating mistrust among households.\nThey sought the court to impose a token fine on Gandhi for the supposed misuse of his public position, breach of public trust, and violations of various legal provisions, including the Model Code of Conduct for the 2024 Parliamentary elections and the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\nDuring the hearing, the bench, consisting of Chief Justice N V Anjaria and Justice K V Aravind, indicated that the case did not qualify as a public interest litigation. The court stated, \u201cWe have not said anything on the merits; we are not saying anything on the merits of the speech. We have only said this cannot be the subject matter under public interest litigation,\u201d according to Live Law.",

        "text": "A budget of Rs 10 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Baoli Sahib temple in the Punjab province to address the long-standing demands of the Hindu community in Pakistan. This marks the first phase of reconstruction, 64 years after the temple was rendered dysfunctional.The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a federal body responsible for overseeing minority worship sites in Pakistan, has commenced work on restoring the Baoli Sahib temple, located in Zafarwal town in Narowal, a city along the western bank of the Ravi River. The temple has been out of service since 1960, according to Dawn News.Currently, there is no functional Hindu temple in the entire Narowal district, forcing the local Hindu population to either conduct religious ceremonies at home or travel to temples in Sialkot and Lahore. Ratan Lal Arya, the former president of the Pak Dharamsthan Committee, explained that the temple became non-functional after the ETPB took control of it. The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time. The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million. The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population resides in Sindh province, where they share cultural and linguistic ties with their Muslim neighbors.",

The forecast indicates that Trump has a 52% chance of winning the presidency, while Harris stands at 42%.Since late August, the model had consistently favored Harris, with her chances hovering around 54-56%, while Trump held about 44-46%. However, in early October, the gap began to close, and the candidates are now nearly even.This shift in the forecast aligns with Trump's improved polling averages in key battleground states like Wisconsin and Michigan, which had previously leaned toward Harris. Trump already had a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.Of the seven critical swing states in 2024, Pennsylvania is the only one where Harris still leads, according to The Hill report.The US presidential election will take place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, with early voting already underway in states like Georgia, California, North Carolina, Virginia, and Alabama. The elected candidate will begin their four-year term in the White House starting from the inauguration on January 20, 2025.",
        "summary": "Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate, leads Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast with a 52% chance to win the presidency. This shift reflects Trump's stronger polling in key battleground states, now narrowing Harris's earlier lead.",

        "text": "In a dramatic development, India and China have reached an agreement on \u201cpatrolling arrangements \u201d and a resolution of the military standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) , the government announced on Monday (October 21, 2024). The patrolling arrangement agreement extends beyond the areas along the LAC where there has already been a disengagement of military personnel over the past few years, and include the so far unresolved areas of Demchok and Depsang, sources told The Hindu, indicating that the India-China standoff since April 2020 is now expected to be resolved.\n\nWhile the MEA did not give further details of the agreement, and whether there would be a reversion to the status quo pre-2020, and whether the \u201cbuffer zones\u201d more recently created would continue to exist for patrolling purposes\u201d, Mr. Misri said that the two sides had \u201creached an agreement on the issues that were being discussed\u201d\n\nThe announcement, by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, came amidst a media briefing on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit on Tuesday which he will attend along with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cOver the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums, and as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the line of actual control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists adding that the two sides would now take the \u201cnext steps\u201d on this.\n\nThe timing of the India-China agreement announcement, just a day before the BRICS Summit indicates that a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi on the side-lines, that has been speculated about is now expected to take place. Although the two leaders met as many as 18 times prior to the Galwan clashes in June 2020 , where 20 Indian soldiers were killed, they have spoken only twice since then, on the side-lines of the G-20 summit in Indonesia in 2022, and the BRICS summit in South Africa in 2023.\n\n Mr. Misri did not confirm a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi , he said that government is discussing the scheduling of a number of bilateral meetings in Kazan, the venue of the BRICS summit.\n\n\u201c[BRICS] is a multilateral event, though, of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall program of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings, and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve, as soon as feasible,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists when asked, not denying that a meeting with the Chinese leader was among those.\n\nMr. Misri, who was previously India\u2019s Ambassador to China, and was no doubt, a key part of the recent negotiations, did not give further details of the agreement between both sides. He referred to recent meetings that had led to the breakthrough, which include two meetings between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Chinese FM Wang Yi in June-July, two meetings of the WMCC mechanism of diplomatic and military officials in July-August, followed by a meeting between NSA Ajit Doval and Mr. Wang, who is also the Special Representative on border talks in September. These were followed by intense negotiations of military commanders and MEA officials in the last few weeks. With Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi\u2019s travels to Russia for the BRICS confirmed, a deadline appeared to have emerged for the negotiations to conclude with a result.",

He said the diplomatic and military negotiators from both sides had been in close touch in recent weeks. Government sources called it a \u201cbig development\u201d.\nALSO READ | India, China Reach Agreement On Disengagement, Border Patrolling Ahead Of BRICS Meet\nThe statement came just a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit for the BRICS Summit to Kazan, Russia, where he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nThere were seven points of conflict on the LAC since the Galwan clash in 2020, five of which had seen disengagement, but the troops from both sides remained in an eyeball-to-eyeball conflict in Depsang Plains and Demchock. The issue also became a major political flashpoint in India with the Congress attacking the Modi government for alleged presence of Chinese troops on Indian soil.\n\n#IndiaChina Stand-off | India-China reach patrolling agreement on LAC\nIt has to translate on ground, Depsang and Demchok are really important: Lt.

EAM highlighted the need to redouble efforts to achieve complete disengagement from the remaining areas in Eastern Ladakh,\u201d the Indian side had said, after the meeting.\nThe two ministers met again on July 25 in Vientiane, Lao PDR on the sidelines of the ASEAN-related Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting to lay the groundwork. \u201cBoth the ministers agreed on the need to work with purpose and urgency to achieve complete disengagement at the earliest,\u201d an Indian statement had said about the meeting.\n\nThe meeting also resolved to hold an \u201cearly meeting\u201d of the Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) to take the discussions forward.

The case relates to Kejriwal's remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification.A bench comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy and SVN Bhatti stated that the court was not inclined to interfere with the matter, especially since a similar plea by co-accused AAP leader Sanjay Singh was dismissed on April 8, 2024.Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s counsel argued that the defamation case lacked merit, claiming that the complaint was filed by the Gujarat University registrar, who was not directly mentioned in Kejriwal\u2019s remarks. However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta countered that Kejriwal was in the \u201chabit of making defamatory and reckless statements and then saying sorry\u201dThe court clarified that although Kejriwal's legal team made references to relevant legal provisions, the dismissal of Sanjay Singh's plea earlier influenced the decision to reject Kejriwal\u2019s petition as well.\"We must have a consistent approach,\" the bench noted, further stating that they were not commenting on the merits of the case, only choosing not to entertain the plea.ABOUT THE CASEA defamation case was filed by Gujarat University registrar Piyush Patel against Kejriwal and Singh after the AAP leaders made \"defamatory\" and \"sarcastic\" statements at press conferences and on social media targeting the university over PM Modi's degrees.The AAP leaders had allegedly made the comments after the Gujarat High Court had set aside an order of the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) that called for providing information about Modi's educational degrees to them under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.After the High Court\u2019s order in the RTI case, Gujarat University filed a defamation case against the two AAP leaders.Arvind Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh had approached the Gujarat High court, seeking quashing of the defamation proceedings in a trial court. The Gujarat High Court had declined the plea, following which the two AAP leaders approached the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Gujarat High Court\u2019s decision and dismissed Kejriwal\u2019s request for relief from the defamation proceedings.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 21, 2024Must Watch",

        "title": "Remarks on PM's degree: Kejriwal faces defamation trial in Gujarat as SC upholds summons",
        "text": "New Delhi: Former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal is facing criminal proceedings in a defamation case over his alleged remarks over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification after the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed his plea to quash summons. A Gujarat Metropolitan court had summoned Kejriwal and AAP's Sanjay Singh in the defamation case over their alleged \"sarcastic\" and \"derogatory\" statements related to PM Modi's educational degrees. Gujarat University Registrar Piyush Patel had filed the defamation case against the politicians over their alleged comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the chief information commissioner (CIC) for providing information about Modi's degrees under the Right to Information Act. A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S V N Bhatti noted that a separate bench of the apex court had junked the plea filed by AAP leader Sanjay Singh on April 8 in the same case, who is a co-accused in the case. \"We must have a consistent approach. Having regard to that view, we would not like to entertain the present plea. The same is dismissed,\" said the bench. The top court, however, said all contentions were left open to be decided in the trial and it was expressing no opinion on the merits of the case. Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, submitted Patel was not an aggrieved party in the matter. \"If at all the statement was defamatory, it is for Modi to file a criminal defamation case and not for the Gujarat University registrar,\" he said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the University, said a separate bench of the apex court had already dismissed Singh's petition on April 8. Mehta said the degree had been uploaded on the university website and referred to the dismissal of the CIC order by the Gujarat High Court. Arguing that no case of defamation was made out, Singhvi stated that Kejriwal merely asked why the university was not publishing Modi's degree. The bench, however, rejected Kejriwal's plea. The high court had on February 16 dismissed the pleas by Singh and Kejriwal seeking quashing of the summons issued against them in the defamation case. Both had challenged in the high court the summons issued by a trial court in the case filed by the Gujarat University and the subsequent order of the sessions court dismissing their revision pleas against the summons. According to the complainant, the two politicians made \"defamatory\" statements at press conferences and on microblogging platform X, targeting the university over Modi's degrees. Their comments against the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the institution, which has established its name among the public, he alleged. \"Their statements were sarcastic and intentionally made to hurt the prestige of the university,\" he added. On March 31, 2023, the high court quashed the 2016 order of the CIC asking Gujarat University to provide information on Modi's degrees to Kejriwal, and observed the AAP chief's RTI plea appeared to be \"politically vexatious and motivated\" instead of being based on \"sound public interest considerations\".",

We have concluded that there are two areas we can explore - 1) Amendment to Aircraft Security Rules... one of the ideas we wish to implement through these rule changes is that once we apprehend the perpetrator behind these threats, we aim to place them on the no-fly list... 2) Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Civil Aviation Act... Naidu explained.Bomb threats cripples Indian aviationOn Sunday alone, more than 20 flights from IndiGo, Akasa Air, and Vistara were disrupted by bomb threats.This led to a meeting between BCAS officials and airline CEOs, as the threats continue to cause alarm and necessitate extensive security checks.Additionally, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and BCAS Director General Zulfiquar Hasan met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan on Monday to discuss the recent surge in hoax calls.During the half-hour meeting at the Home Ministry, both director generals briefed the home secretary on the recent wave of hoax bomb threats, which have caused widespread panic and prompted exhaustive security measures by Indian aviation authorities, intelligence agencies, and other departments.",

The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary by-election.\n\n\"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.\n\nCongress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said.\n\nWith the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.\n\nSoon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate for the seat in Kerala.\n\nWith the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.\n\nDays after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.\n\nIf elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.\n\nThe EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies.\n\nThe bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.\n\nSince her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.\n\nHowever, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nShe emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year.\n\nAfter her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both constituencies.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Tata Consumer Products, one of the leading FMCG majors in India, witnessed its share prices tumble nearly 10% in yesterday's trading after reporting lackluster financial results for the second quarter of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe company's revenues from operations grew by a modest 13% to Rs. 4,214.5 crores compared to the same period last year. However, operating margins declined by 30 basis points to 14.9% due to rising input costs. Net profits increased by 6% to Rs. 359 crores year-on-year, but fell short of street expectations.\n\nWeak demand, especially in the urban markets, impacted the volume growth for Tata Consumer during the quarter. The tea business, which contributes over half of total revenues, registered muted sales. Rising inflation has also constrained discretionary spending by consumers.\n\nCommenting on the results, analysts at Elara Securities highlighted the competitive pressures in the FMCG sector and slowing demand trends in urban regions as near-term headwinds. Although they remain optimistic about the company's diverse portfolio and broader growth prospects, earnings estimates for the next two fiscal years have been cut to factor in the pressure on revenues and margins.\n\nWhile Tata Consumer looks well-positioned in the long run with its brands and distribution expansion plans, investors seem concerned about the soft demand environment squeezing profits in the immediate quarters. The company will need to efficiently manage costs and urgently revive volume growth in key categories to allay such concerns.

With that we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia.\n\n\"There are areas which for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020,\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nThe External Affairs Minister said the LAC breakthrough is a good development that happened due to \"patient and persevering diplomacy\".\n\nREAD | India To Resume Patrolling In Ladakh After Big Breakthrough With China\n\n\"... At various points of time people almost gave up. We have always maintained on the one hand we obviously had to do counter deployment, and we have been negotiating since September 2020. It has been a very patient process, though more complicated than how it should have been,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV.\n\n\"The important thing is if we have reached an understanding, I think what it does is it creates a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border, which were there before 2020. That was a major concern. If there is no peace and tranquillity, how can other areas of bilateral ties improve?\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nWhile he agreed people may speculate on the LAC development, the External Affairs Minister said he would use \"caution\" in responding on whether this positive development would spread to trade ties.\n\n\"It (LAC breakthrough) has just happened. I would not go so fast at the moment,\" Mr Jaishankar said, referring to trade.\n\nThe last meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs was held on August 29 in Beijing. The two sides then had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the LAC to narrow down differences and find early resolution of outstanding issues.\n\nIt was agreed that restoration of peace and tranquillity, and respect for the LAC are the essential basis for restoration of normalcy in bilateral relations.\n\nEarlier this month, Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had said the two sides have resolved the \"low-hanging fruits\" and now need to address difficult situations, adding there was \"positive signalling\" from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries.\n\nIndian and Chinese military commanders too had been meeting regularly seeking complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh as an essential basis for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.\n\nSome areas still remained to be de-escalated after Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from Gogra-Hot Springs in Ladakh in September 2022. The Chinese forces in this area had returned to pre-2020 positions. Even then, Chinese soldiers were still believed to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north in the Depsang plains.\n\nFierce clashes between soldiers of both sides took place in eastern Ladakh's Galwan in June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action. Over 40 Chinese soldiers were killed or injured.",

Shivakumar said on Monday that about 80 per cent of the workers are demanding the candidacy of former MP and his younger brother D.K. Suresh from the Channapatna Assembly seat for bypolls. \n\nHe claimed that he clarified to the workers that they must support whoever the high command decides to field.\n\n\u201cWe are still recovering from the shock of the Lok Sabha election loss where Suresh lost against C.N. Manjunath by more than two lakh votes. Manjunath had contested Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket. Suresh worked hard but we still lost by a huge margin. Had we lost by a smaller margin, we could have improved our performance. We lost the Lok Sabha badly,\u201d said the Deputy Chief Minister. \n\nHe added that if we start to think that JD-S is weak, then \u201cwe will be the biggest fools\u201d. \n\n\u201cWe have discussed and gathered opinions of the ministers. Instead of a meeting of the election committee, we have discussed with the election in-charges. The decision on the party\u2019s candidates has been made. We will submit the proposal to Delhi, and they will make the final decision.\u201d \n\nCommenting on allegations by Union Minister Kumaraswamy that Congress leaders were in contact with BJP MLC and ticket aspirant for Channapatna, C.P. Yogeshwar, he said, \u201cI have not met or spoken to Yogeshwar. There has been no meeting or discussion between us.\u201d\n\nHe added that Yogeshwar is a sitting member of the Legislative Council and since the MLA position from Channapatna became vacant, Congress has been working to organise the workers. \n\nOn the alleged rift between BJP and JD-S, the Deputy Chief Minister said that he is not aware of any conflicts between them and the media has not reported anything about it.\n\n\u201cChannapatna is naturally a JD-S stronghold. Kumaraswamy was the sitting member. But media reports suggest he is surrendering the segment to the BJP. If he gives up this area, it will lead to the party losing its existence,\u201d the Deputy Chief Minister claimed. \n\nHe added that Suresh has worked hard and the Congress is confident of winning the Channapatna Assembly seat. \n\nOn heavy rains in Bengaluru, the Deputy Chief Minister said that many people have built houses in low-lying areas, and when heavy rain occurs, water inundates those houses. \n\n\u201cWe need to find long-term solutions for the areas where water stagnates and problems arise.

        "text": "Ahead of Indian cricket team's all-important Tour of Australia, that starts next month, the recent loss to New Zealand at home has raised a few doubts about whether the current side needs some changes or not. One star who is most likely to be not picked for the Tour of Australia is Cheteshwar Pujara. The veteran batter, known for his dogged resistance in the face of strong challenge, has a proven record in Australia. The 36-year old has been overlooked from international matches, and the last match he played for India was in June, 2023.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Pujara has now surpassed the great Brian Lara's tally of 65 first-clas tons with a century for Saurashtra against Chhattisgarh in a Ranjji Trophy match. Pujara has 66 tons now. He also went past the 21000-mark in first-class run tally. Regarding his absence, Australia star Pat Cummins said: \"It comes down to who wants to outlast each other, which I quite like that aspect of Test cricket. It's going to be a shame that he is not there, but I'm sure they'll pick someone else who's in a similar kind of style.\"\"It was always great playing (against) Pujara. He was one of those guys who never really felt like he was getting away from you. But then he would (just) bat, bat, bat and bat. I really enjoyed the contest against him. Some days he won, other days I won. It's going to have a bit of a different feel without him. Pujara is a great player.\" He also said that the India vs Australia rivalry is now at par with Ashes. I do think it is. Particularly, after the Indian team won the last couple of series at (our) home. We've had more success against England over the past decade. I think it's right up there,\" he said.\"You know when you play against India, you've got a few Indian fans that are watching. It's a slightly different rivalry to England-Australia rivalry. But again, now having a five-Test match series, it does mirror the Ashes series very closely,\" he said.",

The cabinet, dubbed the \u201cRed and White Cabinet\u201d after Indonesia's national colors, dwarfs the 34-member team under predecessor Joko Widodo.\n\nSubianto, who was sworn in as Indonesia's eighth president last week, stated the cabinet's large size was necessary to create a \u201cstrong government\u201d that could unite the diverse nation and represent its many political voices. Analysts noted it allows him to reward the seven-party coalition that backed his election victory in February. Several ministers from Widodo's cabinet were also retained.\n\nA key reason for the cabinet's enormity appears to be Subianto's stated goal of accelerating Indonesia's economic growth to 8% annually through ambitious spending plans. These include salary hikes for civil servants, free school meals for 83 million children, and defense budget increases. To implement such broad programs, a huge team of ministers will be required.\n\nSome familiar faces staying on include respected Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the first person to hold the post under three separate presidencies. Other returnees are the ministers of trade, energy, state firms and interior. Indrawati's stewardship of the economy through various crises has made her a key stabilizing presence.\n\nInterestingly, Subianto had been a political rival of Widodo for years but did not contest his 2019 reelection defeat, even serving as his defense chief later. This paved the way for the unlikely alliance that saw Widodo tacitly endorse Subianto's recent candidacy. With his new giant cabinet, Indonesia's new leader is clearly ambitious in scale \u2013 whether this gamble to leverage broad coalition support pays off remains to be seen.",

        "text": "Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday said his government would clear pending bills worth Rs 763 crore of the police department and also promised to hire 6,100 constables.The Chief Minister gave the assurance while speaking on the occasion of Police Commemoration Day at the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium in Vijayawada.The previous government (YSRCP) has left bills of the police department worth over Rs 763 crore unpaid. Will take decisions in phases to cooperate with the police department and will clear all those bills, said Naidu during his speech as part of the Police Commemoration Day.Noting that investing in the police department is akin to investing in the state, the CM said he always gave importance to and cooperated with it.According to Naidu, the state government has already cleared pending bills worth Rs 100 crore of the department within 125 days of coming to power.Emphasising on the need for providing latest technologies to the police department, Naidu said policemen cannot fight criminals with old fashioned technological tools.Only when we have an upper hand over criminals in terms of surveillance and technology, can we control them, said Naidu, promising to improve and bring advanced technology.He accused the previous YSRCP government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of using the police department as a tool for political harassment.Slamming Reddy, the TDP supremo said the former could not release Rs 700 crore to the police department but allegedly splurged Rs 700 crore on survey stones, which bore the former CM's images.Assuring importance to police welfare, the CM promised to commit at least Rs 20 crore every year and also build a facility at Amaravati to observe the next Police Commemoration Day from there.I pay my tributes to police who died on duty. I assure you that I will always stand by the police who do justice and respect officials, Naidu added.",

In Delhi, we have only CNG and electric buses, whereas 100% of the interstate buses coming from UP and Haryana are diesel-powered. Why can't the governments of Haryana and UP introduce electric buses? It's because they want to play dirty politics with the people of Delhi. While Delhi has no brick kilns, there are 3,800 brick kilns in the NCR region, contributing significantly to pollution levels in the capital,\" the Chief Minister added.\n\nOn the water pollution in Yamuna, she said, \"BJP leaders have been visiting Kalindi Kunj for photoshoots, but the real cause of the toxic foam in the Yamuna is industrial waste being dumped into the river by factories in Haryana. The UP government also contributes to the problem by releasing polluted water into the Yamuna.\"\n\nOver the past several winters, Delhiites have gasped for breath as stubble burning in neighbouring states, among other causes, has pushed up air pollution in the capital. With election in the city due in February, air pollution has now emerged as a key talking point.\n\nIn power for 10 years, AAP is pushing hard for a third term. AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, now out on bail after he was arrested in a corruption case linked to Delhi's now-scrapped liquor policy, stepped down as Chief Minister last month and said he would return to the top office only after the \"people's court\" elects him again. Senior party leader Atishi took over the job after Mr Kejriwal's exit.",

        "text": "Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court on Monday rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) petition demanding that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi apologise for allegedly tarnishing the dignity of Indian women.The PIL stemmed from a claim that Gandhi had falsely accused former Janata Dal (Secular) MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of rape and sexual abuse, of \u201craping 400 women and filming the act,\u201d describing it as \u201cmass rape\u201d and not a sex scandal.A bench comprising Chief Justice NV Anjaria and Justice K Aravind dismissed the petition, stating that it was a waste of judicial time.The Court also imposed a Rs 25,000 fine on the petitioner, the All India Dalit Action Committee, for filing the plea.The petitioner's counsel argued that Gandhi's remarks, made during a public speech, were highly irresponsible and offensive, particularly to the women of Hassan. He pleaded the Court to issue a notice to Gandhi, compelling him to respond to the allegations.\u201cGandhi is a serial offender,\u201d the counsel contended, referencing past statements made by Gandhi, including comments regarding individuals with the surname Modi.'The petitioner also cited Gandhi's alleged citizenship issues, which are pending before the Delhi High Court, as further evidence of his misconduct.However, the Karnataka HC found no merit in the petition and dismissed it along with a fine.The petitioner's counsel sought waiver of the fine and argued that he should not be penalized for taking rightful action.The PIL highlighted that Gandhi's allegations, made without evidence, misled the public and disrespected the modesty of Indian women, particularly in light of the provisions under the new Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita.The plea argued that Gandhi's statement amounted to hate speech and promoted gender-based hatred. It also sought a directive from the court requiring Gandhi to issue a public apology and called for the National Commission for Women to take appropriate action against him.Despite the petitioner's appeal, the Court concluded that the matter did not warrant further consideration.",

However, some of the party leaders in the district unit of the AGP revolted against the decision while the district president also resigned from his post.\n\nThese developments caused the AGP leadership to delay the announcement of the name of Choudhury as the party candidate. However, according to sources, Phani Bhusan Choudhury was insistent on his wife getting a ticket for the Assembly bypolls and the top leaders decided to field Diptimoy Choudhury in Bongaigaon.\n\nMeanwhile, the Barpeta Lok Sabha MP said that the people of Bongaigaon wanted his wife to contest the elections. \u201cThis is the only reason why she was chosen as a party candidate here,\u201d he said.\n\nChoudhury will take on the Congress party\u2019s nominee Brajenjit Sinha in the Bongaigaon Assembly seat.\n\nBy-elections in five assembly constituencies\u2014Dholai, Samaguri, Behali, Bongaigaon, and Sidli became imminent following the elections of five legislators in the lower house of the parliament in this year\u2019s Lok Sabha polls.\n\nApart from Sinha, the Congress has given party tickets to Dhrubajyoti Purakayastha in Dholai, Sanjib Warle in the Sidli seat, and Tanzil Hussain in the Samaguri Assembly constituency.\n\nThe Dholai Assembly constituency is reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) community and the Sidli seat is reserved for the Scheduled Tribe (ST).",

        "text": "\"Have 16 children\" - Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin's eyebrow-raising 'solution' Monday to the possibility the southern state will be allotted fewer Lok Sabha seats - and therefore be less important to any political party looking to form the union government - after the delimitation in 2026, i.e., redrawing of parliamentary constituencies, before the 2029 election, based on revised population levels.\n\nThe DMK leader - presiding over the state-funded Hindu marriage ceremony of 31 couples - said the tradition in his state was for family elders to bless married couples with \"16 kinds of wealth\"; the benediction, translated from Tamil, reads \"Acquire 16 kinds of wealth and lead a prosperous life)\".\n\n\"That blessing does not mean you should have 16 children... but now a situation has arisen where people think they may have to, literally, raise 16 children and not a small and prosperous family.\"\n\nAs an aside (and in a comment seen as another jab at the BJP that is in power at the centre), Mr Stalin called on Tamil couples to give their children \"beautiful Tamil names\".\n\nREAD | \"Imposing Hindi Everywhere\": MK Stalin vs Governor In Anthem Row\n\nThe Chief Minister's comment about Tamil names for Tamil children comes amid yet another state-centre flare-up on the language row; last week Mr Stalin lobbed tough questions at Governor RN Ravi, the centre's rep in the state, for trying to \"impose Hindi everywhere\".\n\nThe Delimitation Row\n\nOver the past several months Tamil Nadu, and the other southern states, have expressed concern over a delimitation exercise that will see the number of seats jump from 543 now to 753.\n\nThe biggest increase will be in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state; the number of Lok Sabha seats will jump from 80 to 126 - a 57.5 per cent spike. Among the southern states, only Karnataka could see a measurable increase - from 28 seats to 36 - in representation in the Lower House.\n\nTamil Nadu's Lok Sabha share will likely only inch up - from 39 to 41, a five per cent increase, and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana may be given only three extra seats each.\n\nNDTV Explains | What India Will Look Like After 2026 Delimitation\n\nAnd Kerala - the state that has best controlled population growth, a critical factor as the country and world battles climate change, unemployment, and resource scarcity - could lose one of its 20 seats.\n\nThe opposition has been fiercely critical about the marked disparity between possible revised Lok Sabha representation for the northern states - a majority of which voted for the BJP in the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections - and for those in the south.\n\nAnd Mr Stalin's government has been among the most vocal in this regard.\n\nTamil Nadu's Anti-Delimitation Move\n\nIn February Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK adopted a resolution against the proposed delimitation, arguing that states that have best controlled population levels ought not to be penalised.\n\nREAD | In Tamil Nadu Assembly, A Challenge To Delimitation Exercise\n\nConversely, the DMK said, states that had failed to do so should not be rewarded.\n\nChandrababu Naidu's Remark\n\nMr Stalin's comment - in jest, yes, but with a definite edge - came shortly after his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, Chandrababu Naidu, also 'advised' people to have more children.\n\nMr Naidu's comment, however, was in the context of an aging state population.\n\nHe warned that a disproportionate number of elderly people could affect the state's finances and offered Japan as an example. \"In many villages, only elderly people remain... as the young have migrated to cities or overseas,\" he said, adding his government would pass laws in this regard.\n\nCentre Says...\n\nThe Narendra Modi government will be considerate of the fact southern states have, on average, controlled population better than the north, sources told NDTV in September last year. Fears southern states will be penalised by their Lok Sabha seats being affected, will be allayed, sources said.\n\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

There were no clues available from the spot and analysis is going on,\u201d they said.\nThe sources added: \u201cThe place is insignificant in terms of being picked as a target for a bomb blast. This is a busy area in terms of car parking and residential locality but the logistics ensured that no damage occurred. What is most surprising is that no bomb blast material is available and neither was any device found. In this case, it becomes a crude bomb.\u201d\nCrude bomb is used in Bengal and other parts of India, sources said, adding that they had never been used in the national capital.\n\u201cThe CCTV footage examination is crucial. There is no clue in CCTVs so far as no one is seen going closer to the spot where the blast took place.\u201d\nOn Monday, Delhi Police said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to the blast. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform.\nThe purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents. The claim was made by Justice League India using a clip of the blast with a \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d watermark at the bottom, and circulated on social media platforms.\nThe blast, which destroyed a portion of the school wall, window panes of nearby shops, and damaged a few cars parked nearby, was captured in a CCTV camera. Police suspect that the bomb might have been placed late at night as local residents said it went off between 7.35 am and 7.40 am.\nThe sound of the blast was heard several hundred metres away. Videos from the spot showed thick plumes rising from the site. Residents called the explosion \u201cintense\u201d and reported a foul smell in the area.\nPolice have filed a case under sections of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on charges of \u201cmischief through explosion\u201d and under the Explosives Act.",

He vacated the Budgam seat and retained the Ganderbal constituency, the pro-tem speaker announced in the House on Monday.

Tensions escalated after attackers killed two Opposition figures\u2014a lawyer and a party official\u2014who were shot while traveling in a car, prompting condemnation from the EU and human rights groups.The new Opposition Podemos party and its presidential candidate, Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, have rejected provisional results that indicate a probable win for the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for half a century. They called for a nationwide strike in response to the results.Mozambique Elections: Police fire tear gas at Mondlane, journalists \u2013 Watch | O Pa\u00eds #Mozambique #Mo\u00e7ambique #Mocambique #MozambiqueElections #News https://t.co/BeZrRxo0NA\u2014 Club of Mozambique (@clubOmozambique) October 21, 2024 \">Also Read: The Mozambican civil society election observer group More Integrity reported that the shooting occurred in the Bairro da Coop neighborhood of Maputo, resulting in the deaths of Podemos lawyer Elvino Dias and party representative Paulo Guambe. Several dozen people, including journalists, scattered as heavily armed police patrolled the area, according to videos posted on social media. Adriano Nuvunga, director of Mozambique\u2019s Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD), described the killings as \u201ca cold-blooded murder,\u201d noting that around 10 to 15 bullets were fired. The EU condemned the violence, demanding an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation. \u201cIn a democracy, there is no place for politically motivated killings,\u201d the EU's diplomatic service stated, adding that its election observers are still assessing the electoral process. As of now, Frelimo leads in all 11 provinces, with Daniel Chapo expected to win the 9 October election, despite external observers raising concerns about the poll's integrity due to reports of vote-buying and intimidation. Full results are due on 24 October, but fears mount that Monday\u2019s protests could turn violent, given the history of police brutality against political dissent.

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed that secularism has long been regarded as an integral part of the Constitution's basic structure. The top court made the statement orally while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the removal of the terms 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Preamble to the Constitution.\"You don't want India to be secular?\" Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked, while hearing the plea alongside Justice Sanjay Kumar. The Supreme Court bench said that the term 'socialism' should not necessarily be interpreted in the western context and the term can also mean that there has to be an equal opportunity for all. \"There are a number of judgments of this court which hold that Secularism was always part of the basic structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and word fraternity used in the Constitution as well as the rights under Part III, there is a clear indication that secular has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,\" Live Law quoted Justice Khanna as saying. Khanna also pointed out that, unlike the French model of secularism, India adopted a new model of secularism.The plea, filed by senior BJP leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy and one Balram Singh, challenged the 42nd amendment to the Indian Constitution that was made by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi-led government during the Emergency.Responding to the top court judge, Advocate Jain said, \"We are not saying that India is not secular, we are challenging the amendment\". Jain further argued that Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar had opined that the inclusion of the word 'socialism' would curtail personal liberty.In response, Justice Khanna said, \"Socialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of country should be distributed equally. Let's not take the Western meaning\".It was also argued by the petitioner that the Preamble of the Constitution, as it stood on November 26, 1949, was a definitive declaration, contending that any subsequent amendment adding words such as 'socialist\" and 'secular' was arbitrary, according to Live Law.To this, Justice Khanna highlighted that the words introduced by the 1976 amendment were clearly indicated by brackets, making it evident that they were additions. Khanna also pointed out that terms such as 'unity' and 'integrity' of the nation were also incorporated through this amendment.The bench then agreed to examine the issue in detail and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Oct 21, 2024ALSO READ | Supreme Court dismisses Arvind Kejriwal's plea in case over remark on PM's degreeALSO READ | Supreme Court junks plea to replace 'Hindutva' with 'Indian constitutionalism",

Over the past five years, imports fr0m FTA partners increased by 37.9 per cent to USD 187.92 billion, significantly outpacing export growth, which rose by 14.48 per cent to USD 122.72 billion.\n\nThis trade imbalance has been particularly pronounced with ASEAN countries, the UAE, Japan, and nations within the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).\n\nThe revised strategy draws on lessons fr0m past agreements, such as the challenges encountered with gold, silver, platinum, and date imports under the India-UAE FTA.\n\nBy adopting a more meticulous approach to concessions, India aims to mitigate potential risks and unforeseen consequences in future trade deals.\n\nA key focus of the new policy is to address the issue of third-country products, especially those originating fr0m China, entering India through FTA partner countries at preferential rates.\n\nThis practice, observed notably with Indonesian and Vietnamese imports under the India-ASEAN FTA, has prompted calls for more robust rules of origin to close existing loopholes.\n\nAdditionally, India is taking a firmer stance against non-tariff barriers proposed by developed nations, particularly those related to sustainability, labour standards, and environmental regulations.\n\nThe country is also advocating for a more balanced approach in negotiations with smaller nations to ensure proportionate gains.\n\nTo refine its FTA strategy and develop standard operating procedures for trade negotiations, the Commerce Department organised a strategic planning session in May.\n\nThis event brought together officials and trade experts, including former negotiators, to brainstorm and shape India's future approach to international trade agreements.",

The 2009-batch officer, currently serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department, raised pertinent questions that garnered widespread attention.\nWho Is Shailbala Martin?\nShailbala Martin, originally from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, was born on April 9, 1965. According to the state government website, she began her career in the State Civil Service (SCS) before being promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) on June 12, 2017. With a BA and an MA in Arts from Holkar Science College in Indore, Martin joined the State Civil Service in 2009.\nThroughout her career, Martin has held various positions, including roles in the Health Department in 2014, Municipal Commissioner of Burhanpur in 2019, and Collector of Niwari district the same year. Since January 25, 2022, she has been serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department.\nThe Loudspeaker Controversy\nThe recent controversy can be traced back to guidelines issued by the state government last year to mitigate noise pollution, which specifically aimed to regulate loudspeakers in religious venues. A journalist on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) questioned the disparity in enforcement, focusing on the use of loudspeakers in mosques and the prevalence of DJs playing music outside these spaces.\nIn response, Martin highlighted the noise pollution caused by loudspeakers in temples, questioning why such disturbances, which can be heard several streets away and continue late into the night, are often overlooked. Her tweet sparked a mix of reactions, with some users supporting her stance while others criticised her for raising the issue.",

As a result, the Khinsvar assembly seat fell vacant.\n\nThere was speculation about a Congress-RLP alliance for the bypoll to the Khinvsar seat but Mr. Dotasra said the Congress' State unit was not looking for a tie-up.\n\nHe said the Congress' Rajasthan in-charge Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa would take the panels for all seven seats to Delhi and candidates would be declared after a discussion with the high command.\n\nDungarpur's Chorasi assembly seat fell vacant after Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) MLA Rajkumar Roat won the Lok Sabha election from the Banswara-Dungarpur district.\n\nThe Congress did not announce any alliance with the BAP in the general election but asked its candidate to withdraw their nominations from the Banswara-Dungarpur constituency. The move was aimed at supporting the BAP.\n\n\"There are no talks of alliance with any party in the assembly bypolls in Rajasthan. We have prepared panels for all seven seats in the meeting today,\" Mr. Dotasra said.\n\nHe also exuded confidence that the party would win all seven assembly seats.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Assembly Tikaram Jully, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, former assembly Speaker CP Joshi and other party leaders attended the meeting chaired by Randhawa.\n\nVoting on seven assembly seats -- Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Deoli-Uniara, Khinvsar, Chorasi, Salumbar and Ramgarh -- will be held on November 13 and the results will be declared on November 23.\n\nBypolls on two seats are being held due to the death of the MLAs -- Congress's Zubair Khan from Ramgarh and BJP's Amritlal Meena from Salumbar.\n\nIn the other five constituencies, the MLAs were elected as MPs, necessitating the bypolls.\n\nCongress MLAs Brijendra Ola (Jhunjhunu), Harish Chandra Meena (Deoli-Uniara) and Murari Lal Meena (Dasau) were elected as MPs in the Lok Sabha election. The other two are Beniwal and Roat.\n\nFour of the seven seats where bypolls will be held were with the Congress, while the BJP, BAP and the RLP held one each.\n\nThe BJP has declared candidates for all seats except Chorasi.\n\nThe BAP has already declared its candidate for the Chorasi seat.\n\nCurrently, the 200-seat state assembly has 114 MLAs of the BJP, 65 of the Congress, three of the BAP, two of the BSP, one of the Rashtriya Lok Dal and eight Independents.",

It's mind-boggling - you are one nation but you are speaking different languages and even the written languages are different. The first thing he (PM Modi) did was unify the tax system. This is an incredible accomplishment. This is something that probably would have taken a century.\"The investor said India's diversity results in incredible creativity and the future belongs to those who are creative.\"I definitely think India is going to become a leader or the leader in semiconductor production in the future. One reason I say that is the demand - you have got a market here that is one of the biggest in the world. Secondly, it is a relatively open economy, so you are going to be able to take technology from Taiwan, China, the United States, wherever. Thirdly, you have got an incredible software industry already, you are the largest exporter of software in the world,\" Mr Mobius said, adding that many large semiconductor companies already have software bases in India.The investor said semiconductor fabrication will happen in India because the country has the labour force. \"I remember I was meeting an Indian friend of mine a few years ago and I said India will become a big semiconductor manufacturer. He said Indians are not as patient and not so good with small things like the Chinese are and I asked him if he had seen the places where they are polishing these tiny diamonds in India. They will do a very good job here, no questions about it. But it will require a huge amount of capital,\" he added.In terms of return on capital, it's \"India, China and the US\", Mr Mobius said, adding that India still presents plenty of opportunities despite stock prices climbing. As the conversation moved to lighter topics, the investor said he likes the 'Baahubali' movies and also had a picture taken with a statue of the villain from the movies in Hyderabad. &nbsp",

What came instead was the pronouncement of his death \u2013 Shashi Abrol had been killed in a terror attack in Kashmir's Ganderbal district.\n\nNews of his death came late on Sunday night, long after the moon had risen, the sight millions of Hindu women look out for to break their daylong fast on the day. Fate could not have dealt Ruchi Abrol a crueller blow.\nShashi Abrol, an architectural designer, was among the seven people killed when terrorists attacked a tunnel construction site on the Srinagar-Leh national highway on Sunday.\nThe attack took place when the team had returned from work to their camp late in the evening. The morning after, his wife held on to their three-year-old daughter, angry, anguished and bewildered at the same time. The couple also has a son studying engineering.\n\u201cI spoke to him in the evening. He didn't mention any threats. I was going to the temple as part of my Karwa Chauth fast, and we had a brief conversation. I tried calling him after I returned but he didn't pick up. After that, his phone was switched off,\u201d a sobbing Ruchi told PTI.\n\u201cI waited for his call but had no idea about the attack,\u201d she added at her home in Jammu's Talab Tillo area, her mother-in-law by her side.\nNo one told them what had happened until late at night. And then too, it came through the media, the family said.\nRuchi was refusing to break her fast, said her sister-in-law Divya.\n\u201cHer life is shattered. The festival of Karwa Chauth has turned into a day of catastrophe for us. Our dear Shashi Ji was killed in a cowardly act by terrorists,\u201d she said.\nAnxiety mounted as the hours passed by.\nRuchi had completed her rituals and was waiting for a video call from her husband, everyone unaware of the magnitude of the tragedy that had befallen them.\n\u201cWe tried to comfort Ruchi as we grew worried when his phone switched off late at night. We only learned about his death through the media, which shocked us all,\u201d Divya said.\nShashi was the family's sole breadwinner.\n\u201cWhat have they gained from this? How will she feed her children now? We curse them,\u201d she said.\nShashi, who had been working for the construction company APCO in Sonamarg for the past six years, had last come home two months ago during his son's college admission.\n\u201cHis aim was to see his son as a bright engineer,\u201d Divya said.\nAs news of Shashi's death spread, hundreds of neighbours, relatives and others visited the family home to offer their condolences.\nThe family criticised the government for failing to inform them promptly and urged the authorities to ensure the swift return of Shashi's body for the last rites.\n\u201cThis is proof of how much peace and normalcy has been restored. Seven people were massacred. We lost our brother,\u201d Shashi's sister Urvashi said after the incident that came just four days after Omar Abdullah was sworn in as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe family called on the government to provide financial assistance.\nJ L Abrol, Shashi's father, said they had never anticipated any danger in Kashmir. \u201cWe demand a job for my daughter in law to feed the family,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is no breadwinner left in the family. How will his wife, who is a homemaker, feed the children? She should be given a government job. It is the government's duty to take care of them,\u201d a cousin Navin Suri said.\nAccording to Additional Deputy Commissioner, Jammu, Shishir Gupta, the loss cannot be compensated but the process to bring back Shashi's body is being fast tracked.",

If you look at our history with Russia after Independence, Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively. Among the major countries, there are not many about who we can say this. Today Russia's situation is different, I think Russia's relationship with the West has broken down, so you have a Russia which is turning much more towards Asia. Should Russia not have multiple options in Asia? Should we not take what is good for us in national interests?\"\"And clearly, Russia as a major natural resources power has a complementarity with India at this stage of development where we are big resource consumers. It isn't just Russian oil, it could be fertilisers, metals, coal. There is a whole economic logic to it. There is also a basic strategic logic, if you look at the Eurasian landmass, there are three big countries. You always keep a balance, a relationship,\" the minister said.New Delhi's ties with Moscow have been a key geopolitical talking point over the past few years, especially after the Ukraine War began. With the West siding with Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia, India's decision to buy Russian oil had come under scrutiny.India has consistently refused to take sides in the conflict and said it is on the side of peace. This was also reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Earlier, articulating the Indian position over the decision to procure Russian oil, Dr Jaishankar had said New Delhi has a right to prioritise the interests of its people.\"I understand that there is a conflict situation (in Ukraine). I also understand that Europe has a point of view and Europe will make the choices it will make that is Europe's right. But for Europe to make choices which prioritises its energy needs and then ask India to do something else..,\" he had said.",

Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Waynad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23.\n\nAfter the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Waynad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also remain present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. \n\nAfter being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Waynad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. Along with this, the election commission announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. \n\nIf Priyanka Gandhi wins from Waynad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi had retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. \n\nGandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation Councillor. \n\nRahul Gandhi had said both Raebareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Raebareli before making a run for active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party. \n\nMeanwhile, Congress appointed Saral Patel as the media coordinator for Wayanad ahead of the by-election with immediate effect.

        "text": "New Zealand's golden generation, led by the inspirational Sophie Devine, will have one last chance to lay hands on a global ICC trophy when it meets a gritty South Africa in the summit clash of the T20 World Cup which is set to throw a new champion, here Sunday. New Zealand's women's team had won the ODI World Cup back in 2000 but none of the current squad members were part of that historic title triumph. Before this event began, New Zealand were in the trenches having lost 10 matches on the trot in the format but under Devine this bunch, comprising of the venerable Suzie Bates and the assuring Amelia Kerr, has done wonders, bringing the side in contention for the ultimate prize.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");It is most probably the last time the Black Shirts will have Devine, Bates and Lea Tahuhu playing of the national side in a global tournament.Devine, 35, has more than 7000 runs under her belt in white-ball formats while the 37-year-old Bates has more than 10,000 runs to her name.Pacer Tahuhu, 34, has 112 wickets in ODIs and 93 in T20Is.They won't leave any stone unturned to ensure that they have a World Cup trophy in their cabinet.South Africa on the other side will be equally determined to complete the unfinished business as they had lost the 2023 World Cup final to Australia at home. They have an opportunity to erase painful memories as they had lost by a mere 19 runs in the close contest.New Zealand have one or other player to rise the occasion in the tournament and in the semifinal against the West Indies, if they failed to set a target big enough to daunt the free-flowing Caribbean batters, their bowlers responded with tidy spells throughout the game to eke out a memorable win.Kerr's wicket tally has swelled to 12 in the tournament as she found apt support from the other end in the likes of Eden Carson (8), Rosemary Mair (7) and the experienced Lea Tahuhu.New Zealand announced their intentions with a big win against India first up and followed that up with consistent performances across departments.A 60-run loss to Australia, arguably the strongest team in the competition, notwithstanding, the Kiwis weren't unnerved as they went on to pip the West Indies in the final over of their low-scoring semifinal to make their third final.When the tournament began towards the end of the first decade of this century, New Zealand appeared to be the team to beat as they made two consecutive finals but got pipped by England and Australia once each.Bates and Devine, the survivors from those campaigns, will thus get a third crack in winning the first ICC trophy for New Zealand in white-ball cricket since 2000 when the men's team won the Champions Trophy in Kenya.But against them will be the formidable South Africa who scripted history of sorts to have stopped the all-dominating Australian team from reaching their eighth consecutive final in the last 15 years and seven editions of the T20 World Cup.If New Zealand has Kerr topping the charts for most successful bowlers, South Africa have two of their top-order batters \u2014 Laura Wolvaardt (190 runs) and Tazmin Brits (170 runs) \u2014 lodged at the top of the batting charts in this tournament.South Africa's all-round might will pose the sternest challenge as the Proteas side is coming off a comprehensive eight-wicket thrashing of Australia, having restricted them to a mere 135/5 and knocked off the target with more than two overs to spare.While a lot will depend on the pair of Wolvaardt and Brits at the top, SA will need the likes of Anneke Bosch and Marizanne Kapp to chip in with the bat too.Similarly, Nonkululeko Mlaba (10 wickets) would also need the rest of the bowlers to replicate their performance from the semifinal, in which they collectively kept it tight to not allow Australia to get away with the bat.Squads:New Zealand: Sophie Devine (captain), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Isabella Gaze (wk), Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Amelia Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder (wk), Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon.Time: 7:30PM IST.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The current season of Bigg Boss Telugu, aptly titled \"Limitless Entertainment,\" has been delivering a blend of drama and excitement week after week. The entry of wildcard contestants, known as the Royals, in the fifth week has added a new layer of competition, often overshadowing the original housemates, referred to as the OG clan. This week\u2019s main task, \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers,\" tested the participants' concentration, strategy, and resilience. Here are some highlights from Day 47 of Bigg Boss Telugu 8:\r\n1. The Cushion Challenge:\r\nThe day began with the continuation of the \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers\" task. Bigg Boss introduced the Cushion Challenge, a twist on the Memory game. Contestants were required to match images displayed on a screen with cushions placed in the garden area, carrying the cushions to a designated grid to score points. \r\n\r\nDespite facing early setbacks, the Over Smartphones team emerged victorious, earning the advantage of eliminating two players from the Over Smart Chargers from the Mega Chief race. They chose to remove Nabeel and Nikhil from the competition.\r\n2. The Conclusion:\r\nThe weekly challenge concluded with four contestants from the OG clan and eight from the Royals still in the game. After the weekly task concluded, Teja and Prithvi were released from their punishment as the week's worst performers, regaining access to their suitcases.\r\n3. Comic Relief from Bigg Boss:\r\nBigg Boss humorously reprimanded Mehaboob and Avinash for napping during the day. The housemates were then summoned to the garden, where they found miniature coffee cups, bun masks, and a violin cutout\u2014a playful nod to Avinash\u2019s earlier requests for coffee and pain relief spray. Both the housemates and viewers enjoyed this lighthearted moment.\r\n4. A Hair-Raising Opportunity:\r\nDuring breakfast, Gautam playfully challenged Prithvi to shave his beard, which Prithvi declined. Bigg Boss then introduced a unique chance to add money to the winner's prize by offering Avinash and Prithvi cash rewards of \u20b925,000, \u20b950,000, or \u20b91 lakh for various haircuts. \r\n\r\nAlthough Prithvi declined, Avinash accepted the \u20b950,000 haircut after much deliberation, adding humour to the situation. He sportingly underwent the haircut, entertaining the audience with his witty remarks.\r\n5. Additional Reward:\r\nIn recognition of Avinash's spirit and courage, Bigg Boss added \u20b950,000 to the winner's prize pool. Furthermore, the house was granted an extra two hours of kitchen time as an additional reward.\r\n6. Selection of the Mega Chief:\r\nThe competition for the prestigious Mega Chief position was through a task called \"Pattuko ledha thappuko,\" in which contenders had to grab a bone placed in a circle before others. The first to seize the bone gained the advantage of eliminating one or two competitors from the race. Gautam ultimately secured the Mega Chief role after a fierce fight.\r\n7. A Slight Commotion:\r\nAt one point, Manikanta grabbed the bone and initially decided to eliminate Hariteja and Teja, citing a pre-game agreement with Gautam to stay in the competition until the end. \r\n\r\nHowever, Gautam denied having made any such deal, leading Manikanta to reconsider his choice and decide to eliminate Teja and Gautam. The situation was resolved by Nikhil, who, as the task Sanchalak, upheld Manikanta's original decision to remove Teja and Hariteja, despite Hariteja's objections.\r\n8. Gautam\u2019s Tribute for Women:\r\nAs the newly appointed Mega Chief, Gautam declared the upcoming week for the women in honour of the female audience. He announced that the women in the house would be exempt from performing household chores unless they volunteered, which garnered appreciation from the housemates and the audience.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the week's episodes, viewers eagerly await the weekend's special broadcasts, during which the host will analyze the housemates' performances\u2013 the weekend episodes air at 9 pm, half an hour earlier than the weekday schedule, on Disney+ Hotstar and Star Maa. \r\n\r\nBased on the above highlights of Day 47 and the promos, a compelling critique of the contestants' strategies and gameplay can be expected in Bigg Boss Telugu 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStay tuned to Yo!

The last time New Zealand emerged victorious in a Test match in India was in 1988, when Sir Richard Hadlee claimed 10 wickets at the Wankhede Stadium, ensuring a resounding 136-run triumph.114376004Latham's team is on the verge of making history, despite a valiant comeback by India, who scored 462 in their second innings. This was largely due to Sarfaraz's penchant for scoring big hundreds, which he carried from first-class to Test cricket with a brilliant 150 off 195 balls, and a partnership of 177 with a partially fit Rishabh Pant, who fell short of his seventh Test century by just one run.114376403India's resilience in Test cricket has been exemplified by remarkable second-innings performances, resulting in some of the most significant improvements in team scores between the first and second innings. 114373829The highest such improvement occurred during the iconic 2001 Kolkata Test against Australia, where India improved by 486 runs, going from 171 all out to declaring at 657/7. In 1999, India witnessed a 422-run improvement against New Zealand in Mohali, from 83 to 505/3 declared.114366921In a recent 2024 Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, India bounced back from a dismal 46 in the first innings to score 462, an improvement of 416 runs. A 375-run improvement took place in 1965 at Brabourne Stadium, where India posted 88 and then 463/5 declared, also against New Zealand. Finally, in Headingley, 1967, India turned the tables against England, improving by 346 runs, going from 164 to 510 in the second innings.",

        "text": "Dubai [UAE], October 19 (ANI):Both teams will be eying their first Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title as neither have won a Women\u2019s ODI World Cup earlier.South Africa, however, will be playing their second successive Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final after losing to Australia in the summit clash of the 2023 edition.The Protea women, however, knocked out three-time defending champions Australia, also record six-time Women\u2019s T20 WC winners, in the semi-finals this year.After defeating West Indies by 10 wickets in their opening Group B encounter, South Africa endured a seven-wicket defeat against England.Laura Wolvaardt\u2019s charges, however, bounced right back by beating Scotland and Bangladesh by 80 runs and 7 wickets, respectively, to make the semis, where they shocked Australia by eight wickets to earn a title shot.New Zealand, who were on a 10-match losing streak in T20Is heading into the tournament, followed a similar path to the final. The White Ferns beat India by 58 runs in their Group A opener but succumbed to a 60-run loss to Australia in their second outing.An eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and a comfortable 54-run win against Pakistan saw Sophie Devine\u2019s team cross paths with 2016 champions West Indies in the top four.A narrow eight-run win over the Windies saw New Zealand make their first summit clash since 2010. The White Ferns reached the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final in the first two editions but lost to England in 2009 before coming up short against Australia the following year.The 2024 Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final promises to be a fascinating contest between bat and ball with South African captain Laura Wolvaardt leading the run-scoring charts in the tournament while New Zealand spinner Amelie Kerr is the top wicket-taker.South Africa, though, seems the more balanced of the two sides ahead of the contest with Tazmin Brits, the tournament\u2019s second-highest run-scorer, and Nonkululeko Mlaba, the tournament\u2019s second-highest wicket-taker, also in their ranks. Head-to-head record, however, tilts the scale in New Zealand\u2019s favour, who have won 11 of the 16 meetings between the two sides. South Africa have four victories under their belt. \n\nSquads: South Africa-Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon.Travelling Reserve: Miane Smit.New Zealand-Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.

        "text": "Jordan Cox is poised to make his Test debut as England's wicketkeeper during their upcoming tour of New Zealand. This opportunity arises as Jamie Smith is set to miss part of the series due to paternity leave. Cox, who will turn 24 on Monday as per ESPNcricinfo, has been England's reserve batter for the last five Tests and now has the chance to make his mark in December. Smith and his partner are expecting their first child in mid-December, coinciding with either the second or third Test against New Zealand.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"Being at the birth of my son is not something I want to miss,\" he told the Daily Mail recently, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\"It will be a memory that I cherish more than any in cricket anyway, so if I lost my place because of it, so be it,\" he added.Cox made his international debut in England's T20I series against Australia last month and will soon join the squads for their upcoming white-ball tour to the Caribbean. Although he was unable to keep wicket for Essex this summer due to a severe finger injury sustained in the Hundred last year, he has been refining his wicketkeeping skills with Brendon McCullum in Pakistan.\"It's life, right?\" McCullum, who is the head coach of the England Cricket team said of Smith's absence.\"People have kids and we wish them all the best, to be there and support their partners. At this stage, it looks like Jamie will probably play the first [Test in New Zealand] and may miss the next two. We're not totally sure - it's up to Mother Nature a little - but we know we've got Jordan Cox in the squad here,\" McCullum said, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.England is confident in Cox's abilities, despite his limited recent experience behind the stumps, a belief reinforced by Smith's own selection earlier this summer while being second-choice at Surrey. McCullum, drawing from his own experience, considers New Zealand to be a comfortable place for wicketkeeping and is eager to evaluate Cox's performance at the Test level. McCullum describes Cox's glovework as \"solid.\"Cox, known for his self-assured nature, admitted that he would get \"bored\" after reaching 40 runs while playing for a struggling Kent side last year. Seeking a change to reignite his passion for four-day cricket, he moved to Essex, where he scored four centuries and averaged 65.57 in his first County Championship season.He took over the No. 4 spot at Essex, vacated by Dan Lawrence's move to Surrey. Lawrence's own recent experiences underscore the challenges of being England's spare batter. After performing well in the Caribbean in March 2022, Lawrence waited over two years for another opportunity in the middle order, only to be placed as an opener with predictable results. Consequently, Cox has now moved ahead of Lawrence in the selection order.Unless England loses a batter to injury or illness before Thursday's third Test in Rawalpindi, Cox will be added to the white-ball squads and travel to the Caribbean, likely alongside Rehan Ahmed. Marcus Trescothick, serving as interim white-ball coach for the three ODIs and five T20Is against the West Indies, has already departed Pakistan in preparation for that tour.Cox is expected to make his ODI debut during the Caribbean series, providing him with an opportunity to stake a late claim for a spot in England's squad for next year's Champions Trophy. However, it is the prospect of a Test debut later this year that could truly satisfy his ambitions and validate the extensive travel he will undertake in the first half of the English winter.\"He's annoyingly good at everything he does - particularly on the golf course,\" McCullum said.\"He's one of those guys that you look at and say he's got a high ceiling in terms of talent, particularly with bat in hand. There's a fair chance that he'll get the opportunity in New Zealand, if Jamie does return home, to bat down the order and take the gloves,\" he noted.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Lodge Keys No. 297 aims to train 1,000 people in the city free of cost over the next 12 months. This was the second event in the series.Participants practised CPR on mannequins. \"Cardiac arrest can strike anyone, anywhere, at any time. Prevention is key, and every citizen should learn CPR,\" said philanthropist and Freemason K. Janaki Ram Sharma.President of Infection Control Academy Dr. Ranga Reddy Burri highlighted the need for awareness, noting, \"Only two per cent of India's population is trained in CPR, which is alarming. Without CPR, 92 per cent of people don\u2019t survive long enough to reach the hospital, and every minute without it reduces the survival rate by 10 per cent.\"Freemason P. Veerabhadrudu emphasised that nine out of 10 people experiencing cardiac arrest die, but CPR performed within the first few minutes can double or triple their chances of survival.",

The drain under the Lakdikapul railway bridge will also have to be renovated. The HYDRAA, in a press release, highlighted that due to the renovation of the rainwater-holding structure at the Raj Bhavan Road, the roads are not getting waterlogged even when that area receives 5 cm of rain.

It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. However, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.Despite the frustration, the Mariners (MBSG) maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.Their relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.The second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.Looking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.The 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.The Scottish midfielder was adjudged the player of the match and he continues to be Mohun Bagan Super Giant\u2019s main man in midfield. Stewart created three chances on the night while registering eight crosses. He also completed 31 out of his 35 attempted passes as per the media release by ISL.East Bengal FC will travel to Bhubaneswar to face Odisha FC in search of their first win of the season on October 22. On the other hand, Mohun Bagan Super Giant will be back in action again on October 30 when they will lock horns against Hyderabad FC away from home.",

It is only one win, we have to build on this.\"United's first win in six games in all competitions was only their third victory in eight Premier League matches this term.They sit 10th in the table ahead of an intriguing week, featuring a Europa League trip to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce and a visit to West Ham.Tottenham scored three goals in eight second-half minutes against West Ham to ease the pain of their recent collapse in a 3-2 loss at Brighton. Mohammed Kudus' opener for West Ham was cancelled out before the break by Dejan Kulusevski.Tottenham ran riot after the interval thanks to Yves Bissouma's strike, an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and a fourth from Son Heung-min.It was a third win in four league games for Ange Postecoglou's men, heaping pressure on new West Ham coach Julen Lopetegui after his side's spluttering start to the season.\"Second half was outstanding from the lads -- good energy, good goals, good football,\" Postecoglou said.Leicester's great escapeBrighton moved up to fifth place with a 1-0 victory at Newcastle on a day of mixed emotions for Danny Welbeck, who scored the 35th-minute winner but was later stretchered off with a back injury that left him needing an oxygen mask.Leicester staged a stirring fightback to snatch a dramatic 3-2 victory at winless Southampton.Cameron Archer struck in the eighth minute before Joe Aribo's 28th-minute goal increased the lead for the bottom-of-the-table hosts.But Leicester's Facundo Buonanotte bundled home in the 64th minute before Ryan Fraser was sent off for conceding a penalty with a foul on Jamie Vardy.Vardy stroked in the 74th-minute leveller from the spot and Jordan Ayew drilled into the bottom corner in the eighth minute of stoppage-time.Fourth-placed Aston Villa have made their best start for 26 years after a 3-1 win at Fulham.Raul Jimenez netted in the fifth minute, but Villa's Morgan Rogers equalised four minutes later.Andreas Pereira had a penalty saved by Villa 'keeper Emiliano Martinez before the interval.Ollie Watkins' 59th-minute header completed the comeback and Fulham's Joachim Andersen was sent off for a professional foul on the Villa striker five minutes later.Issa Diop's 69th-minute own-goal sealed the win, although Villa had Jaden Philogene sent off for two yellow cards in three minutes.Everton clinched their first away win in 16 games in all competitions with a 2-0 victory against Ipswich.Iliman Ndiaye and Michael Keane scored to leave fourth-bottom Ipswich without a win in eight league games.Third-placed Arsenal will go top of the table if they win at Bournemouth in Saturday's final match.On Sunday, Liverpool, currently in pole position, host sixth-placed Chelsea, while champions Manchester City travel to Wolves.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Using a play on words with Klopp's last name, the home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and used a quote from their side's former boss: \"I like people until the point they disappoint me.\" A larger banner, in big red letters, asked Klopp if he had \"forgotten everything we gave you?\".

In October, Klopp announced he would join energy drink company Red Bull, which owns clubs in Leipzig, Salzburg and New York, as their global head of football from January 2025.His decision to take up the job at Red Bull has annoyed supporters in Germany -- particularly at ex-clubs Dortmund and Mainz -- who have a long-standing dislike of RB Leipzig.Some fans believe Leipzig, founded in 2009, are not consistent with Germany's 50+1 rule, which requires member control of clubs, while others have hit out at the multi-club ownership model used by Red Bull.Leipzig's win at Mainz sent the club, who are yet to lose in the league this season, top of the table -- at least until Bayern Munich's match against Stuttgart at home later on Saturday.Leipzig coach Marco Rose, who played under Klopp for several years at Mainz, dismissed the fans' criticism as a minority opinion. \"There are 35,000 people in the stadium, many of whom have an opinion. I believe that around 34,936 people love Kloppo for the fact that he shaped an era here, that we achieved something great together,\" said Rose. \"He was here in Mainz for a long time.\"Everyone has their own life somewhere and the right to decide things freely and for themselves. Not everyone has to love it.\"Rose added that: \"(He) didn't even notice (the banner), so it can't have been that wild.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

The Egyptian now has an incredible nine goals and five assists in just seven league games this season.Andrich made good on his error soon afterwards, combining expertly with Adli and Martin Terrier to flit through the penalty area for a superb one-touch goal in the 25th minute.Boniface would also redeem himself, giving Leverkusen the lead inside the final 20 minutes, heading in a deflected cross from substitute Florian Wirtz to put the hosts on course for victory.Andrich told Sky Germany \"we were focused and played good football -- and there was a nice goal from me.\"The 30-year-old midfielder, who made his Germany debut last season after a career largely spent in the lower divisions, said of his performance: \"I always have fun playing football, but I maybe have to work a bit harder than the rest.\"Days out from their home Champions League clash with Liverpool, Leipzig beat Mainz to go top of the table, at least until Bayern Munich's home match against Stuttgart later on Saturday.At kick-off, the Mainz fans unveiled a series of banners critical of former coach Jurgen Klopp's decision to take over as football boss at Leipzig's parent company Red Bull. The home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and accused Klopp, who coached Mainz to a debut promotion before joining Borussia Dortmund and later Liverpool, of \"forgetting everything we gave you\".Still unbeaten this season in Germany despite two Champions League losses, Leipzig took the lead after 20 minutes thanks to an excellent solo effort from Xavi Simons. Leipzig captain Willi Orban tapped in a rebound from a Lois Openda cross to put his side 2-0 up.Orban told Sky: \"We could have finished things off earlier but we're happy with the win.\"Elsewhere, Freiburg continued their impressive start to the season with a 3-1 home win over Augsburg to go into outright second. Freiburg were three goals up at half-time, with Vincenzo Grifo, Philipp Lienhart and Christian Guenter scoring, before Augsburg's Phillip Tietz pulled one back in the second period.Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Tim Kleindienst scored a double, days after making his Germany debut, in a 3-2 home win over former club Heidenheim.Hoffenheim won their first game since their season opener, with Andrej Kramaric, Marius Buelter and Haris Tabakovic scoring in a 3-1 win over lowly Bochum, who sit last with just one point from seven games.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "AC Milan overcame having to play with 10 men for over an hour to beat Udinese 1-0 on Saturday, a dramatic win which moved the seven-time European champions two points behind Serie A leaders Napoli. Paulo Fonseca's side are third and level on 14 points with second-placed Inter Milan after surviving two offside scares, including one deep in stoppage time, to claim a hard-fought win at the San Siro.

        "title": "NIIMH, Little Known Gem in Hyderabad",
        "text": "Hyderabad: In medical advancement, documentation of medical history and heritage plays a very important role. Unknown to many, Hyderabad houses a national institute that documents the history of Indian medical systems. Hidden away in the lanes of Gaddiannaram, Dilsukhnagar, the National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH), is a rich resource for historians and researchers studying traditional Indian medical systems like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and several components of modern medicine. The institute was formerly known as the National Centre of Indian Medical Heritage.The institute came into existence as the upgraded Department of History of Medicine in 1956 under the government of Andhra Pradesh and was handed over to the government of India in 1969. It was earlier housed on the third floor of Osmania Medical College and shifted to its present premises in 2009. Currently functioning under the administrative control of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), ministry of AYUSH, the government of India, it houses a medical history library with over 10,000 books, including rare publications dating back to the 15th century. Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) designated NIIMH as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Fundamental and Literary Research in Traditional Medicine. Shedding light on the rich medical history of Telangana, director of the institute G. P. Prasad said, \"One of the earliest inscriptions, dating back to 400 AD, was found in Phanigiri, Mulugu. It mentions Agrabhisaja, a chief physician, who served under King Devasena. This inscription highlights the reverence for medical practitioners, who were even allowed to erect Dharmachakras (sacred pillars) as a symbol of their importance in society.\" \"Another key piece of medical history is the Sirur inscription from 1,100 AD in Medak. It references Aggalayya, a Jain scholar, Ayurvedic physician and surgeon. Known for his surgical expertise, Aggalayya taught the art of surgery to students from across India and served under four different dynasties. His contributions earned him the title of 'Samanta Raja', a subordinate king, underscoring his stature in society,\" Dr Prasad highlighted. In Yaragudi (currently in Andhra Pradesh), Ashoka inscriptions mention the establishment of both veterinary and human hospitals, along with the importation of medicinal plants from surrounding regions. During the era of the Nizams, we see the rise of Unani medicine alongside Ayurveda. The Nizams supported the development of Unani, and the region became a hub for both systems of medicine. \"Today, more than 200 medical inscriptions have been collected by our institution,\" Dr Prasad informed. Furthermore, the records from Tirumukkuddal in Tamil Nadu even detail the establishment of a 15-bed inpatient department with designated surgeons, physicians, and staff, providing a clear picture of early hospital management, the director explained. Housing two museums dedicated to medical history, the NIIMH showcases some original and thematic art and artifacts. The certificates of the first woman anaestheologist, Lady Rupa Bai Furdoonji; the first batch of students of Hyderabad Medical School; some paintings showing Edward Lawrie's Chloroform Commissions; replicas of surgical instruments mentioned in Susruta Samhita, the first surgeon of India, are some of the exhibits dedicated to Hyderabad. Through initiatives like the AYUSH Manuscripts Advanced Repository (AMAR) portal, the NIIMH has cataloged an impressive 16,000 AYUSH manuscripts, with 4,249 digitised. The Institute\u2019s digital endeavours also include the Showcase of Ayurvedic Historical Imprints (SAHI) portal, which features nearly 800 medico-historical artifacts and the e-books of the AYUSH project, offering digital versions of classical textbooks. The Journal of Indian Medical Heritage run by the NIIMH has published writings that mention how Ayurveda dawned during the reign of Nizams, some manuscripts from the Qutub Shahi period, a history of Anaesthesia and Hyderabad Chloroform Commission, list of Arabic, Persian and Urdu Medical Manuscripts, growth of the hospital system in Hyderabad and many more topics, providing readers with insights into Hyderabad's rich medical heritage.",

        "text": "Survey to Identify High-Risk Areas; Will Run from October 21 to November 21\n\nIn response to the rising incidents of landslides and land subsidence in Himachal Pradesh\u2019s capital, Shimla, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) is set to launch a drone-based LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) survey. This survey, which will run from October 21 to November 21, aims to thoroughly assess the city\u2019s geographical conditions and identify areas most vulnerable to landslides. The initiative comes at the recommendation of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), reflecting growing concern over Shimla\u2019s environmental stability.\n\nTo ensure the smooth operation of the survey, necessary formalities for drone usage in Shimla\u2019s no-fly zones have been completed, and permission has been granted for areas under the army\u2019s control. A consultancy firm has been tasked with carrying out the LIDAR survey and is expected to submit its comprehensive report by November 21.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Anupam Kashyap emphasized the importance of this initiative, noting that the survey\u2019s primary goal is to accurately assess the instability of Shimla\u2019s terrain and prepare for future risks. \u201cThis survey will not only enhance the safety of Shimla\u2019s residents but will also contribute to the city\u2019s infrastructure development,\u201d he added.\n\nHow the Survey Will Work\n\nThe LIDAR technology used in this survey will create a detailed 3D image of Shimla\u2019s geographical features through laser pulses emitted from drones. These pulses reflect off the ground and return to sensors, providing precise data on the depth, height, and surface of the terrain. This information will be critical in identifying areas prone to landslides and will help pinpoint the underlying causes of these dangerous incidents. With this knowledge, the SDMA hopes to implement effective preventive measures to minimize future risks.\n\nLandslides: A Growing Threat in Shimla\n\nShimla has seen a sharp increase in landslides over the past few years, particularly during the monsoon season, when heavy rains destabilize the already fragile terrain. These landslides have led to widespread destruction, including blocked roads, damaged homes, and the displacement of numerous families. Experts attribute the worsening situation to unchecked construction on the hills and environmental imbalances, further straining the city\u2019s stability.\n\nThe implementation of drone-based LIDAR technology is expected to be a game-changer in tackling Shimla\u2019s landslide crisis. By enabling a more accurate understanding of the city\u2019s topography and vulnerabilities, authorities will be better equipped to devise sustainable solutions to mitigate the impact of landslides. With the increasing threat of climate change and urban expansion, such advanced technological interventions are becoming essential in ensuring the safety and long-term sustainability of hill cities like Shimla.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Pakistan\u2019s young fast bowler Ihsanullah sparked debate with his recent statement on the Public Digital News podcast, where he claimed that Naseem Shah is a better bowler than India\u2019s star pacer Jasprit Bumrah. He remarked, \u201cAgar dekha jaaye toh Jasprit Bhumrah se accha bowler Naseem Shah hai (If you look at it, Naseem Shah is a better bowler than Jasprit Bumrah).\u201dWhen the host countered Ihsanullah by pointing out that Bumrah\u2019s performances have been superior on paper, the young bowler remained steadfast. The 22-year-old pacer defended his stance, saying, \u201cNaseem Shah also performed well in the 2022 World Cup. Sometimes players can go through a rough patch for a year, but Naseem is still better.\u201dWatch:\u2014 Varungiri0 (@Varungiri0) This bold statement comes amid comparisons between two of the most talented pacers in world cricket today. Bumrah, known for his pinpoint yorkers and ability to thrive under pressure, has been a vital asset for India across formats. Naseem Shah, on the other hand, has showcased his raw pace and swing, becoming a key figure for Pakistan at a very young age.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyghnymvkF8&pp=ygULSWhzYW4gVWxsYWg%3DInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time Pakistani players have preferred Naseem Shah over Bumrah. In an earlier podcast appearance, former Pakistan captain Babar Azam was asked whom he would trust for the final over in a high-pressure T20 match with 10 runs to defend. Without hesitation, Babar replied, \u201cNaseem Shah.\u201d Bumrah\u2019s track record, however, speaks for itself. In the 2024 T20 World Cup, he finished as the third-highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets and was named Player of the Tournament for title-winning Team India. His brilliant two-wicket haul in the final helped India defeat South Africa, securing their first major ICC trophy in 11 years.",

        "text": "Mumbai City FC grabbed their first victory of the Indian Super League 2024-25 season with a 2-1 win in a closely-fought encounter against FC Goa at the Fatorda Stadium on Saturday. \n\nThe Islanders extended their unbeaten streak to 13 games against the Gaurs to reaffirm their upper hand in the recent history of the fixture. Two strikes in the first half from Nikalos Karelis and Yoell van Niff were sufficient for the Islanders with Armando Sadiku spot-kick ending up as a consolation goal for the home side.\n\nMidfielder Van Nieff was the best player on the pitch as he repeatedly penetrated the hosts\u2019 well-organised defence with his range of passing. Hmingthanmawia Ralte, commonly known as Valpuia, was an energetic presence for Mumbai City FC and it was he who earned a free-kick for them from the right flank in the 21st minute that led to the Karelis' opener.\n\nVan Nieff stepped up on the set-piece and delivered a perfectly dipping curled ball inside the box that met an onrushing Nikolaos Karelis at the centre of the 18-yard area. Karelis thundered the ball into the back of the net through his head, getting the Islanders an important lead in the contest. \n\nSeven minutes later, former Mumbai City FC midfielder Rowllin Borges came close to helping Sadiku secure the equaliser for FC Goa. Now with the Gaurs, Borges squared up a pass to Sadiku from the right flank, and the striker twice attempted to score but to no avail.\n\nVan Nieff ensured to capitalise on a moment in the 40th minute, driving an attack forward with his sheer pace and trickery on the ball. He dazzled ahead from the middle, but instead of taking the passing route, the 31-year-old opted to test his fortunes from distance. The ball landed into the bottom left corner and helped Mumbai City FC head into the half-time break with a comfortable two-goal lead.\n\nIn the second half, Valpuia committed a foul on Sadiku inside the 18-yard box in the 54th minute. He was shown a yellow card for the same and Sadiku made sure that he didn\u2019t fluff this time, hammering the ball into the top right corner a minute later to give FC Goa a sneak back into the proceedings. \n\nMumbai City FC held their nerves impressively thereafter though, as FC Goa could not turn the tides despite coach Manolo Marquez making some inspired substitutions with Dejan Drazic and Nim Dorjee coming on late into the game",

        "text": "Mohun Bagan Super Giant pipped their arch-rivals East Bengal FC by 2-0 in the high-octane Kolkata Derby in the Indian Super League at the Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Saturday.\n\nMohun Bagan Super Giant controlled the tempo of the match from start to finish, as a goal each from Jamie Maclaren and Dimitrios Petratos in either half was enough for Jose Molina\u2019s men to secure their eighth win against the Red & Gold Brigade in ISL.\n\nThe players took their time to settle into the electrifying atmosphere of 60,000 odd fans buzzing at the stadium. It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. \n\nHowever, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.\n\nDespite the frustration, the Mariners maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.\n\nTheir relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.\n\nThe second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.\n\nLooking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.\n\nThe 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.",

        "text": "Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior's goals earned Real Madrid an entertaining 2-1 win at Celta Vigo on Saturday to pull them level with La Liga leaders Barcelona. France striker Mbappe started and sent the Spanish champions ahead amid reports he is being investigated for an alleged rape during a visit to Sweden. The 25-year-old was criticised in his homeland for not appearing in his country's recent Nations League matches before the Swedish media reports emerged following his trip during the international break, which Mbappe labelled \"fake news\".\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Williot Swedberg levelled for Celta, who might have snatched a draw, but Vinicius tucked home what proved Madrid's winner after 66 minutes.Madrid, unbeaten in 42 La Liga matches, host Barcelona next weekend in the Clasico, after the Catalans welcome Sevilla on Sunday.\"I'm happy because we won after the international break which is not always easy,\" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told Real Madrid TV.\"When they equalised our changes gave new energy to the team and it was a very important win.\"(Mbappe and Vinicius) trained very well in the break, improved their conditions, and they started today's game very well and they have to continue.\"With captain Dani Carvajal sidelined for months to come, Ancelotti replaced the Spanish right-back with Lucas Vazquez.The Italian set up with a three centre-back system, breaking away from his favoured four-man defensive line to accomodate Vazquez as a wing-back.Celta Vigo midfielder Swedberg missed a fine opening in the first half with Thibaut Courtois tipping his effort wide when the Swede ran through on goal.Madrid's new look defence gave Celta plenty of breathing room in attack but the visitors also looked dangerous at the other end, without carving out clear-cut chances.Mbappe slammed Madrid ahead with a long-range effort, which flew into the top corner after Fran Beltran gave the ball away and Eduardo Camavinga laid it off to the striker.It was the forward's first strike from outside the area for Madrid, his sixth league goal and his eighth in 12 appearances across all competitions since joining from Paris Saint-Germain this summer.Celta striker Borja Iglesias rolled home from an offside position as Claudio Giraldez's mid-table side searched for an equaliser.It was a scrappy yet lively clash and Vinicius headed over Fede Valverde's cross and fired a near post effort off-target before the break.Swedberg pulled Celta level with a calm finish in the 51st minute after a fine move from the Galicians, with former Barcelona defender Oscar Mingueza curling in a low cross for the midfielder to stroke home.Vinicius had a goal ruled out for offside against Mbappe in the build-up as the second half continued with the same openness as the first.'A top professional'Javier Manquillo made a brave block to deny Mbappe before Ancelotti sent on veteran midfielder Luka Modric to try and regain control of the match.The 39-year-old Croatian, who became Real Madrid's oldest ever player ahead of 1950s and 1960s Hungarian great Ferenc Puskas, made an instant impact.Less than three minutes after coming on, Modric produced a superb low pass to play in Vinicius, who slid Madrid in front past Vicente Guaita.\"It's a pleasure to coach Modric, to work with him, everything he's been able to achieve and is achieving, he deserves -- he's a top professional and a great guy,\" said Ancelotti.Courtois thwarted Jonathan Bamba after the midfielder darted in behind Antonio Rudiger and tried to prod home.Celta substitute Anastasios Douvikas should have levelled in stoppage time but rolled wide with just Courtois to beat.\"It's bittersweet because we went toe-to-toe with Real Madrid and we were better for much of the game, but we're left with the feeling once more that for our mistakes we let in two goals,\" said Celta midfielder Beltran.\"It would be easy to say 'this is Real Madrid', but (our) team was better... we lost three points, but I think we played a very good game.\"Earlier, Athletic Bilbao moved provisionally fourth by thumping Espanyol 4-1.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "A new champion will emerge in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium, as South Africa and New Zealand face off in the final.Both teams have exceeded expectations to reach this stage, demonstrating resilience, skill, and determination throughout the tournament.South Africa, runners-up in the 2023 edition, are aiming to go one step further and lift the coveted trophy. Meanwhile, New Zealand, who were runners-up in both 2009 and 2010, are equally determined to break their finals curse and claim their first T20 World Cup title.Both sides have been exceptional during the tournament, and the final promises an exciting clash between two teams eager to secure their maiden T20 World Cup crown.If the rest of the tournament is any indication, cricket fans are in for a thrilling conclusion.Full of twists and turns, the tournament\u2019s bragging rights and trophy will once again head south of the equator\u2013this time to either South Africa or New Zealand\u2013after the Proteas\u2019 emphatic win over defending champions Australia.On the other side of the draw, New Zealand made headlines by thrashing India in their opening match and holding their nerve in a semi-final win over the West Indies.New Zealand are looking to claim their second ICC trophy, their first being the ICC Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup in 2000. South Africa, on the other hand, are hoping to break their title drought and secure their first-ever ICC trophy.Reflecting on the potential victory, Chloe Tryon said, as quoted by the ICC, \u201cIt would mean so much. We\u2019ve had incredible support back home, and we really want to unite the country. We wish the whole nation could be here with us, but we\u2019ve got plenty of South Africans cheering us on from the stands. Honestly, I don\u2019t think words can describe how much it would mean to us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re playing for everyone\u2013our families, friends, and all those back home gathering in different places to watch and support us. It would be such a special moment. Hopefully, we can make it happen on Sunday,\u201d she added.Suzie Bates also reflected on the significance of winning, saying, \u201cTo be honest, ever since 2009, as a cricketer, when you play team sports, your ultimate goal is to be a world champion. I think all those tournaments have motivated me, and I know they\u2019ve motivated Sophie as well. Some of the younger girls, fortunately or unfortunately, don\u2019t have that same extra motivation.\u201d\u201cBut yes, it feels like everything has built up to this moment, and we get one more opportunity tomorrow to have a good game. The most overwhelming thing is that it\u2019s felt like a really long journey to get back to this point,\u201d Bates added.Squads:South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe TryonNew Zealand: Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.

        "title": "The storm that wasn\u2019t: how Chennai fared",
        "text": "When this year\u2019s first rain spell of northeast monsoon arrived with a downpour a few days ago, scenes of inundation from previous years were indeed repeated. But many areas of the city recovered within a day, partly because of the concerted efforts and immediate preparation of Tamil Nadu government agencies to face extreme situations and weather warning, and also because the rain stopped earlier than expected.\n\nAlso Read: In Pictures | Aftermath of Tamil Nadu rains\n\nSeeking lessons from last year\u2019s Cyclone Michaung that spelled disaster, the government had prepared for disaster management and planned for flood-relief and rescue operations. About 300 flood-relief centres were opened and food was distributed through 98 community kitchens. The field reviews by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, Ministers and officials helped accelerate flood-management work in different parts of the city.\n\nAlso Read: How Cyclone Michaung formed, intensified, rained, and dissipated | Explained\n\nSanitation workers and Greater Chennai Corporation workers persevered round the clock, bailing out stagnant water with heavy-duty pumps and clearing garbage and sewage. The appointment of nodal officers to coordinate among agencies helped to monitor the work.\n\nAlert downgraded\n\nAlthough Chennai recorded an average rainfall of 13 cm-14 cm on October 15, parts of the city and those on the fringes received more than 20 cm. Cholavaram, with the heaviest rainfall of 30 cm, Red Hills with 28 cm, and Avadi with 25 cm, bore the brunt. In contrast to the extreme weather event predicted for over two days when the Regional Meteorological Centre issued a red alert, rainfall ceased on October 16 as the depression changed its trajectory and weakened. S. Balachandran, Additional Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said, \u201cThere is no perfect forecasting system, and not all systems are fully understood. Each depression behaves differently due to thermodynamical conditions. When the system was in the ocean, there was a risk involved; which is why, we issued the alert. It was to caution people not to panic. Understanding weather systems is a continuous process.\u201d\n\nWeather experts suggested that extension agents be trained in assisting disaster management agencies in translating forecasts into alerts. Raghu Murtugudde, professor at IIT Bombay, said, \u201cThe extension agents will be experts in communicating the alerts in regional languages and guiding people to appropriate actions. There are some systematic biases in extreme rainfall predictions since the tropical systems explode rapidly and are hard to predict.\u201d\n\nThe Chennai Corporation estimated that about 540 localities reported waterlogging, including TNHB Colony at Korattur, Venus Colony at Alwarpet, and G.K.M. Colony at Kolathur. Korattur and Red Hills were among the worst-affected places, where localities were marooned well after the rainfall abated. People had to be rescued in boats at Korattur and drones were deployed to deliver relief materials to residents of Kumaran Colony at Red Hills. Water receded quickly in many inundated areas of south Chennai by the morning of October 16. Geeta Padmanabhan of Thiruvanmiyur said that while a few avenues escaped as drains were desilted, residents had to endure water stagnation for two days in areas like Kamaraj Nagar as the storm-water drain was not desilted.\n\nIn areas around Old Mahabalipuram Road, which get engulfed in water every monsoon, residents like Raj Natarajan of Semmencheri expressed concerns over recurrence of waterlogging in some areas unless Okkiyum Maduvu and the marsh opposite the ELCOT SEZ are cleaned. But it was also true that areas prone to flooding showed visible changes following interventions. The interventions and infrastructure improvements since last year did bring about a change in areas including parts of Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Tansi Nagar, S.V.S. Nagar at Valasaravakkam, Porur junction, Poonamallee High Road near St. Andrew\u2019s Church, and Narayanapuram.\n\nAlso Read: Chennai Rains: Volunteers for the season\n\nExtensive desilting of storm-water drains and construction of a new drain network to a distance of 785 km, out of the planned 1,135 km across the city, have made the difference this time, say Corporation officials. The reconstruction of the Thanikachalam Nagar drain, which was in a shambles for years, seems to have resolved the recurrent issues of flooding at Kolathur and Madhavaram. The storm-water drain built by the Highways Department helped 12 stagnation points on the East Coast Road.\n\nHiccups persist\n\nHowever, there were hiccups in terms of the tardy implementation of the storm-water drain and flood-mitigation projects, missing and incomplete links in the drains, and lack of connectivity between the drains and the water channels. A delay in getting approval from the Highways Department held up the construction of a channel linking the Narayanapuram lake to the Pallikaranai marsh through the 200-Feet Radial Road. The Chennai Corporation has identified nearly 50 locations, including Vembuliamman Koil Street at K.K.Nagar, for gaps in the drain network.\n\nThe Metro Rail construction poses a major challenge this monsoon. It has aggravated the waterlogging in south Chennai where residents say the drains get clogged by debris. Nearly 22 locations in the vicinity of the Metro Rail construction sites in various zones were flooded. For instance, the Corporation installed 19 pumps to bail out water from Millers Road and Purasawalkam High Road, but water drained only after a few days. \u201cWorkers dump debris clogging the drains. They are unaware of the consequences. Excavation at the construction site takes away road space and obstructs the natural flow of water,\u201d says a source at Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). The situation remains grim in some localities of north Chennai that stare at imminent waterlogging owing to incomplete civic projects. Pulianthope, Pattalam, Perambur, Choolai, and Vyasarpadi, which have faced inundation for years, remained flooded even after the rain stopped on October 16.\n\nDevelopment projects executed at Madipakkam, another flood-prone area, had open ends, making the locality vulnerable to inundation. Kuberan Nagar Extension, Ram Nagar South Extension, LIC Nagar, and Govindasamy Nagar were affected, owing to incomplete road projects and storm-water drains and the absence of link to waterways. P. Saravana Kumar, founder of Madipakkam Social Service Trust, points out that rain in the days to come would determine the impact of the storm-water drain. The surplus water channel from the Keelkattalai lake needs to be improved to end flooding at Madipakkam.\n\nHowever, Corporation officials say that compared with last year, water stagnation has come down at Madipakkam after the storm-water drain was built and roads were restored. A few streets suffered from minor issues. Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Works) V. Sivakrishnamurthy says the work to prevent inundation near the Ganesapuram subway in north Chennai will be completed in a few weeks as Southern Railway has agreed to permit line block to build a culvert beneath the tracks.\n\nIn neighbouring Tiruvallur district, which was battered by massive rain, officials of the rank of Deputy Collector supervised the work in taluks and ensured better coordination. \u201cWe have no control over water release as the Araniyar and Kosasthalaiyar originate in Andhra Pradesh. This time, we got live updates from Andhra Pradesh through our engineers,\u201d says Collector T. Prabhushankar.\n\nThe space for buffer storage in major reservoirs saved the city from riverine flooding this time and the rivers\u2019 capacity has been improved by 30%. The projects implemented by the Water Resources Department (WRD) to improve major waterways and surplus courses and the controlled water release from the lakes instilled confidence in officials of managing a rainfall of up to 30 cm-40 cm. The department implemented additional projects costing Rs. 2.30 crore to desilt the major waterways. However, Virugambakkam and Anna Nagar residents point to the insufficient carrying capacity of canals, including Virugambakkam-Arumbakkam canal and Otteri Nullah, and lack of desilting. They flag the risk of floodwater spillover and malfunctioning of the drain network during the rain.\n\nPermanent solution?\n\nThe government had been preparing for three months to tackle the monsoon, said Mr. Stalin. He also said a permanent solution to water stagnation would be found soon. The pending projects, based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee for Mitigation and Management of Flood Risk in the Chennai Metropolitan Area, led by former IAS official V. Thiruppugazh, would be finished soon.\n\nMayor R. Priya said, \u201cWe shortlisted the issues faced last year, constituency-wise, and started sorting them out since July. We had plans for 35 low-level areas and installed 100-HP motors in flood-prone locations. A coordination committee was formed to address issues of waterlogging where the Metro Rail project is in progress.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are working to remove the floating garbage from the canals and clean the silt catch pits. We are planning to resolve issues in areas where we have faced problems so far this year.\u201d\n\nTwo government agencies that managed to function almost seamlessly were Chennai Metrowater and Tangedco. Power shutdown was averted except at a few places like west Velachery and T. Nagar where water stagnation on roads and leakage of underground cables resulted in the outages. The sewers carried nearly 953 million litres of sewage on October 15, as against the daily load of 650 million litres. Additional sewer equipment, replacement of sewers in vulnerable locations, and monitoring of leaks through the GIS command centre helped the water agency.\n\nSources in the WRD note that unless the 29 macro drains, including Otteri Nullah, Veerangal Odai, and Captain Cotton Canal, are made free of encroachments and desilted, the scope of flood control will be limited. A wholistic, long-term flood management plan for the entire Chennai Metropolitan Area, instead of Chennai in isolation, would make the city flood-proof. The government must frame a policy to freeze development near waterbodies and waterways.\n\nExperts say the city is not fully prepared for flood management and mitigation. Chennai is largely involved in firefighting rather than finding comprehensive solutions for urban flood resilience. S. Thirunavukkarasu, former Public Works Department official who specialises in hydraulics and hydrology, says, \u201cWhat we are doing now, including construction of storm-water drains, is crisis management. We need to find the root cause of flooding in each watercourse. A comprehensive policy for restoration of waterbodies, with stringent strategies to increase storage to match their annual run-off, and re-establishing the missing links is needed.\u201d Deepening waterbodies would be one of the strategies to shield Chennai from floods and droughts, he adds.\n\n(With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez, Sunitha Sekar, R.

        "summary": "The first \u2018storm\u2019 this monsoon season, for a variety of reasons, did not drown the city as it was feared. The primary reason was that the actual forecast was off the mark, the low pressurein the Bay of Bengal did two things \u2014 it veered off course and lost power, stopping short of the pounding rain forecast. Further, work in terms of building storm-water networks within the city, the constant presence of Ministers and officials overseeing relief work on the ground, and the partnership with a vast network of civic volunteers, all influenced the outcome positively. However, some areas still struggled with water stagnation for a couple of days at least even after the rain ceased. K. Lakshmi finds out more.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has consistently expressed his deep love for Test cricket, which he views as the pinnacle of the sport. Throughout his career, Kohli has often spoken about the unique challenges that the longest format of the game presents, emphasizing that it tests a player's character, mental strength, and skill across different conditions. What adds to Kohli's superstar aura is his energetic and passionate interaction with crowds during matches. One of his signature gestures on the field is when he turns toward the stands and pumps up the crowd, urging them to cheer louder. This act of rallying the crowd is typical of Kohli's aggressive and enthusiastic approach to the game, whether he's batting, fielding, or captaining. It shows his deep connection with fans and his ability to channel the energy of the crowd into his own performance and that of the team.And when that crowd belongs to his IPL team RCB, then they will surely respond to Virat's calls.With India needing quick wickets in a bid to defend a low score of 107 against New Zealand on Day 5, Virat, standing in the slips urged the crowd to make some more noise.A clip of the moment was shared by the official broadcaster:\u2014 JioCinema (@JioCinema) Kohli often makes this gesture during pivotal moments in matches, especially in high-pressure situations. Whether it's urging support during a crucial partnership, celebrating a key wicket, or raising the energy during tense periods, Kohli's ability to involve the fans plays a significant role in creating an intense atmosphere. His charisma and emotional expressions on the field not only lift the morale of the team but also amplify the excitement in the stadium.This crowd interaction is one of the many reasons Kohli has such a strong bond with Indian cricket fans, who see him as not just a player but a passionate leader who thrives on the collective energy of the team and the spectators.",

        "text": "New Zealand survived a hostile Jasprit Bumrah spell to foil India's attempt to add a final-day twist to an absorbing series-opener, slaying the cricketing giants at home by eight wickets and ending a 36-year long wait to taste Test success in the country, here Sunday This is Kiwis' first Test win on the Indian soil after the John Wright-led outfit towelled India by 136 runs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, way back in 1988. Even hunting a modest 107 on the fifth day against a world-class attack could be nervy, and New Zealand did that after some initial scares. Will Young (48 not out) and Rachin Ravindra (39 not out) fuelled their chase with a 75-run stand for the third wicket, handholding their side a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");However, the Indians will not be an entirely despondent lot despite the defeat as they showed admirable spunk to claw back from the depths of getting bowled out for 46 in the first innings.They will need to build on it and pretty quickly too as the second Test at Pune starts on October 24.The Rohit Sharma-marshalled side will also have to think deeply about retaining Sarfaraz Khan, who made a 150 in the second dig, as Shubman Gill is poised to return after recovering from a stiff neck.The other point they will moot long is whether to go back to the three-pacer strategy or continue three spinners, a move which backfired here spectacularly, in Pune.New Zealand victory did not come without its share of drama once the day's play started at 10.15am, a wet outfield pushing back the proceedings by an hour.Bumrah (2/29), operating from the dressing room end, found appreciable movement and Tom Latham fell in the first over of the day itself for his overnight naught.Latham was behind the ball to cover the in-dipper but it swung back further to thud on to his pads as umpire Michael Gough raised his finger after vociferous appeal from the bowler and the crowd.The New Zealand captain reviewed the decision more in hope than in conviction and the DRS confirmed his worst fears as well, and he had to walk back.India might just have felt the absence of a third pacer as both Bumrah and Siraj found movement and carry to trouble the Kiwi batters under a largely overcast skies.Kuldeep Yadav, who gave away 26 runs in three overs, had replaced Akash Deep in the eleven for this Test after India went with a three-pronged pace attack against Bangladesh recently.Devon Conway, the other overnight batter, was shaky throughout his stay and would consider himself fortunate to have found a last-minute edge on a Bumrah skidder that otherwise would have trapped him plumb in front.But as luck would have it, the ball beat the gully fielder and raced to the fence.However, the left-hander eventually reached the road's end when Bumrah, operating from around the stumps, caught him right in front of the wicket with another one that skidded and swung back into him.The on-field umpire did not relent but the DRS upheld India's appeal to send Conway (17) back.New Zealand were 35 for two at that point, and one would say the match in balance as a couple of more strikes could have left the cat among the pigeons.But Young and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, found some solidity to resist the Indian charge.Once the sun came out for a while, the ball-movement was much more predictable and the Kiwi batters used favourable conditions to rack in a few boundaries to ease the pressure.Ravindra Jadeja, who started with a no-ball, too did not make much of an impression, conceding 14 runs in his first two overs.There was not much on the Chinnaswamy pitch for him to exploit either as the 22-yard track did not disintegrate on the final day, courtesy rain and cooler climes here.With the margin getting reduced alongside each run, the New Zealand batters became more daring and brought out their shots from the shelf, such as a clean hoist over mid-wicket for a six off left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep.The defining moment came when Will Young turned Jadeja for two to collect the winning runs as Kiwis dressing room turned into a hub of celebration.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Under overcast skies, the ball seamed around appreciably, Jasprit Bumrah threatened to pick a wicket every second delivery, and the crowd appealed almost every ball, but New Zealand absorbed it all to ease their way to the target of 107 once things settled down a touch.Will Young was the calming influence after Bumrah got Tom Latham second ball of the day, but Devon Conway did his bit - jumping around, wearing blows on the body, but not playing loose shots. By the time Bumrah finally got Conway for 17 off 39 balls, he was at the fag end of his spell and New Zealand had got 35 on the board already. The fielders did their bit, having saved at least 11 runs by then.Thereupon, though, India's misreading of the pitch came back to hurt them. They didn't have a third seamer to use the conditions, and Young and Rachin Ravindra knocked off the remaining runs with relative ease.While Bumrah bowled, though, you struggled to see where the next run would come from. He drew 22 false shots in eight overs, consistently drawing movement off the surface. Latham might have thought he had the accurate inswinger covered, but the ball pitched and nipped in even further to get him. Conway thought he had the angle covered from around the wicket, but this one swung after pitching, beginning to change its path halfway between pitching and reaching Conway, beating the outside edge and trapping him in front.Bumrah was in his seventh over now, and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, all but sealed the deal when he got two boundaries off the first three balls he faced. He steered the first one behind square, and then got the rare loose ball from Bumrah - a full one on the pads.Young then paddled and punched Ravindra Jadeja for boundaries in his first over to get the package ready. Not trusting the Bengaluru weather to hold up after lunch, the two batters attacked the spinners to put a nice little bow on the top. Young's drop-kicked six off Kuldeep Yadav was even Mark Waugh-like.India made a remarkable comeback from being bowled out for 46 in the first innings, but in the end, New Zealand hung in long enough to seal only their third Test win in India.\r\n\r\nSource link",

On day two of the game, after the opening day was washed out due to rain, India were shot out for 46 -- their third-lowest Test score overall and the fewest they ever posted in a Test match at home. Under overcast skies, India were undone by grand exhibition of seam bowling from Matt Henry (5/15) and Will O'Rourke (4/22), which eventually played a big part in them losing the match.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"I said it at the press conference after day 2, we knew it'd be a challenge, with overcast conditions and tricky pitch. We didn't think we'll be 46 all out but due credit to NZ. It set us back and games like this will happen.\"Gotta take the good things forward. We've been here before, conceding home losses; these things happen. Two Tests to go, we know what it takes and will give it all in the next two Tests,\" said Rohit after the match.Though India made 426 in the second innings, thanks to a counter-attacking 177-run stand for the fourth wicket between Sarfaraz Khan (150) and Rishabh Pant (99), Rohit remarked he was proud of how the two young batters played.\"It was a good effort in the second innings with the bat. We knew what lies ahead, get as many as possible. A couple of guys stood out, was great to watch. When you're 350 behind, you can't think too much.

        "text": "When New Zealand take to the field for the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final against South Africa in Dubai, Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine, and Lea Tahuhu, affectionately called the \u201cgrandmas of the team,\u201d will aim to lift their maiden title and reach the pinnacle of their T20I careers.A new champion will emerge in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium as South Africa and New Zealand face off in the final. Both teams have surpassed expectations, displaying resilience, skill, and determination throughout the tournament.Bates, Devine, and Tahuhu collectively boast an impressive 402 Women\u2019s T20I appearances between them.Moments after New Zealand\u2019s stunning win over West Indies in the semi-finals of the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024, there was a heartwarming moment as three of New Zealand\u2019s most experienced players embraced and posed for the cameras.\u201cWe are the grandmas of the team,\u201d Bates remarked a day ahead of the final, referring to herself, Sophie Devine, and Lea Tahuhu, as quoted by the ICC.\u201cWe are still standing, I think. Lea with her bionic knee, Sophie having dealt with a lot as captain over the past few years, and me just keeping on going.\u201d\u201cIt was a really special moment, knowing we\u2019ve been through some tough times. The three of us, in particular, have experienced the ups and downs. To have that moment, realising we had made the semi-finals and given ourselves a chance, was really special. We old girls look after each other and try to keep up with the younger players,\u201d she added.Bates and Tahuhu played pivotal roles in the semi-final win. Bates delivered the final over, with 14 runs to defend, after contributing a crucial knock at the top of the order, while Tahuhu claimed the vital wicket of Hayley Matthews when the match was on a knife-edge.Devine, as captain, has been outstanding and will step down from the role after the tournament, hoping to sign off on Sunday with the trophy in hand.\u201cI think she has been absolutely brilliant in her captaincy,\u201d Bates said.\u201cShe\u2019s been so calm. The decisions she has made in these conditions have been excellent. It\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s stepping down, but thankfully it\u2019s just as captain,\u201d she added.A title win would not only be a fantastic way for the trio to cap off a successful tournament, but it would also send an inspiring message to women in their 30s, says Bates, who is set to become the most-capped player in women\u2019s international cricket.\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m over 35 and still competing, and that I\u2019ve never given up on my dream, I think, sends a message. As women, there\u2019s often societal pressure to give up on pursuing your dreams,\u201d Bates said.\u201cPeople expect you to do other things at a certain age, and that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about women\u2019s sport\u2013it\u2019s growing every day, breaking down barriers. It\u2019s not just young players; we have players in our team returning after having children,\u201d she concluded.Sunday\u2019s final is scheduled for 18:00 local time at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

        "text": "Fort Lauderdale: Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will feature in next year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced on Saturday. Messi and his team-mates will kick-off the tournament in the opening game at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, on Sunday, June 15, Infantino added. The FIFA president was speaking on the field at Inter's Chase Stadium moments after Messi scored a hat-trick as the team broke the MLS regular season points record with a 6-2 win over the New England Revolution. Miami, who this month won Major League Soccer's Supporters' Shield for the best regular season record, will take the qualification slot designated for the host nation. \"Inter Miami qualifies as the host country representative team on the basis of the club's outstanding and consistent 34-match campaign that saw them secure the shield with two MLS matches to play,\" FIFA said in a statement. The official champions of MLS are determined by the MLS Cup playoffs which begin next week and conclude with the final on December 7. Miami are the favourites to win the playoffs but the FIFA decision to select the regular season winners ensures the involvement of the Argentine superstar. The participation of the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi is a much-needed boost to the profile of the new-look tournament, which FIFA hope will capture the imagination of the global television audience as well as fans in the United States ahead of the World Cup in 2026. The competition could pit Messi against top European club opposition for the first time since he left Paris Saint Germain last year to move to Miami. The 32-team tournament will feature title winning teams from each of FIFA's continental confederations. Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich are among the 12 European teams who have qualified for the tournament while Argentina's River Plate and Boca Juniors and Brazil's Flamengo are among six South American teams. FIFA has yet to announce any broadcast deals or sponsorship contracts for the tournament and the competition has faced some opposition within the game. Players union FIFpro and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar. Opponents of the new tournament have said it adds further congestion to an already crowded schedule and increases the workload of players. The last version of the Club World Cup featured seven teams in a knockout format and was won by Manchester City who beat Brazil's Fluminense in the final in Saudi Arabia. FIFA plan to hold the expanded tournament every four years although no host as yet to be chosen for the 2029 edition.",

With Steve Smith returning to number four after a mixed outing as an opener and all-rounder Cameron Green ruled out of the Test summer due to back issues for which he has opted to undergo a surgery, Australia could see a new opening partner for Usman Khawaja, be it Head or all-rounder Mitchell Marsh from within the team or anyone from trio of Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw, who have been scoring well in domestic cricket.

From my side of things, I have got no favourite position. I have only got a position that is best for the team and what the team needs from me.

I have said that in the past, I just want to play in the Australian cricket team and any position in the Australian cricket team you take.\u201dHead is one of the contenders to take the opening spot due to the success he has witnessed as one in white-ball cricket. His opening contributions in Tests have been decent, making 223 runs in five Tests and five innings with a fifty to his name. With Head set to miss the upcoming ODI series of three matches against Pakistan starting from November 4 due to paternity leave, Head said that he will make his decisions around his family more and it is his teammates and family who drive him to play. \u201cI am not really interested in the individual stuff or where my career might go to, aspirations from an individual perspective.

        "text": "Hyderabad: Fernandez Hospital Educational and Research Foundation organised a symposium on advanced gynaecological ultrasound titled \u201cUltrasonography of the Adnexa and Endometrium: Optimising Diagnosis in Everyday Practice\u201d on Sunday.The event was facilitated by Dr Mala Sibal, a renowned expert in gynaecological ultrasound, and focused on how modern ultrasound techniques are transforming the diagnosis and treatment of gynaecological conditions. Over 200 practising gynaecologists, radiologists, pathologists, postgraduates in obstetrics and gynaecology, and trainees in gynaecological ultrasound attended the symposium from across India.Ultrasound plays a critical role in identifying and managing a wide range of conditions, including gynaecological cancers. By using high-resolution imaging, doctors can accurately detect abnormalities in the reproductive system, such as ovarian cysts or growths in the uterus, which may indicate early signs of cancer. This early detection is crucial because it allows for timely intervention, significantly improving patient outcomes.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mala Sibal said, \u201cUltrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice in gynaecology, including detecting gynaecological cancers. Despite advances in ultrasound technology, emerging literature in the field, and the tremendous impact of accurate and early diagnosis on appropriate medical management, quality ultrasound services are still scarce in many parts of the world. There is significant potential for its expanded use in improving women's healthcare both nationally and globally\u2014 a goal that can be achieved through dedicated teaching, training, and knowledge sharing, which was the key objectives of today\u2019s symposium.\u201dThe symposium highlighted the importance of using ultrasound to differentiate between benign and malignant growths. Specialists discussed how specific markers, visible on ultrasounds, can indicate whether a mass is likely to be cancerous. This level of detail helps doctors make faster, more accurate diagnoses, reducing the need for more invasive procedures.",

Concerns over Dhoni's participation remain due to his age, knee injury and being tight-lipped about his possible plans of retirement after CSK suffered an exit in the group stage. There has been no word in the rumour mill about Dhoni still wanting to compete in the top T20 league.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Top former and current stars have shown their class in the T10 format, including former Australia star David Warner.With the likes of former India stars including Robin Uthappa, Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan and many more, taking part in the different T10 leagues, the prospect of seeing Dhoni in the format remains a possibility.\"Absolutely, I think outside of the top level of international cricketers playing, current India internationals are not allowed to play outside of the Indian Premier League. The recently retired players, almost all the big names of India, have come to play T10. So yes, we can expect MS Dhoni to be playing T10 when he makes up his mind,\" Shaji told ANI.The ten franchises, including the two new ones, Bolts Ajman and UP Nawabs, joined the other eight featuring New York Strikers, Deccan Gladiators, Northern Warriors, Morrisville Samp Army, Delhi Bulls, Bangla Tigers, Team Abu Dhabi and Chennai Brave Jaguars - to complete their rosters.A total of 179 international megastars will participate in the 2024 Abu Dhabi T10, making it the biggest season ever.Players from 11 different nations were drafted, showcasing the truly global nature of the Abu Dhabi T10. Leading the selections were 20 players from the West Indies, 17 from the UAE, 15 from Sri Lanka, and 14 from Pakistan. Afghanistan contributed 11, while nine English, five Zimbabwean, three Bangladeshi, three Australian, and two each from New Zealand and South Africa were also picked, highlighting the tournament's international appeal.Matthew Boucher, Abu Dhabi Cricket CEO, believes that the format can take off on a global level and said, \"It seems like T10 is having a fantastic couple of years.

If they had scored we couldn't have said anything,\" said Conte.Napoli don't have European football as a result of their collapse following a first Scudetto since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona.And under Conte they have quickly re-established themselves as title challengers, with the advantage of not having the expanded Champions League jamming up their schedule.Kvaratskhelia is key to Conte's plans but the Georgia winger is yet to sign a contract extension, with his current deal expiring in 2027.Italian media report that Kvaratskhelia is aiming for eight million euros ($8.7 million) a season, significantly more than Napoli are willing to offer the breakout star of their historic 2023 title triumph.",

It is apparently a tradition to do a photo ceremony on a newly-weds\u2019 first Karwa Chauth.Karwa Chauth is a Hindu festival celebrated largely by Hindu women coming from the northern and western parts of India. Most women observe a fast without consuming any food and water and the fast is mainly done to seek divine blessings for their husband\u2019s long life and prosperity.However, while the tradition initially involved just women fasting, praying for the long life of their husbands, now even the husbands fast for their wives. A newly-wed couple said, \u201cMy husband has been fasting because he believes both of us should be blessed with good health and long life. Also because he has grown up seeing his mother wait for hours together for the moon to come to break her fast, he feels fasting together will decrease the burden a bit.\u201dA 45-year-old woman put a completely different view forward. She said, \u201cAfter a certain age, ensuring that one has to do a fast despite not being in a position to, is not possible.

        "text": "Following New Zealand\u2019s historic eight-wicket win in the first Test match against India in Bengaluru, Kiwi skipper Tom Latham heaped praise on youngster Rachin Ravindra for his ability to calm the dressing room. During New Zealand\u2019s first inning, Ravindra displayed a stupendous performance. The 24-year-old played a 134-run knock from 157 balls at a strike rate of 85.35. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Latham hailed Ravindra for making a 137-run partnership with a number 9 batter Tim Southee. \u201cThe way he [Ravindra] played the situation of the game was really important for us. A 137-run partnership with a No. 9 batter is awesome. I think the way he played leading up to that [second] new ball was really important. Even this morning, the way he came out with the game in the balance where another couple of wickets there and it could have been a nervy 50-60 runs, but I think the way he calmed the dressing room with his composure out there for a young guy in his ninth or tenth Test to play in that fashion is obviously exciting,\u201d Latham was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying. The Kiwi skipper also praised pacer William O\u2019Rourke for his \u201coutstanding\u201d bowling in the Bengaluru Test.\u201cWe\u2019re blessed with a couple of guys on our side, a couple of young guys that have stepped up in this match. I think the way Will [O\u2019Rourke] bowled was outstanding, but I think I also look at the other two seamers, Tim Southee and Matt Henry, the pressure they were able to apply with that new ball on day one was outstanding. Matt got the rewards and Will got the rewards in that first innings,\u201d he added.He added that the victory over India in Bengaluru was a proud moment for the Kiwi side and they will celebrate it.\u201cIt was a combination of everything. [It is] a really special feeling to be in this position. I think the work we did in the first and second innings with the ball and then obviously with the bat, really set the game up for us. It\u2019s obviously a proud moment for this group and the one we will celebrate,\u201d he further added.Chasing a total of 107 runs, Jasprit Bumrah (2/29) showed some fight for India, but Will Young (48*) and Rachin (39*) helped the Kiwis complete a comprehensive win. Earlier, India had taken a 106-run lead in the second innings, scoring 462/10 in response to New Zealand\u2019s total of 402/10 in the first innings. Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (35 from 52 balls, with six fours) and skipper Rohit Sharma (52 from 63 balls, with eight fours and a six) gave India a solid start with a 72-run opening stand.Sarfaraz then took charge, first forming a 136-run partnership with Virat Kohli (70 from 102 balls, with eight fours and a six) and later a 177-run stand with Pant (99 from 105 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) to put India in the lead. However, the introduction of the new ball saw India lose seven wickets for just 54 runs, with the middle order failing to contribute significantly. William O\u2019Rourke (3/92) and Matt Henry (3/102) took full advantage of the new ball, dismantling the Indian batting line-up just when a massive lead seemed likely. Spinner Ajaz Patel took two wickets, while Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee chipped in with one each. In their first innings, New Zealand posted 402 in response to India\u2019s 356. A magnificent century from Rachin Ravindra (134 from 157 balls, with 13 fours and four sixes) and a quickfire 65 from Southee (73 balls, eight fours, and four sixes) helped lift New Zealand from 233/7 to 402, thanks to a 137-run stand for the eighth wicket. Devon Conway (91 from 105 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes) also made a valuable contribution at the top. Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99) bowled well for India, while Mohammed Siraj picked up two wickets, and Ravichandran Ashwin and Bumrah took one each. Earlier, after electing to bat, India had a nightmare start under overcast, pace-friendly conditions.

        "text": "Hyderabad: The Jaipur Pink Panthers and the Bengal Warriorz played out a very tightly contested and highly entertaining game at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, Gachibowli, Hyderabad. The Jaipur Pink Panthers had to work hard, and eventually managed to win the contest with a 39-34 scoreline. For the Jaipur Pink Panthers, captain Arjun Deshwal scored 15 points, while Nitin Dhankar registered 13 points of his own for the Bengal Warriorz.Fazel Atrachali and the Bengal Warriorz began the game very well, with the defensive unit working in tandem to foil a flurry of Jaipur Pink Panther attacks in the early exchanges. Both sides were patient in the first phase of play, with the Bengal Warriorz working hard to hold onto a slender lead.But at the midway stage of the first half, the Jaipur Pink Panthers captain Arjun Deshwal wrestled the momentum away from the Bengal Warriorz. Shortly after, a solid tackle by Abhijeet Malik helped inflict an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers storm into the lead. And even though the Bengal Warriorz fought hard after that, it was the Jaipur Pink Panthers who finished the first half with a 3-point lead. At the half-time break, the Jaipur Pink Panthers led 21-18.The two sides began cautiously in the second half as well as they weren\u2019t keen on conceding any ground. While Fazel Atrachali led the Bengal Warriorz defence brilliantly, Arjun Deshwal was his talismanic self for the Jaipur Pink Panthers.With just under 10 minutes left in the contest, Abhijeet Malik inflicted an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers extend the lead to a 4-point one. At this point, the score read 29-25 in favour of the Jaipur Pink Panthers. It was an action-packed final phase of the game as Nitin Dhankar brought Bengal Warriorz right back into the contest. The Jaipur Pink Panthers, who seemed to be one step ahead all through up until then, were suddenly on the backfoot.But it was Abhishek KS\u2019s super tackle that sealed the contest for the Jaipur Pink Panthers, who walked off the mat with a closely contested win.",

        "text": "Following India\u2019s disappointing eight-wicket loss against New Zealand in the first Test match in Bengaluru, former cricketer Madan Lal believes that the hosts will \u201cbounce back\u201d in the three-game long-format series.Chasing a total of 107 runs, Jasprit Bumrah (2/29) showed some fight for India, but Will Young (48*) and Rachin (39*) helped the Kiwis complete a comprehensive win. Speaking to ANI, Madan Lal said that India has a strong side. However, the former cricketer also warner Rohit Sharma and said that the Kiwis are not like other teams and are a good fighter.\u201cI think the Indian Team is very very strong, but you know New Zealand is not like other teams, they are a good fighter, they always come back. They have a good bowling lineup and they have the best fielding side but now the only thing is India has to be very careful how they can manage the game and that is very important,\u201d Madan Lal told ANI.He added that now the pressure will be on the visitors to stop New Zealand from winning the remaining two Test matches of the series.\u201cYou have to go through all these things when you play a sport\u2026 when you\u2019re down by 1-0 that\u2019s the time when you have to show your character that you\u2019re the best team. I believe India will definitely bounce back\u2026 the pressure is not on India but it\u2019s on New Zealand to stop the hosts from winning the next Test match,\u201d he added.Earlier in the Bengaluru Test, India had taken a 106-run lead in the second innings, scoring 462/10 in response to New Zealand\u2019s total of 402/10 in the first innings. Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (35 from 52 balls, with six fours) and skipper Rohit Sharma (52 from 63 balls, with eight fours and a six) gave India a solid start with a 72-run opening stand.Sarfaraz then took charge, first forming a 136-run partnership with Virat Kohli (70 from 102 balls, with eight fours and a six) and later a 177-run stand with Pant (99 from 105 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) to put India in the lead. However, the introduction of the new ball saw India lose seven wickets for just 54 runs, with the middle order failing to contribute significantly. William O\u2019Rourke (3/92) and Matt Henry (3/102) took full advantage of the new ball, dismantling the Indian batting line-up just when a massive lead seemed likely. Spinner Ajaz Patel took two wickets, while Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee chipped in with one each. In their first innings, New Zealand posted 402 in response to India\u2019s 356. A magnificent century from Rachin Ravindra (134 from 157 balls, with 13 fours and four sixes) and a quickfire 65 from Southee (73 balls, eight fours, and four sixes) helped lift New Zealand from 233/7 to 402, thanks to a 137-run stand for the eighth wicket. Devon Conway (91 from 105 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes) also made a valuable contribution at the top. Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99) bowled well for India, while Mohammed Siraj picked up two wickets, and Ravichandran Ashwin and Bumrah took one each. Earlier, after electing to bat, India had a nightmare start under overcast, pace-friendly conditions. Henry (5/15) and O\u2019Rourke (4/22) ran through the Indian batting order, bundling them out for just 46 runs in 31.2 overs. Only Jaiswal (13) and Pant (20) managed to reach double figures. (ANI)",

        "text": "The Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 season will see an intriguing face-off between the in-form Jamshedpur FC (JFC) and a determined Hyderabad FC (HFC) at the JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.With Jamshedpur FC aiming to sustain their impressive start and Hyderabad FC eager to secure their first win of the season, both teams have much at stake in this anticipated clash.Both teams have plenty to fight for, with Jamshedpur FC looking to continue their strong start and Hyderabad FC hoping to turn around their season.Jamshedpur FC have been lethal in front of goal, scoring in each of their last seven ISL matches. Their current form sees them sitting on nine points after four games, their best-ever start to a season.\n\nThe Red Miners (JFC) have had the upper hand in recent meetings, winning their last three encounters against Hyderabad FC. A victory in this match would see them equal their record of four consecutive wins against any team in ISL history, matching their streak against NorthEast United FC.On the other hand, Hyderabad FC secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC, breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on this, aiming for back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023. However, their attack will need to step up as they remain winless this season.Hyderabad FC is in need of consecutive positive results to build momentum this season. After securing a draw against Chennaiyin FC, Thangboi Singto\u2019s side now has the chance to go unbeaten in back-to-back ISL matches for the first time since their four-game streak from December 2022 to February 2023.The two teams have played 10 matches against each other in the ISL. Jamshedpur FC have won five games and Hyderabad FC have emerged victorious once. Four games have resulted in a draw.Jamshedpur FC head coach Khalid Jamil acknowledged the importance of this match and also the improved strength of Hyderabad FC of late. He backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.\u201cIt is a very important game for us. We are playing in front of our home crowd. They\u2019re a good team. They\u2019re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,\u201d Jamil said in the pre-match press conference, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.Hyderabad FC tactician Thangboi Singto mentioned that the team has become better collectively in the last couple of weeks. He is hoping for that to translate into positive results on the field.\u201cThe players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,\u201d Singto said, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.\n\nJamshedpur FC\u2019s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leads the charts for producing most goal-scoring chances (9) amongst Indian players in ISL 2024-25. With all of his opportunities coming from open play, Jamil\u2019s men have never had to deal with a paucity of chances to convert upfront.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s striker Devendra Murgaonkar stands on the brink of a personal milestone as he could complete the feat of 50 ISL appearances in the coming match. His expected goal value of 0.65 is the highest amongst the team\u2019s players this season, reflecting that he\u2019s consistently at the centre of their goal-scoring endeavours.\n\nJamshedpur FC defender Stephen Eze has averaged 7.5 clearances in every appearance in ISL 2024-25. His ability to be vigilant and aware of any offensive moves transpiring in their backline and responding in a timely manner to the same has ensured that the home team has managed to have a disciplined defence.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s Leander D\u2019Cunha has won the possession back 5.5 times on average per match in the defensive third this season. He has single-handedly helped Hyderabad FC break plenty of attacks in the backend, and the Jamshedpur FC attacking unit will have to come up with rather unique, coordinated efforts to get past him.\n\nBoth teams will be eager for three points \u2013 Jamshedpur to solidify their top-tier form, and Hyderabad to break their winless run.",

        "text": "Dubai, Oct 20 (IANS) Clinical bowling by Amelia Kerr and Rosemary Mair helped New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs to lift their maiden title in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Stadium here on Sunday. Kerr and Mair picked three wickets each to restrict the Proteas to 126/9 in the second innings after New Zealand had posted a challenging 158/5 after they were asked to bat first in the final.\n\nNew Zealand women erased the bitter memories of the heartbreaks of their past T20 World Cup finals as they eventually triumphed in their third trip to the finals. The Proteas on the other hand have lost in the final for a second year running after having lost to Australia in the 2023 Women\u2019s T20 WC.\n\nAsked to bat first, Amelia Kerr, Brooke Halliday, and Suzi Bates helped New Zealand post 158/5 in 20 overs. Georgia Plimmer and Bates opened with a strong start, but Plimmer\u2019s attempted six off Marizanne Kapp was caught by Sune Luus. Bates soon followed, bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba. Captain Sophie Devine was removed for six after a successful review by Nadine de Klerk.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s bowlers tightened control, with no boundaries hit between overs 5.4 and 13.5. Halliday (38) broke the shackles, raised a 57-run stand with Kerr before being caught by Anneke Bosch. Kerr hit consecutive boundaries before falling in the penultimate over to Nonkululeko Mlaba, the only bowler with multiple wickets. Maddy Green\u2019s late six helped New Zealand set a 159-run target for SA.\n\nWith a massive target ahead of them and with the pressure at an absolute high, skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33) and Tazmin Brits (17), the two highest scorers of the edition, gave South Africa a great start.\n\nThe team racked up 47 runs in the powerplay and looked to build on the great start until Tazmin was dismissed by Fran Jonas in the very next over. In attempts to help her skipper continue the onslaught, Tazmin attempted to go big but a miscue of her shot saw Green take a simple catch at long on which rejuvenated the New Zealand side.\n\nThe fall of the wicket saw the Kiwis regain control of the game and built heavy pressure on their opponents in the following overs which saw the required run rate climb past nine runs an over. The ninth over saw New Zealand concede only one run and had five dot balls in the row which saw Wolvaardt try and relieve pressure on the first ball of the next over. In her attempts to take on Kerr, the South Africa skipper was caught at extra cover with Suzie taking the simple catch.\n\nThe removal of the skipper sprung life into the New Zealand bowling attack as a mini-collapse followed soon after. Kerr ended up removing Anneke Bosch (9), on the last ball of the same over in which Wolvaardt was dismissed when she missed an attempt to sweep the ball which resulted in a loud appeal that was rejected by the umpire. Upon further review, Bosch had indeed nicked the ball to reduce South Africa to 64/3 at the halfway mark.\n\nWhat followed was a mini collapse as Marizanne Kapp (8), Nadine de Klerk (6) and Sune Luus (8) fell in quick succession.\n\nKerr, who set the record for most wickets in a single edition of the women\u2019s T20 World Cup on the night, returned to take the scalp of Annerie Dercksen to further add to a historic campaign. With the game going out of South Africa\u2019s reach with each passing over, Mair struck twice in the penultimate over before Carson wrapped up the victory for New Zealand.\n\nThe Proteas once again suffered heartbreak and lost by 32 runs.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nNew Zealand 158/5 in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 43, Brooke Halliday 38, Suzie Bates 32; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2-31) beat South Africa 126/9 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 33; Amelia Kerr 3-24, Rosemary Mair 3-25) by 32 runs.",

        "text": "Liverpool passed a major test of their Premier League title credentials to move back to the top of the table by beating Chelsea 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday. Mohamed Salah's penalty and Curtis Jones' winner made it 10 wins in 11 games for the Reds since Arne Slot took charge. Nicolas Jackson briefly levelled for Chelsea in the second half, but they slipped to a first league defeat since losing to Manchester City on the opening weekend of the season. Victory takes Liverpool one point ahead of City and four clear of Arsenal, who they face at the Emirates next weekend.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Chelsea are now seven points off the top down in sixth, but there was plenty cause for optimism for the Blues from a performance that stretched Liverpool to their limits.Liverpool's only defeat under Slot came to Nottingham Forest following September's international break.The Dutchman responded by this time leaving all of his South American internationals -- Alexis Mac Allister, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez -- on the bench after their exertions in recent days across the Atlantic.The decision to hand Jones just his second league start of the season proved an inspired one as the England international won Liverpool's penalty and scored the decisive goal.Chelsea were fortunate still to have 11 men on the field after just six minutes when Tosin Adarabioyo hauled down Diogo Jota.The Portugal international was still a long way from goal but the incident was almost identical to the one that saw Arsenal defender William Saliba sent-off in a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday.Having survived that scare, Chelsea settled nicely into their rhythm and pushed the home side back by dominating possession.However, Liverpool's pace on the break was a constant threat and Chelsea were caught out when Salah fed Jones, who was chopped down by Levi Colwill.Salah slammed home his 10th goal against his former club from the resulting penalty.Moments later, Cody Gakpo slotted in at the end of a lightning Liverpool counter-attack, but Salah had strayed offside before delivering the assist.At the other end, Jackson smashed off the angle of post and bar in the first sign that Chelsea had some punch to their possession football.Chelsea, though, had another escape just before half-time when referee John Brooks intially pointed to the spot once more when Jones went down under a challenge from Robert Sanchez.VAR intervened, however, as the Spanish goalkeeper got a touch on the ball before making contact with Jones.Within three minutes of the restart for the second half, the Blues were back level as VAR played another helping hand for the visitors.Jackson latched onto Moises Caicedo's through ball and coolly slotted past Caoimhin Kelleher for his fifth goal in eight Premier League games.The Senegalese striker was ruled offside on the field, but was shown to be played on by Ibrahima Konate on replay.Liverpool took just three minutes to restore their lead as Jones timed his run perfectly to control and flick in Salah's cross.Chelsea forced Slot's men to defend their lead for the final 40 minutes but struggled to create clear-cut chances for the equaliser until seven minutes of stoppage time.Renato Vega headed over Cole Palmer's free-kick before Christopher Nkunku failed to get a telling touch to Pedro Neto's teasing cross.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC (KBFC) achieved a remarkable 2-1 victory against Mohammedan SC (MSC) at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday. This win marks the first time in 27 games that Kerala Blasters have triumphed in an away match after conceding the first goal in the Indian Super League (ISL). Two second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition. Mirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory, as per a press release by the ISL. The visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan SC backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match\u2019s tempo.In the 20th minute, Mohammedan SC\u2019s pillar in defense, Joseph Adjei had to be substituted after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian.The next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters FC\u2019s debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan SC. Mirjalol Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.Mikael Stahre\u2019s men didn\u2019t bog down after conceding the goal infact they were more spurred on to equalize. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to do so as Jesus Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan SC defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s long-range effort was denied by the crossbar.The second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield but the game swayed in the favour of KBFC by Kwame Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Noah. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, leaving his marker, Zodingliana Ralte in complete awe before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal.Riding on the positive momentum of scoring an equalizer, the Blasters (KBFC) enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri.Mohammedan SC\u2019s best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala Blasters FC home as they clinched their second win of the season, as per a press release by the ISL.While Kwame Peprah just played 26 minutes, his impact from the bench was such that it helped the team secure a great comeback win. He scored a crucial goal and completed 11 out of his 14 attempted passes. His introduction also allowed Jimenez more space in the box, resulting in the second goal. He was adjudged the Player of the Match.Mohammedan SC will host Hyderabad FC at home on October 26 while Kerala Blasters FC will be in action on October 25 against rivals Bengaluru FC in Kochi.",

Brooke was outstanding against the West Indies. Spoke about backing our strengths, she backed her strengths, found those pockets, and ran hard. Helped us get to a competitive total.\n\n\u201cWe all know she is a once-in-a-generation player. What she was able to do tonight was incredible. Physically to do what she did with the bat, I think she can\u2019t feel her legs. She is not a bad cricketer but the person that she is, the world is her oyster and is great. South Africa were great, and the semifinal against Australia was unbelievable,\u201d said the New Zealand skipper.\n\nShe also highlighted the performance of bowler Lea Tahuhu, who kept things quiet for South Africa in the middle overs.\n\n\u201cI have spoken about her at length. You want a person like her in the team, she will scrape and fight for you. It is not always about the wickets, but it is about the work that goes behind it and working hard for your mates,\u201d Devine said.",

        "text": "Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot. McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth. Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane. Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams. For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006. \"It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race,\" said Leclerc.\"I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better.\"Verstappen said: \"It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer. It was a tough battle and tough to keep him (Norris) behind but it's a great result. \"I have my opinion about his move, but I'll leave it to the stewards. I dont need to say anything here.\" Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. Norris fell to fourth as Sainz also passed him on an eventful opening lap that saw Lewis Hamilton rise from 17th to 12th before he went off at Turn 19 on lap three, prompting an early Safety Car intervention. The Mercedes star had never previously failed to finish in 11 races in Austin. The race resumed on lap five, Leclerc pulling away to build his lead to three seconds by lap 10 with Verstappen resisting Sainz, who reported possible fuel problems and a loss of power. Norris stayed fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Piastri. By lap 20, as first the pit-stops began, Leclerc was 8.3 seconds clear of Verstappen with Sainz third, 1.3 adrift of the Dutchman. Norris was 3.6 adrift In fourth. Sainz came in on lap 21 for hards, rejoining sixth. Verstappen stayed out until lap 26 rejoining fifth, Ferrari having executed their undercut. Leclerc then came in on lap 27 for hards, leaving Norris and Piastri leading the way. He was third. As Norris pulled clear, Piastri frustrated Leclerc until lap 31 when Norris pitted. He rejoined fifth behind Verstappen and ahead of sixth-placed Russell who had not stopped. A lap later, Piastri pitted and order was restored with the Ferraris, led by Leclerc, in control ahead of Verstappen and both McLarens. \"These tyres aren't good, I can't brake or attack,\" reported Verstappen.Russell finally pitted on lap 41, rejoining eighth on mediums for the final stint as Norris closed in on Verstappen and they fought for third and vital points in their title scrap. The duo battled fiercely for a dozen laps, the champion defending adroitly each time Norris attacked until lap 53 when, pushed wide and off-track, the Briton finally made his move stick to take third. \"He needs to give me it back,\" complained Verstappen on team radio as they battled on and the stewards studied the move before hitting Norris with a five-second penalty for gaining an advantage.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Jude Bellingham's first season at Real Madrid started with a glut of goals and ended with a dream double, but his second is yet to take off. The England international faces his former side Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu in a rematch of last season's Champions League final, which Bellingham and Los Blancos triumphed in to win the competition for a record 15th time. The 21-year-old has shown signs of frustration in his sophomore year at Madrid, tasked with more defensive responsibility in midfield than at many times last season following the arrival of French superstar Kylian Mbappe.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti used the hard-working Bellingham on the right of midfield in a 2-1 La Liga win at Celta Vigo on Saturday, another new role for the 103 million euro ($112 million) man.Bellingham started last season as a key figure in the centre of Madrid's attack, scoring 10 goals in his first 10 games across La Liga and the Champions League.Thrust into the position after Karim Benzema departed with Madrid still waiting for then Paris Saint-Germain striker Mbappe to arrive, Bellingham thrived.After nine games this season in all competitions, Bellingham is yet to find the net.During the win over Celta, Bellingham appeared furious with Brazilian team-mate Vinicius Junior after the forward did not pass him the ball when he was well placed to score and instead lashed over.\"I haven't seen that (moment) you're talking about, but if it happened, it means that he has balls, character, and seems good to me,\" said Ancelotti on Saturday, defending Bellingham.\"Honestly, I didn't realise (it had happened), I'll watch it, but if he has reacted... let's be calm, after the game they were talking, laughing -- they have no problems.\"What's to our merit is that we always compete well, until the end.\"Ancelotti looked to shore up Madrid's defence during the second half of last season by getting Bellingham to play a hybrid role which saw him drop to the left of midfield at frequent intervals.The midfielder looked exhausted in the final months of the campaign and struggled with shoulder and ankle issues.Sharp riseBellingham was also below his best for England at Euro 2024 despite the Three Lions reaching the final, with the exception of his stunning bicycle kick goal against Slovakia in the last 16.He has been on a sharp upwards trajectory since breaking into the Birmingham City first team as a teenager, with the club retiring his number 22 shirt after he joined Borussia Dortmund at 17.Bellingham became the club's youngest captain at 19 and led them to the brink of the league title before Bayern Munich claimed victory on the final day of the 2022-23 campaign.He was named player of the season and also shone for England at the 2022 World Cup before elimination by France in the quarter-finals.Madrid fans quickly fell in love with Bellingham as he proved their saviour time and time again, including with a brace in his first Clasico against Barcelona.His goals turned him into the sort of star it might have otherwise taken years at Madrid to become and that has proven a hard bar to consistently live up to.Ancelotti has repeatedly emphasised Bellingham's job has changed and he should be appreciated for what he is still bringing to the team, in a midfield role now similar to what he was accustomed to before joining Los Blancos.With Mbappe, Vinicius and sometimes Rodrygo Goes selected in attack, Ancelotti and Madrid have struggled to find the perfect balance this season.New England coach Thomas Tuchel will also have to decide how best to fit Bellingham in with Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer vying for attacking midfield positions behind Harry Kane.Madrid are still searching for the right formula ahead of a vital week, facing Dortmund and then La Liga leaders Barcelona, and Bellingham will be determined to contribute whether that includes him scoring or not.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Race stewards penalised Norris and relegated him to fourth behind three-time world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull after the pair clashed and ran off-track in the closing laps. A five-second penalty given to Norris, who finished third on track at the flag, pushed him back to fourth behind the series leader and dealt a blow in his bid to catch and pass the Dutch driver in this year's title race.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Norris was adjudged to have gained an advantage by running off the track when he swept outside Verstappen on lap 53 or the 56-lap race.The incident cost Norris valuable points and helped lift Verstappen to a 57-point lead in the title race with 354 to Norris's 297 with five races left.\"My view is that the way the stewards interfered with a beautiful piece of motorsport was inappropriate because both cars went off track so both cars gained an advantage,\" said McLaren team chief Andrea Stella.\"It's a shame because it cost us a podium, it cost us a race where we stayed patient after we were pushed off in the first lap, at the first corner. We accepted it.\"Having said very clearly our position, this kind of position by the stewards, this kind of decision cannot be appealed. For us the chapter is now closed and we move on to the next race.\"But both cars went off track so for us there was no doubt that the manoeuvre was correct.\"Norris was philosophical about his plight after a feisty drive, having recovered from a poor first lap when he wasted his fourth pole in five races and fell to fourth.\"Not my best race,\" he said. \"With the loss in turn one and just the racing at the end, it clearly wasn't enough -- so that's life. I didn't do a good enough job, but I gave it a good shot so I'm doing my best.\"My best isn't good enough sometimes. It just wasn't our day today.\"He added that he was considering talking to the stewards about their decision, but felt \"there's plenty of scenarios where people wouldn't get a penalty in cases like what happened.\"He said it was difficult to know if he should have given his place back immediately during the race.\"It's tough to know, but maybe that was my one opportunity that I had. Max was defending well and it wasn't easy to overtake.\"Verstappen said he had endured a difficult race without the pace in his car to attack.\"It was tough, a tough battle and I tried everything to keep him behind me. But it was fun, too,\" he said.'Worked like crazy'\"A podium is a good result. I have my own opinion on the move, but I dont need to say anything. I'll let the stewards do their thing.\"The race was won buy Charles Leclerc who led home Carlos Sainz in a Ferrari one-two. Leclerc's win lifted him to 275 points in third place in the championship.\"We did a great job and the pace of the car was really good and that's thanks to the engineers and the team,\" said Leclerc.\"They've worked like crazy for the upgrades and it is paying off now. We could not have dreamed for anything better.\"It all worked and we are very happy. Now we are targeting the constructors title.\"It was Leclerc's first win in America, his third this year and the eighth of his career as Ferrari revelled in their first US Grand Prix one-two since 2006.Ferrari's success at the Circuit of the Americas lifted them to 496 points in the teams' title race behind McLaren on 544 and Red Bull on 504 with the Mexican and Brazilian Grands Prix to come on the next two successive weekends.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

The 24-year-old leg-spinner top-scored with 43 in the New Zealand total of 158-5 and then took 3-24 as South Africa fell short by 32 runs.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Kerr finished the tournament as the leading wicket-taker with 15 and collected both the Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament Awards.But 14 years ago, Kerr watched forlornly on television as New Zealand, with current skipper Devine and opening bat Bates in the side, lost the 2010 final to Australia by just three runs.It was a moment that triggered a love for the game and a desire to put the record right.\"I was inspired to be a White Fern watching that 2010 World Cup which Sophie was at,\" said Kerr who made her international debut when she was just 16.\"From that moment I was at the nets with my dad pretending I was batting with Sophie and Suzie.\"And I was in the team so young and playing with my role models who have been so good to me, two of New Zealand's greatest ever cricketers.\"I just think back to myself as a kid. When I was at primary school in creative writing, I wrote about winning a World Cup with Sophie and Suzie.\"I don't necessarily believe you deserve things in sport, but if any two people do, it's Sophie and Suzie.\"Devine, 35, and Bates, 37, are two of the elder stateswomen in the side along with 34-year-old Lea Tahuhu.Each of them made their mark on the final. Bates made 32 and took three catches while fast bowler Tahuhu squeezed the South African middle order.Devine only made six but her leadership was outstanding, bringing out the best in the younger players in the team, like Kerr.'Heartbreak and happiness'\"We joke about being grandmas and mums and whatnot but you feel a real sense of pride at seeing them stand up and take opportunities. Melie (Kerr) today was unbelievable,\" said the skipper.\"For us to be able to win it, it's just nice to have that. It's always something that you want to have when you finish your career.\"Devine's first action after winning was to embrace her fellow 'grandma' Bates who has now played 334 white ball internationals since making her debut back in 2006.\"Me and Suze have been through a lot together,\" she said.\"We've been through a lot of hairstyles together, hers a lot worse than mine.\"But to be able to share it, to be fielding close together as well and to share that moment, that embrace, that's 17, 18 years of joy and heartbreak and happiness shared in that moment. It's just been awesome to share that with her.\"With the men's cricket team also completing a spectacular win in Bengaluru earlier in the day, their first Test win in India since 1988, Sunday was arguably New Zealand's finest ever day on the cricket field, although Devine hopes there is more to come.\"I'm really hopeful that tonight's victory can inspire that next generation of not just young girls but young boys as well to pick up a cricket bat, a cricket ball,\" she said.\"It still feels pretty surreal at the moment and hopefully the impact of what we've been able to achieve is going to be long-standing and long-reaching. Everyone loves a winner, don't they?\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Watch, highlights ISL 2024-25: Peprah, Jimenez on target as Kerala Blasters beat Mohammedan SC",
        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC pulled off a memorable 2-1 victory over Mohammedan SC at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday, marking the first time in 27 games that they have won an away match after conceding first in the Indian Super League. \n\nTwo second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition.\n\nMirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory.\n\nThe visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match's tempo. \n\nIn the 20th minute, Mohammedan defender Joseph Adjei had to be substituted out after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian. \n\nThe next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan. Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.\n\nThe Blasters weren\u2019t bogged down after conceding the goal. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to level the scores as Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s effort was crashed onto crossbar. \n\nThe second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield. But the game swayed in the favour of the Blasters by Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Sadaoui. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, evading his marker before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal. \n\nThere was controversy in the 70th minute as Mohammedan were denied a penalty after Franca was bundled over from behind by Hormipam Ruivah after being put through on goal. The home crowd was furious with the decision and expressed their displeasure by throwing water bottles on the pitch.\n\nThe Blasters enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri. \n\nMohammedan best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala BlastersFC home as they clinched their second win of the season.",

        "title": "Australian star Perry congratulates NZ\u2019s trio of Suzie, Devine, Tahuhu for T20 WC win",
        "text": "Star Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry congratulated New Zealand\u2019s veteran trio of Suzie Bates, skipper Sophie Devine, and pacer Lea Tahuhu for finally securing the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title, beating South Africa in the final. For three of the most experienced White Ferns stars, it was a Sunday to remember as they ended a 15-year wait for their first-ever ICC Women\u2019s T20 WC title. The hard work, pain, blood, sweat, and tears worth 410 T20Is combined finally proved to be worth it as they made key contributions to this historic title win. Perry took to Instagram and posted in a story that she could not think of a group of players more deserving of success for their country and congratulated them. Notably, Australia\u2019s title defence ended in the semifinals after an eight-wicket loss to South Africa. This marked the first T20 WC after 2009 in which Australia was not in the finals. NZ reached the finals after a thrilling eight-run win over West Indies in the other semifinal. The White Ferns veterans made key contributions throughout the tournament. Bates was the fourth-highest run-getter with 150 runs in six innings at an average of 25.00, with a strike rate of around 93 and best score of 32. Despite not scoring a half-century, she made important contributions up the order in every match. She also took a wicket. Skipper Devine made 114 runs in six innings at an average of 28.50, with a strike rate of 107.54. Her best score of 57* came against India in the opening clash and set the tone for the Kiwis\u2019 brilliant run in the tournament. Tahuhu took five wickets in six games at an average of 22.80, with best bowling figures of 3/15 that came against India. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*. She has also taken 59 wickets with the best figures of 4/26. Devine is the sixth-highest run-getter in women\u2019s T20Is and White Ferns\u2019 second-highest run-maker, scoring 3,391 runs in 143 matches and 139 innings at an average of 28.25, with a strike rate of 120.93. She has scored a century and 21 fifties, with the best score of 105. She has also taken 117 wickets with the best figures of 4/22. Tahuhu is also an established veteran with 96 T20I appearances, in which she has taken 93 wickets at an average of 19.79, with the best figures of 4/6. Coming to the match, SA won the toss and elected to field first. Bates played a crucial knock of 32 in 31 balls, with three fours at the top. After being reduced to 70/3, it was a 57-run stand between Amelia Kerr (43 in 38 balls, with four boundaries) and Brooke Halliday (38 in 28 balls, with three fours) that played a crucial role in NZ reaching 158/5 in their 20 overs. Nonkululeko Mlaba (2/31) was the pick of the bowlers for White Ferns. In the run-chase of 159 runs, despite a brisk start by skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33 in 27 balls, with five fours), SA and a 51-run stand with Tazmin Brits (17 in 18 balls, with one four), SA lost wickets quickly and never found their rhythm following the dismissal of their openers. They were restricted to 126/9 in their 20 overs, with Kerr (3/24) and Rosemary Mair (3/25) shining the most with the ball for NZ. Kerr was given the \u2018Player of the Match\u2019 award for her all-round show. (ANI)",

        "title": "ICC Women\u2019s T20 WC: \u201cThree grandmas\u201d of New Zealand team finally get their crowning moment",
        "text": "New Zealand veteran Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine and Lea Tahuhu, the three \u201cgrandmas\u201d of their team, finally got the crowning moment of their T20I career on Sunday as an all-round White Ferns side defeated South Africa by 32 runs to secure their maiden ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title. NZ captain Devine had described the trio as \u201cthree grandmas\u201d, and it was the veterans who finally got their moment on Sunday.For 37-year-old Bates and 35-year-old skipper Devine, this was the third time lucky, with the long-serving pair both having played in their country\u2019s previous two appearances in Women\u2019s T20 World Cup finals, way back in 2009 and 2010, ending in losses to England and Australia. Those defeats at Lord\u2019s and in Bridgetown threatened to be the closest the pair came to World Cup glory, but Dubai 2024 has proved a fitting finale for two of the game\u2019s greats.Bates, who had bowled the crucial final over against West Indies in the semi-final, was at her belligerent best with the bat in the first innings against South Africa.It was Bates (334 international matches) who got the ball rolling for her team in the final, showing her class on the day when she surpassed Mithali Raj (333 international appearances) as the most-capped player in the history of women\u2019s international cricket.Her 32 from 31 deliveries gave the White Ferns the perfect platform on which to build, which her teammates duly did to reach a winning total of 158/5.\u201cIt is just outstanding, and just speaks to the volume of who Suzie is as a player,\u201d Devine said of her teammate. \u201cShe is now the most capped player in the history of the game on the woman\u2019s side, and it is unbelievable to think that she can go out there and play with such aggression and such fearlessness. I think it set the tone for the rest of the batting lineup. I think everyone knows how special I find Suze and what she has been able to achieve. So, I am just so stoked for her that we are able to lift it for her,\u201d she added, Devine captained her side with aplomb throughout the tournament, even lightening the mood just moments before the final began by telling some jokes to relieve some tension \u2013 jokes that she later said \u201cshe was not sure she could repeat,\u201d. And while her own individual contribution with the bat in the final (6) was not her best, it was her simply brilliant 57* from 36 balls right back at the start of the tournament against India that had got her team off to the perfect start in their winning campaign.\u201cI started to dream last night about what it would feel like to hold the trophy with this team, but I did not want to get to ahead of us,\u201d said Devine after the title win. \u201cThe great thing about this group is we know what we have been trying to achieve in the last 15, 18, 24 months. We kept taking steps in the right direction. You want momentum and we came to the World Cup on the back of 10 successive losses, but everyone starts on zero,\u201d she added. The 34-year-old Tahuhu often flies under the radar compared to her two experienced teammates, but bowled tidily in the final once again, and has now moved up to 93 career wickets in T20 Internationals, second only to Devine for New Zealand and up with some of the legendary names of the sport.\u201cI have spoken about it at length before, Lea\u2019s the sort of person that you want in your team, because you know that she is going to get in the fight, she is going to compete and scrap for you, and I knew if I threw her the ball, that she is going to make something happen. And she did just that,\u201d said Devine. \u201cIt is not always the person that takes the wickets or the catches. It is the work that goes on behind it, the teamwork. It is sort of working hard for your mate out in the middle there. And Leah was fantastic today, and helped change the outcome of the game I thought,\u201d she concluded. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*. She has also taken 59 wickets with the best figures of 4/26. Devine is the sixth-highest run-getter in women\u2019s T20Is and White Ferns\u2019 second-highest run-maker, scoring 3,391 runs in 143 matches and 139 innings at an average of 28.25, with a strike rate of 120.93.

This module was doing recce of the crime spot for the last one month.\n\nThis terrorist organisation active in Kashmir has targeted Kashmiri Pandits, Sikhs and non-locals in the last one and a half years.\n\nThis is a big change in the strategy of this module, which is simultaneously targeting non-local and local on development projects.\n\nMeanwhile, sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) are visiting the terror attack site on Monday to make their own assessment of the attack.\n\nOfficials said that the death toll in the terrorist attack on a private company\u2019s labourers\u2019 camp in Gagangir area reached seven after another injured labourer succumbed in hospital.\n\nThose killed by the terrorists include both locals and non-locals working to build a tunnel between Gagangir and Sonamarg to make Srinagar-Sonamarg an all-weather road.\n\nThe list of killed civilians includes Faheem Nasir (Safety Manager from Bihar), Angil Shukla (Mechanical Manager from Madhya Pradesh), Mohammad Hanif from Bihar, Dr Shahnawaz from Budgam district of Kashmir, Kaleem from Bihar, Shashi Abrol (Designer from Jammu) and Gurmeet Singh (Rigger from Gurdaspur, Punjab).\n\nFive injured are being treated at SKIMS Super Speciality Hospital in Srinagar.\n\nSecurity forces cordoned off the area and an operation was launched to trace the terrorists. The attack took place around 8.15 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nThe attack on innocent civilians engaged in an important infrastructure project that would make Sonamarg tourist destination an all-weather destination, thereby bringing livelihood to hundreds of locals, has received wide condemnation.\n\nUnion Home Minister, Amit Shah posted on X, \u201cThe dastardly terror attack on civilians in Gagangir, J&K, is a despicable act of cowardice. Those involved in this heinous act will not be spared and will face the harshest response from our security forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this moment of immense grief, I extend my sincerest condolences to the families of the deceased. Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured,\u201d he added.\n\nUnion Road Transport and Highways Minister, Nitin Gadkari, who has been personally monitoring the work on this tunnel project said, \u201cI strongly condemn the horrific terror attack on innocent labourers in Gagangir, Sonamarg, Jammu & Kashmir, who were engaged in a vital infrastructure project. I offer my humble tribute to the martyred labourers and extend my deepest condolences to their families during this difficult time. My thoughts and prayers are with the injured for a swift and full recovery.\u201d\n\nJ&K Lt Governor, Manoj Sinha said, \u201cI strongly condemn the heinous terrorist attack on civilians in Gagangeer. I assure the people that those behind this despicable act will not go unpunished. We have given full freedom to J&K Police, Army and Security forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur brave personnel are on the ground & they will ensure terrorists pay a very heavy price for their action. My heartfelt condolences to bereaved families. Praying for speedy recovery of the injured. The entire nation stands in solidarity with the families in this hour of grief,\u201d he added.\n\nChief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the incident as dastardly and cowardly on the part of the militants. \u201cThe casualty figure from the Gagangir attack is not final as there are a number of injured labourers, both local and non-local. Praying that the injured make a full recovery as the more seriously injured are being referred to SKIMS, Srinagar.\u201d\n\nImmediately after getting news about the attack, Omar said earlier on Sunday, \u201cVery sad news of a dastardly & cowardly attack on non-local labourers at Gagangir in Sonamarg region. These people were working on a key infrastructure project in the area. 2 have been killed & 2-3 more have been injured in this militant attack. I strongly condemn this attack on unarmed innocent people & send my condolences to their loved ones.\u201d\n\nPDP president, Mehbooba Mufti said, \u201cI unequivocally condemn the attack as being senseless act of violence\u201d.

He said such incidents will vitiate the atmosphere and requested the government to take immediate measures to contain such brutal attacks on innocent people.\n\nCPI-M leader and MLA, Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said, \u201cA deeply troubling report of yet another terrorist attack on migrant labourers has surfaced from Ganderbal. Barely 48 hours ago, a non-local labourer was killed in Shopian. These despicable attacks appear to be deliberate attempts to disturb peace. Culprits must be brought to book and punished. Sending my heartfelt condolences to the victims\u2019 families.\u201d\n\nJ&K Peoples\u2019 Conference (JKPC) Chairman, Sajad Gani Lone said, \u201cStrongly condemn the dastardly act of terror wherein two persons have lost their lives in Sonamarg. This is an insane act of madness. My thoughts with families of these two families. May the perpetrators be brought to justice.\u201d\n\nIntelligence agencies believe that the act of terrorists killing innocent, unarmed civilians is the result of frustration among their handlers across the border after witnessing a largely people participative and peaceful Lok Sabha and legislative assembly election in J&K.",

Returning to the World Cup Final after three years following the birth of her daughter in December 2022, four-time Olympian Deepika was seeded third in the eight-archer field.She had a smooth run through the semifinals but probably the pressure of gold medal match got to her against fourth-seed Li Jiaman, a team silver medalist from the Paris Olympics.It was Deepika's ninth appearance at the World Cup Final where she has also bagged a bronze. Dola Banerjee is the only Indian archer to have won a gold in the World Cup Final, having topped the podium in Dubai 2007.In the men's recurve section, Dhiraj Bommadevara, despite leading 4-2, could not hold off the challenge from South Korea's Paris Olympics bronze medallist, Lee Woo Seok in the opening round and made an early exit .The pressure once again seemed to affect the Indian archers, who have often struggled in high-stakes matches.The five-member Indian contingent, comprising three compound and two recurve archers, thus concluded their season-ending World Cup Final campaign with just one medal.After a stellar semifinal win against Mexico's Alejandra Valencia, Deepika couldn't maintain momentum.She dropped the first set by a single point (26-27). Despite improving in the second set, Li's flawless 30, including an X-ring shot, gave the Chinese archer a commanding a 2-0 lead (30-28).The third set proved decisive as Deepika's second arrow landed in the red 7-ring, allowing Li to claim victory with three solid 9s, taking the set 27-25 and sealing the gold on her debut World Cup Final appearance.In the semifinals, Deepika triumphed over home favourite and Paris Olympics bronze medalist Valencia, edging her out 6-4 (29-28, 26-26, 26-29, 28-28, 28-27). It also avenged Deepika's bronze medal loss to Valencia from the Yecheon World Cup earlier this year.Deepika's campaign had begun with a dominant 6-0 victory over China's Yang Xiaolei (27-23, 29-22, 29-27).In the men's recurve, third-seeded Dhiraj was India's sole qualifier.Facing second seed Lee Woo Seok, Dhiraj started strongly, drawing the first set and winning the second.However, he missed the opportunity to close out the match in the third by just one point with the South Korean drawing level before delivering flawless performances in the fourth and fifth sets.Dhiraj eventually lost 4-6 (28-28, 29-26, 28-28, 26-30, 28-29).On the compound side, the three-member Indian contingent returned empty-handed ending their campaign on Saturday.Prathamesh Fuge finished fourth after a tense semifinal loss, while Priyansh and Jyothi Surekha Vennam failed to reach the medal rounds.",

        "text": "Wellington: Members of the New Zealand White Ferns cricket team which beat South Africa by 32 runs in the final of the women's Twenty20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday will split prize money of around USD 2.3 million.That works out at around USD 155,000 or NZD 256,000 per team member, a life-changing windfall for players who for years have struggled for years to achieve financial parity with their male counterparts.New Zealand's first-ever victory in the World Cup of cricket's shortest format was a massive surprise. The White Ferns had lost 10 consecutive T20 matches before beating South Africa in a warm-up match.That pre-tournament success proved a turning point for New Zealand who beat India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing only to Australia on the way to the semifinals.South Africa ousted six-time champion Australia in a massive upset in the semi in which New Zealand beat the West Indies.New Zealand made 158-5, batting first in the final, helped by Suzy Bates who made 32, Amelia Kerr who made 43 and Brooke Halliday who made 38. Kerr then took 3-24 and Rosemary Mair 3-25 as New Zealand restricted South Africa to 126-9.\"Pretty unbelievable to be honest,\ufffd Mair said. \ufffdComing into the tournament all the odds were against us so for the group to bounce back like they have is unbelievable.\"We just care so much about each other. We've been through a lot of lows in the last 18 months, and we've just stuck by each other and kept working hard for each other.\"Captain Sophie Devine was leading the New Zealand team for the last time. She and Bates have played in all nine T20 World Cups since the first in 2009. New Zealand reached the final of the first two tournaments in 2009 and 2010, losing to Australia on both occasions.\"This means everything to us,\" Bates said. \"When you play team sport, you want to be a world champion.\"We've fought our way back to the top. (Devie) has been so outstanding leading this team... so calm and believing in us. We'll probably have a cuddle for even longer later because there's been some dark times that only the people in the (locker room) understand.\"New Zealand was coached to victory by Australian Ben Sawyer and former Black Caps batters Dean Brownlie and Craig McMillan.The White Ferns' success was praised Monday by New Zealand Sports Minister Chris Bishop. It came at the end of a weekend in which New Zealand also retained sailing's America's Cup and in which the New Zealand men's cricket team beat India in a test in India for the first time in 36 years.\"And then to round out a truly amazing sporting weekend, at 3am Monday morning (NZT) the White Ferns, led by Sophie Devine, stepped up to face South Africa in the women's T20 World Cup final in Dubai and absolutely smashed it, bringing home their first World Cup since the One Day International in 2000,\" Bishop said.\"Amelia Kerr's 43 runs off 38 balls and then taking 3 wickets for 24 set our team up for their magnificent performance.\"",

Returning to the World Cup Final after three years following the birth of her daughter in December 2022, four-time Olympian Deepika was seeded third in the eight-archer field.\n\nShe had a smooth run through the semifinals but probably the pressure of gold medal match got to her against fourth-seed Li Jiaman, a team silver medalist from the Paris Olympics. It was Deepika's ninth appearance at the World Cup Final where she has also bagged a bronze. Dola Banerjee is the only Indian archer to have won a gold in the World Cup Final, having topped the podium in Dubai 2007.\n\nLet us know! \ud83d\udc42\n\nWhat type of content would you like to see from us this year?\n\u2014 HubSpot (@HubSpot)\n\nThe five-member Indian contingent, comprising three compound and two recurve archers, thus concluded their season-ending World Cup Final campaign with just one medal.\n\nAfter a stellar semifinal win against Mexico's Alejandra Valencia, Deepika couldn\u2019t maintain momentum. She dropped the first set by a single point (26-27). Despite improving in the second set, Li's flawless 30, including an X-ring shot, gave the Chinese archer a commanding a 2-0 lead (30-28).\n\n'Why Is OLA a Public Issue': Comedian Kunal Kamra\u2019s Feud With Bhavish Aggarwal Heats Up Again - Accusations, Bouncers, & Netizens React\n\n'No Rest, No relaxation In The Path We Have Chosen For Developed India,' Says PM Modi\n\nRajasthan: Man Gets Beaten Up With Rod By Wife & Daughter Over Domestic Dispute In Bikaner; Shocking Video Surfaces\n\nDiwali 2024 Calendar: Know When Is Deepavali, Choti Diwali, Dhanteras, Lakshmi Puja & Other Key Dates\n\nThe third set proved decisive as Deepika's second arrow landed in the red 7-ring, allowing Li to claim victory with three solid 9s, taking the set 27-25 and sealing the gold on her debut World Cup Final appearance.\n\nIn the semifinals, Deepika triumphed over home favourite and Paris Olympics bronze medalist Valencia, edging her out 6-4 (29-28, 26-26, 26-29, 28-28, 28-27). It also avenged Deepika's bronze medal loss to Valencia from the Yecheon World Cup earlier this year. Deepika's campaign had begun with a dominant 6-0 victory over China's Yang Xiaolei (27-23, 29-22, 29-27).\n\nOther results\n\nIn the men's recurve section, Dhiraj Bommadevara, despite leading 4-2, could not hold off the challenge from South Korea\u2019s Paris Olympics bronze medallist, Lee Woo Seok in the opening round and made an early exit .\n\nIn the men\u2019s recurve, third-seeded Dhiraj was India\u2019s sole qualifier.Facing second seed Lee Woo Seok, Dhiraj started strongly, drawing the first set and winning the second.\n\nHowever, he missed the opportunity to close out the match in the third by just one point with the South Korean drawing level before delivering flawless performances in the fourth and fifth sets. Dhiraj eventually lost 4-6 (28-28, 29-26, 28-28, 26-30, 28-29).\n\n(Except for the headline, this article has not been edited by FPJ's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)\n\nFollow us on\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "text": "Indian Premier League (IPL) defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are in a precarious position ahead of the upcoming season as they would be without the services of previous season's mentor Gautam Gambhir, assistant coach and academy head Abhishek Nayar and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate. The trio have joined the Indian cricket team as head coach and assistant coaches respectively, and certainly leave a void in the KKR dugout. While Dwayne Bravo has joined the side as mentor, other positions need to be filled.In addition to the backroom staff, early indications are that the captaincy role is not straightforward either. Shreyas Iyer joined KKR when he was bought for Rs 12.25 crore at the 2022 auction and it's understood that the franchise is willing to retain the Mumbai batter but not as their top retention.Ahead of October 31 deadline, Andre Russell is the front runner to be retained with a hefty price tag. The all-rounder was earlier retained for Rs 12 crore by KKR and is very likely to get a substantial raise.If things don't go per Iyer's liking, will he explore different options? In case he looks that way, the right-hander is expected to set the auction on fire because many teams - Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings, Delhi Capitals - are in the need of a captain. And an Indian captain is always sought after.Punjab won't mind loosening their purse strings for the right-hander considering he had a successful partnership with Ricky Ponting, now PBKS head coach, at DC and the two were together when they reached the final in 2020.Equally, don't be surprised if DC explore the Iyer option, too, because he was a proven leader for them and Rishabh Pant has asked to not be considered as skipper.Even last year, when Iyer was returning from injury lay-off, there was a section in the KKR camp which wanted to continue with Nitish Rana, who was standby captain in Iyer's absence, as leader for 2024 season.The franchise, however, \"announced\" Iyer as captain before the tournament got underway. The statement did raise a few eyebrows as Iyer was the original captain and Rana was only doing the job in his absence, and many felt the announcement was absolutely unnecessary.Shah Rukh Khan co-owned KKR are one of the franchises who advocated for a smaller auction, and pushed for more Right to Match (RTM). It's a strategy they are likely to use at the upcoming auction.There are more tempting retention options in Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana (uncapped), Mitchell Starc and Varun Chakravarthy but it will be interesting to see how much the defending champs are willing to spend.They have a problem of plenty on that front but it's their captaincy piece which would be keenly followed by other franchises too.",
        "summary": "Champions KKR are in a critical position as they face the upcoming IPL season without top staff including former mentor Gautam Gambhir. Shreyas Iyer's captaincy is uncertain, with all-rounder Andre Russell likely to be retained, as other teams explore the possibility of acquiring the KKR skipper.",

        "title": "EA Sports FC 25 Review: Minor League Upgrades",
        "text": "It's difficult to recognise granular changes in seemingly constant things. You don't really notice a tree growing every year, but when you put those years together, the difference becomes apparent to the naked eye. The erstwhile FIFA series of football sims is somewhat like that. With a new edition released every year, the changes to the long-running and ridiculously popular sports franchise can be imperceptible over a year, or even more. These games only start feeling new after three or four subsequent editions when Electronic Arts is compelled to re-energise the series after a run of games becomes undeniably stale. To me, FIFA has always existed in eras. A spate of games follows the same language with minor improvements and tunings, before EA decides to freshen things up.\n\nThe franchise's latest era began last year when it shed its decades-old FIFA identity and rechristened itself as EA Sports FC. But a new name didn't bring a promised new beginning with FC 24. There was a new coat of paint, but underneath, the game was very much carved out of the same wood that has long been showing cracks. No one expected EA to upend a successful formula and re-imagine the game in a new light, but EA Sports FC 24 was desperately lacking fresh ideas. One year later, EA Sports FC 25, the second entry in EA's new football video game timeline, is still very much a fruit from the same tree. But there are a few new ideas this time around, some of which elevate the game from its swamp of familiarity. On a visual level, there's not much that differentiates FC 25 from its predecessor. You could boot it up and your flatmate might walk in on you playing and think its FC 24. But if they'd pick up the controller and jump in a game, the differences are likely to become a little more apparent.\n\nTo begin with, EA Sports FC 25 is harder, especially for those who are used to running at defences with a pacy winger, cutting through the entire opponent half and scoring a worldie \u2013\u2013 that's harder to pull off here. There's a greater (and much needed) emphasis on defending in FC 25 that hands players a little more power to dictate play when they are off the ball. Defenders and defensive midfielders have more of a commanding presence and are clearly more empowered to disrupt quick offensive moves. At first, this is a bit jarring. When attacking, you tend to lose the ball often and quickly if you're not carefully constructing your passes and relying on a single player to break down the defence. Defenders pick your pocket or win the second ball before you have the time to adjust, turn or take a second touch. This forces you to craft more considered plays and graft for your goals.\n\nDefenders can now also make a tactical foul in a last-ditch attempt to nullify an attack. These are fun to pull off in the game and of course will result in your player being penalised, but the new ability is only useful in certain circumstances and doesn't strengthen defences as a whole. Even with their newfound powers, however, defenders still seem to be playing with their hands tied behind their backs. When facing up to an oncoming attacker, big centre-backs are potent in their tackling. But if a pacy forward slips past them, you could kiss defensive recovery goodbye. There's little that's stopping the forward from scoring at that point as defenders are woefully inept when chasing down attackers and making recoveries. This has long been an issue in EA's football games, and FC 25 doesn't address the glaring defensive weakness either.\n\nDefenders still struggle to make recoveries against pacy forwardsPhoto Credit: EA\n\nEA's football franchise has always favoured an arcade-style recreation of the world's game. It's faster, leaner, and meaner. For a more authentic on-pitch gameplay, purists like me have preferred the more deliberate playstyle and pacing of Pro Evolution Soccer (rest in peace). But EA Sports FC25, to its credit, attempts to bring a bit of realism to its otherwise hyper-kinetic simulacrum of football made for 16-year-olds brought up on TikTok and Twitter (also, RIP). EA has burned in a Simulation Settings master switch in the game this time, that lets you swap out the classic FIFA experience \u2013\u2013 akin to a run-and-gun sort of playstyle \u2013\u2013 for a more grounded simulation of the sport \u2013\u2013 much like a tactical shooter. EA says that the Simulation gameplay type is \u201ccloser to what you'd see in a live football match.\u201d While that's an exaggeration, the option does slow down things on the pitch, underscoring the action with real-time decision making. Once I toggled the Simulation mode on, I never went back.\n\nThis change isn't just apparent on the defensive third of the field; attacking now seems beholden to gravity and you can't simply fly around with the ball glued to your toes. Players are more prone to bad touches, more susceptible to losing one-on-one battles, and more unlikely to knock the ball past the opponent in a sudden burst of pace. Passing, too, is now a little less video gamey. It doesn't seem hard coded to be precise, and I found myself struggling to pass my way out of tight spaces in the midfield early on. With time, however, you grow into the rhythms of the sim and find solutions that help you build up efficient plays. This experience, of course, is subject to user customisation. If you prefer the manic intensity of classic FIFA gameplay, then you can stick to the default simulation setting or fine tune it the way you like by adjusting individual sliders for different gameplay elements.\n\nWith the simulation setting on, the gameplay is more realistic and consideredPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe altered on-pitch experience is underpinned by an overhaul of tactical foundations across FC 25. This applies to how you tactically set up your team, assign player roles, and decide how they will play together on the pitch. When you head to team management in any mode, you're greeted by a revamped and streamlined tactics menu, where you can choose a tactical preset, pick a formation, a build-up style, and a defensive approach. All of this is a neater, but also a leaner experience. Some specific tactical adjustments present in past games have been stripped away, in essence giving you less control over your team's tactical set up. You also can't manually adjust the position of your players on the pitch and create your own formations like you were able to in previous games. These changes make for a less flexible, more guided tactical experience in FC 25.\n\nThe tactical streamlining, however, is counter-balanced by a deeper focus on individual player roles in your starting XI. Each position on the pitch comes with distinct positional role that can be assigned to the player. These player roles govern how individual members of your team will think, act and move on the pitch. For instance, you could set up you right-back as a Falseback; this role will task your right-back to push into the central midfield rather than staying out wide \u2014 Pep Guardiola style. Or you could play them as an Attacking Wingback, prioritising wide attacking output over defensive duties. Each Player Role comes with its unique benefits and drawbacks; you may get an extra pair of legs on the offensive side of the pitch to provide options when attacking, but that player will likely be stranded out of position when you lose the ball, making you susceptible to counters.\n\nPlayer Roles add depth to the tactical set up of your teamPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nEach player on your team also comes with specific level of Role Familiarity, denoted by \u2018plus' signs. A player's familiarity to a position and its corresponding roles and responsibilities guides how good they will be when starting from that position. A single plus sign next to a role indicates the player has mastered the position, while a double plus sign \u2014 only available for certain players \u2014 tells you that they are one of the world's best in that role. These options are quite helpful in guiding player-level behaviour on the pitch and offer you the freedom to tweak around and see what's working for you. The more role-familiar players you have in your starting XI, the more your team is likely to actually play like team.\n\nBeyond menus and inputs, the AI-driven tactical core of EA Sports FC 25, however, remains annoyingly broken. EA says there's a new AI model guiding positional awareness and player behaviour in the game that utilises real-world data. And the new iteration of the Hypermotion technology claims to bring more authentic on-pitch player interactions, animations and visuals. But, when playing a match in FC 25, these changes are frankly imperceptible. There's barely any noticeable shift in visual fidelity from FC 24, and while there are newer animations for player actions in the game, AI player behaviour remains woeful. Despite spending hours setting up your tactics, it is often a struggle to get your team to behave like a real-life football club. You see glaring gaps in the midfield, AI-controlled defenders not rushing to mark attackers in space, and AI players constantly failing to adapt to evolving situations in a match.\n\nFC 25 features Smart Tactics options that can be accessed with the D-padPhoto Credit: EA\n\nAnd it isn't just the on-pitch flaws that are carried over from previous games; general UI clunk, unresponsive inputs in menus, and stuttering transitions between screens are alive and well in FC 25. These recurring frustrations point to a callous approach from EA that mandates rushing out a new edition in time for a new football season over hammering out the dents in the chassis to deliver a polished product. You can also never quite shake the feeling that EA Sports FC 25 is residing under the skin of its predecessor. The main menu here is the clone of the new one seen last year. As is the lazy tradition, this will continue for a few editions before EA knows it's time to switch things up. The familiar DNA pervades every other screen in the game, with only a few strands swapped around to make sure players can see what's changed if they bring a magnifying glass.\n\nLet's talk about the manager mode. The trademark Career mode, where I've sunk most of my time in my decades of playing FIFA, is as usual split between Manager and Player careers \u2014 I'll mostly be talking about the former. In FC 24, the Career mode felt largely ignored, with EA only bringing minor and cosmetic changes to the tired formula. In FC 25, the changes, unfortunately, remain aesthetic and stop way short of overhauling the manager mode experience. The ability to set an overarching tactical vision for your club, introduced last year, has been retained, and there are some tweaks across different aspects of the mode, but little is new in terms of impactful additions. The Career mode homepage now shows a rolling list of your tasks as a manager and a social media feed on the side providing updates on player transfers from football gossip god Fabrizio Romano and club and player news from The Athletic. After the initial novelty of checking every item off your list before you head to matchday, you start to groan at the repetitive tasks and eventually start ignoring them.\n\nThe new manager mode homescreen comes with a task list and a social media feedPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe new tactics system makes its way to the Career mode, changing the way you set up your club to win matches, but the all-important transfer hub remains the same for practical purposes. The way you set up your scouts, find players you need, engage in transfer negotiations is completely unchanged, following the set formats we've seen for years now. And there is still no VAR in EA Sports FC 25. I understand that implementing a video review system in online matches is not feasible, but playing manager mode in 2024 without VAR affecting matches and their outcomes seems outlandish. There is a greater focus on youth development and scouting; manager mode even lets you play bi-monthly five-a-side youth tournaments to accelerate the growth of your youth team. And now there's an option to embark on a manager career for a women's team from some of the top licensed leagues. While these additions are appreciated, EA has frustratingly again overlooked a core overhaul of the manager mode that fans have long demanded.\n\nAs expected, however, the money-spinning Ultimate Team mode gets the spotlight again. EA's biggest addition this time around is a quickfire 5v5 Rush mode, that in essence replaces the Volta street football mode. Rush comes with its own set of rules for offside, player penalties and set pieces, all of which fit naturally within the seven-minute match format. The new feature, available across different game modes, strips away the contrived \u201ccoolness\u201d of Volta with simple, fun five-a-side matches that truly shine in the Ultimate Team mode. With Rush, EA is basically cribbing from Rocket League. In Ultimate Team Rush, you can either team up with friends or play with strangers online \u2014 each user controlling a player \u2014 and take on other teams of five online. As a former Rocket League addict, I can confirm that Rush has the same effect. It's fast, engaging and often frustrating \u2014 but never not fun.\n\nRocket league-style five-a-side Rush mode is fun and addictivePhoto Credit: EA\n\nPlaying with friends online naturally brings more cohesion to your game, but jumping into a match with strangers is as unpredictable as you'd expect it to be. If you're lucky, you'll match with players who want to work as a team, construct selfless plays and win together. Most of the time, however, you'll find yourself playing with pre-pubescent idiots who're in the habit of shouting \u201cSiuuuuu\u201d after eating their morning cereal. Nevertheless, Rush is cool, if derivative addition to EA Sports FC 25, and I found myself playing quickfire games online again and again. In fact, despite getting a good Ultimate Team together on paper, I played more Rush games than the traditional 11v11 matches in Ultimate Team Rivals.\n\nThe familiar stuff from Ultimate Team, like squad-building challenges and online competitions, are all here \u2014 and so is in-your-face case for microtransactions. The new tactical system and player roles make their way into mode, too. In addition to introducing the all-new Rush mode, FC 25 expands the Evolutions feature, which brings cosmetic and stat upgrades to your player cards in Ultimate Team. You can select an eligible player from your team and graft to complete challenges that upgrade your player cards. Or you can give EA more money and spend in-game currency to buy upgrades.\n\nUltimate Team remains the focus for EAPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nAside from Ultimate Team, other familiar modes like online Seasons, Clubs and Co-op Seasons are all here in the same form we've seen for years. As with all EA Sports football games, the comfort of consistency remains key. There are no radical changes, no upending of norms, no risk-taking. But one can hardly begrudge EA to rip apart things that have continued to work for years for reasons as flimsy as creativity and innovation. But it's the minor visual upgrades that leave a bad taste in the mouth. EA Sports FC 25 runs and looks as we've come to expect games in the series to run and look for the past few years.\n\nAs I mentioned, when it comes to the naked eye test, there's little that differentiates the game from its predecessor. Sure, certain player faces are more detailed now, as is the norm with every new edition, and a fresh set of animations try and add a bit more realism to player movement, but these don't amount to a perceptible visual upgrade on the pitch. Annoyingly though, cloth physics gets an upgrade that makes player kits comedically bouncy. Shirts and shorts look like they are going through a panic attack, wiggling as if they have a mind of their own. The ever-present general layer of visual glitches and jank hasn't been ironed out, as well. Whether you're on the pitch or in the menus, EA Sports FC 25 will often refuse to follow your lead.\n\nCertain player faces and animations are improved in FC 25Photo Credit: EA\n\nWhen you put all of its new tricks and familiar frustrations into a bag, EA Sports FC 25 fails to offer an experience that makes you look at the series in a new light. And that seems to be the recurring problem with the franchise as a whole. EA has constantly favoured reiteration over rejuvenation, and sadly that approach has only led to regurgitation. Every new edition of its annual football sim feels like meeting an old friend, asking \u201chow you've been\u201d and getting \u201csame old, same old\u201d in reply. There are some new ideas, most notably the Rocket League-style Rush mode that adds a much needed, well, rush to an otherwise stale table of contents. And while the tactical overhaul brings a new way to engage with team strategy and player instructions, it does so at the cost of mechanical flexibility.\n\nThe on-pitch gameplay takes a few steps forward in the right direction, empowering the defensive side of the game, but FC 25 stops short of taking necessary strides towards meaningful upgrades that could change the game for good. The continued apathy towards career mode, however, remains the biggest complaint. Gaping cracks in the quintessential mode have repeatedly been ignored for surface-level improvements \u2014 as if a new coat of paint would change the fact that the underlying wall is rotting. EA Sports FC 25, disappointingly, opts to do the same, even though a foundational change is long overdue. Over the past few years, EA's long-running football franchise has essentially embraced a live service strategy, with minor seasonal upgrades rolled out annually to an audience hooked to its unethical commercial model. The only difference is that EA asks you to pay full price every year for a \u201cnew\u201d game.\n\n Engaging and addictive Rush mode Deeper tactical control with Player Roles Greater emphasis on defending Focus on realism with Simulation setting Improved animations\n\n Minor changes to career mode UI and gameplay jank Lack of noticeable visual upgrades Rigid new tactics system Frustrating AI player behaviour\n\nRating (out of 10): 6\n\nEA Sports FC 25 released September 27 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X and Nintendo Switch.\n\nPricing starts at Rs. 3,999 for the Standard Edition on Steam and Epic Games Store for PC, and Rs. 4,499 on PlayStation Store for PS5 and PS4, and Microsoft Store for Xbox Series S/X and Xbox One.",

        "text": "A recently published Ordinance effecting an amendment to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955, enables the government to assign the powers of the the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation or its Commissioner to any officer or agency or authority in order to protect public assets. Approval of the Ordinance by the Governor is perceived as an effort on part of the government to clear the legal hurdles for the Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) which is entrusted with the responsibility of protection of lakes and government lands in and around the State capital. The Telangana Ordinance No. 4 of 2024 published in the Telangana Gazette on October 3, inserts a Section 374B, which stipulates that the government can empower any officer/agency/authority to exercise the powers vested with the corporation/the commissioner for protection of public assets such as roads, drains, public streets, water bodies, open spaces and public parks and preserve them from illegal encroachments. The government sought to justify the amendment by saying unforeseen contingencies and disasters necessitated the requirement of specialised agencies whose services can be roped in by GHMC to strategise and implement effective resilient systems for natural calamities and disasters. While the Ordinance legally accords enforcement powers to HYDRAA with regard to GHMC Act, it also restricts its authority to GHMC alone. As per the government order constituting HYDRAA, the authority\u2019s jurisdiction includes area under GHMC and all urban and rural local bodies up to the Outer Ring Road. The government may be specifically include or exclude areas from HYDRAA\u2019s purview from time to time as per the orders. Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 already has provisions for the government or the municipal commissioner to empower district level task force/agency towards enforcement with regard to removal of unauthorised structures. As per the sources, a government order has already been issued empowering the HYDRAA to take action in the urban local bodies too. However, the same is not available in public domain.",

        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world\u2019s leading generative AI technology.The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment.The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry\u2019s belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement.Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter.Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank\u2019s investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated.In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \u201cAI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \u201cAnd this is just the start.\u201dThe huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \u201cPeople are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\u201d said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year \u2013 adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn\u2019t exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round.Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \u201cthe most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\u201dApple Inc. didn\u2019t participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs.The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company\u2019s board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure \u2014 an unusual organization that has frustrated investors \u2014 to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company\u2019s backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company \u2014 a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI\u2019s board said it hasn\u2019t discussed specific numbers.OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported.A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees \u2014 such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also...",

        "text": "Shares of Marico hit a record high of Rs 719.80, gaining 4 per cent on the BSE in Thursday\u2019s intra-day trade in an otherwise weak market on stable volume growth in July to September quarter (Q2FY25). The stock surpassed its previous high of Rs 713.60 touched on September 27, 2024.At 02:18 pm; Marico had erased its intra-day gain and was trading 0.5 per cent higher at Rs 696.50 on the BSE. In comparison, the BSE Sensex tanked 2.1 per cent or 1,781 points at 82,485. In the last six months, the stock has outperformed the market by surging 41 per cent, as against a near 12 per cent rise in the benchmark index.Marico in its Q2 quarterly update said that consolidated revenue growth remained in high single digits, as higher realisations in the domestic business was offset by incremental currency headwinds in some overseas markets. The company expects consolidated revenue growth to move into double digits in the second half of the year and expects to deliver double-digit revenue growth in this year.The sector witnessed stable demand trends with rural outperforming urban on a year-on-year basis for the third quarter in a row. In the given context, the domestic business posted mid-single digit volume growth, exhibiting improvement on a sequential basis, Marico said.The management said the International business delivered robust low teen constant currency (CC) growth with each of the markets contributing positively. Bangladesh posted high-single digit growth, demonstrating the strong resilience of the company\u2019s business model amidst a challenging operating environment which has now largely stabilized. Vietnam also grew in high single digits, while MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and South Africa maintained their robust double digit growth trajectory.However, Marico expects gross margin to moderate on a year-on-year basis owing to partial absorption of higher input costs, as the Company prioritized expanding its consumer franchise in the current demand environment. Consequently, the company expects a moderate lag in operating profit growth vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.Among key inputs, copra prices rose ahead of internal forecasts and the recent import duty hike led to vegetable oil prices moving higher towards the end of the quarter. Crude oil derivatives, however, remained rangebound.On outlook, Marico said the company remains focused on achieving double-digit revenue growth while managing margin pressures from commodity inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.After a weak update from Dabur, Marico\u2019s update reassured investors. The numbers are largely in line with our estimates, said analysts at Nuvama Wealth Management. Value Added Hair Oils (VAHO) and Saffola Oils remain muted.The brokerage firm said Marico\u2019s consolidated revenue growth is likely to be 8 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Domestic business shall clock 5 per cent volume growth YoY. The International business shall deliver 13 per cent CC growth. Bangladesh shall post high-single digit growth amid a turbulent operating environment. Copra experienced inflation higher than expectations. Parachute shall see mid-single digit volume and double-digit revenue growth. Foods and Digital-first brands performed better than estimates; analysts said in company update and retain \u2018BUY\u2019 rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 780 per share..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Stock market crash today: In the aftermath of the bloodbath at the Dalal-street on Thursday, investors lost a total of Rs 9.7 trillion in market capitalisation on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At Tuesday's close, the total market capitalisation of companies listed on the BSE stood at around Rs 474 trillion - this was pulled down to Rs 465 trillion on Thursday. However, in intraday deals, investors losses mounted to Rs 10.56 trillion with the total market capitalisation of the BSE slipping to Rs 464 trillion. The market breath also favoured the declines as around 2,875 stocks traded losses versus advances by 985 stocks, with 109 remaining unchanged. In terms of contribution to the 30-blue chip stock index, BSE Sensex\u2019s decline, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank led the way, pulling Sensex down in its sharpest decline since August 05. The BSE Sensex plunged 1,832 points or 2.17 per cent to 82,434 level in intraday deals. Meanwhile, Nifty50 slipped to an intraday low of 566 points, down 2.19 per cent to 25,230.30 level in intraday trade. That apart, the country's volatility indicator, India VIX jumped to 11.72 per cent. Among sectors, Nifty Realty was clear loser ending the day 4.36 per cent lower and was followed by Nifty Auto slipping 2.88 per cent, Nifty Private Bank declining 2.61 per cent and Nifty Financial Services sliding 2.59 per cent. According to analysts, today\u2019s sharp decline was driven by several negative factors, including escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by Sebi and strength in the Chinese market, following the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) stimulus package. \u201cSpeculation is growing that Israel may retaliate by targeting major oil fields in Iran, which could further fuel the rise in oil prices. Additionally, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by SEBI are expected to impact trading volumes, as retail participation may decline due to the increased contract size and limits on weekly expiries,\u201d said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP, research & advisory at Master Capital Services.Analysts also concurred that the foreign money is being diverted from India to China as the country became attractive to investors following its government\u2019s stimulus package. \u201cThere has been a notable outflow of Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) money from India to China over the past few days, exerting pressure on large-cap stocks. Lastly, profit booking ahead of state elections and concerns over elevated valuations have added to the downward pressure,\u201d stated Santosh Meena, head of research, Swastika Investmart. .storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "The Airports Authority of India\u2019s Madurai Airport commenced 24-hour operations with effect from October 1, 2024. This milestone marks a significant step towards enhancing connectivity, providing a seamless travel experience and supporting the growth of regional as well as national Air traffic. This will provide flexibility to Airlines, Non-Scheduled operators, Medical flights and General Aviation for efficient planning of Aircraft operations. Airlines can also plan bases at Madurai Airport. This will also enable effective use of Airport Infrastructure and resources, read an official statement.At an event organised at Madurai Airport to formally start the 24-hour operations, M. Suresh, Chairman, AAI underscored the organisation\u2019s strategic approach towards this transformative upgrade. He also emphasised the widespread benefits of the commencement of round-the-clock operations from the Airport. The event also saw the esteemed presence of MP, Manickam Tagore, MP, S. Venkatesan, MLA, V. V. Rajan Chellappa, MLA, A.M.S.G. Ashokan and senior officials from the District Administration.At present Madurai has 248 scheduled movements in a week and is connected to cities like Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Singapore, Dubai and Colombo. Additionally, there is a demand for flight connectivity to other cities of India like Pune, Goa, Kolkata, Cochin, Bhubaneshwar, Varanasi, Guwahati, etc. With round-the-clock operations, the weekly scheduled movements in the winter season of 2024 are expected to be around 344 movements for Madurai Airport.Extending operational hours will allow more flights to land and take off, thereby improving connectivity, especially for flights of long-haul routes. This will attract more airlines and routes, making Madurai Airport a more prominent hub.Travellers will have more flexible flight options, making travel easier and more convenient. This will enhance passenger satisfaction and attract more travellers to Madurai.With more flights and passengers, local businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation services will likely see increased demand. This will lead to job creation and stimulate the local economy. Madurai has a rich cultural and religious heritage. Round-the-clock operations will make this city more accessible to tourists, especially those from different time zones, contributing to the growth of the tourism sector. 24-hour operations will also facilitate better cargo handling, allowing for more efficient logistics operations. This will attract businesses that rely on air freight, further boosting the local economy. It will also enable the locals to have better access to enhanced medical facilities.With the starting of 24-hour operations, a Night parking facility will be available at Madurai Airport as well. This will help the Airport to facilitate connections not only within India but also to international destinations. Since most international operators prefer to operate during night time from India, 24-hour operations will encourage airlines to consider international operations from Madurai Airport. It will also allow airlines to plan night parking at the Airport and plan base flights. Transitioning Madurai Airport to 24-hour operations presents a compelling opportunity to enhance Passenger service, drive economic growth, and improve overall operational efficiency. By embracing this change, the Airport can position itself as the leading airport in the country, catering to the diverse needs of passengers and contributing to the region\u2019s overall development. Implementing these extended hours will not only meet the demands of a growing travel market but also support Madurai\u2019s aspirations as a vital transportation hub in the region",

        "text": "The rupee depreciated 14 paise to settle at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as the volatile geopolitical situation triggered a surge in crude oil prices, weighed down by a steep fall of over two per cent in domestic equity markets. According to forex traders, a strong American currency and unabated outflow of foreign funds fuelled by the bullish Chinese markets also accelerated the rupee's slide. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.91 and touched a low of 83.97 against the greenback during intra-day trading. The unit ended the session at 83.96 (provisional) against the American currency, registering a steep loss of 14 paise from its previous closing level. On Tuesday, the rupee settled 3 paise lower at 83.82 against the American currency. Forex markets were closed on Wednesday on account of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. According to Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the rupee declined on weak domestic markets and a strong dollar, while a surge in crude oil prices also weighed on the domestic unit. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a slight negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"Traders may take cues from ISM services PMI, weekly unemployment claims and factory orders data from the US. Investors may watch out for a non-farm payrolls report from the US on Friday. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.23 per cent to 101.91. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.66 per cent to $75.13 in futures trade. Experts attributed the spike in crude prices to the fear of Israel's retaliatory attacks on Iran's oil installations amid escalating tension in West Asia. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex crashed 1,769.19 points, or 2.10 per cent, to settle at 82,497.10, while the Nifty tanked 546.80 points, or 2.12 per cent to close the session at 25,250.10.

FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b915,000 crore since Monday. Analysts said foreign investors rushed to sell Indian equities as Chinese stocks turned bullish after the country announced a slew of stimulus measures to revive the economy. On the domestic macroeconomic front, a monthly survey released on Tuesday showed India's manufacturing sector growth fell to an eight-month low in September amid a softer increase in factory production, sales and new export orders. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from 57.5 in August to 56.5 in September, registering the weakest pace of growth since January.",

        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world's leading generative AI technology. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment. The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry's belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement. Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank's investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated. In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\" OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \"And this is just the start.\" The huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \"People are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\" said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year - adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn't exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round. Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \"the most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\" Apple Inc. didn't participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI's board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs. The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company's board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure - an unusual organization that has frustrated investors - to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company's backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company - a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI's board said it hasn't discussed specific numbers. OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported. A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees - such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also developing their own AI models. In this funding round, OpenAI discouraged investors from backing rival companies, such as Anthropic or Musk's AI startup xAI, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg earlier reported that leading venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which backed Safe Superintelligence, would not participate in the newest fundraising.

        "title": "Lock into attractive SCSS, FD returns before interest rate cuts begin",
        "text": "Interest rates are expected to decline soon after remaining elevated for an extended period. After the US Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 50-basis-point (bps) cut, other central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will likely follow suit.\u201cThis is a good time to take fixed-income exposure at elevated rates before the softening starts,\u201d says Amol Joshi, founder, PlanRupee Investment Managers.Rate cuts on the horizonThe RBI has projected inflation at 4.5 per cent for financial year 2025 (FY25), close to its 4 per cent target. With the current repo rate at 6.5 per cent, experts anticipate a 50 basis point cut soon. \u201cI see a repo rate cut of 50 bps to 6 per cent,\u201d says Joydeep Sen, author and corporate trainer (debt).\u201cRBI may cut rates by 50 bps over the next six months, starting with a 25 bps cut in December,\u201d says Pankaj Mathpal, managing director, Optima Money Managers. Current rates are attractiveFixed-income instruments such as bank fixed deposits (FDs), corporate FDs, and small savings schemes (SSS) are currently offering attractive returns. For example, bank FDs of two to three years\u2019 duration are yielding 7 per cent, while the government has kept SSS rates unchanged as of September 30, 2024. \u201cIf you want to invest in FDs or the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme (SCSS), now is the right time. Investors can also consider long-term debt funds,\u201d says Mathpal.Sen notes that any reduction in bank FD rates will lag behind the RBI\u2019s actions. \u201cBank deposit rates will ease but may not align directly with RBI rate cuts, as credit demand remains strong, and banks need deposits,\u201d he explains.Which instruments look good?Several fixed-income products currently offer attractive rates. The SCSS, with an 8.2 per cent interest rate that can be locked in for five years, remains one of the most attractive. The scheme\u2019s investment limit has been enhanced to Rs 30 lakh.The Mahila Samman Certificate offers 7.5 per cent interest for two years on deposits up to Rs 2 lakh. Select corporate FDs offering around 9 per cent are worth considering. Banks are offering attractive rates for 12-15 month FDs. Investors with a longer time frame will, however, be better off investing in longer-tenured FDs.\u201cSenior citizens should capitalise on high SCSS rates and lock in investments now. For short-term needs, FDs are a good option. NBFC FDs offer slightly higher rates than bank FDs,\u201d says Mathpal. As a rule, match your investment timeframe with the product\u2019s tenure, as premature withdrawals lead to penalties.Avoid floating rate instruments With interest rates set to fall, floating-rate instruments like RBI Floating Rate Savings Bonds may not be ideal. They currently offer 8.05 per cent (35 bps higher than the 7.7 per cent offered by the National Savings Certificate). \u201cFloating-rate instruments will adjust downwards as rates drop, so they are not suitable in a declining interest-rate environment,\u201d says Joshi.Focus on goals and allocationInvest according to your horizon. \u201cYoung investors should focus more on equity, while retired senior citizens should prioritise fixed income. Mid-career investors should aim for a balanced allocation,\u201d says Sen.Fixed income allocation should also depend on investment horizon and risk appetite. \u201cInvestors with lower risk tolerance and short-term goals should focus on debt instruments,\u201d says Mathpal..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Leading artificial intelligence research company OpenAI announced this week that it has closed an enormous funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion. This massive injection of capital positions OpenAI as one of the highest valued private companies in the world. The round was led by previous investor Thrive Capital, with Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, Khosla Ventures and others also participating. This brings OpenAI's total funding to nearly $18 billion since its founding in 2015. OpenAI says the new funds will allow it to expand its AI research, build new tools, and grow its infrastructure to handle increasing demands on its systems. OpenAI has become the worldwide leader in generative AI models like ChatGPT, which has over 250 million users. The company is also known for developing powerful transformer models for natural language processing, computer vision and other domains. However, continued progress requires vast computing resources and talent \u2013 two things that do not come cheaply. OpenAI reportedly spends billions each year on research costs like training new models as well as hiring top AI scientists and engineers. Sustaining this level of spending is likely why OpenAI sought such a gargantuan funding round. The company faces intensifying competition from DeepMind, Anthropic, xAi and others working in similar areas. Microsoft has also become a close partner, building products using OpenAI technology. To maintain its advantages, OpenAI needs ample funds to recruit top people, invest in the latest hardware and pursue ambitious long-term research goals. With over $17 billion in capital raised to date, OpenAI is now in an elite class of private unicorns. How the company utilizes these massive new resources, and whether it can fulfill its lofty visions, will be exciting to watch unfold in the coming years. For now, OpenAI's dominant position in critical AI domains seems set to continue fueling innovative advances that impact technology worldwide.",

        "text": "Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, plunged in trade on Thursday, mirroring global cues on the back of increased Middle East tensions and rising crude prices. BSE Sensex closed the day, down 2.10% at 82,497.10, and Nifty50 closed the day at 25,250.10, down 2.12%.The bloodbath on Dalal Street left equity investors poorer by Rs 9.78 lakh crore. The market capitalization of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) plummeted by Rs 9,78,778.57 crore, bringing the total value down to Rs 4,65,07,685.08 crore ($ 5.54 trillion) in just one trading session. In the last few days, BSE Sensex has corrected around 4% from the near 86,000 high it hit last week. The risk of a broader regional conflict has increased following Iran's missile strike on Israel. While Iran insisted it has \"no interest in a broader war\" after the attacks, Israel has vowed to strike back. Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory firm, noted in a client note that \"Iran's decision to respond to devastating attacks from Israel against its proxy Hezbollah, including a new ground offensive, with a ballistic missile strike against Israel, raises the risk of a wider regional conflict that could draw in the US and disrupt oil markets. However, according to an ET report, market analysts suggest that the potential downsides in stock markets could be contained.Stock market outlook: Where are Sensex & Nifty headed?According to Sandeep Raina, Executive Vice President-Research, Nuvama Professional, the market correction is temporary in nature. \u201cThe changes in derivative regulations and the expiry scheduled for today has led to the corrections in the market,\u201d Raina told TOI. \u201cHowever, this is a temporary reaction and we don't expect any major corrections. The markets should stabilize and return to normal levels in the coming days,\u201d he said.Escalating tensions in the Middle East have led to a surge in oil prices, with concerns that supplies from major producers could be disrupted. For countries that heavily rely on oil imports, such as India, the increase in crude prices is a significant concern, as it can have a substantial impact on their import bill and overall economy.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, warned, \"The situation will change if Israel attacks any oil installations in Iran which will trigger a huge spike in crude. If it happens, it can turn out to be more damaging for oil importers like India. Therefore, investors should watch the emerging situation very closely.\" Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers predicts heightened volatility in Indian stock markets in the coming weeks.\u201cThe current geopolitical induced risks and ongoing US election cycle may continue to impact global markets including India in the short term. Also, we are entering the results season starting next week and that is also going to add to the moves depending on the quality of results,\u201d Solanki told TOI.\u201cHence, I see near term 2-3 weeks of heightened news based volatility in the markets. Investors may book some profits in stocks which have run up way ahead of fundamentals and could look for new ideas and add in a staggered manner,\u201d he said.Chinese dragon roars: India\u2019s biggest worryFor investors in India, the resurgence of Chinese stocks, which have underperformed in recent years, could be a more significant concern, feel analysts. The Chinese government recently announced a series of economic stimulus measures, which has led to predictions by analysts that the rebound in Chinese stocks could be sustained. As a result, there is a possibility that some funds may be redirected from India to China, as global investors have been favoring India over China in recent times.The recent stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government is being hailed as a game-changer for the nation's economy and stock markets. Victoria Mio, head of Greater China equities and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, believes that this shift in focus from debt control to growth support could be the key to restoring investor confidence and unlocking value in China's markets.\"As global investors seek stability amidst uncertainty, the Chinese government's decisive pivot from debt control to growth support could be the catalyst needed to restore confidence and unlock value in China's markets.\"The impact of this stimulus package is already being felt in the Chinese stock market, with the SSE Composite index gaining over 15% in the past week, including an impressive 8% rise on Tuesday. Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, attributes this surge to a combination of short covering and a growing belief in the effectiveness of the government's policies. He also suggests that some of the capital outflows from India may have been redirected to China to capitalize on the sharp rally.Looking ahead, Holland believes that global interest rate cuts will benefit all emerging markets. For India specifically, investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming results season to gauge the health of the economy and individual companies.",

        "text": "Amid long-standing calls by private port players to bring parity between recent winners of public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports and players with older contracts, the Centre has released draft guidelines for tariff migration, allowing concessionaires to switch to a market-based tariff regime.\u201cIn the past, tariffs were regulated due to a limited competitive landscape, but the evolving market and competitive landscape necessitates deregulation. The original objective of introducing the tariff regulations in 2005 included safeguarding the interest of users, while ensuring fair returns to the port and encouraging competition and efficiency. The long-term objective outlined in the Tariff Guidelines 2005 was competitive pricing. The market and competitive landscape in the Indian port sector have since witnessed a significant shift,\u201d the shipping ministry said in the draft guidelines.Currently, tariffs for private operators at central government ports are regulated under three separate regimes \u2014 Tariff Guidelines 2005 (superseded by Tariff Guidelines 2019), Tariff Guidelines 2008, and those of 2013.The draft guidelines will allow PPP players to fix their own scale of rates (SOR) and will require them to sign a supplementary agreement.Previously, the major port authorities were both service providers to end users and the concessioning authority. Thus, the tariff regulations played an important role in safeguarding the interests of both port users and PPP operators.According to the Centre, with the transition to the landlord port model and increased private sector participation, the utility of tariff regulations (and fixation) in this context has diminished.Several PPP operators had also raised concerns with the ministry in the past, stating they were at a disadvantage compared to fully private ports, as there was no parity in tariff fixation, making PPP projects less desirable.While the new regulations allow pricing freedom, they will not hinder government revenues earned from these PPP projects, as there will be no change in royalty.\u201cAs an additional measure, the royalty as revenue share of the major port should/would not go below what it would have got under the regime when the tariff was fixed/determined as per the Tariff Guidelines. This would be done by converting the revenue share to royalty based on the annual revenue requirement of the project as determined earlier,\u201d the draft guidelines said.The government has invited stakeholders to send their inputs by 25 October..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "In a boost to commercial real estate and infrastructure projects, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that if the building is constructed for supplying services such as renting or leasing out, it can be regarded as a plant and input tax credit (ITC) under GST will be eligible. However, it rejected constitutional validity challenge to blocked credit provisions in the GST law. \u201cIf the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, the building could be held to be a plant,\u201d a division bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol said. ITC norms With this the apex court upheld Odisha High Court\u2019s ruling in the matter of Safari Retreats. The issue here revolved around section 17(5) of the CGST Act. This particular section prohibits ITC for works contract services when supplied for construction of an immovable property. However, this will exclude plant and machinery. The big question concerned what will be included in the definition of \u2018plant and machinery\u2019? The High Court had held that if the assessee is required to pay GST on the rental income from the mall, it is entitled to ITC on the GST paid on the construction of the mall. Aggrieved by this, the Tax Department moved the Apex Court. After going through all the submissions, the top Court while saying the shopping mall is a \u2018plant\u2019, held that functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant. Expert terms this ruling as a boon for the industry. \u201cThe outcome of the ruling that \u2018functionality test\u2019 should be applied on buildings to determine whether the same qualify as plant is very positive for the industry. With this ruling, by applying the functionality test, if one is able to prove the nexus/ role a particular product with the business of a taxpayer, credit should ideally be admissible\u201d said Harpreet Singh, Partner at Deloitte. \u201cThe eligibility of input tax credit (ITC) will be determined based on the functionality and essentiality tests,\u201d explained Abhishek A. Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who represented multiple petitioners in the case before the Supreme Court. \u201cIn essence, the Court has effectively read down the provisions of Section 17(5)(c) and (d) of the GST Act. ITC can only be denied in situations where the nature of the taxpayer\u2019s business and the claimed credits fail to satisfy these two critical tests. Post this ruling, there will be no requirement to amend the law. According to Rohit Jain, Deputy Managing Partner at Economic Laws Practice, the top Court has upheld the existing provisions and interpreted that building for leasing qualifies as a \u201cplant\u201d and no restriction of ITC is applicable. \u201cThere is no need to make any changes in the law,\u201d he said. Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co felt by reiterating this broader principle in the context of GST, the Supreme Court has given a lot of hope to taxpayers across the country, especially those whose input costs include substantial construction expenses. \u201cCompanies in the commercial real estate as well as infrastructure sectors will do well to review their input credit positions in the light of this judgment,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "SC permits input tax credits on construction expenses for leased buildings",
        "text": "In a development that may encourage increased investment in commercial real estate, the Supreme Court granted the industry relief on Thursday by permitting the application of input tax credits (ITC) on construction expenses for commercial buildings meant for leasing.\"If the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, which are covered by clauses (2) and (5) of Schedule II of the CGST Act, the building could be held to be a plant,\" said Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol.This ruling is anticipated to ease the financial strain of rent on tenants occupying commercial spaces. Real estate companies stand to gain, as buildings can now be categorised as plant and machinery. Additionally, this advantage is not limited to commercial real estate; various industries will also be able to claim ITC on rentals for commercial properties. The ruling suggests that the ITC benefit will be available retroactively.\u201cThis is an important decision that could have wide ramifications for industries, particularly hotels, infrastructure, and logistics, including warehousing. While the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of restrictions relating to input credit on construction-related procurements, it has been held that whether a building constitutes 'plant or machinery' needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis,\u201d said Pratik Jain, Partner, PwC India.\u201cIt means that where it falls under this category, credit would be allowed. It will be interesting to see if the government considers amending the GST laws after this decision,\u201d added Jain.Experts believe that although the constitutional challenge was dismissed, the acceptance of the taxpayer\u2019s submission under Section 17(5)(d) is a positive outcome, potentially lowering the financial burden on developers and fostering greater investment in commercial real estate.\u201cThe real estate industry should carefully evaluate the implications of this ruling on ITC eligibility for outward supplies related to rental income. Given the Supreme Court's decision, it would be prudent for the GST Council to issue clarifications allowing real estate players to claim ITC on rental income,\u201d said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY India.Tax experts also pointed out that the question now arises whether this ruling would also apply to factory buildings, jetties, storage tanks, etc.\u201cThe applicability will depend on the specifics of each case. In the Safari Retreats case, the petitioner retained the property and leased it out rather than using it for personal purposes. In contrast, factory buildings, storage tanks, etc. are typically used by the registered person for their own operations. Therefore, once the detailed ruling is available, it will be crucial to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether ITC related to factory buildings, storage tanks, etc., will be allowed. If ITC is permitted, it will be important to understand the circumstances under which it can be claimed,\u201d said Agarwal.Tax experts also believe that GST laws generally do not allow the benefit of input credit/set-off of GST costs incurred on the input side for the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, with very few exceptions. This often results in additional GST costs for service providers whose primary input-side investment is in immoveable property, such as malls/commercial real estate players, port or airport service providers, and LNG terminal operators.Background of the caseIn the case of Safari Retreats, a mall owner approached the Orissa High Court, arguing that when a mall is being built for providing commercial rental services for the shop spaces therein, there should be no restriction on availing input credit/set-off for the GST cost incurred on the said construction. The Orissa High Court upheld this argument, and the GST authorities subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court. Several similar matters eventually reached the Supreme Court, leading to the formation of a large batch of matters on this legal point. Some of these newer matters also challenged the constitutional validity of such a restriction on input GST credit. Today, the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment\u2014while it has rejected the constitutional validity of the restriction, it upheld the conclusions of the Orissa High Court and, among other things, held that input credit will be allowed if the construction activity is for \u2018plant\u2019 or \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201cThis is a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court. While determining whether a mall, hotel, jetty, breakwater, or warehouse qualifies as \u2018plant or machinery\u2019 will remain a factual question (potentially leading to a second round of litigation), the greatest positive is that the Court has categorically held that there is no blanket restriction against input credit/set-off of the GST cost incurred on the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, especially when the said structure itself is integral to providing the output services in question,\u201d said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Signs of financial sector froth",
        "text": "The Indian equity market is on a high: again. On August 1, Nifty 50, the benchmark index for the Indian equity market, hit the \u201825000\u2019 mark. The jump from 24000 to 25000 took just 24 trading sessions. By September 24, it soared past \u201826000\u2019. This unbridled bull run has, in fact, characterised the Indian equity markets since the March 2020. However, now the bullish frenzy has regulators concerned. On March 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch, underlined the \u2018stretched valuations\u2019 of small and mid-cap stocks, iterating there are \u201cpockets of froth\u201d in the market. On July 22, she shared her concerns about speculative trading in F&O segment and losses made by retail traders in this segment. Latest reports suggest, SEBI is all set to tighten regulation to curb retail frenzy in equity options. Are the concerns of the regulator regarding a \u2018froth\u2019 in the market valid? Chart 1 shows the six global markets: Nifty 50, India (NSEI), Dow Jones, United States (DJI), German Index (GDAXI), Bovespa Index, Brazil (BVSP), and SSE Composite Index, China (000001.SS) from 2015 to 2024. For every market, we can see a sharp rally post the pandemic, an uncertain correction in 2022 and a sharper rally from late 2022 onwards. However, for both DJI and Nifty 50 (top two panels), the bullish spree in the last two years is extraordinarily strong. The market capitalisation (mcap) as percentage of GDP (Buffet indicator) suggests the Indian markets are overvalued. The Buffet indicator for India increased substantially from 2019 to 2022, a pattern which matches the US\u2019 (Table 1). India\u2019s mcap-to-GDP ratio reached a 15-year high of 140.2 per cent in May 2024. Values of the Buffet indicator above 100 is, by itself, an indicator of overvaluation but with values skirting 150 per cent, the financial sector has, it seems, decided to grow on its own. The concerns of the regulator about \u2018froth\u2019 in the market are evidently not unfounded. What is leading to the continued bullish frenzy? For one, the retail market participants have entered the stock markets in a big way post Covid, especially in India. Moreover, there are concerns that credit growth in the real sector could be finding a route to the equity market. Table 2 presents the growth in the US and Indian equity markets during different monetary policy phases of the US Federal Reserve, broadly matched by central banks of major markets. Expansionary phase The sharp rally in both the markets post Covid coincides with the expansionary phase. From May 2022, Federal Reserve increased interest rates responding to inflationary pressures, leading to some correction: for both DJI and Nifty 50, we see markets returns fall during contractionary phase. However, with the rate hike paused from September 2023, the markets rallied sharply again. With the Fed\u2019s decision to slash interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, we are looking at another expansionary phase, which may stretch valuations on the upside. How will the financialisation impact the real economy? The symptoms of overvaluation bring forth concerns about financialisation: proliferation of financial assets and financial market growth unrelated to the real sector growth. First, financialisation makes companies more concerned about \u2018share-holder value creation\u2019 than real capital accumulation. Financialisation can lead to \u2018distribute and disinvest\u2019 rather than \u2018retain and reinvest\u2019 for firms, which will jeopardize the real capital accumulation and employment generation. Speculative surge Second, the retail participation in the F&O segment and growth in intra-day trading shows the inclination to use the equity market for speculative gains rather than for long-term investment. This can be detrimental to retail participants\u2019 long-term saving behaviour, and adversely impact saving rates in the economy. Furthermore, if the participation in the stock market is leveraged, a market crash can lead to substantial erosion of wealth for retail investors. The Union Budget in 2024, increased short-term capital gains tax (STCG) and introduced a flat long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) across asset classes, discouraging short-term churning of portfolios. But have the market participants, especially the younger retail traders, taken the cue? Going ahead, regulatory measures should not only discourage leveraged trading, but also create awareness on appropriate risk management strategies for intra-day trading and the pitfalls of shorter-term churning for long term financial goals. \u2018Nudges\u2019 may be more effective than overt paternalism in guiding younger retail participants.

        "text": "Swift, the global financial messaging provider, announced on Thursday that it will begin trialing transactions involving digital currencies and assets on its secure network starting in 2025. This marks a notable step toward the gradual integration of digital assets into the broader financial system.Headquartered in Belgium, Swift is a member-owned cooperative that connects over 11,500 banks, securities organisations, and corporations across more than 200 countries, enabling the secure exchange of standardised financial messages. Although Swift does not hold or manage funds, its network allows financial institutions to communicate, facilitating global and local financial transactions. This initiative aims to demonstrate how Swift can support the movement of diverse types of value \u2014 whether digital or traditional \u2014 across over four billion accounts in 200 countries and territories.Bridging digital and traditional currenciesThe pilot programme will involve central and commercial banks, exploring how Swift\u2019s existing infrastructure can facilitate transactions of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets alongside traditional money. Initial use cases will include payments, foreign exchange (FX), securities, and trade-related transactions. A particular focus will be on enabling Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) and Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) transactions across different digital ledgers.In the release, Tom Zschach, Swift\u2019s chief innovation officer, emphasised the need for digital assets and currencies to coexist with traditional money. \u201cWith Swift\u2019s vast global reach, we are uniquely positioned to bridge both emerging and established forms of value,\u201d Zschach stated. \u201cAs new forms of value emerge, our intention is to continue offering our community the ability to seamlessly make and track transactions of all kinds of assets.\u201dRole of CBDCs in tokenised assetsTokenisation, the process of converting traditional assets such as bonds into digital units or blockchain-based tokens, has been explored by banks and asset managers for several years. The hope is that tokenised assets will make trading more efficient, reducing costs and removing intermediaries. Despite these ambitions, tokenisation has yet to gain significant traction in mainstream markets. The tokenised asset market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, the company said.CBDCs, digital versions of a country\u2019s official fiat currency, are also being trialled worldwide. According to recent data, around 90 per cent of the world\u2019s central banks are currently experimenting with CBDCs. These digital currencies aim to support the trading of tokenised assets and are a response to technological advances that have led to the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.SWIFT, a key player in the global financial system, has been actively involved in trials of both CBDCs and tokenised assets. In March, it announced plans to launch a platform that would connect developing CBDCs to the traditional financial system, ensuring a seamless transition between digital and traditional forms of money..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

The benchmark Sensex surged 729.46 points or 0.88 per cent to 83,226.56 at 12.31 PM, while the Nifty climbed 191.80 points or 0.76 per cent to 25,441.90. This upward momentum comes after a weak start, with markets opening lower for the fifth consecutive session due to geopolitical tensions and foreign institutional investor (FII) selling. The Sensex had opened at 82,244.25, down from its previous close of 82,497.10. The market breadth remained positive, with 2,284 stocks advancing against 1,529 declines on the BSE. 174 stocks hit 52-week highs, while 50 touched 52-week lows. 292 stocks reached the upper circuit limit, and 222 hit the lower circuit.

On the flip side, Cipla (-1.42 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (-1.33 per cent), Shriram Finance (-1.13 per cent), BPCL (-1.10 per cent), and Apollo Hospitals (-0.86 per cent) were the top losers. Sectoral indices also showed strength, with the Nifty Bank up 453.30 points or 0.87 per cent at 52,298.50, and Nifty Financial Services gaining 135.35 points or 0.57 per cent to 24,016.90. The Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap Select indices rose 0.31 per cent and 0.26 per cent respectively. The market\u2019s reversal comes despite ongoing concerns about the Iran-Israel conflict and its potential impact on crude oil prices, which could affect inflation and India\u2019s fiscal deficit. Earlier in the day, experts had pointed to global factors, including FII withdrawals to cheaper markets like Hong Kong, as reasons for the initial weakness. Investors are now closely watching US job data and further geopolitical developments for cues on market direction. The sharp intraday turnaround suggests a possible change in sentiment, although it remains to be seen if this momentum will sustain until market close at 3.30 PM. As trading continues, market participants will be keenly observing whether key support levels can be maintained and if the recovery can offset the losses from previous sessions.",

        "text": "Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, the latest entrant in the Gemini family of artificial intelligence (AI) models, is now generally available for production use. On Thursday, Google announced the general availability of the model, highlighting that it was a smaller and faster version of the Gemini 1.5 Flash which was introduced at Google I/O. Due to being fast, it has a low latency inference and more efficient output generation. More importantly, the tech giant stated that the Flash-8B AI model is the \u201clowest cost per intelligence of any Gemini model\u201d. Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B Now Generally Available In a developer blog post, the Mountain View-based tech giant detailed the new AI model. The Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B was distilled from the Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model, which was focused on faster processing and more efficient output generation. The company now claims that Google DeepMind developed this even smaller and faster version of the AI model in the last few months. Despite being a smaller model, the tech giant claims that it \u201cnearly matches\u201d the performance of the 1.5 Flash model across multiple benchmarks. Some of these include chat, transcription, and long context language translation.You Might Soon Be Able to Share Images Directly With Google's Gemini App One major benefit of the AI model is its price effectiveness. Google said that the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B will offer the lowest token pricing in the Gemini family. Developers will have to pay $0.15 (roughly Rs. 12.5) per one million output tokens, $0.0375 (roughly Rs. 3) per one million input tokens, and $0.01 (roughly Rs. 0.8) per one million tokens on cached prompts. Additionally, Google is doubling the rate limits of the 1.5 Flash-8B AI model. Now, developers can send up to 4,000 requests per minute (RPM) while using this model. Explaining the decision, the tech giant stated that the model is suited for simple, high-volume tasks. Developers who wish to try out the model can do so via Google AI Studio and the Gemini API free of charge. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "The rupee traded on a flat note and settled at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday as surging crude oil prices amid volatile geopolitics weighed on the local unit, while the Reserve Bank intervened to prevent the domestic currency from touching its lowest level. Forex traders said a weak American currency against major Asian rivals as well as the RBI's move to sell dollars supported the local unit. However, it was weighed down by weak domestic equity markets and unabated outflow of foreign funds. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.96 and moved between a narrow range of 83.93 and 83.97 against the greenback. The unit failed to recover from its deep plunge witnessed in previous sessions, and ended flat at 83.96 (provisional) against the dollar. On Thursday, the rupee slid 14 paise to settle at 83.96 against the American currency. The unit had touched its all-time low of 84.09 on August 5. Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said the rupee traded nearly flat amid reports of the Reserve Bank of India selling dollars in the short-term offshore markets, which prevented the Indian currency from hitting a new record low. However, weak domestic markets, a strong dollar and a surge in crude oil prices weighed on the rupee. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"FII outflows and elevated crude oil prices may further pressurise the rupee. Traders may take cues from non-farm payrolls report from the US. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.11 per cent to 101.87. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.12 per cent to $78.49 in futures trade. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex extended its sharp loss from the previous session and crashed another 808.65 points, or 0.98 per cent, to settle at 81,688.45. The Nifty also tanked 200.25 points, or 0.79 per cent to close the session at 25,049.85. Both the indices had tumbled over 2 per cent on Thursday. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Thursday, offloading shares worth \u20b915,243.27 crore on a net basis in the cash segment, according to exchange data. FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b930,000 crore since Monday as they turned bullish towards the Chinese market, betting on various economic stimulus measures announced by the country. Meanwhile, a monthly survey released on Friday showed India's services sector activity fell to a 10-month low in September as new business, international sales and output growth moderated. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services Business Activity Index fell from 60.9 in August to 57.7 in September, indicating that the output registered an increase, but at the slowest rate since November 2023.",

        "text": "By delivering a political speech at the inaugural ceremony of Dasara, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and chief guest litterateur Dr. Hampa Nagarajaiah have desecrated the holy shrine and ruined the sanctity of Nada Habba: MLC A.H. Vishwanath Mysuru: MLC A.H. Vishwanath has strongly criticised the political speeches made during the inauguration of Dasara-2024 atop Chamundi Hill yesterday, asserting that the event lost its sanctity due to the political undertones. Speaking to reporters at Jaladarshini Guest House here this morning, he stated that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah exploited the traditional Dasara inauguration to advance his political agenda. \u201cCM Siddaramaiah, who once spoke lightly of the Gods, has now sought the blessings of Goddess Chamundeshwari, the presiding deity of Mysuru,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dasara inauguration yesterday devolved into a political platform, with CM Siddaramaiah, MLA G.T. Devegowda (GTD), and even the inaugurator, Dr. Hampana, delivering speeches laden with political tones. It was more of a political event than a devotional one,\u201d Vishwanath lamented. He noted that the speakers, focused on their political agendas, overlooked the rich history of Nada Habba Dasara. \u201cDasara has shifted from being a public celebration to a political affair,\u201d he stated, adding that politicians have brought Dasara to a new low. Is GTD a MUDA beneficiary? Regarding MLA G.T. Devegowda\u2019s (GTD) praise for Siddaramaiah, he described it as mere flattery and theatrics. \u201cOne must wonder whether GTD is a beneficiary of the MUDA scam,\u201d he remarked, implying that the MLA\u2019s unnecessary adulation of the CM raises suspicions about his own connections to several MUDA sites. \u201cGTD turned the entire inauguration into a farce, and there is no excuse for this. The function became hypocritical, with everyone patting themselves on the back. It is truly unfortunate that nobody took the time to speak about Goddess Chamundeshwari, the erstwhile Mysuru Maharajas, or the glory of Dasara,\u201d he regretted. He further noted that Union Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has appointed a Non-Vokkaliga leader (C.B. Sureshbabu of the Kuruba community) as the Legislative Party leader of the JD(S), fearing that appointing a Vokkaliga leader might be detrimental to the party in the future. Vishwanath pointed out that no one from the Opposition has explicitly declared intentions to topple the State government, asserting that the Government is propagating this false narrative to protect itself amid the MUDA scam and divert public attention from it. Netas sullied Mysuru\u2019s reputation The MLC questioned whether Siddaramaiah had overlooked the verdict delivered by Justice M. Nagaprasanna, emphasising that the CM\u2019s wife wrote an emotional letter expressing her intention to return the 14 sites just hours after the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s intervention. He maintained that returning the sites does not erase the wrongdoing, arguing that the offence remains even if it is acknowledged. Vishwanath expressed scepticism about GTD\u2019s sudden vocal support for the CM, noting that the MLA has remained silent on the issue until now and allegedly possesses multiple MUDA sites himself. \u201cPoliticians are responsible for tarnishing Mysuru\u2019s reputation. There must be an investigation into all MUDA site allocations, and previous MUDA Commissioners should face imprisonment for their misconduct,\u201d he declared. MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority He further questioned the current MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority to cancel the Khata of the returned sites while the case is still under judicial review. \u201cSiddaramaiah should first read the 197-page verdict from the High Court. A thorough investigation into the entire MUDA scam is necessary. The current MUDA Commissioner must also be held accountable for hastily cancelling the Khata of the returned sites without properly examining the process,\u201d he stated, challenging the Commissioner\u2019s powers to unilaterally annul the Khata. Vishwanath argued that Siddaramaiah\u2019s remarks seem to suggest he operates above the law, accusing him of undermining the rule of law. He added that the Lokayukta case against Siddaramaiah cannot be withdrawn unilaterally, even after the CM\u2019s wife returned the 14 sites.",

While airlines have been relying on AI for preventive maintenance or improving passenger experience, integrating a risk management platform will help IndiGo adjust its flight schedules proactively and minimise disruptions during emergencies. New tools for the new world This is especially crucial as aviation continues to be affected by global conflicts such as those in West Asia and Ukraine. Airlines have been forced to reroute or cancel flights due to these ongoing conflicts.

This will also help to improve the credit-deposit (C/D) ratio, according to the ratings agency ICRA. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had earlier expressed concern over the high C/D ratio for some lenders and sought a review of business models.Abhishek Dafria, group head, structured finance, ICRA, said the securitisation market\u2014pass-through certificates (PTCs) plus assignment\u2014witnessed an extraordinary quarter in Q2 FY25, with volumes touching Rs 60,000 crore. About 35 per cent of the volumes originated from private sector banks, which have dived into the securitisation market to improve their credit-deposit ratio given the relatively slower pace of deposit accretion, he added.The country\u2019s largest private lender, HDFC Bank, securitised new car loans worth Rs 9,063 crore through a PTC transaction where mutual funds were key investors. India Ratings has assigned an \"AAA\" rating to this asset-backed securities transaction.\"Regular issuances by large institutions will provide a fillip to the securitisation market, boost investor confidence\u2014including that of foreign portfolio investors\u2014while proactive regulatory guardrails will ensure financial market stability,\u201d said Jatin Nanaware, senior director, India Ratings.Besides banks, ICRA said non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) would also continue to raise funding through securitisation as they diversify their borrowing liabilities and improve their asset-liability management (ALM). The sustenance of volume growth in the coming quarters, however, remains to be seen, given the appetite for large-size transactions, as seen in Q2, may be limited. The securitisation volumes may reach Rs 2.1 trillion in the current financial year (FY25), Dafria of ICRA said.HDFC Bank securitised Rs 19,200 crore of loans as a strategic initiative to lower its high credit to deposit ratio (CD ratio)..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Increase in thermal stress and humidity due to climate change have turned out to be major factors contributing to infertility in dairy cows, posing a serious challenge to livestock farmers. Reportedly, more than 40% of cows slaughtered in Kerala are infertile and in order to address the issue the Animal Husbandry department will establish Regional Livestock Fertility Management Centres (RLFMC) across the State. A first of its kind initiative in Kerala, the project implemented through the Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) will provide multiple treatment options including IVF (in vitro fertilisation) to the farmers. \u201cA large percentage of infertility cases can be corrected. The RLMFC will take cases referred by department veterinarians and normally cows that fail to get pregnant after three sessions of Artificial Insemination (AI) will be considered,\u201d says R. Rajeev, managing director, KLDB. State-of-the-art facilities Each centre will have a mobile unit with state-of-the-art facilities for embryo transfer process, providing doorstep service to the farmers. It will be led by a team of experts, who will assess the cow\u2019s living conditions, feed, health and case history. While treatment for nutritional and hormonal problems will start immediately, some issues will require an extended period to be addressed. In the meantime, the RLFMC team will use software to collect and examine the data of each case and give instructions to the farmers. While infertility causes considerable losses for farmers, it also impacts Kerala\u2019s goal of attaining self-sufficiency in milk production. \u201cThe expense for producing an embryo and transferring it will come to around \u20b96,000. We mainly target heifers as chances of hormonal imbalance are higher in cows. Heifers are ideal carriers for embryo transfer,\u201d says Mr. Rajeev. The centres also offer the provision to opt for quality embryos if the cows are not superior breed. \u201cThe ovum can be taken from any other cow or the farmer can also opt for quality embryos produced by us. The mobile lab will assess fertility issues in cows and also carry out embryo transfers,\u201d he adds. A joint initiative of the State and the Centre, the RLFMCs will come up at Chithara in Kollam and Thalayolaparambu in Kottayam in the initial phase. Minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development J. Chinchurani will inaugurate State\u2019s first RLFMC in Kollam on Saturday.",

        "title": "254,000 jobs added in September as US economic growth holds steady: Report",
        "text": "The US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far surpassing expectations and alleviating concerns about a faltering job market, as per the US Department of Labor. The report has also beaten Wall Street's expectations of a substantial interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the New York Post.Unemployment rate dropsThe unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%, down from 4.2% the previous month, while hourly earnings rose by 4% year-on-year. Consensus estimates had predicted a gain of 150,000 jobs, a modest increase from the 142,000 reported for August. The unemployment rate had previously shown slight fluctuations, falling from an unexpected rise to 4.3% in July.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that further interest rate cuts are likely, but he emphasised a gradual approach designed to support a healthy economy. At the Fed's last meeting on September 18, officials reduced the rate to 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, and projected two additional quarter-point cuts in November and December.\u201cIf the economy performs as expected, that would mean two more cuts this year,\u201d Powell said.Private sector growthData from ADP showed that private sector companies added 143,000 jobs in September, surpassing analysts' estimates of 125,000 and marking a rebound from August's figure of 99,000. This increase ended a streak of five consecutive months of job declines.Despite these positive signs, there are indications of a weakening job market. The Labour Department reported that the quits rate, a crucial measure of worker confidence, fell to 1.9% in August, the lowest since June 2020. The hiring rate also declined to 3.3%, down from 3.4% in July, the weakest rate since August 2013, excluding the pandemic.Low layoffsPayroll growth across most sectors suggests fewer layoffs, although hiring has slowed due to reduced demand following the Federal Reserve's rate hikes of 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% last month, following a 0.5% rise in August, while year-on-year wages rose by 4.0%, up from 3.9% in August. This strong wage growth makes it unlikely that the US central bank will implement another half-percentage-point rate cut at its meeting on November 6-7.ChallengesThe labour market continues to add jobs at a steady pace, allowing Americans to maintain confidence and spending, which supports the economy. However, the hiring rate has slowed significantly, with an average of 116,000 jobs added monthly from June through August, marking the weakest three-month stretch since mid-2020.However, the economy has remained resilient, growing at a 3% annual pace from April to June, boosted by consumer spending and business investments. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta indicates a growth rate of 2.5% for the July-September quarter.Economic concerns weigh heavily on voters as the presidential election on November 5 approaches. While many Americans appreciate the job market's resilience, high prices continue to frustrate them, remaining approximately 19% above levels recorded in February 2021 when inflation began surging.",
        "summary": "The US economy experienced significant job growth last month, adding 254,000 jobs and reducing the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Despite a slowdown in the hiring rate and worker confidence, wage growth remains strong, making further substantial rate cuts from the Federal Reserve unlikely.",

        "text": "Gold has always been a haven both for investors and borrowers. Even in recent times, gold loans are becoming increasingly popular for those seeking quick financial assistance. They allow borrowers to leverage their gold jewellery to secure funds without the need for extensive complicated documentation or a perfect credit score. Moreover, gold loan interest rates are generally lower than unsecured loans, making them a cost-effective borrowing option. Understanding the various benefits of a gold loan is essential, if an individual is planning on availing one. This can significantly improve one's overall borrowing experience. Bajaj Finance Gold Loan All about the gold loan A gold loan is a secured loan where individuals can pledge their 18-22 karat gold jewellery as collateral to obtain funds. This type of loan offers numerous benefits, including: Quick processing Gold loans are typically processed much faster than traditional loans, with many lenders offering instant approvals. This rapid turnaround can be a lifesaver for those facing unexpected expenses. Higher loan amounts Borrowers can receive loans based on the value of the gold pledged, often up to 75% of its market value. This flexibility allows individuals to secure the exact amount they need without overcommitting. No need for perfect credit score Since gold acts as collateral, lenders are more lenient regarding the borrowers credit history. This makes gold loans an attractive option for those who may struggle to secure other types of financing due to a lower CIBIL score. Reasons to choose Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan There are multiple lenders in the market that one can choose from. However, here are some reasons that make Bajaj Finance a preferable choice for many borrowers: Quick loan processing Bajaj Finance processes gold loans quickly, allowing borrowers to get the funds they need without delays. This is particularly helpful when funding immediate expenses, such as medical bills or urgent repairs. Minimal documentation Borrowers can secure a substantial loan amount by submitting their basic KYC documents like Aadhaar card, Voter ID, driving licence, passport, letter from NPR or NREGA job card. High loan amount One can get a loan starting from \u00e2\u0082\u00b95,000 to \u00e2\u0082\u00b92 crore, depending on the value of the gold pledged, gold loan interest rate, and the borrowers liquidity requirements. This makes it possible for individuals to meet their financial needs, whether big or small. Convenient repayment options With multiple repayment plans, borrowers can choose a schedule that suits their financial situation, making it easier to manage repayments. This flexibility ensures that borrowers can stay on top of their finances without feeling overwhelmed. Zero part-prepayment fee Bajaj Finance does not levy any part-prepayment fees, allowing borrowers to save on unnecessary administrative costs when they clear their loans early. This feature is especially beneficial for those who might receive windfalls or bonuses and wish to reduce their debt. Complimentary insurance on gold assets When opting for a loan with Bajaj Finance, pledging gold is insured for free, providing added peace of mind. This safeguard ensures that borrowers do not have to worry about the security of their valuable assets while they are being used as collateral. Steps to apply for a Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan Applying for a gold loan with Bajaj Finance is pretty simple.

        "title": "Insurance Query: Evaluating business-owners\u2019 financial stability",
        "text": "I am 42 years old. I run my own business. I wish to buy life insurance, but I don\u2019t get salary slips, which is an important document to buy a policy. How can I get covered? Congratulations on taking the important step of considering life insurance. It is an essential tool to secure the future of your dependents and safeguard your business interests. Insurance providers understand that entrepreneurs and business-owners like yourself have different financial structures and offer various alternative ways to evaluate your financial stability. There are several options available to you: Bank statements: Your bank statements can offer a clear picture of your financial health and stability. As a business-owner, your transactional history and cash flow from your primary bank account (reasonably reflecting your business and savings) will serve as proof of income. By examining your regular deposits and business-related transactions, we can get a comprehensive understanding of your financial standing. A 12-month record of your bank statements is typically sufficient to demonstrate your financial viability. Using account aggregators, your bank statements can be verified digitally with your consent, with your mobile number and an OTP. Income tax returns (ITR): Another excellent option is your ITR. They reflect your declared income over time and are particularly useful for self-employed individuals or business owners whose income may fluctuate. Your ITR provides consistency, helping us determine an accurate picture of your earning capacity. This is a reliable document for underwriting purposes, giving us the confidence to offer you a suitable insurance policy. Vahan portal: If you own a vehicle, we can retrieve information from the Vahan Dashboard, a government database of registered vehicles. These data help us assess your assets and overall financial position. While vehicle ownership may not directly indicate your full financial strength, it adds another dimension to your profile, further enriching the financial underwriting process. Credit history: Your credit history \u2014 whether through credit card transactions, personal loans, or business loans \u2014 can be accessed via credit bureaus based on your PAN. This allows us to assess your financial behaviour, creditworthiness, and ability to manage financial obligations. A strong credit score is a key indicator of financial health and can significantly strengthen your life insurance application. GST details: As a business-owner, your goods and services tax (GST) filings can be another surrogate for salary slips. GST returns provide insight into your business\u2019 turnover and profitability, helping us assess your financial standing and stability. If your business is registered under GST, sharing your filings can help us tailor your insurance coverage based on your business performance. Other ways In rare cases, when the above financial surrogates may not fully establish your eligibility, there are still ways to secure a policy. Insurers are often open to considering other financial assets you may own, such as property, investments or business assets, that can demonstrate your financial strength. Flexibility is key, and we believe that every customer deserves a thorough and fair evaluation. Points to note You can present any asset you own \u2014 property, mutual funds, fixed deposits, or business assets. All of these contribute to demonstrating your financial health for the purposes of underwriting. Always provide clear, accurate and up-to-date financial documents. This ensures a smooth, hassle-free process with no delays in securing your life insurance policy. Since every individual\u2019s financial situation is unique, especially for business-owners like yourself, insurance companies now offer policies designed specifically for entrepreneurs and other self-employed individuals.

        "title": "RBI survey indicates slowdown in manufacturing",
        "text": "The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) latest quarterly industrial outlook survey of 1,300 manufacturing companies reveals that manufacturing companies are witnessing a slowing growth in the first and second quarter of 2024-25. This is also mirrored in manufacturing PMI which is tapering downwards.\n\nAccording to RBI survey data, the net response (difference in the percentage of companies reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism) regarding production output has decreased from 27.9 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 22.9 per cent in Q2 2024-25. The number was 34.4 in the fourth quarter of FY24. This implies that more manufacturers witnessed slowdown in production this fiscal. One concern is that the companies polled indicated a steep fall in growth expectation of production output in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal.\n\nThe RBI survey report states that the pressure from raw material costs, financing expenses, and salary payments has eased. As a result, expectations of growth in selling prices and profit margins have also softened. \u201cManufacturers polled for better expectations on production, order books, employment, capacity utilisation and overall business situation during Q4:2024-25 and Q1:2025-26. Input cost pressures are likely to continue for manufacturers, who expect to retain pricing power and increase in selling prices on the back of robust demand conditions,\u201d the survey report reads.\n\nGeopolitical strife\n\nRamendra Verma, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat says, \u201cThiscan be attributed to a chain reaction of geo-political situation, which has resulted in supply chain disruptions leading to high inputs costs (for e.g. \u2013 energy and semiconductors). This is also leading to weakening of demand.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, net responses for order book growth dropped 25.6 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 19.5 per cent in Q2 2024-25, while net responses for pending orders increased from 5.9 per cent to 8 per cent in the same period. Similarly, net responses for capacity utilisation fell from 18.7 per cent to 15.1 per cent.\n\nVerma outlined several factors contributing to the low net responses for order books, such as declining consumer confidence and reduced spending, which have led to fewer new orders. Additionally, global economic uncertainties have made businesses reluctant to place large orders. \u201cMany manufacturers are operating below capacity due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions,\u201d Verma explained, adding that this under-utilisation is also linked to more cautious inventory management practices.\n\nSujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, pointed out that the slower growth in related indicators aligns with the decline in industrial production. In Q1 FY25, capacity utilisation dropped after surpassing 75 per cent in the final quarter of the previous fiscal. \u201cOne of the reasons for lower utilisation was elections which usually disrupts activity along with heatwaves especially in the north. This was also highlighted in the PMI survey which indicated some of the factories remained shut due to excessive heat,\u201d Hajra added. \n\nThe monthly Purchasing Managers Index for India\u2019s manufacturing sector has also shown a downward trend. It was reported at 58.8 in April 2024, remained relatively stable at 58.3 in June, but declined slightly to 57.5 in August 2024, and further dropped to 56.5 in September 2024.\n\nThe global market research firm Nomura\u2019s report indicates a similar weakening outlook. \u201cEven as the pace of government spending picks up in coming months and base effects become more favourable, we expect growth momentum to remain soft, due to fading urban pent-up demand, tight monetary policy, a moderation in credit growth, negative real rural wage growth, sluggish private capex and soft external demand,\u201d the Nomura report says.",

They will stay put for two days and public entry to MUDA Office has been restricted.\n\nThe investigation focuses on the controversial allotment of 14 sites to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah\u2019s wife, B.M. Parvathi, along with other irregularities related to 50:50 site allocations, alternative sites and compensatory sites. Social activist Snehamayi Krishna has complained to the ED that irregularities worth Rs. 4,000 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore has happened in MUDA.\n\nThe team, accompanied by armed personnel, travelled from Bengaluru\u2019s Shantinagar Office and arrived at MUDA gate around 10.45 am. More than 20 armed personnel from Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have provided security to the ED sleuths. The Mysuru City Police are providing additional security.\n\nAfter their arrival, an ED representative informed the Police officers on duty at MUDA gate that they were from ED in Bengaluru. Upon hearing the update, MUDA Commissioner A.N. Raghunandan promptly arrived at the gate to welcome the ED officers. Subsequently, the sleuths proceeded directly to the MUDA Commissioner\u2019s chamber on second floor, where they began discussions in the antechamber around 11.30 am.\n\nAn Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Siddaramaiah, Parvathi and others, revolving around allegations of illegal money transfers linked to the land allotments.\n\nRaid at Kengeri home\n\nSources informed Star of Mysore that the ED team also conducted a raid at the residence of J. Devaraju in Kengeri, Bengaluru. Devaraju was the individual who sold the 3.16-acre land at Kesare to B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy, Parvathi\u2019s brother. Mallikarjunaswamy later gifted the land to Parvathi, in exchange for which she received 14 sites in the Vijayanagar Third and Fourth Stages under a 50:50 ratio.\n\nAfter a brief discussion in the antechamber of the Commissioner\u2019s Office, the ED sleuths proceeded to MUDA Chairman\u2019s Office. Chairman K. Marigowda has already resigned from his post. The officers then moved to the meeting room adjacent to Chairman\u2019s Office, where they held discussions with senior officials.\n\nWill cooperate: MUDA Secretary\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the MUDA Office around 12.15 pm, MUDA Secretary Prasanna Kumar stated that the ED has officially commenced its investigation. \u201cWe will cooperate with the sleuths and provide whatever information they request. All documents will be made available, and there will be no public work for two days,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked how much longer the ED sleuths intend to remain in Mysuru, the MUDA Secretary replied that, for now, they would stay for two days. \u201cDepending on their progress, their stay might be extended. Ultimately, it is for them to decide, and I have no role to play in that matter,\u201d he added.\n\nSeeking documents\n\nBefore arriving in Mysuru, the ED had instructed MUDA to submit all the crucial documents related to the case, which forms the basis of the FIR (11/2024) registered by the Lokayukta against Siddaramaiah, his wife Parvathi, his brother-in-law B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy and landowner J. Devaraju.\n\nLokayukta Police have already launched a detailed investigation, examining alleged offences spanning from 1968 to 2023. Teams are tracing records dating as far back as 1935, when Ninga, father of Devaraju, originally owned the disputed land in Kesare\u2019s survey numbers 462 and 464.",

        "title": "Why this small-cap real estate and EPC company is a worthy buy",
        "text": "Both the construction and infrastructure industries have taken off strongly in the post-Covid period. Residential real estate and commercial construction have been on overdrive over the past three-four years. Infrastructure projects such as ports have been in the limelight for a while now and continue to see considerable traction.\n\nAs a play on these segments, Man Infraconstruction (Man Infra) has been a key beneficiary of the offtake in the real estate and construction businesses.\n\nThe company focuses on residential construction and infrastructure projects (ports). It takes an EPC (engineering, procurement and contracting/construction) approach in its infrastructure business as well as select real estate projects. \n\nIn the residential construction segment, Man Infra takes the joint development agreement (JDA), joint venture (JV), development manager (DM) and society redevelopment approaches, which ensure that the upfront investments are minimal and margins are healthy. It is focused on the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in its residential towers projects.\n\nAt \u20b9190, the stock trades at 23 times its per share earnings for FY24 and 19 times its likely per share earnings for FY25. This is among the lowest valuation multiples commanded by any real estate or construction company with mid-sized operations. The BSE Realty trades at a PE of nearly 65 times, while most frontline and mid-sized real estate players trade at price-earnings multiples of 30-70 times. \n\nA track record of strong execution of projects, expertise in residential, commercial properties, as well as ports, multiple revenue streams via a low-risk, asset-light business model and a net-debt-free balance sheet are positives for Man Infra. The company has both private and public sector clients.\n\nThe stock has corrected about 20 per cent from its recent high and presents a reasonably attractive opportunity. Investors with a two-three-year perspective can buy the shares of the company at the current price. \n\nBetween FY22 and FY24, the company\u2019s revenues grew at a compounded annual rate of 43.5 per cent to \u20b91,263.5 crore in FY24, while net profits rose at nearly 111 per cent annually to \u20b9300.4 crore. It enjoys an EBITDA margin of 25.8 per cent in FY24, which is among the best in the industry.\n\nDiversified operating model\n\nMan Infra has been in the construction business for nearly 60 years now. It has specialised capabilities in the ports business. It has helped in the development of eight major ports in India including those of Navi Mumbai, Chennai, Gujarat Pipavav, Mundra and Kochi. It has also been an EPC contractor for leading infrastructure companies and real estate developers. \n\nIn the last several years, Man Infra has been able to up its game in the residential space. Projects such as Atmosphere O2, Mulund West (47 storeys \u2013 two towers), Aaradhya Highpark, Nr. Dahisar (30 storeys \u2013 six towers) and Aaradhya EastWind, Vikhroli (34 storeys) were executed in three-and-a-half to four years.\n\nIn the last 10 years, the company has become a reasonably-established player in the MMR, with a presence in the central, eastern, western suburbs and recently in South Mumbai as well.\n\nIn all, 17 projects totalling 2.4 million sq ft have been delivered, mostly six months to one year ahead of schedule. Around 90 per cent of its inventory reportedly is sold before even the occupancy certificate is received.\n\nMan Infra receives DM fee for handling and marketing a real estate project. It receives EPC margin for in-house construction and engineering capabilities. The company receives interest margin on funds infused into projects. \n\nIn the EPC business, it receives regular EPC margin from the government and private clients. When it professionally manages a site, material and labour of a real estate project, it receives a PMC (project management consultancy) margin. \n\nRevenues from projects executed under the DM model are not reflected in consolidated sales figures, but only the DM fee (12-14 per cent of total project revenues) gets added to the sales and PBT.\n\nFor projects executed under the JV model, sales are not reflected in the consolidated revenue figure, but the company\u2019s share of profits gets added to the bottom line.\n\nThus, in the DM model, all costs and revenues are booked in the landlord\u2019s financials, while in the JV model, all costs and revenues are booked in the SPV, even as Man Infra receives a share of profit based on the extent of its stake in the venture.\n\nThis asset-light approach is set to continue for the company. Given the focus on DM and JV-based revenue generation, the top-line growth may not be as robust as in the past few years, though profitability is set to receive a considerable boost given that minimal to no upfront capital commitment is required.\n\nFuture potential and healthy financials\n\nMan Infra has cash and cash equivalents of \u20b9487 crore as of June 2024. Its debt was only \u20b933 crore as of June 2024, down from \u20b9332 crore in September 2022. Very few real estate and construction players enjoy a net-debt-free balance sheet as well as healthy operating margins.\n\nThe company has 6.1 million sq ft of carpet area waiting for execution over the next several years. Man Infra\u2019s real estate business itself has a visibility of \u20b915,000 crore over the next five-six years, with margins expected to be north of 20 per cent consistently.",

        "text": "As the agriculture minister chairs the annual conference on Rabi crops on Saturday, where strategies will be chalked out with States for a bumper harvest, one important issue to grab attention may be the shortage of Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), the key fertiliser used in wheat, mustard and gram, all three major winter crops. \n\nLatest data show that sales of DAP fell to 7.76 lakh tonnes (lt) last month, which is 51 per cent lower from 15.7 lt year-ago. Monthly sales of DAP in September were reported at 11.15 lt in 2022, 5.96 lt in 2021, 7.65 lt in 2020 and 6.33 lt in 2019.\n\n\u201cFarmers normally buy DAP in September-October to prepare the field for the sowing. With a favourable monsoon and its delayed withdrawal as well as good moisture has created the demand for fertilisers as farmers expect a good harvest of winter crops,\u201d said agriculture scientist A K Singh. \n\nAlso read: India decides to ease rice export curbs further\n\nWith the reports of farmers\u2019 protest over alleged shortages of DAP coming particularly from Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, there is something amiss as far as availability is concerned, Singh added.\n\n\u201cWheat crop this year is very crucial and the government should not take any chance and ensure ample and timely availability,\u201d Singh suggested and added that there should be study on shrivelled crop of wheat, which has been continuing for last few years and the government has been relaxing procurement norms in one state or the other.\n\nAccording to the crop weather watch report, the total fertiliser sale during Kharif season 2024 (April-September) was 319.97 lt which included 189.12 lt of urea, 46.12 lt of DAP, 9.27 lt of MOP and 75.46 lt of complex (a mixture of N, P , K nutrients). The total demand for the season was estimated at 321.44 lt \u2013 177.12 lt of urea, 59.87 lt of DAP, 10.26 lt of MOP and 74.19 lt of complex.\n\nSingh said that it is unusual to see the fall in sales of DAP as against its projected demand whereas there is no such difference noticed in other fertilisers when sales data are compared with demand.\n\nOfficial data show that sales of urea were up 3.1 per cent at 30.89 lt in September 2024 from 29.97 lt year-ago, but those of MOP were down 4.7 per cent at 2.25 lt from 2.36 lt and complex dropped by 11.6 per cent at 16.6 lt from 18.77 lt.\n\nThe Centre will discuss (on October 19) with state officials about the plan and strategies about the on-going Rabi sowing season that started from October 1, to ensure that the winter-grown foodgrains production target of 164 million tonnes (mt) including 115 mt of wheat, 13.65 mt of gram and 13.8 mt of mustard, officials said.\n\nAlso read: Rice exports a tad lower in H1, but trade sees shipments gaining pace in year ahead as govt eases curbs",

The bracelet, passed on to him by his father Salim Khan, has been integral to Salman\u2019s life for several decades. You will never spot Salman without the bracelet. So how does the Firoza bracelet secure Salman Khan? In a recently resurfaced Reddit video, Salman elucidates the protective mechanism of the \u201cFiroza\u201d stone in his bracelet. He says, \u201cThis stone is called Firoza. Apparently, there are only two living stones, they say. One is a Greek, and one is a Firoza. This is the turquoise. What happens with this is if there\u2019s any negativity coming onto you, first this takes it. It gets veins in it and then it cracks. This is my seventh stone.\u201d Healing properties Turquoise, a mesmerising gemstone, is recognised not only for its vibrant blue-green hue but also for its rich history and believed metaphysical properties. The benefits of wearing turquoise are manifold, spanning from health and emotional well-being to spiritual growth,\u201d says Dr Priya Kaul, a spiritual life coach and healer. \u201cIt is supposed to calm and reduce anxiety and tension. Its calming effect can help people handle anger and stress, promoting stability, she says adding, \u201cThis gemstone promotes self-expression and communication, which may help emotional upheaval sufferers.\u201d Firoza, the living stone Turquoise, also popularly known as \u201cFiroza\u201d, is a powerful gem that brings in good luck, blessings of higher powers, and spiritual protection to people who tend to get into conflicts very often. \u201cIt\u2019s a stone that activates your good luck and ability to get through situations. Turquoise is associated with the planet Jupiter, which activates the luck side of divine protection,\u201d says Neelam Naseeb, CEO of MBM Crystals and the Ursoulcompass community. People who tend to be overly emotional at times can wear this crystal to balance their emotions. Neelam says, \u201cAstrologically and spiritually, anyone can wear this crystal to enhance good luck and protection.\u201d She suggests that individuals seeking balance and making decisions based on divine guidance, rather than emotions, should wear this more frequently. Enhanced Communication: Dr Priya refers to turquoise as the \u201cstone of communication.\u201d \u201cIt encourages open dialogue, making it a perfect companion for those in professions that require clear expressions\u2014like teaching, counselling, or public speaking.\u201d Spiritual Growth: \u201cMany practitioners of meditation and yoga wear turquoise to enhance their spiritual journey, as it helps to release outdated belief systems and foster a deeper connection to one\u2019s higher self,\u201d says Priya. Physical Well-Being: People believe that turquoise supports the respiratory system, alleviates ailments like asthma, and promotes overall physical well-being. \u201cIts detoxifying properties may also improve metabolic processes and enhance immunity. People often wear turquoise as a talisman for overall health and protection against illness.\u201d Protection and Safety: Many ancient cultures, including Native Americans, wore it as a safeguard against negative energies, psychic attacks, and physical threats. \u201cFor those who travel frequently or live in uncertain circumstances, wearing turquoise can impart a sense of safety and security.\u201d Promoting Creativity: The vibrant colours of turquoise stimulate creativity and inspire self-expression. Artists, musicians, and writers often wear this gemstone to tap into their creative energies. Aesthetic appeal: Apart from its metaphysical properties, turquoise is visually stunning and can enhance any jewelry collection. It pairs beautifully with many metals and stones, making it a versatile choice for various styles\u2014whether in rings, necklaces, bracelets, or earrings.",

        "title": "Your Guide to Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates in India",
        "text": "Purchasing a car is not just a significant milestone; it\u2019s often a major financial commitment that can impact your budget for years to come. One of the most crucial aspects of financing your vehicle is securing the best car loan interest rates. Whether you\u2019re considering a sleek new model or a reliable used car, understanding how to get favorable loan terms can save you substantial money over time. This guide provides essential tips and insights to help you secure the best deal on your car loan and streamline your new car loan approval process.\n\nWhy Car Loan Interest Rates Matter\n\nCar loan interest rates play a vital role in determining how much you will ultimately pay for your vehicle. A lower interest rate means reduced monthly payments and lower total interest paid over the loan term. On the other hand, a higher interest rate can inflate the overall cost of your vehicle, leading to financial strain.\n\nFor example, consider a \u20b910,00,000 car loan with a five-year term. If you secure a loan with an 8% interest rate, your monthly payment will be approximately \u20b920,000. However, if your interest rate is 12%, your monthly payment jumps to around \u20b922,000. Over five years, that\u2019s a difference of nearly \u20b91,20,000! Clearly, understanding how to obtain the best car loan interest rates is essential for making a sound financial decision.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nSeveral factors influence the car loan interest rates you may qualify for, including:\n\n1. Credit Score\n\nYour credit score is one of the most significant determinants of your car loan interest rates. Lenders assess your creditworthiness based on this score; a higher credit score generally results in a lower interest rate. For example, individuals with a score above 700 typically enjoy more favorable loan terms than those with lower scores.\n\nBefore applying for a car loan, it\u2019s wise to check your credit score. If you find areas for improvement, such as outstanding debts or errors on your credit report, take steps to rectify these issues. Paying off debts and ensuring timely payments can help boost your score, making you more attractive to lenders.\n\n2. Loan Term\n\nThe length of your loan, or the term, can also impact your interest rate. Generally, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates, while longer-term loans may carry higher rates but result in lower monthly payments. It\u2019s crucial to strike a balance that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nWhile a longer loan term might seem appealing due to lower monthly payments, keep in mind that you could end up paying significantly more in interest over the life of the loan. Consider your budget and long-term financial objectives when choosing a loan term.\n\n3. Loan Amount and Down Payment\n\nThe amount you borrow, and your down payment can influence the interest rate offered. A larger down payment reduces the loan amount, which can lead to a lower interest rate. Additionally, a significant down payment shows lenders that you are financially responsible, potentially improving your loan terms.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the car\u2019s purchase price. For example, if you\u2019re purchasing a car for \u20b915,00,000, a down payment of \u20b93,00,000 can significantly improve your chances of securing a better rate.\n\n4. Market Conditions\n\nCurrent market conditions can also affect car loan interest rates. Economic factors, such as inflation and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policies, can influence lending rates across the board. Keeping an eye on market trends can help you time your loan application for better rates.\n\nTips for Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nTo maximize your chances of obtaining the best car loan interest rates, follow these actionable tips:\n\n1. Improve Your Credit Score\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a higher credit score can lead to lower interest rates. Take proactive steps to improve your credit before applying for a loan:\n\n\u2022 Pay bills on time: Late payments can negatively impact your score.\n\n\u2022 Reduce outstanding debts: Aim to lower credit card balances and pay off loans.\n\n\u2022 Check your credit report: Correct any errors that may be affecting your score.\n\n2. Shop Around\n\nNot all lenders offer the same car loan interest rates. To find the best deal, compare rates from various sources, including banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Make sure to take into account the loan terms, fees, and other charges that may apply.\n\nUse online comparison tools to simplify this process. A little research can go a long way in helping you secure a better interest rate.\n\n3. Consider Pre-Approval\n\nGetting pre-approved for a car loan can significantly enhance your bargaining power when shopping for a vehicle. Pre-approval provides you with a clear idea of how much you can borrow and what interest rates you might qualify for. This not only streamlines the buying process but also strengthens your position when negotiating with dealerships.\n\nAdditionally, a pre-approved loan can help you avoid high dealer financing rates, ensuring that you stick to your budget.\n\n4. Negotiate Your Rate\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to negotiate with lenders. If you receive a better rate from another lender, use it as leverage in your discussions. Many lenders are willing to match or even beat competing offers to secure your business.\n\nBe prepared to discuss your credit history and financial situation during negotiations. Demonstrating that you\u2019ve done your research can bolster your position.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Additional Fees\n\nWhen considering a car loan, pay attention to any additional fees that may affect your overall costs. These can include:\n\nProcessing fees\n\nPrepayment penalties\n\nLate payment fees\n\nUnderstanding these charges can help you make a more informed decision about your loan.\n\n6. Stay Informed About Market Trends\n\nKeeping an eye on market conditions can help you identify the best time to apply for a loan. Interest rates can fluctuate based on economic factors, so being informed can guide your decision-making process.\n\nNavigating the world of car loan interest rates doesn\u2019t have to be daunting. By understanding the factors that influence your rate and taking proactive measures, you can significantly reduce your vehicle's overall cost. Start by checking your credit score, comparing lenders, considering your loan term, and confidently negotiating your rate. With these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to drive off in your new car with a loan that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nReady to kick off your journey? Begin by reviewing your credit score and exploring various lenders to uncover the best car loan interest rates available. Your dream car is within reach\u2014ensure you\u2019re financing it wisely!",

Its drones have reportedly been used by both sides in the ongoing war in Ukraine.The Pentagon added DJI to its list of Chinese military-linked companies in 2022. It claimed at that time that China ensures access to advanced technologies and expertise through PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian but support military advancements.

DJI denied these claims and suspended business operations in both Russia and Ukraine in April 2022 to reassess compliance requirements.DJI was also previously blacklisted by the US department of the treasury in 2021 for allegedly supporting the surveillance of the Uyghur minority in China's Xinjiang region.",

That in turn will open the doors for the dollar index to see a fresh rise to 105-105.50 in the coming weeks. \n\nFinds support\n\nThe US 10Yr Treasury yield (4.08 per cent) is getting support around 4 per cent. The yield fell in the first half of the week and made a low of 3.99 per cent. But from there it rose back well in the second half recovering all the loss.\n\nImmediate resistance is at 4.12 per cent. A break above it can take the US 10Yr Treasury yield up to 4.17 and 4.21 per cent this week. The price action thereafter will need a close watch to see if the rise is extending beyond 4.21 per cent or not.\n\nThe outlook will turn negative only if the yield declines below 4 per cent. Only then the chances of a fall to 3.85-3.8 per cent will come into the picture again.\n\nMore downside\n\nThe euro (EURUSD: 1.0867) continues to fall. It touched a low of 1.0811 and has bounced back from there. The broader trend is down. Resistances are at 1.0885 and then 1.0920-1.0930 which can cap the upside if more rise is seen from current levels.\n\nThe outlook is bearish to break 1.08 in the coming days. Such a break can take the euro down to 1.0750 in the short term.\n\nThe level of 1.0750 is a strong support which can halt the current fall. A bounce from there can trigger a corrective rise to 1.09-1.0950 going forward.\n\nThe Indian rupee (USDINR: 84.07) was broadly stable all through last week. The domestic currency was stuck in a narrow 10-paise range of 83.98-84.08 through the week. The break above 84 seen on Wednesday failed to get a strong follow-through rise. There are chances for the rupee to remain stuck between 84 and 84.10 for some more time.\n\nHowever, the bias is negative. We expect the rupee to break 84.10 eventually and decline towards 84.40 going forward. \n\nRupee has to get a sustained rise above 84 in order to see a recovery towards 83.85-83.80.\n\nOn the charts, the medium-term picture is negative for the rupee. It is likely to remain below 83.50 going forward. Once the break below 84.10 happens, it will open the doors for the rupee to weaken towards 84.80-85 over the medium-term.",

        "text": "The Nobel prize in economics for 2024, or more correctly Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded earlier this week has triggered off debates not as much about economics but about colonialism and its institutions. Economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were awarded for their significant work on how a nation\u2019s institutions shape its economic development. Among the most cited in economics, their work not only draws a connection between the two but parses societal institutions into \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cextractive\u201d, and theorises that inclusive institutions have a positive long-term impact on economic prosperity while extractive institutions stifle a country\u2019s economic development. They claim inclusive institutions are the ones that promote democracy, limit corruption, enforce justice and property rights; the extractive show a high concentration of power, corruption, and limited political freedom.\n\nThe claim that certain institutions are a pre-condition for economic development has drawn criticism from within the discipline because inclusive institutions in many high-income western economies came about after their development. Equally important is how countries like China, to take an example, enjoy staggering economic prosperity despite \u201cextractive\u201d institutions. The economists have ignored the impact of colonialism \u2014 and its extractive institutions in colonies \u2014 on economic development. This should interest India where the flavour of the season is to throw off the colonial yoke and symbols. Its institutions, a colonial legacy, still function on the discredited trickle-down theory; there has been a staggering rise in its billionaires count even as household savings have fallen sharply with people spending more on basic necessities. If anything, this year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics draws attention to why it is critical for India to de-colonise its economic structure that was, and continues to be, based on the extractive principle.",

        "text": "State-run lender UCO Bank on Saturday reported around 50 per cent year-on-year growth in its net profit to \u20b9602.74 crore for the second quarter this fiscal, backed by over 45 per cent y-o-y rise in its operating profit and around 44 per cent y-o-y fall in provisions during the period.\n\nThe Kolkata-based bank had registered \u20b9401.67 crore net profit for the second quarter last fiscal. The lender posted \u20b9550.96 crore net profit in the first quarter of the current financial year. \n\nIts operating profit for the second quarter of FY25 grew \u20b945.80 crore to \u20b91431.60 crore from \u20b9 981.88 crore for the corresponding period of FY24, the bank said in a stock exchange filing. \n\nNet Interest Income (NII) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 stood at \u20b92300.34 crore, registering a growth of around 20 per cent on a y-o-y basis as against \u20b91916.55 crore for the same period a year ago. Domestic Net Interest Margin (NIM) rose 25 basis points y-o-y to 3.30 per cent. During the period non-interest income grew 53.48 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9993.07 crore. \n\nTalking to the media, UCO Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Office Ashwani Kumar said the increase in net interest income and non-interest income were the two main factors for the growth in net profit. \u201cOur provision coverage ratio slightly came down and NIM improved,\u201d Kumar said. Provision Coverage Ratio stood at 95.92 per cent as on September 30, 2024.\n\nTotal provision during the quarter fell 44.07 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9492.84 crore compared with \u20b9342.09 crore for the same period last fiscal. Fresh slippages stood at \u20b9864 crore during Q2FY25 compared with \u20b9578 crore in Q2FY24. \u201cSlippage was slightly elevated in this quarter due to one corporate account which turned into an NPA, having an exposure of around \u20b9245 crore,\u201d the MD said. \n\nTotal Recovery and upgradation\n\nTotal recovery and upgradation during the period stood at \u20b91017 crore as against \u20b9656 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal. \n\nUCO Bank has so far recovered around 90 per cent of the \u201cerroneous credits\u201d which certain account holders of the bank had received via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) last year. \u201cActions are on to recover the rest of the money. Our endeavour is to recover maximum during this fiscal,\u201d Kumar said. Notably, certain accounts holders of the Kolkata-based bank in November last year had received a total of around Rs 820 crore \u201cerroneous credits\u201d via IMPS.\n\nThe lender\u2019s asset quality improved during Q2FY25. Gross NPA ratio fell 96 bps year-on-year to 3.18 per cent, whereas net NPA ratio fell 38 bps y-o-y to 0.73 per cent during the period. \n\nThe bank is planning to tap capital markets for raising of equity capital upto \u20b9 1500-2000 crore by way of QIP in one or more tranches. \u201cWe may go for it in the third quarter, subject to market conditions,\u201d Kumar said. \n\nThe bank\u2019s overall loan growth target for this fiscal is 12-14 per cent y-o-y. It expects that home and car loans to grow 18 per cent and 30 per cent y-o-y, respectively, during this festive season.\n\nIn the second quarter the lender witnessed an 18 per cent y-o-y growth in gross advances, while deposits growth stood at 10.57 per cent y-o-y.",

Among the key industries fueling this growth, the Indian government has prioritised the agrochemical sector, recognising it as one of the \u201c12 industries with the greatest potential for India to achieve global leadership.\u201d\n\nThe agrochemical sector has experienced significant progress, with projections estimating its value will reach $8.22 billion by 2024 and grow to $13.08 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 4 per cent. \n\nHowever, FY2023-24 brought its share of challenges, including fluctuating markets, rising raw material costs, and unpredictable monsoons. \n\nAlso read: What is it in the Digital Farm Mission?\n\nResilient industry\n\nThe industry has remained resilient, supported by government initiatives like \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cAtmanirbhar Abhiyan,\u201d strategic investments, and a focus on innovation. Increased collaboration in research and development, alongside the growing focus on manufacturing is expected to further drive the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nInternational magazine Agropages released the rankings of the top 20 Indian agrochemical companies based on their FY 2023-24 performance. The revenue threshold for inclusion in the top 20 list increased to \u20b91,226 crore, up from \u20b91,151 crore in the previous year, reflecting robust growth among the Indian agrochemical companies. \n\nAmong the top 20 companies, 11 surpassed the \u20b92,000 crore sales mark, while nine companies reported revenues between \u20b91,000 crore and \u20b92,000 crore. \n\nNotably, 10 companies posted year-on-year growth, with PI Industries and Safex Chemicals achieving double-digit increases, nearing or exceeding 20 per cent. \n\nOn the other hand, 10 companies faced declines in sales, with Sharda Cropchem and Meghmani Group experiencing the steepest drops.\n\nFocus on R&D pays off\n\nOne of the standout performers in the Agropages rankings was Best Agrolife Ltd (BAL), which climbed from 16th place last year to 13th in FY 23-24. \n\nThe company reported a consolidated revenue of \u20b91,873.3 crores for the fiscal year, showcasing its growth and increasing market presence. Interestingly, the company\u2019s growth relied on building its brand business. Its branded business grew by 85 per cent in FY \u201824, while having shifted its focus from B2B to B2C. \n\nThe company\u2019s focus on R&D and patented products seems to have yielded a strong product presence in the expanding customer base.

The consumer price inflation in India rose to 5.49 per cent in September from 3.65 per cent in the previous month, well above market estimates of 5 per cent. It was the highest inflation rate since the start of the year, overshooting the RBI\u2019s target of 4 per cent after dropping below the threshold in the first two months of the September quarter.\n\nHowever, a significant fall in crude oil prices helped the market to recover from lower levels.\n\nOn the domestic front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to offload shares, selling Rs 21,823 crore in the cash segment, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) kept their buying momentum with purchases totalling Rs16,384 crore in the same segment.\n\nPalka Arora Chopra, Director of Master Capital Services said, \u201cNifty 50 ended its three-week losing streak by closing in the green. The key resistance now stands at 25,000, and a breakout above this could lead to a move toward 25,300.

        "text": "The USD 200 billion Chinese food delivery industry, once a thriving sector that expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic, is now facing a downturn, according to a report by CNN.Having more than doubled in size over three years, this industry \u2013 the world\u2019s largest by revenue and volume of orders \u2013 had provided a steady income for casual workers. However, the workers are now struggling to make ends meet.China\u2019s economic slowdown, prompted by a property crisis and weak consumer spending, has hit delivery workers hard, decreasing their incomes and job stability.On Friday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed a moderation in third-quarter growth and said that weakened consumer spending and the ongoing property market crisis continue to weigh heavily on the economy.Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.6 per cent in the three-month period from July to September, compared with a year ago. That was just slightly higher than the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, who had predicted an expansion of 4.5 per cent, CNN reported.According to a professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, delivery workers will persistently face pressure as long as delivery platforms prioritise cost-cutting measures. \u201cThey are working long hours, really being squeezed,\u201d said Jenny Chan, associate sociology professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong. \u201c[And] they will continue to face pressure as [delivery platforms] have to keep the cost low,\u201d she said.Chan further noted that the economic downturn has led to a shift towards budget-friendly meals, resulting in decreased earnings for delivery workers, who must then work extended hours to maintain their earnings.Apart from the given problems, the workers are constantly under immense pressure to meet tight deadlines, even if it means cutting corners on the road \u2013 by speeding or running red lights \u2013 causing hazards that endanger both themselves and other road users, CNN reported.Delivery workers have been witnessing their paychecks shrink dramatically, increasing their financial struggles.Last year, they made 6,803 yuan (USD 956) a month, according to a report from the China New Employment Research Center. That\u2019s almost 1,000 yuan (USD 140) a month less than they were making five years ago, despite many reporting working longer hours, according to CNN.A 1,000 yuan difference may seem negligible in US dollars, but it\u2019s substantial in China, where the national average monthly wage stood at just 1,838 yuan (USD 258) last year, according to the NBS figures.",

        "text": "Kasauli, Oct 20 (IANS) India\u2019s G20 Sherpa and former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant contends that in order for India to grow at high rates of nine to ten per cent and become a developed economy by 2047, the country\u2019s GDP has to grow by nine times and per capita income by eight times, with manufacturing and urbanisation playing a key role in the process.\n\nHe also hailed India\u2019s chairmanship of the G20 and batted for lateral entry into the government service.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturing has to grow by 16 times. It has to fire on all cylinders. We have to become a manufacturing nation,\u201d Kant told IANS at the Kasauli Literary Festival.\n\nHe also stressed that the country must urbanise in a scientific, sustainable manner, enhance agriculture productivity, and remain a services nation.\n\n\u201cFor all this to happen, you have to provide well-paid jobs to the people and every transition that takes place to manufacturing means that people must move from agriculture to manufacturing and towards urbanisation. The dependence of population in India on agriculture is 46.5 per cent,\u201d Kant added.\n\nHe pointed out that agriculture gives us 16.5 per cent of the GDP, adding that nowhere in the world does this happen.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you need to take the population away from agriculture and put them into manufacturing on better-paid quality jobs. There also needs to be stress on disinvestment, cutting red tape, and ease of doing business which has been this government\u2019s agenda,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nAbout the time when India held the presidency of G20 from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, Kant recollects that the country was able to bring consensus on all key issues confronting the world.\n\nSome of the key issues were a specific action plan for sustainable development goals which had been impacted due to Covid, the issue of strong, sustainable, balanced growth in the global economy, the issue of Green Development Pact, technological transformation and the use of digital public infrastructure and more importantly, the issue of women-led development.\n\n\u201cThese were all critical issues. But to my mind, our biggest achievement during G20 was the fact that it spoke the voice of the Global South, and under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, was able to make the African Union an integral member of G20. So, in a way, we succeeded in making it from G20 to G21 which has made G20 a far more inclusive body in the world. Now, it covers almost 90 per cent of the global population and covers a very vast, almost 80 per cent of the global GDP. So, this has been India\u2019s biggest achievement,\u201d Kant said.\n\nStressing that it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wish to hold G20 meetings in most states and UTs, and not just at one or two places, the former bureaucrat said: \u201cWe took it to every nook and corner of the country. And every state was an active participant. This required clockwork precision. It was a very federal G20. Every state brought their one district and a product forward.\u201d\n\nAdding that the country has succeeded hugely when it comes to ease of doing business, Kant claims what India has achieved in last eight years what it could not achieve in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe have scrapped over 1,600 laws. And moved up 79 positions in the World Bank ease of doing business. India has now become an easy and simple nation,\u201d he said.\n\nKant feels that the next lot of reforms have to happen by the states which have to make procedures simple.\n\n\u201cThis is very critical. India has done a lot of work in terms of insolvency, bankruptcy code, real estate regulation act, and goods and services tax. We have opened up, reduced the corporate tax, and opened up the economy for the private sector in a much bigger way while the FDI has also grown,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked why small traders are not very happy with the introduction of GST, Kant said that there will be some unhappy people when you bring in major reforms of paperless digital tax, as you are cutting out human intervention completely.\n\n\u201cGST rates in some areas are high but that is an issue where states and Central government have to sit down and sort out,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout India\u2019s focus right now, the former NITI Aayog CEO said first and foremost, the country needs to drive manufacturing in a big way and increase exports in order to become an exporting nation.\n\n\u201cWe must urbanise and must improve learning and health outcomes and nutritional standards which is very important. The social indicators to improve are very critical. Health, education, nutrition, all these are very critical over a long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nConsidering that NITI Ayog during his reign had several lateral entries, India\u2019s G20 Sherpa said that he has always been in favour of lateral entrants considering they bring in a lot of fresh thinking.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to find ways of, introducing new talents into government to constantly push for innovation and transformation within government,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that there was no disconnect between major schemes and their implementation on the ground, Kant cited a few examples.\n\n\u201cWe have made 40 million houses and provided pipe water connection to 253 million Indians. Around 130 million toilets and 88,000 kilometres of road have been made. Now this is the kind of infrastructure which no other country has been able to make in seven years. What disconnection are you talking about?\u201d",

During the previous year, the soyameal shiipments stood at 18.36 lakh tonnes. \n\nThe increase in shipments is despite the fact that Indian soyameal had been expensive in the world market by around $100-150 per tonne.\n\nIran was the largest buyer with volumes of around 4.15 lakh tonnes followed by Bangladesh at 3.02 lakh tonnes. Nepal was the third largest buyer with volumes of 1.92 lakh tonnes and Germany at 1.06 lakh tonnes and Afghanistan at 85,181 tonnes. \n\nAlso read: Iran turns saviour for pricey Indian soyameal exports\n\n\u201cIn view of demand from Iran, Bangladesh and Nepal export of soybean meal during this oil year was higher than last year by 15.90 per cent, resulting in better crushing and production of soybean meal\u201d said D N Pathak, Executive Director, The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA).\n\nSoyabean meal production increased during the year to 94.69 lakh tonnes, up from previous year\u2019s 91.79 lakh tonnes as per the latest estimates revealed by SOPA. Soyameal imports reduced during the year marginally to 0.25 lakh tonnes, down from same period last year\u2019s 0.27 lakh tonnes. \n\nDomestic consumption by the feed sector was a tad lower at 66 lakh tonnes during oil year 2023-24, down from previous year\u2019s 67 lakh tonnes, while the off-take from food sector was flat at 8 lakh tonnes. \n\nAlso read: India\u2019s oilmeal exports down by 8.5% in H1 of current fiscal \n\nFor the current oil year 2024-25, SOPA expects the production of soyabean to increase by around 6 per cent to over 125.8 lakh tonnes on higher yields, over previous year\u2019s 118.74 lakh tonnes. This is mainly on account of higher yields on account of favourable weather conditions. The yields are estimated to be higher this year at 1063 kg per hectare as against 1002 kg per ha in the previous year, as per the survey carried out by SOPA recently in the key producing states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.",

        "text": "Ananya Panday's film CTRL debuted on Netflix today (October 4). Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, the movie also stars Vihaan Samat in a key role. In a recent interview, Ananya revealed that she gets her \u201cnazar\u201d taken out every week to ward off negativity. \u201cI take out my nazar every week. The help at my house does the mirchi thing. You know the Mirchi thing? So, if it smells a lot, it means you have nazar. If the mirchi burns a lot, you have nazar. I don't know the science behind it,\u201d Ananya said in a video shared on Netflix India's YouTube channel. The actress also mentioned that her mother, Bhavana Panday, often puts \u201ckaala teeka\u201d behind her ear to shield her from the evil eye. She said, \u201cMy mom put two black dots behind my ear before I came here. Everyone thinks I don't shower or have something dirty behind my ear, but my mom keeps putting it again and again.\u201d(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Last month, Netflix dropped the trailer for CTRL. The story follows Ananya Panday's character Nella and her seemingly perfect life. She stumbles onto Control Your Life, an AI-based program. Her life changes after logging into the app. Nella's relationship with her boyfriend Joe (Vihaan Samat) comes to an end after he cheats on her but everyone blames her. In resentment, Nella says to CTRL, \u201cI just want to erase my ex.\u201d While Nella wants to take away her suffering, the app has different ideas. Soon after, Joe's presence in the real world starts fading along with his social media blueprint. After a phone conversation, Nella learns that Joe has gone missing. \"But isn't that what you wanted?\" an AI-generated character asks Nella in the last few seconds of the trailer.Sharing her thoughts on playing Nella, Ananya Panday said in a statement, \u201cMy character Nella is like any of us. She's caught up in a world dominated by technology and social media. CTRL explores how we navigate the fine line between our online presence and who we are in real life. Working with Vikram sir and Nikhil sir has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait for you to watch it on Netflix and uncover the connection between Nella and Allen,\u201d reported News18.

        "text": "The media is buzzing with tales of a whopping Rs 50 crore heist from a retired IAS officer\u2019s high residence in the tranquil hills of Uttarakhand. What\u2019s drawing attention is not just the theft, but also the great question\u2014how did such a hefty sum of money get there in the first place? The babu, once a powerful figure in a nearby state government and still considered very close to the Chief Minister there, has now become the focus of suspicion on social media, where rumours are spreading quickly. What makes this case even more intriguing is the fact that no formal FIR has been lodged, despite the scale of the theft. Some media outlets have meanwhile received notices, we\u2019re hearing. Neither the authorities nor anyone associated with the officer appears prepared to speak out, adding to the mystery. A Lucknow-based daily broke the story, alleging ties to a powerful ex-bureaucrat but not naming any names. As expected, the story has since gone viral, with social media users spreading the word and speculating about the officer\u2019s identity. Many people question why the authorities are so tight-lipped. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the officer\u2019s wife was emotionally affected by the occurrence, adding another layer of personal drama to an already sensational case. What\u2019s really going on here? Some argue that this is yet another example of how certain public officials stash illicit wealth in cash to avoid detection by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Cash is harder to trace, making it a convenient way to fly under the radar of anti-corruption bodies. If the stolen money is found, experts warn that any attempt by the officer to reclaim it could trigger a new legal firestorm under the Prevention of Corruption Act. For now, the silence around the case only seems to intensify public curiosity. The lack of an official statement, whispers about who the officer might be, and the staggering amount of money involved have everyone waiting for more details to surface. The case may even impact the prevailing tensions between the Centre and the state chief minister. Watch this space for updates. Delhi DMs get more powers, ruffle feathers The Delhi government\u2019s recent move to form \u2018working groups\u2019 of District Magistrates (DMs) to assess and improve the functioning of various departments has raised eyebrows, especially among senior babus. These groups are tasked with reviewing departmental operations and submitting actionable recommendations by October 5. They\u2019ve also been empowered to hold meetings with concerned officials\u2014which is the tricky part. Many in the administration are questioning the practicality of junior DMs overseeing and advising more experienced senior officials. Some see this as an unusual situation, with younger IAS officers from recent batches being asked to recommend improvements to departments headed by officials with decades of experience. This bold move comes at a time of transition for Delhi, with newly appointed Chief Minister Atishi stepping into the shoes of Arvind Kejriwal. Known for her focus on education reforms, Atishi now faces the challenge of managing the city\u2019s broader governance issues. This initiative is likely part of her broader strategy to improve inter-departmental synergy and bring fresh perspectives to long-standing administrative processes. A senior official explained that this initiative aligns with Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena\u2019s vision of making DMs more active and dynamic. Take that with a pinch of salt! The order coincides with a renewed push for cohesion between Atishi, AAP ministers, and senior babus, aiming for better coordination across key departments like transport, health, and education. Whether this approach will foster the intended inter-departmental synergy or cause further friction remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly a shake-up in Delhi\u2019s administrative corridors. Why merging DIPAM and DPE makes sense The government is once again considering the merger of two important departments: the Department of Investment & Public Asset Management (DIPAM) and the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). Both play crucial roles in managing Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and if all goes according to plan, they could soon be working together under the Ministry of Finance. The idea behind the merger is to create more synergy and liquidity for the NDA government\u2019s ambitious investment projects, particularly as it prepares for major reforms aimed at boosting growth and employment. This proposal isn\u2019t entirely new. It was first floated during the NaMo 2.0 era but didn\u2019t materialize for various reasons. The project was revived again in the list of \u201c100 days programme\u201d conceived by the Modi sarkar before the May 2024 Lok Sabha polls. So why merge these two departments? DIPAM deals with investment and disinvestment in CPSUs, while DPE focuses on the management and performance of these enterprises. When a CPSU is up for closure or divestment, DIPAM initiates the process, and DPE handles the final closure. A merger could streamline this process and make things more efficient. It seems the government is banking on this move to bring much-needed agility to its public sector investment strategy ahead of 2024. By Dilip Cherian",

        "text": "Los Angeles: Hollywood star Anne Hathaway is set to return to the coming-of-age comedy franchise film Princess Diaries with its third instalment. The development on Princess Diaries 3 is moving at a brisk pace with Adele Lim signing on to direct, reports Variety. \"As a diehard fan of the original Princess Diaries, I'm beyond excited to be a part of bringing the third iteration of this beloved franchise to life,\" Lim said in a statement. \"We look forward to celebrating its core tenants of female power, joy and mentorship with audiences worldwide.\" As per Variety, the film is produced by Debra Martin Chase, who originated the film franchise starring Hathaway as Mia Thermopolis, the down-to-earth teen-turned-queen of the fictional kingdom of Genovia, and Julie Andrews as her regal grandmother. Hathaway will also produce under her Somewhere Pictures banner. Naia Cucukov, Lim's producing partner at 100 Tigers, will executive produce the film alongside Melissa Stack. Princess Diaries 3 has been in development since 2022 and, last year, Hathaway shared an update about the long-awaited movie's progress in an interview with V Magazine. \"We're in a good place,\" Hathaway teased. \"There's nothing to announce yet. But we're in a good place,\" she had said. Flora Greeson is writing the script. Plot details haven't been confirmed, but the threequel is expected to continue the story in 2001's The Princess Diaries and the 2004 sequel Royal Engagement rather than rebooting the series. Lim is best known for penning the mega-hit movie Crazy Rich Asians, which grossed $174 million domestically for Warner Bros.",

It is anticipated that additional lenders, including Punjab & Sind Bank and UCO Bank, may soon follow suit.MTNL\u2019s mounting debtMTNL\u2019s financial situation has been deteriorating, with total debt reported at Rs 31,944.51 crore as of August 30, 2024.

        "text": "Many people wonder whether street vendors earn more than many white-collar professionals. A vlogger has now highlighted the impressive monthly income of a vada pav seller, leaving the internet stunned. Sarthak Sachdeva shared a video on Instagram where he joined a local vendor and worked on his cart. The clip begins with the content creator saying, \u201cAaj mai dekhunga ek din mein vadapav bechke mai kitne paise kama sakta hu. Subah ki shuruyaat dekhke aur seekhke kiya, phir garam garam vada pav banake. Ek ke baad ek customer aane laage. [Today, I will see how much money I can earn by selling vada pav in a day. I started the morning by observing and learning, then made hot vada pavs. Soon, one customer after another began to arrive.]\u201d The content creator was even heard telling a customer, \"Aaj mera pehla din hai thele pe [Today is my first day on the food cart].\" Then, he said, \u201cEk vada pav 15 rupae ka tha. Ek ke baad ek customer thele pe aa rahe the aur pata chal raha tha ki subhe subhe vada pav ki kitni demand hoti hai. Aur 2.5 ghante mein kareeb 200 vadapav bik chuke the. [One vada pav costs Rs 15.

        "title": "Heritage Circles or Hoardings ?",
        "text": "This year\u2019s Dasara illumination is mediocre but the Circles are worse. Mysuru has turned into \u2018flexuru\u2019, thanks to the Government\u2019s decision to hand over key Circles to private players. What used to be iconic landmarks are now little more than giant hoardings. Interestingly, according to sources, most of these companies were not interested to take over the Circles as they did not have enough time to create aesthetic designs but agreed to sponsor so as to not \u2018upset\u2019 the administration. But here\u2019s the burning question: If the Government is intent on selling off our public spaces to the highest bidder, then why did they bother increasing the Dasara budget? And they did this while creatively sidestepping public tenders by invoking the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act. For those not in the know, the KTPP Act allows the Government to bypass open bidding when it claims it \u2018ran out of time.\u2019 How convenient. So, we\u2019re left wondering \u2014 was the whole Dasara preparation process conveniently delayed just to activate this loophole and handpick the \u2018right\u2019 contractors? Here\u2019s where it gets truly puzzling: The Dasara budget ballooned from Rs. 29 crore last year to Rs. 40 crore this year. That\u2019s a whopping Rs. 11 crore more, and yet, somehow, they still felt the need to hand over our beautiful Circles to private companies. Now, instead of historic monuments, we\u2019re greeted by enormous sponsor logos and political banners. The District Administration appears to have forgotten that Mysuru is not just any city; it is a heritage city, where even a traffic Circle has historical significance, whether in its name, its design, or its location, which is meant to reflect the unique character of the city. But now, under a barrage of gaudy lights, sponsor logos and political banners, these once-distinguished Circles are telling a different story \u2014 a story of administrative neglect, lack of imagination, and unbridled greed. It is truly disheartening that the first impression tourists arriving from Bengaluru by road receive is no longer one of beauty or history, but of consumer products and political personalities. This unregulated give-away of public spaces without the establishment of any proper guidelines has led to what can only be described as a visual assault. Seeking sponsorship to improve public spaces isn\u2019t inherently a bad idea. Done right, it can be a win-win situation \u2014 enhancing the city\u2019s beauty while also attracting investment. But the way it\u2019s been executed here is anything but right. To begin with, the administration did not give sponsors enough time to plan and design their campaign. Next, if public spaces like Circles or medians are to be leased to sponsors, there must be clear and enforceable ground rules, which we don\u2019t have. Other countries have stringent design approval committees for such purposes, often comprising experts from renowned advertising agencies or design institutions. Why can\u2019t Mysuru do the same? We could have a \u2018Dasara Public Space Design\u2019 Approval Committee which MUST comprise people from reputed design firms and schools such as the National Institute of Design or Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. Such a Committee would ensure that sponsors adhere to basic aesthetic principles, like limiting the sponsor\u2019s logo to no more than 20 percent of the space and ensuring that the advertisement blends harmoniously with the theme of Dasara and surrounding architecture. Additionally, it could enforce rules that protect the physical structure of these heritage sites, ensuring that nothing is permanently damaged. What we have now, however, is a chaotic free-for-all, where anyone with a banner can turn our historical Circles into personal billboards. For years now, the city\u2019s once-pristine Circles have been turned into medieval town squares, plastered with garish posters announcing everything from elections to festivals to, morbidly, even deaths. But MCC does nothing to stop this vandalism. Way back in 2006, the MCC proposed to declare K.R. Circle, Five-Lights Circle, Ramaswamy Circle etc., as \u2018hoarding-free\u2019 zones and ban commercial hoardings within 100 metres of heritage sites. What happened? Nothing. In 2009, MCC started an \u2018illegal hoarding drive\u2019, what happened? Nothing. In 2011, MCC Commissioner K.S. Raikar made a grand announcement: \u201cWe held discussions with the City Police Commissioner and cases will be filed against those violating the MCC directive on flex boards.\u201d What happened? Nothing. Earlier this year, in 2024 the MCC Commissioner said that they have issued notices and asked the Zonal Commissioners to clear out the flex\u2026 what happened? Nothing. Today, flex posters not only remain all around heritage Circles and buildings, but they have also now become part of the structure and with that part of Dasara too! What a sad reflection of incompetence, of a District Administration, of a Royal Heritage City, one that hosts a world-famous festival! Unless the MCC really flexes its muscles against flex, our city will become \u2018Flex City\u2019 and unless they make rules for sponsors of Circles during Dasara, then Historic Circles will end up as \u2018Billboards.\u2019 At this rate of callousness, myopic vision and greed, Mysore Palace may be the next big Dasara hoarding with sponsors\u2019 logo adorning the Palace domes. We are doomed. e-mail: [email protected]",

PEOPLE reported that things are rocky between Cheryl Hines and Kennedy Jr and they have barely spoken. 'She's embarrassed because he got caught,\" a source told PEOPLE. Hines has been in Europe since shortly after the news broke.Olivia Nuzzi was placed on leave after she acknowledged that her relationship with Kennedy Jr (she didn't name him) turned personal. Kennedy camp vehemently rejected it and asserted that he only met Nuzzi once during the interview last year. But the two camps did not let things be. Kennedy camp claimed Olivia Nuzzi bombarded him with her nudes while Nuzzi camp claimed Kennedy Jr grabbed her arm during the interview in a very creepy way. Nuzzi accused her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza of playing a role in leaking the allegations and Lizza denied those. In a court filing, Nuzzi said Lizza explicitly threatened to make public personal information about her to destroy her life, career and reputation. Amid this controversy, three more women claimed that they have been romantically involved with Kennedy Jr over the past year. According to reports, these three women came in contact with Kennedy Jr through Children's Health Defense -- the advocacy group founded by Kennedy. \u201cThere are a number of women in the \u2018health freedom\u2019 movement who thought of themselves as Bobby\u2019s only one, and I\u2019m quite sure they are angry and shocked to find out they weren\u2019t,\u201d a source told Mediaite. \u201cAfter talking to some of these women, I think what he does is just love bombs them. He makes them feel important, even tells them he loves them, and so they all feel special and wanted.\u201dKennedy's spokesperson did not comment on the fresh allegations. As Kennedy is facing storms one after another, Hines has been in Europe attending several shows during Milan Fashion Week. But there are rumors that Hines is seething in anger and contemplating divorce from Kennedy Jr who is the most prominent aide of Donald Trump -- this election season.",
        "summary": "Cheryl Hines is reportedly embarrassed by several cheating scandals involving her husband, RFK Jr. The controversies include a relationship with reporter Olivia Nuzzi and allegations from three other women associated with Children's Health Defense. Hines, currently in Europe, has shown signs of anger and is contemplating divorce, reports claimed but she has not issued any public statement yet.",

        "title": "The frustrated pursuit of happiness",
        "text": "Pain and disappointment writ large in his face, Sunil, 40, sat down to narrate his story at a lodge on Anna Salai in Chennai. Hailing from Malappuram, he began driving an autorickshaw at his hometown after completing Class X. Since he was struggling to make ends meet, and inspired by tales of people from his district going abroad, he began dreaming of a better life in a foreign country. He was directed to an agent at Palavakkam in Chennai. In the very first meeting, the agent claimed that he had successfully sent many abroad for jobs, and Sunil was quickly convinced. He paid \u20b940,000 to him in processing fees for a job in Israel. However, thereafter, there was no progress at all for months. Sunil met the agent frequently to push his case. Every time, the agent collected more money, and altogether Sunil ended up paying \u20b97 lakh, which he mopped up by mortgaging his house, pledging his wife\u2019s jewellery, and borrowing from relatives. The agent claimed he had tied up with a tour operator in Israel for sending 46 men and women en masse as tourists. Tickets for onward and return journeys and hotel rooms were booked in their names. The plan was that they would travel like tourists and on reaching a famous church in Jerusalem, would disappear amid the crowd. Later, they would stay in the houses of relatives or friends who had already settled down as migrant workers and seek jobs. A plan fraught with danger and rejection, but Sunil went ahead because he was desperate to \u201cgo abroad\u201d. However, the visa was rejected. Neither could he leave Chennai nor was his money repaid. The agent advised him to stay back and wait for another opportunity, promising this time a job in Canada. He demanded a further \u20b98 lakh, and Sunil coughed it up too, borrowing from every one he knew. Forged ID cards On May 1, the agent sent Sunil forged ID cards and documents identifying him as a senior scientist in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) attending a conference of scientists in Canada. This time the visa came through, but as Sunil tried to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the authorities came to know that there was no such conference happening and stopped him. \u201cMy dreams are gone. I had to come back and begged the agent to return the money. Instead of returning the money, he threatened me. I am staying at a cheap lodge for five months now, and I\u2019ve been starving. If I go back home, all the people who lent me money will be at my door. So I am hiding in Chennai. My aged father is down with a terminal illness and my wife is unable to bear this life any more.\u201d Later, investigation revealed that his agent was running an office as a registered bus travel operator. His modus operandi was the same: sending people abroad with forged documents and ID cards as scientists from prestigious research institutions. But Sunil is far from alone in his predicament. The police say there has been a huge increase in the number of overseas job-seekers being cheated by unscrupulous recruitment agents. Once Gulf countries were the most sought-after, but the pattern of migration by unskilled and semi-skilled aspirants indicates that eastern European nations, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, Lithuania and Armenia, are popular. South Korea, Israel, and Canada have also come into the picture. Recently, it came to light that job-seekers from several districts, especially from South India, were recruited through illegal manpower agencies and sent to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar on tourist visas. Victims are then held captive in Cambodia or Laos for work in harsh and restrictive conditions. They are forced to commit online cyber frauds, which is known as \u201ccyber slavery\u201d. These agents do not have a licence from the Ministry of External Affairs, which is mandatory to be involved in any recruitment for work abroad. Typically, they target job-seekers through advertisements posted on social media platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. In 2023, G. Mohan, an engineer from Erode, saw an advertisement on Facebook. Out of curiosity, he clicked the link and entered all details sought. Immediately, he received a call from an agent offering a job in Canada and even permanent residentship. They first collected \u20b950,000 for processing papers, and subsequently, he had to pay \u20b94.5 lakh. Later, they called him, informing there was some delay in getting a visa owing to the India-Canada diplomatic row. \u201cThey asked me to go to any European country and work for some time there. It would be easier to migrate to Canada then. They told me that they would arrange a visa from the Slovakian embassy. Days went by, but there was no progress towards travelling to any country or obtaining a visa. They said they would get a visa for another country and demanded more money. The money I paid has still not been returned,\u201d he recounted. The police later discovered that Akil, 25, of Ernakulam, and S. Veeraragavan, 29, of Tindivanam, also had similar experiences. Irrespective of whom they approached, the police found that some traits were similar. Tutoring the applicants These unregistered agents run their illegal operation from outlets such as browsing centres, tea shops, or petty shops, while some of them have swanky offices, creating the impression of a travel agency. They also tutored applicants on how to approach visa officers in embassies, besides supplying forged documents to them. They even tutored them on how to seek asylum in a foreign country, if they managed to get there. Many of those who were cheated did not file complaints because they were hoping to get their money back. Then how could the police zero in on this racket? Only if the forgery was detected at the processing stage. In September, last year, Mohammed Irfan Khan of Andhra Pradesh appeared with documents before the visa processing staff in the U.S. Consulate in Chennai and claimed that he was a medical professional and wanted a visa to attend a medical expo. All his documents were found to be fake. In November, Rusheekesh Reddy and Dhivakar Reddy of Andhra Pradesh were caught when they produced fake documents for visa processing for Kallem Sai Ram Reddy. Following this trail, the police found out that all fake certificates were generated at a centre at Villivakkam in Chennai, run by Mohammed Riyas and Mageshwaran since 2019. Thirumurthy, 30, of Thanjavur, was one of the victims rescued by Indian authorities recently. He recounted, \u201cWe paid \u20b94.5 lakh to the middleman who arranged this job for a salary of $2,000 a month. Eight of us were taken to Sihanoukville, Cambodia, by road from Bangkok. Our passports were collected by them. Only after landing at the workplace did we realise that it was a scam. We were detained in wire-fenced buildings. When we refused to do their bidding, they would beat us up and even give electric shocks.\u201d He adds, \u201cOur phone and WhatsApp conversations were scrutinised by them constantly. At last, we managed to send a mail to family members. With the help of a native lawyer, we sought the assistance of the Indian High Commission, and were rescued.\u201d R. Viswanathan, vice-president of the Tamil Association in Cambodia, said that based on a series of complaints from the affected persons, the Indian authorities, with the help of local officials, rescued the workers, and were trying to put an end to the illegal recruitment and confinement camps. Recently, the CB-CID registered nine cases and arrested 10 illegal recruitment agents. Similarly, the Greater Chennai Police, along with the Emigration Department, raided 10 locations, registered nine cases, and arrested five persons who operated without licence. The Emigration Department has also identified certain districts as hotspots where people try to go abroad through illegal means. These include Tiruchi, Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Sivaganga, Madurai, Tiruvannamalai, Perambalur, and Thiruvarur. \u2018File complaints\u2019 Greater Chennai Police Commissioner A. Arun has advised people to be wary of fake advertisements of foreign employment. Anyone who has been cheated by unauthorised companies should file a complaint, he has said. Surender, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Job Racket Wing, says no individual or agency can recruit Indian citizens for overseas employment without a valid licence. \u201cHowever, job aspirants get connected to the agents under the radar. We are working on 60 cases of job rackets.\u201d The Emigration Department advises those seeking jobs overseas to engage only with licensed agents. Licensed agents are required to maintain a bank guarantee with the government, and their operations are monitored and regulated by the offices of Protector of Emigrants (PoE). These agents undergo stringent inspections and document verification before they are licensed. A valid job offer comes along with an employment contract duly signed by the foreign employer, recruitment agent, and the worker. The contract must mention the terms and conditions of the job and the salary and other emoluments. Valid offers must allow the worker to emigrate on the strength of employment or work visa or other similar visas, not on a tourist visa. As per the Emigration Act, 1983, no recruiting agent shall collect from the prospective emigrant service charges of more than \u20b930,000 plus GST (18%) for services, excluding airfare and other charges. A receipt has to be issued. M. Rajkumar, Protector of Emigrants, Chennai, says, \u201cWe have 200-odd licensed agents registered with us. People can see the list of licensed agents on www.emigrate.gov.in and check whether their agents are licensed or not. We have also opened a column called job opportunities as of now for ECR (Emigration Clearance Required) countries. Wherever the licensed agents conduct the interviews, it will be posted here.\u201d He adds that aspirants would be safe when they go through licensed agents. \u201cWhen ECR passport-holders go to ECR countries, we verify everything for them and give them emigration clearance.\u201d Job-seekers can dial the PoE helpline 9042149222 for more information.",

        "text": "As Prince Harry is on a solo trip and rumors of Harry-Meghan divorce are rife, it has now come to be reported that Harry did not spend the night of his 40th birthday with Meghan though he was in the US at that time. While many reports call it the \"latest blow to their marriage\", their friends claim that it was actually a gift from Meghan and the couple are not separating -- they are professionally choosing different paths. Meghan was last seen before Harry's birthday. The Duchess of Sussex reportedly booked the trip for Harry so that he could spend the night of his 40th birthday doing a hike on the Montecito peak -- which is part of the Cold Spring Trail in California. It is near Harry-Meghan's mansion.Soon after Harry's birthday, he started his solo tour which has now been extended by a few days and Harry has scheduled some secret meetings. Reports claimed Harry and Meghan have been staying apart and Harry was found moping around by himself at a local cafe. It was when reports of his longing to be back to the Royal Family emerged. It was reported that Harry was feeling homesick as Meghan was busy with her Hollywood and entrepreneurial projects. Sources close to the couple who emphasize that they are not splitting claimed that the phase of Harry moping is over and now he has immersed himself in work according to his liking. Meghan was supposed to accompany him on his tour to New York but she was unwell. From New York, Harry flew to the UK and it was obvious that Meghan would not accompany him there. From UK, Harry went to Africa for a charity event but now Harry has extended his solo trip. Harry was initially scheduled to be back in California this weekend, UK Express reported. But he has chosen to prolong his solo trip. The Duke will likely head to Johannesburg and Cape Town for \"private time\" with family and friends. Another secret visit is also planned but it has been kept out of his official diary, the report said.",

        "title": "Hamas confirms Yahya Sinwar\u2019s death",
        "text": "Jerusalem: Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar , was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza, and the militant group reiterated its stance that hostages taken from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. \u201cThose prisoners will not return to you before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza,\u201d said Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar's Qatar-based deputy and headed up the grou's delegation during several rounds of cease-fire negotiations mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. In a statement, Hamas heralded Sinwar as a hero who \u201cascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.\u201d The statement appeared to refer to a video the Israeli military circulated of Sinwar\u2019s apparent last moments in which a man sits on a chair in severely damaged building, badly wounded and covered in dust. In the video, the man raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli drone. Sinwar\u2019s killing, in what appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, could shift the dynamics of the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas war began. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran , which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be him, half-buried in rubble and with a gaping wound in his head. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that \u201cour war is not yet ended.\u201d But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar\u2019s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar\u2019s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. \u201cWe are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,\u201d Ronen Neutra, father of the Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra, said in a video statement. \u201cSinwar, who was described as a major obstacle to a deal, is no longer alive.\" Netanyahu was planning to convene a special meeting Friday to discuss hostage negotiations, an Israeli official with knowledge of the negotiations said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the their former enemy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. \u201cWhen U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield \u2014 in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy \u2014 the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.\u201d More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza erupted in October last year, issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. Hezbollah's statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel\u2019s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it would activate an additional reserve brigade to the north of its country to support troops battling in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to \u201cplans prepared in advance\u201d to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced...",

Why? \u201cBecause, I told him, everything you just said is about you. You want the world to know that you did a good job, that you were smart. But, strange as it may seem, a memoir isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s not even the story of your life. It\u2019s a story carved from your life, a particular series of events chosen because they have the greatest resonance for the widest range of people\u2026\u201d\n\nThe art of memoir, encapsulated in six words: A story, carved from a life.\n\nThat is the problem with autobiographies of Indian sportspersons \u2013 they tend, more often than not, to be a highlights reel of their careers as they lived it \u2013 or, often, as they want you to think they lived it. What you get is a one-dimensional portrait \u2013 scorecards and career graphs rendered in prose and wallpapered with a litany of clich\u00e9s; what you don\u2019t get is insight into the living, breathing human being behind those accomplishments; the stories carved from their lives.\n\nThere are exceptions. A Shot At History by Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, co-authored by Rohit Brijnath, is one; the more recent I Have The Streets by India\u2019s ace off-spinner R Ashwin, written with Sidharth Monga, is another. To that sparse canon add Witness, the autobiography of champion wrestler Sakshi Malik co-written with veteran sports journalist Jonathan Selvaraj.\n\nWhen the book hits the shelves, the large-type headlines and the buzz in the social media echo chamber will be about Malik\u2019s first up-close experience of sexual harassment and her ongoing battle to bring BJP politician and former Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to book for the serial sexual abuses he is accused of. And that will be a pity, because there is so much more to Malik\u2019s story as both a champion wrestler and an insurgent fighting injustice.\n\nThe battle against Brij Bhushan and his backers in politics \u2013 and, by extension, against the strong arm of the police force \u2013 bookends the story of Malik as an insecure girl from a small village in Haryana; her early, occasionally risible forays into various sports; her discovery of wrestling as the career she always wanted and never knew it till her wandering footsteps led her to the mat.\n\nThe book is hung on the tick-tock timeline of her life and times, both in the ring and out of it, and it is a story of stark contrasts. There is the self-assured sportsperson juxtaposed with the awkward, unsure woman in the throes of a first, and lasting, love. She is the ace wrestler, proud of the painfully acquired strength of thighs and biceps, but also the woman who hates how those same biceps look when she is forced to wear high fashion. She is the gawky village girl who leans heavily on parental support and encouragement in a rigidly patriarchal environment that frowns on women \u201cdisplaying\u201d themselves in skimpy sports costumes but equally, the mature woman battling the realisation that the love of even the most supportive of parents can be subsumed by the lure of the money their accomplished daughter brings in\u2026\n\nSakshi Malik, the person\n\nMalik\u2019s story is layered; it lends what we know of her life a larger frame and a deeper context. Through the pages of Witness, a Sakshi Malik emerges who is no longer just a champion wrestler, or a leader in an ongoing battle against a political strongman and accused sexual abuser \u2013 she is a human being in the true sense of the word, with all the fears and uncertainties, the faults and the foibles that being human entails.\n\nAnd it is all down to a clear-eyed awareness of her own self, abetted by honesty as unsparing of herself as it is of everyone in her orbit. Thus, if she is open about her parents\u2019 unconditional love turning into unbridled greed as the money begins to pour in, or about the politicking of farmer leader Naresh Tikait who insinuated himself into the wrestlers\u2019 protests for his own ends, or about her disenchantment with what she sees as the self-interest of her comrades-in-arms Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, she is equally forthright about her own early forays into petty theft and, more startlingly, about her deepest insecurities.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Moehringer said in an interview where he discussed the art of the memoir, \u201cin order to tell the truth, you simply cannot avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings. It goes down easier if you are equally unsparing of yourself.\u201d\n\nParts of Witness will hurt. Parents, siblings, former opponents, and present comrades will all find reflections of themselves that they would far rather have hidden from the world \u2013 but there is no part of the book that cuts as deep, and is as unsparing, as the image Malik sees in her own mirror.\n\nIn an early chapter, she talks of the paralysing dread that envelops her before every bout, and about how she has \u201cnever enjoyed the actual act of confrontation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany wrestlers have a little bit of nervousness before their bout starts, which helps them get focused for the contest,\u201d Malik writes. \u201cI have come across contestants who tell me they are excited before a bout. They enjoy that feeling of getting into a fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that. I\u2019ve always been afraid, sometimes almost sick with worry.\u201d\n\nWho knew? As one accustomed to reading, and listening to, sportspersons natter on about \u201cembracing the challenge\u201d, \u201csoaking up the pressure\u201d and suchlike inanities, it came as a refreshing change to read an elite sportsperson \u2013 a practitioner of one of the most physically confrontational of all sports \u2013 talk with such openness about the crippling grip of fear that she had to confront, even before she confronted her opponent on the mat, right through her career.\n\nIf being honest \u2013 with oneself first, and then with the reader \u2013 is hard for sportspersons, it is equally difficult for them to talk in an accessible fashion about the nuances of their sport. And there is a reason for this: in her formative years, the sportsperson practices the mechanics of her sport for countless hours until it becomes part of muscle memory. In the heat of competition, she instinctively does what all that practice has prepared her for. Asking her to relieve a bout, to explain the mechanics of a takedown, is akin to asking a pilot how she flies a plane, or a writer how she organises her material and engages her reader.\n\nHere, again, Malik scores \u2013 a favourite section, one that I went back to after a first read-through of the entire book, is chapter ten where Malik delves into the arcana of \u201cweight cutting\u201d, a phrase that entered the public consciousness thanks to the fiasco of Vinesh Phogat failing, by 100 grams \u2013 one third the weight of an adult human heart \u2013 to qualify for the final of the 50kg wrestling competition in the Paris Olympics.\n\nElsewhere, there are illuminating details about the mechanics of various forms of takedowns, insights into how a wrestler reads and counters an opponent\u2019s strategy \u2013 a wealth of detail, told in accessible form, that made me go back to YouTube videos of her various bouts, including the Rio Olympics bronze medal match in the 58-kg category that made her India\u2019s first woman Olympic medallist in wrestling, with a new awareness and appreciation of the sport.\n\nWe consume sport in boxes \u2013 the playing field, the wrestling ring, the boundaries of our television screens. And yet the real story, unseen by us, lies outside these boundaries, in what ace sportswriter Gary Smith calls \u201cthe psyche of the sporting spirit.\u201d\n\nWriting an energising memoir\n\nThe likes of Andre Agassi, Phil Knight and Prince Harry needed a Moehringer to go outside those boxes, to delve into and unearth the stories hidden behind those medals, the fame, the public persona. Malik finds the ideal amanuensis in Jonathan Selvaraj, a veteran sportswriter who has spent decades covering those sports, including wrestling, that play out in the nearly impenetrable shadow cast by cricket.\n\nOn the evidence of this book, Selvaraj has mastered sprezzatura, the ability to conceal art. Selvaraj brings to the book the art and the craft of a skilled storyteller \u2013 a mastery of narrative arc and of pacing, the ability to focus on what is important, the minute attention to the telling detail. Rather than chisel and sand and buff and polish the story to death, Selvaraj helps Malik embrace the volatility, the insecurities, integral to the human condition.\n\nWhere Selvaraj really excels though is in his ability to step back and let Malik\u2019s natural voice, with which we have become familiar through the many press conferences and interviews she has given in the course of her battle against Brij Bhushan, shine through. It is Selvaraj who writes, but it is Malik we hear.\n\nMalik\u2019s lived experiences and refreshing honesty combine seamlessly with Selvaraj\u2019s self-effacing pen to produce a sports biography that is energising, and compellingly readable.\n\nWitness, Sakshi Malik with Jonathan Selvaraj, Juggernaut.",

The two cases, though separate, have brought attention to growing criminal activities in the region, prompting swift action from local law enforcement.\n\nThe first case involves a 52-year-old mushroom trader from Tanda Rajpur, Palampur. He lodged a complaint against four individuals\u2014two women and two men\u2014accusing them of extortion and blackmail. According to the victim, the incident began when he received a call from a woman in Ram Chowk, Palampur, asking to purchase mushrooms. Upon arriving at her house, he found two women inside. They gave him water, locked the door, and then engaged in obscene acts. Shortly after, two men entered the room, assaulted him, and forcibly filmed an obscene video.\n\nThe victim claimed the group demanded \u20b91.5 lakh, threatening to release the video if he didn\u2019t pay. Terrified, he approached the Palampur police station, where a formal case was registered. Station in-charge Bhupendra Singh Thakur confirmed that an investigation is underway, with the accused currently being tracked by the police.\n\nMeanwhile, in Manali, local police exposed a gang involved in prostitution-related fraud after receiving a complaint from Pradeep Bagati, a resident of Jharkhand. Bagati reported that he was tricked by a woman at the Manali bus stand, who promised him a room at a cheap rate. When he followed her to Aleu, she demanded \u20b92000 for engaging in sexual activity. As soon as he undressed, she took photographs and summoned her accomplices. A second woman and two men then entered, robbing him of \u20b95000 in cash, taking his ATM card, and withdrawing \u20b910,000.\n\nThe gang threatened Bagati, demanding an additional \u20b950,000 to ensure his release. Bagati managed to escape and alerted the Manali police. Acting swiftly, the police arrested the suspects and recovered 12 mobile phones, ATM cards, and cash. The arrested individuals were identified as Vishal from Shimla, Deepak from Chandigarh, and two women from Kullu and Manimajra.\n\nManali police station in-charge Manish Sharma stated that this gang had been operating for over two years, targeting unsuspecting individuals. The gang\u2019s network is now under further investigation, with more arrests likely.\n\nThese two cases underline the growing concern over extortion and organized fraud in Himachal Pradesh, as police intensify efforts to combat such criminal activities.",

Despite Dhoni having retired from international cricket, the bond between the two remains as strong as ever.Wearing a T-shirt inspired by the Indian tricolour and proudly displaying Dhoni's iconic jersey number 7, Babu shared how the Indian icon personally ensures that he receives match passes. \u201cI take Dhoni\u2019s name to the stadium, and the passes I\u2019ve been receiving so far are all arranged by Dhoni sir,\u201d Babu disclosed in the viral clip.

Meanwhile, Dhoni is keeping fans and pundits guessing about his future with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction. With five IPL titles under his belt, Dhoni\u2019s IPL future will play a crucial role in shaping the franchise\u2019s strategy for the next season.Interestingly, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) recently introduced a new rule allowing players who have not represented India for over five years to be classified as 'uncapped'. This enables CSK to retain Dhoni for a base price of \u20b94 crore, giving hope to fans who wish to see him play for the franchise once more after relinquishing captaincy last season and passing the baton to Ruturaj Gaikwad.Whether Dhoni plays the IPL or not, one thing remains clear \u2014- his legacy extends far beyond the cricket field.",

        "text": "Air pollution is back to haunt the national capital with the onset of winter and early morning and late-night fog. \nOn Saturday, Delhi\u2019s Anand Vihar reported PM 2.5 of 326 and PM 10 levels of 654, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to activate Stage 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan from October 15. GRAP includes measures to control dust, waste management, and ensure vehicular restrictions, with mist-spraying drones to monitor and tackle pollution hotspots.\nThe Delhi government on Monday also imposed a blanket ban on the sale and use of firecrackers till January 1, 2025, in view of the likely deterioration of air quality in the city during the winter.\nTo further understand the effects of the deteriorating air quality, LocalCircles conducted a survey which revealed that 36 per cent Delhi-NCR families have one or more members with sore throat, cough and breathing difficulty/asthma due to rising levels of pollution, while 27 per cent have someone with a runny nose/congestion.\nThe survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. A total of 61 per cent respondents were men while 39 per cent were women.\nThe survey also sought to know the steps Delhiites were taking or planning to take to combat the issue of air pollution. While only 18 per cent citizens of Delhi-NCR said they will use air purifiers to reduce the impact of pollution, a large majority said they would just live with it by increasing the intake of immunity foods and drinks. A total of 22 per cent respondents are planning to travel for some part of the next one month. It is also likely that many have planned travels for Diwali which also allows them to get away from peak pollution days in Delhi-NCR when AQI has touched 1000 in the past.\nYear after year for the last decade, AQI levels in the region have been touching 500-1000 between October 15 and December 1, causing devastating long-term impact on the health of residents and no concrete solutions have been implemented to address this at a structural, policy and enforcement level.\nEmissions from transportation account for approximately 19.2 per cent of Delhi\u2019s air pollution, according to the Centre\u2019s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management in Delhi.\nAnother major contributor to the worsening air quality is stubble burning in neighbouring states. Satellite data on Wednesday reported 99 fire incidents in Punjab, 14 in Haryana, 59 in Uttar Pradesh, and one in Delhi.\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered \u201cgood\u201d, 51 and 100 \u201csatisfactory\u201d, 101 and 200 \u201cmoderate\u201d, 201 and 300 \u201cpoor\u201d, 301 and 400 \u201cvery poor\u201d, and 401 and 500 \u201csevere\u201d.",

Eight were found alive on Wednesday after being reported missing after an avalanche on Sunday, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nAn avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, such as a hill or mountain. Avalanches can be triggered spontaneously, by factors such as increased precipitation or snowpack weakening, or by external means such as humans, other animals, and earthquakes.\n\nPrimarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches have the capability to capture and move ice, rocks, and trees.\n\nAvalanches occur in two general forms, or combinations of slab avalanches made of tightly packed snow, triggered by a collapse of an underlying weak snow layer, and loose snow avalanches made of looser snow.\n\nAfter being set off, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they capture more snow. If an avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air, forming a powder snow avalanche.\n\nThough they appear to share similarities, avalanches are distinct from slush flows, mudslides, rock slides, and serac collapses. They are also different from large-scale movements of ice.\n\nAvalanches can happen in any mountain range that has an enduring snowpack. They are most frequent in winter or spring but may occur at any time of the year. In mountainous areas, avalanches are among the most serious natural hazards to life and property, so great efforts are made in avalanche control.",

Four years down the line, their Montecito neighbors are not very happy about the royals settling at their place.

The residents are expressing frustration that the coastline is now becoming exclusive to wealthy property owners. UK Express reported that restricting access to public beaches was illegal in Portugal until recently but new regulations now allow local councils and government agencies to designate certain beaches as \"private\". \"Worst thing to happen to the Portuguese coast, typical greed situation. Taking land and property from locals who have been enjoying it for years,\" one wrote. \"I am very upset by this massive piece of Portuguese land destroyed for the rich, removed from the average local that had been creating memories in this place for generations and generations,\" another said. \"I have been going to this place for years, camped there several times and, because of this company, this is no longer possible,\" another said. Reports said Harry and Meghan chose Portugal to be close to Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank who own a home at the Costa Terra Gold and Ocean Club in Melides. Harry and Meghan will not be shifting out of the US and their Portuguese resort will be more like a holiday home for them. Reports said the resort is on a picturesque and unexplored beach in the Algarve and has become a popular holiday destination. Once completed, the resort is set to have 300 homes, with prices starting at a whopping \u00a33.6million.The news has put speculations over Harry-Meghan divorce to sleep following their individual engagements.

The British monarch arrived in Sydney late on Friday evening for their 9-day Australia tour.Later, Charles will address the New South Wales state parliament and visit the Admiralty House for a series of private meetings with top officials.Royal watchers will have another opportunity to see the king on Monday when he arrives in Canberra with Queen Camilla for the busiest portion of his streamlined schedule.In the past, visiting British royals would undertake extended tours, drawing large crowds of excited, flag-waving supporters. However, due to the king's fragile health, much of the usual pomp and grandeur has been scaled back this time.Aside from a community barbecue in Sydney and an event at the city's iconic opera house, large public gatherings will be limited.On Sunday, a small group of protesters gathered near a church, calling for Australia to \"decolonise.\"While Australians are slightly in favour of maintaining the monarchy, the enthusiasm is far from what it was in 2011 when thousands turned out to see Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, wave to the crowds.",

        "text": "After a disaster like \u2018Jigra\u2019 featuring Alia Bhatt, some Telugu distributors are wary about distributing another Bollywood actress film in the two Telugu states. \u201cWomen centric movies are not fetching even bare minimums openings and it would be difficult for Kangana to release her film \u2018Emergency\u2019 without much fuss,\u201d says a distributor. \u201cProbably, she has to tour Hyderabad and promote her political thriller by hosting big events, only then it could create some buzz in trade circles,\" he adds. Earlier, Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut's much-anticipated film \u2018Emergency\u2019 has cleared a significant hurdle as it recently received certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The film, which portrays the controversial political period of the 1975 Emergency in India, has been under scrutiny for its depiction of historical events and figures, particularly former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who is portrayed by Ranaut. Of course, Bollywood teams are reportedly in discussions with Telugu distributors but no agreements have been finalized for the film to hit theaters. \u201cKangana's recent films \"Chandramukhi 2\" and \"Dhakkad,\" had underperformed in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In all likelihood \"Emergency\" would be released on a commission basis. In which, the film would release in theatres. Then all the collections are garnered and given back to makers, after deducting theatre rentals and 8 to 10% commission,\u201d he informs. He believes the film would attract more viewers in Telangana, particularly in the Nizam region, compared to Andhra Pradesh, where Hindi films generally receive less patronage.",

He claims that Satya would be roped in by other producers since few distributors are insisting for his comedy and few ongoing films could have his comedy track to cash in on his popularity. \"He will be doing comedy in another big star movie and discussions are underway, \" he adds. He also claims that probably by now, few producers would have reached him to cast him as a \u2018hero\u2019 in the films since the laugh-riot has set cash registers ringing in two Telugu states. \u201cHe may soon turn a protagonist and is surely grabbing plum comic roles too,\u201d he concludes.",

She revealed how each member in the family dealt with it in their own way and never showed their emotions to each other. Reminiscing about that dark phase in their lives Riddhima said, \"When my dad passed away we never showed emotions to each other.

Ranbir also hyped his sister up and forewarned the other members of the cast to not take her lightly. \"Riddhima, beyond the politeness and you know, the softness, she's a fighter.

Because I would tell them don't take Riddhima lightly,\" he said.He also showered love and praises on her, and showed her his unwavering. \"I don't tell her this often, but Riddhima, I love you deeply. You are somebody I look up to. Even when you were not doing a show like this, I was always rooting for you. And I'm gonna root more for you,\" he concluded.&nbsp",

The streets buzzed with excitement as women prepared for this special day dedicated to the well-being and long life of their husbands. Various organisations and local communities came together to organise programmes and gatherings for the cultural celebrations. Women dressed in vibrant, traditional attire were the centre of attraction of the festival. Their hands were adorned with intricate mehndi designs, symbolising love and devotion.\n\nFrom dawn, the women observed a day-long fast, refraining from food and water. This fast is a key ritual of Karva Chauth and is kept until the moon appears in the night sky. The day began with Sargi, a pre-dawn meal given by mothers-in-law to their daughters-in-law, symbolising the bond between them. As the day progressed, groups of women gathered in homes or community centres, sharing stories and songs related to the significance of the festival. They passed the Karva (a clay pot) around in a circle, singing traditional songs of marital bliss.\n\nKarwa Chauth Moon Rise Timings In MP: Moon Will Be First Seen In Bhopal Followed By Indore; Check...\n\nIn the evening, as twilight fell, the anticipation grew. Women sat in beautifully decorated spaces, their thalis prepared with diya, rice and sweets, waiting for the moon to rise. Once the moon appeared, they gathered on rooftops or terraces, gazing at it through a sieve, symbolising the filtering of negativity. They then offered water to the moon, seeking its blessings before breaking their fast by sipping water and eating a sweet from their husband's hands. Throughout the city, the sounds of laughter, music and blessings filled the air, as families gathered to celebrate the bond of love and the strength of relationships, making the night of Karva Chauth a truly magical and heart-warming experience.\n\nOne unique programme took place in the Pashupatinath Porwal Social Group. They celebrated the Karva Chauth festival at The Meera Garden, Rajiv Gandhi Square, Indore. Over 250 people participated in the event and passed a message to observe No Car Day once a week. The males of the group were seen holding placards and they also took a pledge to keep the environment safe.\n\nMaharashtra: NCP-Ajit Pawar Faction Appoints Ashish Damle As Chairman Of New Brahmin Economic Development Body\n\nMumbai: Doctor Dupes Colleague Of \u20b934.97 Lakh In Medical Camp Scam\n\nMumbai: Peon Arrested For Sexually Assaulting Minor At School Premises\n\nMaharashtra: ACB Files 26 Disproportionate Assets Cases Involving \u20b929 Crore\n\nFollow us on",

Snakes have flexible jaws, which are not rigidly attached like in many other animals. This flexibility allows them to stretch their jaws wide open to accommodate prey much larger than their head. In the case of an egg, the snake carefully manoeuvres it into its mouth and gradually swallows it whole. Once inside, special muscles in the snake's bodywork to break the egg's shell, after which the contents are digested, and the shell is later regurgitated. This incredible ability showcases the snake's evolutionary adaptations for survival.''\n\nAnother said, ''That's a remarkable sight! Snakes have the ability to stretch their jaws to consume prey much larger than their heads, thanks to their unique jaw structure. It's a fascinating example of nature's adaptability.''\n\nA third said, ''Incredible sight! Nature is fascinating.'' A fourth added, ''Omg this is really shocking.'' A fourth added, ''Creatures are so different that every single creature has its own uniqueness.''\n\n''That sounds wild! Snakes are fascinating when they eat something that seems too big for them.

Bhavana Pandey shared a particularly hilarious incident that happened during a Karwa Chauth function at Anil Kapoor's house, which left everyone in splits. Recalling the event, she said, \"We go to Sunita Kapoor's house, Anil Kapoor's wife. So all of us go there and break the fast together. We have to go to the terrace to see the moon. So all of us go together. So we got the channi (strainer) and placed the diyas there. I told Chunky to hold his position because we were waiting to eat.\" Bhavana then complained how Chunky Pandey's old habits landed her in an awkward situation. \"Chunky has this old habit. I prepared everything and the moment I turned around he was gone. I don't know whether he got a call or something else happened, and the channi landed straight on the face of Boney Kapoor! I instantly turned around and yelled, 'Chunky, where are you?' He came back and took his position. Then I did the ritual properly,\" she concluded. This made everyone burst into laughter, leading Kapil to a witty comeback. He joked that Boney Kapoor must have been wondering why Sridevi (his late wife) looked so different that day.

        "title": "Color Blind Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Color Blind Color blindness is the inability to see the difference between certain colors. Although many people commonly use the term \u201ccolor blindness\u201d for this condition, color blindness in the sense that everything is seen in shades of black and white is very rare. So most people who are color blind see a different color than they should see. Color blindness is usually an inherited condition, and men are more likely to be born with the condition. Most people with color blindness cannot distinguish between certain shades of red and green. Less commonly, a person with this vision disorder cannot distinguish between blue and yellow. In addition, certain eye diseases and some medications can also cause color blindness. Symptoms of Color Blindness A person may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. Some people find out that they or their child has color blindness symptoms when it causes confusion. Such as when there is a problem distinguishing colors in traffic lights or interpreting color-coded learning materials. The most common color blindness is the inability to see some shades of red and green. Often, a person who is less able to see red-green or blue-yellow is not fully sensitive to either color. This condition can be mild, moderate, or severe. Can Color Blind People See Any Colors? The following is an explanation of what colors color blind people can see, based on the type of color blindness: 1. Red-Green Color Blindness This is a condition where the photopigments in the red cones or green cones of your eyes do not function properly. There are several types: Deuteranomaly: This is the most common form of color blindness and affects 5 percent of men, but is rare in women. It occurs when the green cone photopigment does not function properly. Yellow and green appear redder, and it is difficult to distinguish blue from violet. Protanomaly: Occurs when the red cone photopigments do not function properly. Orange, red, and yellow appear greener, and the colors are less vibrant. It is usually mild and does not cause problems in daily life. It is rare in women and affects about 1 percent of men. Protanopia: A person does not have functioning red cone cells. Reds appear only dark gray. Some shades of orange, yellow, and green appear yellow. This is rare in women and affects only about 1 percent of men. Deuteranopia: A person does not have functioning green cone cells. Red looks yellow-brown, and green looks beige. This affects 1 percent of men and is rare in women. 2. Blue-Yellow Color Blindness This is when the blue cone photopigment is missing or not functioning properly. This is the second most common type affecting men and women equally. Tritanomaly: Blue cone cells work only in a limited way. Blue looks greener, and pink is difficult to distinguish from yellow and red. This condition is very rare. Tritanopia: also known as blue-yellow color blindness, is a condition where someone does not have blue cone cells. Blue looks green, and yellow looks light gray or purple. This condition is also very rare. 3. Complete Color Blindness Also has another name monochromacy, which is when someone does not see color at all and vision is not very clear. There are two types, namely: Cone monochromacy: This condition occurs when 2 of the 3 cone photopigments, such as red, green, or blue, are not functioning. When only one type of cone is functioning, it is difficult to distinguish one color from another. Rod monochromacy: also known as achromatopsia, is the most severe form of color blindness. None of the cone cells have functioning photopigments. As a result, the world appears in black, white, and gray. Meanwhile, color blindness in children is often detected late. Because children tend not to know and are not aware that what they see may not be perfect. Risk Factors There are many things that increase the risk of experiencing this vision disorder, including: Inherited from parents. Having certain diseases. Taking certain medications. Exposure to chemicals. Done. Causes of Color Blindness Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that occurs with the eye\u2019s ability to respond to different wavelengths of light. Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters the eye through the cornea and passes through the transparent lens. The jelly-like tissue in the eye (vitreous humor) to the wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of the eye in the macular area of \u200b\u200bthe retina. Cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), or long (red) wavelengths of light. Chemicals in the cone cells trigger reactions and send wavelength information through the optic nerve to the brain. If your eyes are not abnormal, you will perceive color. But if your cone cells lack one or more wavelength-sensitive chemicals, you won\u2019t be able to distinguish between red, green, or blue. Causes of color blindness include: 1. Genetic disorders Inherited color deficiencies are much more common in males than females. The most common color deficiency is red-green, with blue-yellow deficiency being much less common. It is rare to have no color vision at all. You can inherit a mild, moderate or severe degree of the disorder. Inherited color deficiencies usually affect both eyes, and the severity does not change throughout life. 2. Certain diseases Several conditions can cause color deficits in the eyes. Starting from sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic alcoholism, and leukemia. One eye will be more affected than the other, and the color deficit will improve if the underlying disease can be treated. 3. Certain eye diseases This condition can also occur due to eye disease that causes damage to the part of the eye that helps see color. Examples of eye diseases include glaucoma or macular degeneration. 4. Consumption of certain medications Some medications can alter color vision, such as some drugs that treat certain autoimmune diseases, heart problems, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, infections, nervous disorders, and psychological problems. 5. Aging factors Your ability to see colors slowly declines as you age. 6. Chemicals Exposure to certain workplace chemicals, such as carbon disulfide and fertilizers, can cause color vision loss. Color Blindness Diagnosis If you have trouble seeing certain colors, your eye doctor can perform a test to see if you have a color deficiency. You will have a complete eye exam. Then, the doctor will perform supporting tests to support the examination. Here are some types of color blindness tests that doctors can perform: 1. Ishihara test This examination is the option that doctors most often recommend. In the procedure, the doctor will ask the patient to recognize numbers or letters that are shown faintly on the image in the form of colored dots. 2. Color Arrangement Test This examination aims to provide a detailed analysis of this condition and/or a person\u2019s ability to recognize colors accurately. This color blindness test consists of a number of colored discs or plates that a person must arrange in the correct color order. 3. Cambridge Color Test This test involves using a computer screen. When a person undergoes it, the doctor will ask them to identify the letter \u201cC\u201d on the screen that is a different color than the surrounding colors. Color Blindness Treatment There is no cure for color blindness. Except for color vision problems related to the use of certain medications or eye conditions. Stopping the medication that is causing the vision problem or treating the underlying eye disease may result in improved color vision. Wearing colored filters over glasses or colored contact lenses can enhance the perception of contrast between confusing colors. However, such lenses will not improve the ability to see all colors. Several rare retinal disorders associated with color deficiencies can be modified with gene replacement techniques. This treatment is being studied and may be available in the future. In addition, you can also try the following tips to help overcome this condition: Memorize the order of colored objects. If it is important to know individual colors, such as traffic lights, memorize the order of the colors. Label colored items that you want to match with other items. Ask someone with good color vision to help you sort and label clothes. Use technology. Such as apps for mobile phones and digital devices that can help identify colors. Color Blindness Prevention The causes of color blindness are divided into factors that sufferers cannot control (genetic) and factors that sufferers can control. Here are steps you can take to reduce the risk of color blindness: 1. Prevention for genetic factors If the cause of color blindness is a genetic factor, then there is no preventative measure that a person can take. Therefore, it is important for couples who want to get married to discuss genetic testing with their doctor before planning a pregnancy. 2. Prevention for controllable causes For causes of color blindness that you can control, there are several efforts to reduce the risk: Routinely undergo a comprehensive health check. Have an eye exam every year. Implement a healthy lifestyle. If working in a sector that is prone to exposure to hazardous chemicals, be sure to wear proper eye protection. Exercise regularly. Consume healthy, balanced nutritious food. Especially food that is healthy for the eyes. Complications of Color Blindness In general, this condition can cause the child\u2019s learning process to be less than optimal. In addition, there will be many adjustments that sufferers will have to make. However, the most severe level of this condition is total color blindness. In this condition, sufferers can only see colors such as gray, white, and black. In addition, people with total color blindness are also at risk of experiencing other vision disorders, such as: Nystagmus or a condition where the eyeballs make rapid and repeated movements without intention. Photophobia or sensitivity to bright light. Decreased visual acuity. Amblyopia or lazy eye syndrome. Farsightedness or hypermetropia. When to See a Doctor? If you suspect you or someone you love has trouble distinguishing certain colors or changes in color vision, see an eye doctor for testing. Remember, it is important for children to get a comprehensive eye exam. Including color vision testing, before starting school. Also, there is no cure for genetic color deficiencies. But if eye disease or illness is the cause, then treatment can improve color vision.",

        "title": "Lazy Eye(Amblyopia) Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Lazy Eye(Amblyopia) The medical term for lazy eye is amblyopia. This condition occurs when the brain only connects to one eye, causing poor vision in the other eye. This causes the brain to ignore signals from the weak or lazy eye. This disease can lead to impaired vision and loss of depth perception. The eye affected by lazy eye does not always look different, although it may \u201cwander\u201d in different directions. The condition usually affects only one eye. However, in some cases, vision in both eyes can be affected. This condition usually occurs in children and is the main cause of decreased vision in children. However, it is important to understand that this condition is not the same as crossed or turned eyes or what is called strabismus. It\u2019s just that strabismus can cause amblyopia if crossed eyes are not used enough. If left untreated, temporary or permanent vision loss can occur. This includes loss of depth perception and three-dimensional vision. Lazy Eye Symptoms (Amblyopia) Lazy eye symptoms are seen from sufferers who cannot focus well with one of their eyes. Because the disturbed eye will not see objects clearly. The brain cannot receive clear data either, so it will start to ignore the image of the object. In many cases, a stronger brain and eyes can make up for these deficiencies very well. Therefore, sufferers do not realize that they have an eye problem. That is why lazy eye is often only diagnosed when a child undergoes a routine eye test. Symptoms of lazy eye can include: Blurred vision. Double vision. Weak depth perception. Rolling the eyes, either up, down, out, or in. People with this condition need to have their vision checked, especially if they have a family history of strabismus, childhood cataracts, or other eye conditions. Risk Factors for Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Risk factors associated with an increased risk of lazy eye include: Born premature Having a family history of lazy eye Developmental disorders. Causes of Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Lazy eye develops as a result of abnormal visual experiences early in life. This changes the nerve pathways between the retina at the back of the eye and the brain. The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals. Eventually, the eyes\u2019 ability to work together decreases, and the brain suppresses or ignores input from the weaker eye. Anything that causes a child\u2019s vision to become blurry or causes the eyes to squint and change direction can cause this condition. Common causes of this condition include: Muscle imbalance (strabismus amblyopia). The most common cause is an imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes. This imbalance can cause the eyes to protrude inward or outward, preventing them from working together. Difference in visual acuity between the eyes (refractive amblyopia). A significant difference between the two eyes can cause lazy eye. Often it is due to nearsightedness, but sometimes it is due to farsightedness or an uneven curvature of the eye\u2019s surface (astigmatism). Glasses or contact lenses are usually used to correct this refractive problem. In some children, this eye condition is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems. Problems with one eye, such as a cloudy area in the lens (cataract), can block clear vision in that eye. Infantile deprivation amblyopia requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. It is often the most severe type of amblyopia. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Diagnosis Amblyopia diagnosis can be determined from a medical interview, physical examination, and several supporting examinations such as: Crowding phenomena test, testing using the Snellen chart. Density filter neutral test, a vision test using reduced light intensity. Worth\u2019s four dot test, a test to see fusion and stereopsis vision. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Treatment Effective lazy eye treatment involves treating the underlying eye condition first. Simple early treatment measures that can be taken may include the use of glasses, contact lenses, eye patches, eye drops, or vision therapy. The earlier the condition is treated, the better the outcome. However, recovery is still possible if amblyopia is diagnosed and treated when you are older. 1. Glasses/contact lenses If you have amblyopia due to nearsightedness or farsightedness, or have astigmatism in one eye, then corrective glasses or contact lenses may help. 2. Eye patch Wearing an eye patch over your dominant eye can help strengthen your weaker eye. Your doctor may recommend wearing the patch for 1 to 2 hours a day, depending on how severe your amblyopia is. Blindfolds will help develop the areas of the brain that control vision. 3. Eye drops Eye drops can be used once or twice a day to blur the vision in the good eye. Like an eye patch, this treatment encourages you to use your weaker eye more often. This can be an additional alternative to lazy eye treatment. 4. Surgery If you have crossed eyes or eyes that point in opposite directions, you may need surgery on the eye muscles. Lazy Eye Complications Certain complications can occur with lazy eye, including: Blindness. If left untreated, sufferers can eventually lose vision in the eye affected by lazy eye. This vision loss is usually permanent. Eye Alignment. Strabismus, where the eyes are misaligned, can be permanent. Central Vision. If children do not receive treatment, central vision may not develop properly. This can affect their ability to perform certain tasks. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Prevention Lazy eye cannot be prevented. However, you can stop it from getting worse or causing permanent problems. The best way to prevent vision loss due to amblyopia is to have regular eye exams. Make sure your child has a comprehensive eye exam at 6 months of age and then again at 3 years of age. When to See a Doctor? When you experience symptoms of this eye problem and it starts to interfere with your vision, see an eye doctor immediately for further treatment. Proper treatment can minimize the effects so that treatment can be done faster.",

        "title": "Pterygium Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Pterygium Pterygium is an eye disease that occurs due to the growth of a pink, triangular tissue membrane that appears on the white part of the eyeball. This condition is also known as surfer\u2018s eye. Typically, this condition begins on the cornea near the nose and can grow to the pupil (the black part of the eye). This condition is usually only found in one eye. However, if you experience it in both eyes, this eye disorder is called pterygia. This disease can cause discomfort and trigger itching. If not treated immediately, this condition can increase the risk of closed pupils and impaired vision. Symptoms of Pterygium This disease develops slowly. At the beginning of the appearance of pterygium, you will not experience any symptoms. However, symptoms will be felt more as the condition worsens. There are several symptoms that sufferers often experience in the early stages of its development, such as: A pink line appears on the white of the eye. Red and irritated eyes. Dry eyes accompanied by itching and a burning sensation. Feeling like there is sand or dust in the eyes. Eyes that water more often. The vision became a little blurry. Worsening symptoms are characterized by the growth of a membrane that increasingly covers the cornea and impaired vision. Pterygium Risk Factors Avoid various risk factors that can trigger this disease, such as: Spending too much time outdoors during the day. Eyes exposed to dust, sand, and air pollution can cause eye irritation. Dry eyes. Causes of Pterygium It is not yet known exactly what causes pterygium. However, too much direct exposure to ultraviolet light is thought to be the cause of this condition. There are several theories that try to explain the pathogenesis of pterygium. For example, geographical variations affect the incidence of pterygium, which is shown by most studies that have been done. This is based on the higher incidence of pterygium in countries closer to the equator. The increased prevalence of pterygium is thought to be due to the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation, particularly UV-B radiation, which affects people in equatorial regions. The hypothesis is that this radiation causes mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, thereby facilitating abnormal proliferation of the limbal epithelium. Apart from direct exposure to sunlight, eye irritation that is not treated properly can also trigger pterygium. Diagnosis of Pterygium A doctor can diagnose this condition based on a physical exam using a slit lamp. This lamp allows the doctor to see a person\u2019s eye with the help of magnification and bright lighting. Additional tests include: Visual Acuity Test. This test involves reading letters on an eye chart. Corneal Topography. This medical mapping technique is used to measure changes in the curvature of the cornea. Photo Documentation. This procedure is done by taking pictures that aim to track the growth rate of the pterygium. Pterygium Treatment If the symptoms of pterygium are still mild or still in the early stages, doctors will generally prescribe medication to reduce irritation or redness in the eyes. Medication can be given with steroid eye drops, artificial tears, and so on. However, if the pterygium has reached an advanced stage and disturbing symptoms are found, such as impaired vision, the doctor will recommend surgery to remove this abnormal tissue growth and remove it. After that, conjunctival tissue or placenta can be used to fill the empty space where the pterygium lesion was. Pterygium Complications If left untreated, this condition can trigger severe scarring of the cornea. Scarring can increase the risk of vision loss. Pterygium Prevention Prevention of pterygium disease can be done by using sunglasses with lenses that can block 99-100 percent of UV A and UV B every day when going outdoors and the weather is hot. Don\u2019t forget to use head coverings, such as hats, which can protect your eyes from direct exposure to sunlight.",

        "title": "Conjunctivitis Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis, also called pink eye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva. Well, the conjunctiva itself is a clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye (sclera) and the inside of the eyelids. This inflammatory disorder of the conjunctiva can cause the white part of the eye to appear reddish or pink. This eye disease is usually caused by bacterial or viral infections, to allergic reactions. Even so, this disorder rarely affects vision. In addition, conjunctivitis most often attacks children, because this eye disease can spread quickly in schools and daycare centers. However, conjunctivitis is rarely serious, especially if it is found and treated quickly. The role of parents is very important to address this problem in children quickly so that the discomfort caused can be overcome immediately. Symptoms of Conjunctivitis Symptoms of conjunctivitis vary depending on the type and cause. In general, the symptoms of conjunctivitis are: Red eyes in one or both eyes. The eyes also often feel itchy and like there is sand in them. The eyes can produce a thick, crusty discharge at night, making it difficult to open your eyes in the morning. Enlarged lymph nodes may also be found. Eyes feel burning and/or sore. Swollen eyelids. Blurred vision. Eyes are sensitive to light. Green or white discharge from the eyes. Risk Factors for Conjunctivitis There are several factors that increase a person\u2019s risk of experiencing this eye problem, including: Using contact lenses, especially long-term wear. Exposure to someone infected with the virus or bacteria causes this eye disorder. Being exposed to something that causes a person to be allergic. Causes of Conjunctivitis As mentioned earlier, there are three main types that cause this eye disorder, namely infections from viruses or bacteria, and allergies. However, there are several other causes that can cause conjunctivitis, such as: Reaction to eye drops. Irritants to shampoo, dirt, smoke, and chlorine. Fungi, amoeba, and parasites. Conjunctivitis is also sometimes caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Gonorrhea and Chlamydia are examples of STDs that can cause conjunctivitis. Types of Conjunctivitis There are several types of conjunctivitis that are distinguished by their causes. Here is a more complete explanation: Viral Conjunctivitis This viral eye condition is the most common type of conjunctivitis. This type of pink eye is highly contagious and often spreads in certain settings, such as schools and other crowded places. This condition can cause burning red eyes with discharge. Bacterial Conjunctivitis This eye problem is also considered very contagious. A bacterial infection causes the eyes to turn pink. This disorder can also cause pain in the eyes with lots of sticky pus in the eyes. Some bacterial infections can also cause little or no discharge. Allergic Conjunctivitis This eye problem is caused by an allergic reaction to pollen, animals, cigarette smoke, pool chlorine, car exhaust, and many more. This conjunctivitis is not contagious. When it occurs, you can feel very itchy, red, and watery, and the eyelids can become swollen. Diagnosis of Conjunctivitis To make a diagnosis, the doctor will initially ask questions about symptoms and recent medical history related to conjunctivitis. After that, supporting examinations are carried out by taking samples of fluid flowing from the eye to be analyzed in the laboratory (culture). This laboratory examination can help the doctor to determine the cause of the disorder. For example, caused by bacteria, viruses, allergies, or other problems. After that, the determination for the right treatment can be done. Conjunctivitis Treatment Treatment for this eye disorder depends on the underlying cause. Here are some treatments: For viral conjunctivitis, doctors will not prescribe antibiotics, as it usually resolves on its own within one to three weeks. To create more comfort, apply a cool, wet cloth to the eyes. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment. However, if the conjunctivitis is caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia, oral antibiotics are needed. Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with vasoconstrictors, antihistamines, and steroid eye drops. This can help relieve itching and swelling. General treatment is symptomatic for all types of conjunctivitis, namely compressing the eyes with warm water for 5-10 minutes 4 times a day to relieve discomfort. In addition, artificial tears can also be given. For conjunctivitis sufferers who use contact lenses, it is recommended not to wear contact lenses until the eyes are completely healed. Complications of Conjunctivitis If left untreated, conjunctivitis can cause complications in the form of inflammation of the cornea that affects vision. This can happen to both children and adults. Therefore, proper evaluation and treatment are needed to avoid problems such as blurred vision or light sensitivity so that the risk of complications is smaller. Conjunctivitis Prevention Here are some ways you can do to prevent conjunctivitis: Keep your hands clean and do not touch your eyes with your hands. Wash your hands more often. Use clean towels and cloths every day. Do not share towels or washcloths. Change pillowcases as often as possible. Limit the use of eye cosmetics, such as mascara. Do not share eye cosmetics or personal eye care items. Avoid allergy triggers. Clean contact lenses regularly, especially before use. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms of conjunctivitis, such as eye pain, a feeling of something stuck in your eye, blurred vision, and light sensitivity, see an eye doctor immediately for treatment. Those who wear contact lenses should stop wearing them as soon as symptoms of conjunctivitis begin. If symptoms do not improve within 12 to 24 hours, make an appointment with your eye doctor to make sure you do not have a more serious eye infection related to your contact lens use.",

        "title": "Presbyopia Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Presbyopia Presbyopia or old eyes is a condition in which the eyes slowly lose their ability to focus quickly on close objects. This condition is something that commonly occurs as we age. Presbyopia generally appears at age 40 and continues to develop until age 65. This is related to the eye lens which is surrounded by elastic muscles. These muscles can change the shape of the lens to focus light to fall right on the retina. Unfortunately, as we age, the muscles around the eye lens will lose their elasticity and harden. As a result, the eye lens cannot bend light properly to focus it on the retina. Symptoms of Presbyopia Symptoms of presbyopia begin to be experienced since someone enters the age of 40 years, usually, someone is not aware that he has presbyopia because he can still try to adjust. You need to recognize the symptoms of presbyopia especially if you are over 40 years old. The symptoms that appear are usually marked by: Difficulty reading newspapers or writing on a cell phone or letters from a close distance, and when you move the object away, the writing is more legible. Vision becomes blurry when looking at objects at close range. Eyes feel sore and head feels tense and sore after reading at close range or writing. The above complaints will get worse when you do it in low light conditions. Risk Factors for Presbyopia The most significant risk factor for presbyopia is age. Most people lose some of their ability to focus on near objects by age 40. However, certain diseases or medications can cause presbyopia in people younger than 40. When symptoms of presbyopia occur earlier than usual, it is called premature presbyopia. In addition, a person is at higher risk for premature presbyopia if they have: Anemia, which is a lack of enough normal blood cells. Suffering from cardiovascular disease. Diabetes, or difficulty metabolizing blood sugar. Having hyperopia, or farsightedness, which means the sufferer has greater difficulty seeing objects that are close up than objects that are far away. Multiple sclerosis, which is a chronic disease that affects the spine and brain. Myasthenia gravis, which is a neuromuscular disorder that affects the body\u2019s nerves and muscles. The presence of trauma or certain eye diseases. Have vascular insufficiency, or poor blood flow. In addition, some prescription and over-the-counter medications can also increase a person\u2019s risk of developing early presbyopia. Examples of these medications are: Anti-anxiety medication. Antidepressant. Antihistamines. Antipsychotics. Antispasmodic. Diuretic. Causes of Presbyopia First of all you need to know that in order to see an object, the human eye must capture light, and focus the light from the object being viewed to the retina in the eye. When the object is at a closer distance, the lens of the eye that is responsible for focusing the light captured by the cornea of \u200b\u200bthe eye becomes more flexible. The lens of the eye is different from the cornea, because the lens of the eye has a flexible nature, and can change shape with the help of the circular muscles that surround it. When you look at an object that is far away, the circular muscles relax. Likewise, when you look at an object at close range, the circular muscles of the eye will tense and make the lens of the eye change shape in order to focus the light received. In presbyopia, the eye lens will experience changes to become harder and begin to lose its flexibility, this happens with age. As a result of this loss of flexibility, the eye lens becomes difficult to focus the existing light. As a result, the resulting image becomes unfocused/blurry. Presbyopia Diagnosis Presbyopia can be diagnosed through a routine eye examination consisting of a vision examination through an eye refraction test, and a complete eye examination. Presbyopia Treatment Until now, several steps that can be taken to overcome presbyopia include: Wearing glasses. Using contact lenses. Refractive eye surgery, such as LASIK surgery. Eye lens implantation. Korean inlay, which is the act of inserting a small plastic ring into each cornea to change the curvature of the cornea. Complications of Presbyopia If presbyopia is not diagnosed or not properly corrected, the sufferer\u2019s vision will gradually deteriorate. This condition can make presbyopia sufferers have problems maintaining their daily activity and productivity levels. Especially when sufferers have to read small writings, they can experience headaches and eye fatigue. Everyone develops presbyopia as they age, so presbyopia may also be accompanied by other types of eye problems. Presbyopia can occur in combination with: Astigmatism. An imperfection in the curvature of the cornea that causes blurred vision. Hyperopia, or farsightedness. Myopia, or nearsightedness. In addition, people with presbyopia may also have different types of eye problems in each eye. Presbyopia Prevention To date, there is no proven technique to prevent presbyopia. However, there are steps you can take to improve your eye health and slow the progression of presbyopia, namely: Have regular eye exams. Manage chronic health conditions that can cause vision loss, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Wearing sunglasses. Wear protective eyewear when participating in activities that may result in eye injury. Eat a healthy diet with foods containing antioxidants, vitamin A, and beta carotene. Make sure you wear glasses with the right lens size. Use good lighting when reading. When to See a Doctor? If you experience one or more symptoms of presbyopia, see a doctor immediately. The goal is that appropriate treatment can be carried out early so that the risk of complications can be minimized.",

        "text": "Cataract Cataracts are a disease when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy and opaque. In general, cataracts develop slowly and are not initially felt to be disturbing. However, over time, cataracts will interfere with vision and make sufferers feel like looking at a foggy window, making it difficult to drive, read, and do daily activities. This eye disease is the leading cause of blindness in the world that can be treated. Cataract Symptoms Sufferers can experience several symptoms, for example: Blurred vision like fog. See circles around the light. Double vision. Decreased vision at night. Glare when looking at car headlights, the sun, or lamps. Frequently change the size of glasses. The colors around it look faded. Cataract Risk Factors There are several factors that can increase the risk of cataracts, including: Aging. Aging is the most common cause of lens opacities or cataracts. History of trauma. Eye lenses that have experienced trauma, such as sharp material fragments entering the eye, being hit by a ball, fireworks, can cause cataracts to develop more quickly. Infection during pregnancy. If the mother has an infection during pregnancy, especially rubella, it can be the main cause of congenital cataracts in the child that is born. Congenital cataracts can occur in one or both of the child\u2019s eyes. Taking certain medications over a long period of time, such as corticosteroids and amiodarone, can trigger cataracts. People with certain diseases. People with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypokalemia, and atopic dermatitis may be associated with the development of cataracts later in life. Smoking and alcohol consumption habits. Prolonged exposure to sunlight on the eyes. Exposure to toxins or poisons. Family history of cataracts. History of eye surgery. Causes of Cataracts The most common cause of cataracts is due to aging or trauma that causes changes in the eye tissue. The lens of the eye is mostly made up of water and protein. As we age, the lens becomes thicker and less flexible. This causes protein clumps and reduces the amount of light reaching the retina, a light-sensitive layer located at the back of the eye. This condition eventually causes blurry and dull vision. The lens changes start out as a mild yellow-brown color, but worsen over time. Some inherited genetic disorders can also cause other health problems that can increase the risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, previous eye surgery, or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications can also cause the eye disease to develop. Cataract Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose cataracts by reviewing your medical history and symptoms and performing a thorough eye exam, including: Visual field examination. Visual acuity test. Examination using a tool directed from the side of the eye, to show cloudiness in the eye lens ( shadow test ). Other additional examinations that can also be performed to diagnose cataracts include: A slit lamp examination, which allows the eye doctor to see the structures in the front of your eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the retina, if abnormalities in other organs in the eye are suspected. Applanation tonometry. This test measures the fluid pressure in the eye. Cataract Treatment If cataracts aren\u2019t too bothersome, you may just need new glasses to help you see better. If cataracts cause vision to worsen and make it difficult to carry out daily activities, surgery is a treatment that can be performed to overcome this eye problem. Cataract surgery is generally safe and does not require hospitalization. There are two types of cataract surgery, namely: Small incision cataract surgery ( phacoemulsification ). This surgery is done by making a small incision on the edge of the cornea. Next, the doctor will shine ultrasound waves to destroy the lens and then remove it using a suction device. Extracapsular surgery. This surgery requires a larger incision to remove the cloudy lens nucleus. The remaining lens is then removed using a suction device. In both types of surgery, an artificial lens, also called an intraocular lens, is inserted to replace the original lens. The surgery takes about an hour and is painless. Doctors usually use eye drops to numb the eye and keep the patient conscious during the surgery. Cataract Complications In most cases, cataracts will continue to worsen over time, causing vision to decrease. This can make it difficult for sufferers to drive, even endangering safety, as well as the sufferer\u2019s overall quality of life. If left untreated for a long time, cataracts can often cause total blindness. Untreated cataracts can also become \u201chyper-mature,\u201d a condition that makes them more difficult to remove and more likely to cause complications of cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is usually safe and rarely causes complications. However, it is not impossible for complications from cataract surgery to occur, including: Eye inflammation. This complication usually occurs when the sufferer has a large or thick cataract. Light sensitivity. When this condition persists, it may be due to dryness or inflammation. Photopsia, or seeing flashes of light or floaters. This condition occurs when the gel inside the eye separates from the retina. Photopsia is common and usually resolves within a few months. Macular edema. This is caused by a buildup of fluid in the macula, the central part of the retina at the back of the eye. Ptosis, or drooping eyelid. This complication can occur due to surgical trauma. Intraocular lens dislocation. This occurs when a new (intraocular) lens implant is not properly seated in the eye\u2019s capsular bag, which holds it in place or is dislocated. Torn or detached retina. This is more likely to occur in younger sufferers and is the result of the retina pulling away from the back of the eye. Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) or a second cataract, can occur because cataract surgery removes the front part of the lens but leaves the back in place. Cataract Prevention Some efforts that can be made to prevent cataracts include: Have your eyes checked regularly by an eye specialist. Protect your eyes from impact and prolonged exposure to sunlight by using glasses that protect against ultraviolet rays, both UVA and UVB. Manage other health problems, such as diabetes, that can increase the risk of cataracts. Limit the habit of driving at night. Improve lighting in the house. Using a magnifying glass when reading. Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption Implement a diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables. When to See a Doctor? If some of the cataract symptoms above appear and become increasingly disturbing or worsen, so that the sufferer feels pain in the eyes or has difficulty carrying out daily activities, it is a good idea to immediately see an eye specialist for further examination and treatment.",

        "title": "3 Diets That Can Do More Harm Than Good For Women With PCOS, Nutritionist Shares",
        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is one of the most common hormonal problems among women of reproductive age. In this condition, women may experience symptoms such as irregular or missed periods, fertility problems, excessive hair growth - especially on the face - and acne. If you are suffering from PCOS or have recently been diagnosed with it, you'll know how challenging it can be. While there is no permanent cure for this condition, the good news is that you can manage it. How? By taking charge and being more mindful of your dietary practices. However, many start following diets without knowing if they're really good for their condition. Are you also feeling confused about what to eat and what not to? Recently, nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary took to her Instagram handle to clear this confusion and share the three worst diets for women with PCOS.Also Read: What To Drink For PCOS: 5 Quick And Easy Herbal Drinks Shared By Ayurvedic Expert Here Are 3 Worst Diets For Women With PCOS, According To The Nutritionist: 1. Intermittent Fasting Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a popular diet in recent times. In this, you are required to alternate between eating and fasting periods. While it may work well for some, Rashi recommends avoiding it if you have PCOS. She explains, \"If you're going to do intermittent fasting every single day, and not cyclically, it's going to raise your cortisol levels and bring down your progesterone.\" When this happens, it can mess up your hormones and worsen your condition. 2. Low Calorie Diet Low-calorie diets are great for losing weight, but not for people with PCOS. According to Rashi, eating low-calorie foods like salads all the time can do more harm than good. In fact, it can make your condition worse. This is because your body may go into survival mode, instead of focusing on thriving processes like ovulation. You may be getting your period, but this does not necessarily mean you are ovulating. Therefore, it's essential to fulfil your recommended daily calorie intake, which is about 1600 to 2400 calories a day. 3. All Fruit Diet Do you resort to having fruits all the time, thinking they are healthy? Well, this is exactly why you're unable to manage your symptoms, especially if you have insulin-resistant PCOS. For the unversed, this specific type of PCOS is caused by blood sugar dysregulation. The nutritionist explains that eating too many fruits at once can cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar levels. So, while you think you're eating healthy, it can worsen your hormones. If you want balanced hormones, start with balanced blood sugar levels.Also Read:Should You Avoid Dairy If You Have PCOS? Expert Weighs In Watch the full video below: View this post on Instagram So, What Type Of Foods Should You Eat For PCOS Management? Now that you know what to avoid for PCOS, you must be wondering what to eat. To begin with, make sure to enrich your diet with high-fibre and high-protein foods. This includes all types of fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens. Protein-rich foods, on the other hand, will help promote satiety and improve insulin sensitivity. Along with this, you must also include omega-3 fatty acids in your diet since they can help improve fertility, regulate hormones, and even reduce facial hair growth. When trying to manage PCOS, your focus should be on following a well-balanced diet, not a strict one. PCOS can be managed by making the right dietary choices. Keep these points in mind and take a step closer towards a healthier you.",

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Peppermint Tea",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Peppermint Tea: Peppermint, a cross between watermint and spearmint, is native to Europe and Asia. For thousands of years, people have used it for its pleasant, minty taste and numerous health benefits. The essential oil found in peppermint is menthol, which gives the plant its cooling properties and recognizable minty scent.Peppermint tea is generally sweet and free of caffeine. Many studies have shown that peppermint tea may have health benefits such as improving digestion, boosting focus, and relieving migraine. Peppermint tea is typically consumed as a beverage. Let us read some of the possible benefits of drinking peppermint tea below.5 Health Benefits of Ginger TeaFollowing are some of the top health benefits of peppermint tea.1. Alleviates Digestive Problems: Peppermint may help alleviate digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and indigestion. This is because peppermint relaxes the digestive system and eases pain. Additionally, some animal studies indicate that peppermint can prevent smooth muscle contractions, which can help relieve spasms in the gut. While there are no studies on peppermint tea and digestion, experts believe that the tea may have similar health benefits.2. Relieves Headaches and Migraines: Peppermint, known for its muscle-relaxing and pain-relieving properties, has the potential to alleviate certain types of headaches. The menthol found in peppermint oil stimulates blood flow and offers a cooling sensation, which may contribute to pain relief. While there is limited scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of peppermint tea in relaxing muscles and reducing headache pain through its aroma, applying peppermint oil directly to the temples may provide some relief.7 Health Benefits of Rosemary Tea3. Prevents Menstrual Cramps: According to a study published in 2016, peppermint oil capsules were found to be equally effective in reducing menstrual pain as mefenamic acid, a common over-the-counter pain medication. The research team tested the effectiveness of peppermint oil on 127 young women with dysmenorrhea and found some promising results. Some people also consume peppermint tea as a home remedy for menstrual cramping.4. Alleviates Nasal Congestion: Although consuming peppermint tea won't cure a cold on its own, the menthol scent of the mint combined with the steam from the tea could help clear your nasal passages if you have a blocked nose.7 Health Benefits of Black Tea5. Prevents Bad Breath: Peppermint not only has a refreshing flavor, but its antibacterial qualities may also aid in eliminating the microorganisms that are causing the mouth odor. It's also said to prevent a film of bacteria from accumulating on your teeth, maintaining the health of your whites.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "10 Health Benefits Of Adding Lemons To Your Daily Diet",
        "text": "Lemons are small, bright yellow citrus fruits known for their sour taste and high vitamin C content. They are incredibly healthy due to their rich supply of antioxidants, particularly vitamin C, which strengthens the immune system, aids in collagen production, and promotes skin health. Lemons also contain fibre and beneficial plant compounds that support digestion, weight management, and heart health by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Consuming lemons daily can boost hydration, enhance nutrient absorption, detoxify the body, and even prevent kidney stones. Their versatile nutrients make them a simple but powerful addition to a healthy diet. In this article, we discuss in detail how consuming lemons daily can boost your health. Here's how lemons can boost your overall well-being 1. Rich source of vitamin C Lemons are packed with vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and protects against colds and flu. Vitamin C also helps repair tissues, promotes collagen production, and strengthens the skin. 2. Improves digestive health Lemon juice stimulates the production of digestive juices like bile, helping to improve digestion. Its acidic nature also helps break down food more effectively and relieves symptoms of indigestion, such as bloating and heartburn. 3. Aids in weight loss Lemons are low in calories and high in fibre, particularly pectin, which can help you feel fuller for longer and reduce cravings. Drinking lemon water before meals can support portion control and weight management. 4. Promotes hydration Adding lemon to water encourages you to drink more, helping to maintain hydration throughout the day. Staying hydrated improves metabolism, energy levels, and overall cellular function. 5. Boosts heart health The vitamin C and plant compounds in lemons help lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Consuming lemons regularly can reduce the risk of heart disease by improving vascular health and preventing artery blockage. 6. Supports skin health Lemon's antioxidant properties protect the skin from free radical damage, which can cause premature aging. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, helping to keep the skin firm, reduce wrinkles, and heal wounds. 7. Helps detoxify the body Lemons act as a natural diuretic, promoting urination and helping flush out toxins from the body. This detoxifying effect supports kidney health and helps maintain overall detoxification through the liver. 8. Prevents kidney stones The citric acid in lemons increases urinary citrate levels, which helps prevent the formation of kidney stones. Drinking lemon water regularly can dilute urine, reducing the risk of stone formation. 9. Boosts iron absorption Lemons enhance the absorption of non-heme iron, the type of iron found in plant-based foods. Adding lemon juice to meals can improve iron uptake, reducing the risk of iron deficiency anaemia. 10. Supports oral health The antibacterial properties of lemons can help fight bacteria in the mouth, reducing the risk of gum disease and bad breath. However, due to their acidity, lemons should be consumed in moderation to avoid tooth enamel erosion. Adding lemons to your daily diet provides a wide range of health benefits.

        "title": "Facts about sea turtles you need to know",
        "text": "Sea turtles are ancient and vital creatures, having lived in the world\u2019s oceans for over 100 million years. Found in warm and temperate seas, they play a crucial role in maintaining marine ecosystems. However, sea turtles face increasing threats from climate change, habitat destruction, and human activities. Their unique life cycle and migratory patterns make them particularly vulnerable, yet they remain symbols of resilience. Every year on June 16, \u2018World Sea Turtle Day\u2019 is celebrated to raise awareness about the conservation efforts needed to protect these magnificent animals and highlight their importance to ocean health. Fascinating facts about sea turtlesLife expectancy of 80 yearsSea turtles have an impressive lifespan, with many species living between 50 and 80 years. They take two to three decades to mature, and once they do, they remain actively reproductive for about 10 years. Sand temperature determines their genderThe temperature of the sand where sea turtles lay their eggs plays a crucial role in determining the sex of the hatchlings. Cooler sand temperatures produce male sea turtles, while warmer sand tends to result in females. This temperature-based sex determination is sensitive to climate change, impacting future turtle populations.Florida faces a shortage of male sea turtlesDue to record-high temperatures in Florida, the sands where sea turtles nest have become significantly hotter. This has led to an alarming trend where most eggs are hatching as females, resulting in a growing shortage of males. Sea turtles migrate thousands of milesSea turtles are known for their remarkable migrations. The leatherback turtle, for example, travels more than 10,000 miles annually across the Pacific Ocean. Loggerhead turtles have been tracked migrating from Japan to Baja, covering around 8,000 miles. These long-distance migrations are essential for feeding, breeding, and survival.They play a vital role in ocean ecosystemsSea turtles are essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. They graze on seagrass beds and coral reefs, preventing overgrowth and promoting biodiversity. By controlling jellyfish and crustacean populations, sea turtles help balance the food web. Their presence ensures the health of the oceans, benefiting many other species.Their shells cannot retractUnlike land turtles, sea turtles cannot retract their heads or flippers into their shells. This makes them more vulnerable to predators like sharks and killer whales. Hatchlings and eggs face even greater threats from animals such as raccoons and seabirds, making protection crucial for their survival in the wild.Human activities pose major threatsHuman activity is a significant threat to sea turtles. Coastal development reduces nesting sites, while artificial light disorients hatchlings, leading them away from the ocean. Plastic pollution also presents a major danger, with many sea turtles mistaking debris for food, which often results in fatal blockages or entanglement.There are only 6.5 million sea turtles leftThe current global sea turtle population is estimated at 6.5 million, with most species classified as endangered or critically endangered. This decline is primarily due to habitat loss, illegal hunting, and accidental capture in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are critical to prevent further decline and to protect these iconic marine species.Hawksbill and Kemp\u2019s Ridley turtles are critically endangeredHawksbill turtles, known for their striking shells, have a population of only about 57,000 individuals, making them critically endangered. Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles, another critically endangered species, are even rarer, with just around 10,000 individuals left. Both species are under severe threat from climate change and human activities.Sea turtles thrived during the COVID-19 pandemicDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced human activity on beaches gave sea turtles a break from disturbances. In Florida, where around 400,000 sea turtle nests were recorded in 2019, researchers found improved nesting success during lockdowns in 2020. Fewer beachgoers and less waste allowed turtles to thrive without human interference.Sea turtles have existed for over 100 million yearsSea turtles are among the oldest creatures on Earth, having existed for more than 100 million years. They have survived drastic changes in the planet\u2019s climate and ecosystem over millennia. However, their ability to adapt is being tested by the accelerated pace of modern climate change and human impacts on the oceans.They can hold their breath for hoursSea turtles are highly adapted to life in the ocean and can hold their breath for up to five hours when resting. When active, they surface every few minutes for air. This ability is essential for their long dives, especially when they are feeding or avoiding predators in the deep sea.Excellent navigation skillsThey use the Earth's magnetic fields to navigate thousands of miles, returning to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs.Sea turtles help combat climate changeBy grazing on seagrass beds, sea turtles play a role in regulating the ocean\u2019s carbon cycle. Seagrasses absorb carbon dioxide and store it, helping mitigate the effects of climate change. The health of these underwater meadows depends on sea turtles, as they prevent overgrowth and maintain biodiversity in marine ecosystems.Conservation efforts Many organisations and governments are working to protect sea turtles through measures like reducing bycatch in fisheries, protecting nesting sites, and banning plastic waste. The Sea Turtle Conservation Project, in particular, aims to protect species such as the Olive Ridley turtle. Launched in 1999 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in collaboration with the UNDP, it focuses on Indian coastal states, particularly Orissa. It uses satellite technology to monitor nesting areas, safeguard breeding habitats, and promote collaboration at national and international levels for turtle conservation efforts.Also read: Why does Octopus have blue blood?",
        "summary": "Sea turtles, ancient creatures vital to marine ecosystems, face increasing threats from climate change and human activities. With lifespans up to 80 years, they help maintain ocean health by grazing on seagrass beds and coral reefs. Conservation efforts are critical to protect these endangered species and ensure the balance of marine biodiversity.",

        "title": "Celiac Disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Celiac Disease Celiac disease is a serious autoimmune disease. It occurs in people with a genetic condition where gluten consumption causes damage to the small intestine. Celiac is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide, but only about 30 percent are diagnosed. Celiac Disease Symptoms The symptoms are not the same as food allergies. When accidentally ingesting food containing gluten, the person will experience intestinal problems such as diarrhea, excessive gas, and constipation. Other symptoms seen in sufferers include: Stomach ache. Nauseous. Anemia. Rash or dermatitis herpetiformis). Loss of bone density. Headache or general fatigue. Bone or joint pain. Mouth ulcers. Weight loss. Heartburn. In children, they are at risk of experiencing intestinal problems than adults. Symptoms are characterized by: Nausea or vomiting. Bloating or swelling in the stomach. Diarrhea. Constipation. Too much fat in the stool (steatorrhea). Weight loss. Risk Factors for Celiac Disease Celiac is at high risk for the following groups: Having a family history of Celiac or dermatitis herpetiformis. Having type 1 diabetes. Having Down syndrome or Turner syndrome. Having autoimmune thyroid disease. Having Addison\u2019s disease. Causes of Celiac Disease It is not yet known exactly what causes Celiac. This disease triggers a reaction from the immune system to gluten by damaging the small hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine. Damaged villi prevent the body from getting essential nutrients from food. Celiac Disease Diagnosis Celiac diagnosis is done with the following steps: Serology tests. These tests look for antibodies in the blood. Elevated levels of certain antibody proteins indicate an immune reaction to gluten. Genetic testing. Testing is done with human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) to rule out celiac disease. If the test results indicate celiac disease, your doctor will likely do further testing by: Endoscopy. This procedure uses a long tube with a tiny camera on the end. The camera allows the doctor to see the small intestine and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to analyze damage to the villi. Capsule endoscopy. This procedure uses a small wireless camera to take pictures of the entire small intestine. The camera is inside a vitamin capsule that is swallowed. As the capsule travels through the digestive tract, the camera takes pictures of the condition of the intestine. Celiac Disease Treatment Celiac treatment can be done with the following steps: Gluten-Free Diet These are the foods that sufferers need to avoid Wheat. Barley. Wheat. Potato flour. Malt. Semolina. Triticale. Bread. Pasta. Cereals. Spell. Gluten can be hidden in foods, medicines, and non-food products, including: Modified food starch, preservatives, and food stabilizers. Prescription and over-the-counter medications. Vitamin and mineral supplements. Herbal and nutritional supplements. Lipstick products. Toothpaste and mouthwash. Envelopes and stamp glue. Play-doh. Vitamin and Mineral Supplements The use of supplements is done in patients with anemia or severe nutritional deficiencies. Supplements consumed include: Copper. Folate. Iron. Vitamin B-12. Vitamin D Vitamin K. Zinc. Complications of Celiac Disease Untreated Celiac Disease can cause: Malnutrition. This occurs when the small intestine cannot absorb enough nutrients from food. Malnutrition causes anemia and weight loss. In children, malnutrition causes growth retardation and short stature. Weakening of bones. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D causes softening of bones (osteomalacia or rickets) in children and loss of bone density (osteopenia or osteoporosis) in adults. Infertility and miscarriage. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D causes reproductive problems. Lactose intolerance. Damage to the small intestine causes abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating or drinking dairy products containing lactose. Cancer. People who do not maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer. Nervous system problems. Some people experience seizures or nerve disease in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Celiac Disease Prevention Prevention is done by reducing the risk. These are the steps that can be taken: During pregnancy, stick to a gluten-free diet. Gluten consumption during pregnancy activates the disease and causes malabsorption of nutrients in both mother and fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage. Genetic testing for babies. If the baby tests positive for Celiac, antibody blood tests should be done after the child is 3 years old and every two to three years thereafter. Breastfeeding for at least six months. Based on research, delayed symptoms among infants at risk of Celiac disease who are breastfed for at least 6 months, can occur. Introduce gluten slowly after the child is between 4 and 6 months old. Adding gluten to children while breastfeeding lowers the risk of Celiac disease after they are 2 years old. Mothers who breastfeed their children after adding gluten to their diet reduce the risk of their children developing Celiac disease later in life.",

        "title": "Chagas disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Chagas disease is a zoonotic disease transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans and vice versa. This disorder causes inflammation and infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a type of parasite in the form of insects, such as fleas and cockroaches. Therefore, Chagas disease is often referred to as the kissing bug. The insects that spread the parasite that causes Chagas disease are from the genus Triatoma, including Triatoma infestans, Rhodnius prolixus, and Panstrongyius megistus. The disease is more common in South America, Central America, and Mexico, where the triatomine insects originate. This disease can infect everyone without exception. If not treated immediately, Chagas disease can cause serious heart and digestive problems. In someone who has acute disease, the parasite needs to be destroyed. But if the disorder is chronic, the treatment that needs to be done is to manage the symptoms and prevent the infection from spreading. Chagas Disease Symptoms A person who has Chagas disease will experience a number of symptoms, namely: Fever Fatigue Pain in the body Headache Rash Loss of appetite Diarrhea Vomiting Swelling of the eyelids In general, these symptoms will last for several weeks or even longer but can disappear on their own. However, it is advisable to see a doctor if Chagas disease symptoms recur or if you have just returned from a country with high exposure to the T. cruzi parasite. By immediately checking yourself with a doctor, Chagas disease can be treated quickly. Chagas Disease Risk Factors Some factors that can increase a person\u2019s risk of developing Chagas disease include: Receiving a blood transfusion or organ transplant from a person with the disease. Consuming raw food that has been contaminated with the parasite or eating undercooked meat from infected animals. Pregnant women who are infected can transmit the disease to the fetus in the womb. Living in rural areas with poor sanitation or living in countries with high exposure to the T. cruzi parasite, such as Central America, South America and Mexico. Living in a housing complex that has triatomine insects. Travelers visiting countries with high exposure to the disease. Spending time in a forest filled with wild animals that may be infected. Causes of Chagas Disease The most common cause of Chagas disease is the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of an insect called a triatomine. The insect can become infected with T. cruzi when it ingests the blood of an animal infected with the parasite. These insects usually bite humans while they are sleeping. Infected insects defecate after feeding and leave parasites on the skin. The most commonly bitten parts of the body are areas with thin skin, such as the eyes or mouth. After that, the parasite enters the body through the eyes, mouth, cuts or scratches, or insect bites. Scratching or rubbing the bite area can cause the parasite to enter the body. Once inside the body, the parasite multiplies and eventually spreads. Chagas Disease Diagnosis The doctor will first perform a physical examination, such as asking about the symptoms experienced and other factors that can increase the risk of contracting Chagas disease. If you experience symptoms of Chagas disease, a blood test may be needed to confirm the presence of the T. cruzi parasite or the levels of proteins produced by the immune system (antibodies) to fight the parasite in your blood. If diagnosed with Chagas disease, it is recommended to undergo several additional tests to determine whether the disease is already in the chronic phase and has the potential to cause heart or digestive complications. These supporting tests include: Electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor heart activity. Chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged. Echocardiogram to see if there are changes in the heart or its function. Abdominal X-ray to look for changes in the colon. Endoscopy. Chagas Disease Treatment In the early stages, Chagas disease is quite easy to cure. Treatment focuses on killing the T.cruzi parasite by taking benznidazole and nifurtimox. These drugs must be taken for 2 months. Treatment will be effective if the drugs are taken as soon as possible after infection. This disease needs to be treated immediately so that it does not enter the chronic phase because the medicine cannot cure the disease. However, this medicine can slow its development and minimize serious complications. In addition, some additional treatments may be needed depending on the signs and symptoms that arise, such as: Heart-related complications require taking medications, a pacemaker, or the use of other devices to ensure the heart remains healthy. Complications related to treatment require changes in diet, consumption of drugs, corticosteroids, and others. Chagas Disease Complications If Chagas disease has progressed to the chronic phase, serious heart or digestive complications can occur. These may include: Heart failure. Enlargement of the esophagus (megaesophagus). Enlargement of the large intestine (megacolon). Chagas Disease Prevention Chagas disease is a dangerous disease. However, you can avoid this disease by doing some preventive measures such as the following: Spray the inside and around the house with insecticide. Do not stay in muddy areas, filled with straw, or in shacks for long periods of time. Put up a mosquito net on the bed. Using mosquito repellent lotion. Maintain food hygiene and storage. Checking donor blood, organs, cells, and tissues before receiving a transfusion. Perform routine uterine check-ups to avoid transmitting this disease to your child. Do not consume raw foods. When to See a Doctor? If you have just visited a country that has a high risk of Chagas disease and are experiencing symptoms, it is a good idea to get checked immediately.",

        "title": "Kidney Disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Kidney Disease? Kidney disease is one of the medical conditions that are prone to occur so you should be aware of it. The kidneys are two organs shaped like red beans that are located on either side of the upper back of the body, right under the human ribs. The function of the kidneys includes producing renin, an enzyme that regulates blood pressure. In addition, the kidneys also produce erythropoietin compounds that function to stimulate red blood cell production. This organ also functions to filter the body\u2019s metabolic waste. Even healthy kidneys can keep the salt and mineral levels balanced in the body. No less important, the kidneys are able to produce active compounds from vitamin D so that bone health is maintained. When the kidneys are damaged, the body\u2019s metabolic waste will cause swelling in the ankles, vomiting, shortness of breath and lack of sleep. Symptoms of Kidney Disease In fact, the symptoms of kidney disease that appear in each sufferer will be different. This is because of the different types of kidney disease that individuals experience. In fact, some of them do not show any symptoms at the beginning of this condition. Therefore, it is better to know more about the health symptoms associated with kidney disease. Here are the early signs and symptoms that everyone should be aware of: You will experience fatigue, lack of energy, and even difficulty concentrating. Having trouble sleeping. Changes in skin health that become drier and itchier. Experiencing increased frequency of urination. There is blood in the urine. Urine that is foamy and has a pungent odor. Not only that, urine also has a very dark color. Experiencing persistent swelling in the eye area. Swollen ankles and feet. Experiencing decreased appetite. More frequent muscle pain or cramps. In addition to the above symptoms, there are also some Often Ignored Symptoms of Kidney Disease. It is important to immediately recognize and ask a doctor if there are any suspicious complaints or signs. Kidney Disease Risk Factors People with diabetes are at higher risk of developing kidney disease. In fact, diabetes is the main cause of this condition. However, the risk of kidney disease also increases in individuals with the following conditions: Have high blood pressure. Have high cholesterol levels. Smoking habit. Have other family members with a history of kidney disease. Elderly, over 65 years old. Research shows that this condition is more common in people of African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian descent. In addition, this condition is also often associated with other medical conditions, such as: Blockage of blood vessels in the arms or legs. Suffering from diabetes or sugar disease. High blood pressure or hypertension. Suffering from heart failure. Currently undergoing intensive care in hospital due to a serious illness. Suffering from liver disease. Types of Kidney Disease This condition consists of several different types. Here are the types of kidney disease that often occur: 1. Chronic kidney disease or chronic kidney failure Experts also often refer to this disease as chronic kidney failure. This disease occurs when kidney function is gradually lost. When this condition occurs, the body will slowly accumulate waste or substances that the body does not need. Over time it can cause health problems in other organs. 2. Acute kidney disease This type of kidney disease is a sudden decline in kidney function. There are a number of causes that can trigger acute kidney disease. Starting from lack of fluid and blood, injury to the kidneys, or blockages that cause fluid to return to the kidneys. 3. Kidney stones This condition is indicated by the formation of solid objects or gravel in one or both kidneys. Usually, this condition occurs due to high levels of certain minerals in the urine. 4. Kidney infection Doctors also call this condition pyelonephritis. This condition can occur due to an untreated urinary tract infection. As a result, bacteria move towards the kidneys and cause infection. 5. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes cysts to appear in the kidneys. 6. Glomerulonephritis Disorders of the glomerulus or glomerulonephritis are conditions when the kidneys become inflamed. The glomerulus is a part of the kidney organ that plays a role in filtering waste materials, as well as removing excess fluids and electrolytes from the body. Glomerulonephritis can occur in a short time (acute) or long-term (chronic). For the cause, glomerulonephritis can occur due to many factors. For example, such as infection, autoimmune disease, or as an impact of inflammation that attacks blood vessels. Causes of Kidney Disease The causes of this condition will vary depending on the type. For example, the causes are: The kidneys do not have enough blood flow. There is direct damage to the kidneys. Kidney tissue damage due to drugs or severe infection (sepsis). Have a history of chronic kidney disease. Obstruction of urine from the kidneys. Meanwhile, chronic or long-term kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition damages kidney function. This condition eventually causes kidney damage to worsen over months or years. Meanwhile, diseases or conditions that cause chronic kidney disease can include type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as high blood pressure. Kidney Disease Diagnosis Immediately visit the nearest hospital when you experience some health problems related to kidney disease. There are several examinations that you can do to find out the condition of your kidneys, such as: Blood tests , usually these tests are to filter waste from the blood by estimating the glomerular filtration rate or eGFR. A doctor can also perform a urine test to determine the health condition of your kidneys. Kidney biopsy is a procedure where a specialist doctor takes a tissue sample from the kidney to then examine in detail in the laboratory. USG, to get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe current condition of the kidneys and detect other disorders, such as tumors or cysts. Kidney Disease Treatment Treatment for this condition will also depend on the type and cause of the disease. However, treatment generally aims to relieve symptoms and reduce the condition from getting worse. There are several treatments that doctors can recommend for sufferers, such as: Use of medications. For example, the use of ACE inhibitors to help control blood pressure and protein in the urine. In addition, the use of antibiotics can also be prescribed by doctors to inhibit bacterial growth. Kidney stone crushing to treat large kidney stones. Dialysis that lasts for 3-5 hours with a frequency of about 3 times per week. Surgical procedures to remove kidney stones or polycystic kidneys and kidney transplantation. In addition to these treatment options, doctors will also recommend that sufferers of this condition live a healthy lifestyle to ease kidney function. Efforts to implement a healthy lifestyle are: Limit your intake of foods high in salt, sugar, and cholesterol. Routinely check for diseases you have. For example, diabetes, hypertension, and autoimmune diseases. Increase your consumption of water. Limit consumption of alcoholic beverages. If you smoke, people with kidney disease need to stop this habit immediately. Increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Exercise regularly. Kidney Disease Cure Rate The cure of this condition will actually depend on the type. For example, in chronic kidney failure, this disease cannot be completely cured. However, treatment, medical care, and the implementation of the right lifestyle can help people with this disease to carry out normal activities and extend their life expectancy. Meanwhile, for cases of acute kidney failure which usually occurs temporarily, appropriate medical treatment and care can restore or improve kidney function. Kidney Disease Prevention Immediately check the condition of the kidney stones by visiting a doctor to do some tests. Do a urine test first to check for infections and stones in the urine. And do a blood test to make sure the kidneys are functioning properly. There are also preventive measures to reduce the risk of getting this disease, such as: Follow the directions for use. When using over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, follow the directions on the package. Taking too much or too often can cause kidney damage. Maintain ideal body weight. Make sure to exercise regularly and adopt a healthy diet. Read more about recommended exercise times at: Note, This is a Good Exercise Time for Health . Don\u2019t smoke. Smoking can damage your kidneys and worsen existing kidney damage. Manage your medical conditions well. If you have a disease or condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to manage it. Complications of Kidney Disease Long-term kidney disease can negatively impact almost every part of the body. Possible complications include: Fluid retention, which can cause swelling in the arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). A sudden increase in the level of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia), which can interfere with heart function. Anemia. Heart disease such as coronary heart disease. Weak bones and increased risk of fractures. Decreased sex drive, impotence or decreased fertility. Damage to the central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes, or seizures. Decreased immune response, which makes sufferers more susceptible to infection. Pericarditis, is inflammation of the sac-like membrane that surrounds your heart (pericardium). A pregnancy complication that carries risks to both the mother and the developing fetus. Permanent damage to the kidneys (end-stage renal disease), which ultimately requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms of kidney disease that do not improve, immediately check your health condition with an internal medicine specialist . Remember that proper treatment from the start can reduce the risk of dangerous complications.",

        "text": "What Is Diabetes (High Blood Sugar)? Diabetes or sugar disease (high blood sugar) is a chronic (long-term) disease that you need to be aware of. The main sign of this disease is an increase in blood sugar (glucose) levels above normal values. This condition occurs when the sufferer\u2019s body is no longer able to take sugar (glucose) into the cells and use it as energy. This condition ultimately results in the accumulation of extra sugar in the body\u2019s bloodstream. Uncontrolled diabetes can have serious consequences, causing damage to various organs and tissues of the body. For example, organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. There are two main types of diabetes, namely type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If explained, here is an explanation of both, namely: Type 1 diabetes. This type is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body\u2019s immune system will attack itself. In this condition, the body will not produce insulin at all. Type 2 diabetes. In this type of diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin or the body cells of people with type 2 diabetes will not respond normally to insulin. Symptoms of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) The symptoms of this health problem will appear differently in each sufferer. Because this condition will depend on the severity and type of diabetes that the sufferer has. However, in general there are several symptoms that will be experienced by sufferers, both type 1 and type 2, namely: Increased thirst. Increased frequency of urination. Easily tired or feeling constantly tired. There are visual disturbances, such as blurred vision. The occurrence of continuous infections in the body, which commonly occur in the gums, skin, and vaginal area (in women). Unexplained weight loss. The presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are byproducts of the breakdown of muscle and fat that occur when there is not enough insulin available). Therefore, immediately check yourself with a doctor if you experience one or more of these symptoms. This aims to ensure that sufferers receive appropriate treatment early on so that the risk of complications from diabetes can be avoided. Risk Factors for High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) There are several risk factors for type 1 diabetes, including: Family history or hereditary factors, namely when someone will have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes if there are family members who suffer from the same disease because it is related to certain genes. Geographical factors, people who live in areas far from the equator, such as Finland and Sardinia, are at risk of developing type 1 diabetes. This is due to the lack of vitamin D that can be obtained from sunlight, which ultimately triggers autoimmune diseases. Age factor. This disease is most often detected in children aged 4\u20137 years, then in children aged 10\u201314 years. Other triggering factors include consuming cow\u2019s milk at too early an age, water containing sodium nitrate, cereals, and gluten before the age of 4 months or after 7 months, having a mother with a history of preeclampsia, and suffering from jaundice at birth. Meanwhile, here are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes, including: Overweight or obesity. High distribution of abdominal fat. Inactive lifestyle and rarely doing activities or exercising. History of type 2 diabetes in the family. Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans have higher rates of disease compared to whites. Age over 45 years, although it is possible that it can occur before the age of 45 years. Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. History of diabetes during pregnancy. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is characterized by irregular menstruation, excessive hair growth, and obesity. Causes of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) Normal blood sugar levels are less than 100 mg/dL. If blood sugar levels have reached 100-125 mg/dL, it means you have entered prediabetes status. Meanwhile, blood sugar levels that reach 126 mg/dL and above are classified as diabetes. High blood sugar levels are known as hyperglycemia. Basically, hyperglycemia is a condition when blood sugar levels increase or are excessive. Meanwhile, diabetes is a disease that is mostly influenced by hyperglycemia. The cause of high blood sugar from diabetes occurs due to disorders in the body. Because this condition makes the body unable to use blood glucose into cells. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood. In type 1 diabetes, this disorder occurs because the immune system, which usually attacks viruses or other harmful bacteria, attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells. As a result, the body lacks or cannot even produce insulin so that the sugar that should be converted into energy by insulin causes a buildup of sugar in the blood. While in type 2 diabetes, the body can produce insulin normally. However, insulin cannot be used normally by the body. This condition is also known as insulin resistance. Diagnosis of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) The doctor will diagnose this condition in a person by conducting a medical interview. Then, the doctor will also check the glucose levels in a blood test. There are three types of tests that doctors can use to measure blood glucose levels, namely: 1. Fasting blood glucose test For this test, people with diabetes need not eat or drink anything except water (fasting). This fasting is for at least eight hours before the test. Because food can greatly affect blood sugar, this test allows the doctor to see baseline blood sugar. 2. Random blood glucose test This examination can be done randomly by diabetics. Even when you are fasting. 3. A1c This test, also known as HbA1C or glycated hemoglobin test, aims to show a person\u2019s average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. 4. Oral glucose tolerance test In this test, the doctor will measure blood glucose levels after fasting overnight. Then the diabetic will drink a sweet drink. Later, the patient\u2019s blood glucose levels are checked at one, two and three o\u2019clock. In addition, the doctor will also perform blood and urine tests to distinguish whether someone has type 1 or 2 diabetes. Later, the blood will be checked for autoantibodies (autoimmune signs that the body\u2019s immune system is attacking itself). Meanwhile, urine will be checked for ketones (a sign that a person\u2019s body is burning fat as an energy supply). Diabetes Treatment Treatment will be adjusted to the type of diabetes you have. Insulin therapy is one of the treatments that can be done by sufferers of this condition, both type 1 and type 2. In fact, in fairly severe cases of type 1 diabetes, pancreas transplantation may be an option to treat damage to the pancreas. Meanwhile, people with type 2 diabetes will be given several types of medication. However, generally, there are several treatments that must be done to reduce the risk of diabetes, such as: 1. Implement a healthy diet If you have diabetes, you should adjust your diet to a healthy one. Focus on your intake of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Hibiscus Tea",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Hibiscus Tea: Hibiscus, a flowering plant that thrives in warmer climates, produces deep red flowers with a sweet and tart cranberry-like flavor. The part of the hibiscus plant used for making tea is known as the calyx. It protects and supports the flower.Hibiscus has cultural significance in many parts of the world and is generally used in food and traditional medicine. It has been used to treat a wide range of conditions for centuries, including high blood pressure, indigestion, and obesity. Modern science also suggests that there may be other health benefits to using the hibiscus plant, including lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight management. However, more research is required to confirm these findings.5 Health Benefits of Peppermint TeaFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of hibiscus tea.1. Prevents Disease: The Hibiscus plant is rich in many antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, Vitamin C, and anthocyanin. These antioxidants help the body fight off harmful molecules called free radicals. Free radicals are linked to several different diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Although the body's antioxidants fight against the free radical damage, antioxidant-rich foods can also help prevent disease.2. Reduces Inflammation: The anti-inflammatory properties of hibiscus have been demonstrated in several animal and human investigations. Numerous disorders, including cancer, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, are caused by inflammation. It appears that hibiscus may have anti-inflammatory properties, however, more research is required to reach a definitive conclusion.5 Health Benefits of Ginger Tea3. Lowers Blood Pressure: High blood pressure, affecting nearly half of all adults in the United States can lead to severe health issues such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated that drinking hibiscus tea can lower blood pressure in humans. However, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health cautions that hibiscus and other herbal remedies only modestly reduce blood pressure and cannot substitute medications for individuals diagnosed with high blood pressure.4. Lowers Cholesterol: High cholesterol affects millions of adults and can lead to serious health issues such as heart attack and stroke. Although some clinical studies have shown that hibiscus may lower cholesterol levels, others have shown little to no effect. While hibiscus tea may help maintain healthy cholesterol levels, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness.5 Health Benefits of Chamomile Tea5. Promotes Weight Loss: Numerous studies indicate that hibiscus extract, which is more concentrated than hibiscus tea, has a good effect on weight loss, which may help avoid obesity. There isn't any proof, though, that hibiscus tea has the same effect.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Keto Diet Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What Is The Keto Diet? The keto or ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet. This type of diet is useful as a medical treatment and is an effective option for short-term weight loss. This diet has been linked to the treatment of epilepsy. In fact, ketogenic diets can help reduce seizures in people with epilepsy, especially in children who do not respond to medication. The mechanism is not fully understood, but this low-carb, high-fat diet is said to change activity in the brain. Effects that are felt include reducing sensitivity to stimuli that cause seizures. When undergoing a diet, the body produces ketone compounds as the main source. This compound has a protective effect on the body against seizures due to epilepsy. In addition, the keto diet also helps control blood sugar levels and improves mood stability. These conditions also contribute to seizure control. However, further research is needed to confirm these benefits. Benefits of the Keto Diet for Body Health You need to know that the keto diet should not be done long-term by healthy people. However, in general, this type of diet offers a number of benefits, including: 1. Lose weight A study entitled Ketogenic diet for weight loss and its implications on health: A literature study in ResearchGate states that ketogenic is a popular diet pattern for losing weight. The method is by limiting carbohydrate intake to 50 grams per day. This diet is quite effective in helping to lose weight in the short term. The duration itself is less than 6 months. 2. The keto diet is good for people with diabetes and prediabetes Diabetes presents with symptoms such as metabolic changes, high blood sugar, and impaired insulin function. Following a keto diet can help manage these symptoms. This is because the diet helps eliminate excess fat associated with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome. A study in the ACP Journals found that the keto diet can improve insulin sensitivity by up to 75 percent. Additionally, another study in the Journal of Diabetes Research conducted research on women with type 2 diabetes. The study found that following a keto diet for about 90 days significantly reduced hemoglobin A1C levels, a measure of long-term blood sugar management. 3. Reduces the risk of heart disease The keto diet is a diet that increases the intake of healthy fats. This method can reduce the risk of heart disease by improving risk factors. For example, reducing blood pressure, body fat, and blood sugar. A study entitled Effects of ketogenic diets on Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Evidence from Animal and Human Studies in Nutrients states that ketogenic is a useful diet pattern for improving several components of metabolic syndrome. The syndrome causes sufferers to experience a group of health problems simultaneously, one of which is heart disease. By reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome, the potential for heart disease can also be reduced. 4. The keto diet can reduce the intensity of Parkinson\u2019s symptoms. Parkinson\u2019s is a nervous system imbalance disorder that interferes with the body\u2019s ability to control balance and movement. One of the symptoms is slowed body movement. A study in PubMed Central found that the keto diet may help improve symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, more research is needed on these benefits. 5. Other health benefits In addition, following a healthy ketogenic diet can also provide health protection benefits for the body against the following conditions: Cancer. Experts are currently exploring diet as an additional treatment for cancer, as they suspect that diet may help slow tumor growth. Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The keto diet is also said to help reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and slow its progression. Epilepsy. Studies have shown that this diet also plays a role in reducing seizures in children with epilepsy. Polycystic ovary syndrome. Following a ketogenic diet may help reduce insulin levels, which may play a role in polycystic ovary syndrome. However, further research is needed to determine the benefits of the keto diet for these medical conditions. It is always best to discuss the best treatment with a nutritionist. Foods to Eat During the Keto Diet When on a keto diet, you should include fat in every meal.

Refined sugar. Included in beverages, such as cola, soda, artificial sweeteners, sugar, honey, and alcohol. Snacks, especially those high in preservatives and containing artificial sweeteners. In addition, you must also avoid high-protein foods, acidic foods, and foods that contain alkaline. How to Start a Keto Diet? Unfortunately, many people still mistake the keto diet with carbs. Both are similar, but not the same. Find out the difference through the article Similar but Not the Same, Here\u2019s the Difference Between the Carb and Keto Diets. If you\u2019re just starting a ketogenic diet, here are some things to keep in mind: 1. Pay attention to your intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. First, you have to limit your carbohydrate intake, consume moderate amounts of protein, and consume high amounts of fat per day. This makes the body burn fat as its main fuel source and break it down into \u2018ketones\u2019 in a process called ketosis. A person on a keto diet should consume 20 grams to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day, or less. For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates is equivalent to 2 slices of bread and a banana. The reason is that carbohydrates make up about a tenth of the daily kilojoule intake on the keto diet. This way, the body remains in a constant state of ketosis. A kilojoule itself is a measure of how much energy the body gets from food. 2. Maintain body intake Ketosis is a condition where the body lacks carbohydrate intake to be converted into energy. When experiencing ketosis, the kidneys will work harder to remove more fluids and electrolytes. Therefore, make sure to consume sodium and potassium intake, and drink plenty of water while on the keto diet. 3. Pay attention to the duration of the keto diet How long is the keto diet actually? This type of diet is good for you to do in the short term, namely for 2 to 3 months. The maximum limit is 6 to 12 months. The practice not only reduces body weight but also improves health. If you are just starting to try this diet, induction is the first phase that you must go through. The method is, stop eating at 8 pm and eat again the next day at 12 noon. This induction phase lasts for 7 days. 4. Discipline in implementing the keto diet Don\u2019t forget, make sure you are disciplined and consistent in following this diet. Pay attention to all the rules, including reducing carbohydrate and sugar intake. If you continue to consume carbohydrate and sugar intake, then the diet will not work. This is because fat in the body cannot be transmitted into energy. 5. The emergence of keto flu symptoms When in the induction phase, keto dieters may experience keto flu. This condition appears with symptoms of weakness and dizziness. The disorder occurs because the body is adjusting to the loss of carbohydrates. Later, the body will start to get used to burning fat as an energy source. 6. Pay attention to health history If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, gallbladder problems, or other chronic illnesses, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting a keto diet. 7. Write a food menu During the induction phase, you should only include 20 grams of carbohydrates in your body. As for fat intake, you can get it from beef, chicken, turkey, and steak, not processed foods such as sausages, nuggets, and meatballs. 8. Pay attention to protein intake The standard protein requirement is normally around 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. Meanwhile, keto dieters need a higher protein intake. The amount is around 1.5 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. 9. Pay attention to calorie intake In addition to high protein, you also have to pay attention to your calorie intake. Usually, the number of calories your body needs is around 2,000 kilocalories with a composition of 55 to 60 percent fat from the total food you consume. Note that calorie intake should not exceed the recommended limit, because it can increase fat stores in the body. Similar to protein, the body will store excess fat in the form of lipoproteins. 10. Avoid eating starchy vegetables Next, avoid consuming starchy vegetables. This includes potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, and beans. This step aims to keep participants in a state of ketosis. 11. Increase your egg intake Eggs are one of the best foods for keto dieters. This type of food is high in protein and contains healthy fats that can support the weight loss process. However, pay attention to how to process it. You can fry it with olive oil that contains healthy fats. In addition, you can also boil it and make it as a salad or sandwich topping. 12. Cook your own food By cooking your own food, you will not consume excessive carbohydrates. You are free to reduce or increase the right intake so that the diet gives optimal results. 13. Know the side effects The side effects of undergoing a keto diet that may occur are not limited to keto flu. You are also at risk of experiencing digestive disorders, such as bloating, constipation, and frequent farting. These problems arise because the body\u2019s fiber intake is not met. 14. Be patient to get the results During the first week, your body will experience effects that may make you uncomfortable. For example, dizziness and weakness. However, the process will be visible for several weeks afterward. So, be patient to get maximum results. Who Can\u2019t Do The Keto Diet? Although effective in helping to lose weight, there are groups of people who should not do this diet, including: 1. People with cardiovascular risk Ketogenic is done by consuming high-fat foods. This is dangerous for groups of people with a history of cardiovascular problems. Because this diet can increase the risk of heart failure. 2. Pregnant women Pregnant women who only consume certain foods are at risk of experiencing nutritional deficiencies that are useful for fetal growth and development. Not only that, this diet can also cause babies to be born with low birth weight. 3. People with digestive disorders Ketogenic is a low-fiber diet. This diet is certainly not suitable for people with digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The impact can range from nutritional deficiencies to decreased quality of life. 4. People at risk of osteoporosis The ketogenic process in the body also causes a decrease in bone mineral levels. This can certainly increase the risk of osteoporosis which triggers bone fractures, thus reducing the quality of life of sufferers. 5. People with diabetes Ketogenic can indeed help control blood sugar and insulin levels. However, this diet pattern is not suitable for sufferers who are undergoing insulin treatment. This is because this process can cause a drastic decrease in blood sugar which can be fatal. Is Keto Diet Safe for Health? This diet is generally safe for most healthy people. However, some people may experience some side effects at first, especially as their bodies adjust. Some side effects of the keto diet are: Lack of energy. Poor mental function. Sleep disorders. Nauseous. Digestion feels uncomfortable. Decreased physical performance. These effects are temporary and may subside over time. However, if you follow the keto diet long-term, side effects can include: Low protein in the blood. Excess fat in the liver. Kidney stones. Micronutrient deficiencies. To avoid this, you can try a low-carb diet regularly for the first few weeks. This will make your body burn more fat before you completely eliminate carbohydrates. In addition, the keto diet can also change the body\u2019s water and mineral balance. So, try adding extra salt to your food or taking a mineral supplement. When you first start the keto diet, you may want to eat until you are full and avoid restricting your calories too strictly. Usually, the keto diet can help you lose weight without having to intentionally restrict calories.",

        "title": "Bell\u2019s Palsy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Bell\u2019s Palsy? Bell\u2019s palsy is a temporary weakness that occurs on one side of the facial muscles. The side of the face affected by Bell\u2019s palsy will usually appear to droop. Generally, this condition occurs in pregnant women, people with diabetes, and HIV. This nerve condition is often misunderstood as cerebral palsy, or the meaning is often confused. In fact, Bell\u2019s palsy and cerebral palsy are two different conditions. Bell\u2019s palsy is a condition where damaged nerves in the face affect the sense of taste and the way the body produces tears and saliva. Bell\u2019s palsy usually comes on suddenly and gets better within a few weeks. Meanwhile, cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect muscle movement and coordination. The condition occurs due to damage to the immature and developing brain, and most often occurs before birth. In many cases, cerebral palsy also affects vision, hearing, and sensation. Bell\u2019s palsy will cause one-half of the face to appear to droop. Smiles can only be done on one side, and the eye on the affected side refuses to close. This condition is also known as acute peripheral facial paralysis, the cause of which is unknown, and can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown, but many experts believe the condition is the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Or it may be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. Bells Palsy Symptoms Bell palsy causes different symptoms in each sufferer. Symptoms of paralysis that occur on one side of the face can be divided into two types, namely: Partial paralysis (mild muscle weakness). Total paralysis (no movement at all, but this is very rare). Bell\u2019s palsy also affects the sufferer\u2019s mouth and eyelids, making it difficult for these two parts to open and close. The following are the symptoms of Bell\u2019s palsy that you need to know: Ear pain on the paralyzed side of the face. The affected ear will be more sensitive to sound. Ringing in one or both ears. Decreased or changed sense of taste. The affected part of the mouth will drool easily. Mouth feels dry. Pain around the jaw. Headache and dizziness. Difficulty eating, drinking, and speaking. Bell\u2019s palsy is a disorder that occurs in the muscles and nerves of the face, so this condition does not impact the performance of the brain and other parts of the body. If paralysis on one side of the face is also accompanied by paralysis in other parts of the body, the sufferer really needs serious treatment from a doctor. Risk Factors A link was found between migraines and weakness in the face and limbs. A 2015 study revealed that people who suffer from migraines may be at higher risk of developing Bell\u2019s Palsy. In addition, Bell\u2019s Palsy is more common in: People aged 15-60 years. Those who have diabetes or upper respiratory disease. Pregnant women, especially in the third trimester. Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold Recurrent attacks of Bell\u2019s palsy are rare. However, in some cases, there is a family history of recurrent attacks, suggesting the possibility of a genetic predisposition to Bell\u2019s palsy. Causes of Bells Palsy Until now, experts do not know for sure the cause of Bell\u2019s Palsy. However, they suspect that this condition occurs because the nerves that control the facial muscles are compressed or disturbed. In addition, the cause of paralysis occurs due to inflammation of a viral infection, one of which is the herpes virus. You need to know that Bell\u2019s palsy has nothing to do with stroke. Here are some causes of Bell\u2019s palsy on the face: Injuries due to accidents occur due to lacerations to the chin or cracks in the skull. Hereditary facial paralysis, this condition occurs in children who are born with weakness or paralysis of the face. Surgical injury, this condition usually occurs during parotid gland surgery. Meanwhile, several viral infectious diseases that are suspected of being related to Bell\u2019s palsy are: Herpes simplex. Chickenpox and shingles. Infectious mononucleosis (epstein-barr). Cytomegalovirus infection. Respiratory disease (adenovirus). German measles (rubella). Mumps (mumps virus). Flu (flu B). Coxsackievirus. According to the US National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, many experts believe that something can trigger a dormant viral infection, essentially awakening and triggering Bell\u2019s palsy. If you are stressed or have recently been sick, those can be potential triggers. So can recent physical trauma or even lack of sleep. Autoimmune conditions can also be other triggers. The facial nerve reacts to the infection by swelling, which can cause pressure on the bony (fallopian) canal through which the facial nerve passes to the side of the face. Inflammation of the facial nerve can reduce blood flow and oxygen to the nerve cells. Damage to these cranial nerves and nerve cells can lead to paralysis of the facial muscles. In most cases of Bell\u2019s palsy, paralysis on one side of the face can usually recover completely. Therefore, it is best to contact a doctor to understand the condition experienced. Diagnosis The American Medical Association (AMA) states that treatment is more effective when given early. Therefore, sufferers are advised to visit a doctor immediately after experiencing symptoms. Diagnosing Bell\u2019s Palsy is a process of elimination. Doctors will look for other conditions that cause facial paralysis, such as a tumor, Lyme disease, or stroke. The medical staff will also examine the sufferer\u2019s head, neck, and ears. The doctor will also assess the facial muscles to determine if any nerves other than the facial nerve are affected. If the diagnosis is still uncertain, the doctor will refer the sufferer to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist or otolaryngologist. Here are the tests you can do to diagnose Bell\u2019s palsy: Electromyography (EMG): This procedure can be done by placing electrodes on the sufferer\u2019s face. The machine will then measure the electrical activity of nerves and the electrical activity of muscles in response to stimulation. This test is useful for determining the level of nerve damage, as well as its location. MRI, CT Scan, or X-ray. These tests are good for determining whether there is another underlying condition, such as a bacterial infection, skull fracture, or tumor. Blood tests to check for bacterial or viral infections. Bells Palsy Treatment To reduce swelling in the facial nerve, sufferers can use prednisolone or prednisone (a group of corticosteroid drugs). Meanwhile, to prevent problems arising in the eyes that cannot close, sufferers usually need eye drops. About 70 percent of people with Bell\u2019s palsy recover. Most will start to improve within two to three weeks. However, it can take up to 10 months to fully recover depending on the extent of nerve damage. If a specific cause of Bell\u2019s palsy can be identified by your doctor, such as an infection, that cause will be treated. If not, symptoms will be treated as needed. One of the treatments that doctors recommend for Bell\u2019s palsy is to protect the eyes from drying out at night or when working in front of a computer screen. Eye care includes eye drops during the day, ointments at bedtime, or keeping the room humid at night. These treatments help protect the cornea from being scratched, which is essential for the management of Bell\u2019s palsy. The doctor may also prescribe other treatments for the sufferer\u2019s condition based on the severity of symptoms and medical history. Other treatment options include: Steroids to reduce inflammation. Antiviral drugs. Analgesics to relieve pain. Physical therapy to stimulate the facial nerve. In addition to the above treatments, learn about therapies to treat Bell\u2019s Palsy. Bells Palsy Prevention Start a healthy lifestyle by eating high-fiber foods and exercising regularly. In addition, do regular health checks. Bells Palsy Complications Bell\u2019s Palsy usually resolves within a short period of time and does not cause long-term complications. However, during the illness, most people with Bell\u2019s Palsy are unable to close their eye on the affected side of their face. That is why it is very important to prevent dry eyes at night or when working on a computer. The eye care you need is eye drops during the day, ointment at bedtime, or making the room humid at night. These methods can help protect the cornea from being scratched. Other complications of Bell\u2019s palsy can include: Permanent damage to the facial nerve. A person may have synkinesis, a condition in which moving one part of the face causes another part to move without the person realizing it. For example, your eyes close when you smile. Partial or complete blindness in the eye that will not close due to excessive dryness, and scratches on the protective membrane of the eye (cornea).",

        "text": "What is Cerebral Palsy? Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect movement and muscle coordination. In many cases, cerebral palsy also affects vision, hearing, and sensation. This condition occurs due to damage to the immature and developing brain, and most often occurs before birth (during pregnancy). However, cerebral palsy can also occur during the birth process, or in the first year after birth. In general, cerebral palsy causes movement disorders associated with excessive reflexes, spasticity or flexibility of the limbs and body. In addition, other signs include unusual postures, unintentional movements, unsteady walking, or a combination of all of these. Cerebral Palsy Symptoms The signs and symptoms of this disease can vary greatly from person to person. Cerebral palsy can affect the entire body, or be limited primarily to one or two limbs, or one side of the body. Common signs and symptoms include problems with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues. The following is an explanation of the symptoms of cerebral palsy from a number of aspects: `1. Symptoms in movement and coordination Stiff muscles and excessive reflexes (spasticity), the most common movement disorder. Variations in muscle tone, such as being too stiff or too floppy. Stiff muscles with normal reflexes (rigidity). Lack of balance and muscle coordination (ataxia). Tremors or involuntary, jerky movements. Slow, wriggling movements. Favoring one side of the body, such as reaching with only one hand or dragging a foot while crawling. Difficulty walking, such as walking on toes, a crouched gait, a scissor-like gait with crossed knees, a wide-legged gait, or an asymmetrical gait. Difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes or picking up utensils. 2. Symptoms when talking and eating Delay in speech development. Difficulty speaking. Difficulty with sucking, chewing, or eating. Excessive salivation or difficulty swallowing. Developmental Disorders. Delays in reaching motor skill milestones, such as sitting or crawling. Learning difficulties. Intellectual disability. Delayed growth, resulting in smaller than expected size. 3. Other issues Brain damage can cause other neurological problems, such as: Seizures ( epilepsy ). Difficulty hearing. Problems with vision and abnormal eye movements. Abnormal touch or painful sensations. Bladder and bowel problems, especially in children with cerebral palsy are more susceptible to bladder stones. Mental health conditions, such as emotional disorders and behavioral problems. The brain disorder that causes this condition does not change over time, so symptoms usually do not get worse with age. However, as the child gets older, some symptoms become more or less obvious. Muscle shortening and muscle stiffness can worsen if not treated promptly. Cerebral Palsy Risk Factors There are a number of factors that can put a baby at increased risk of cerebral palsy, including: Premature birth (birth before reaching 37 weeks of gestation). Low birth weight (less than 2.5 kilograms). Breech birth occurs when the baby\u2019s bottom or legs come out first Rh incompatibility, which occurs when the Rh type of the pregnant parents\u2019 blood does not match the Rh type of their baby\u2019s blood. Negative habits in mothers during pregnancy. For example, smoking, drinking alcohol or using drugs. The birth of twins or more (triplets), especially when one baby survives and the other dies at birth. Causes of Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy occurs due to abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain. This usually occurs before the child is born, but can also occur at birth or in early infancy. In many cases, the cause of cerebral palsy is unknown. Many factors can cause problems with brain development, including: Gene mutations that result in genetic abnormalities or differences in brain development. Maternal infection that affects the developing fetus. Fetal stroke, a disruption of blood supply to the developing brain. Bleeding into the brain in the womb or during birth. An infection in a baby that causes inflammation in or around the brain. Traumatic head injuries in infants, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or physical abuse. Lack of oxygen to the brain is associated with difficult labor or delivery, although birth-related asphyxia is a much less common cause than historically thought. Diagnosis Cerebral Palsy A doctor will diagnose cerebral palsy by taking a complete medical history, performing a physical examination that includes a detailed neurological exam, and evaluating the symptoms. In addition, to support the diagnosis, the doctor can also perform additional tests such as: Electroencephalogram (EEG). Aims to evaluate electrical activity in the brain. MRI. The purpose of this examination is to identify brain irregularities or injuries. CT scan. A CT scan creates clear cross-sectional images of the brain. It can also reveal brain damage. Ultrasonography (USG). Cranial ultrasound is a method of using high-frequency sound waves to obtain basic images of a young baby\u2019s brain. Blood tests. Aim to rule out other conditions, such as bleeding disorders. If a doctor confirms a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, they may refer the person to a specialist who can test for neurological problems. Neurological examination can detect: Vision loss and disturbances, such as blurred vision in one or both eyes. Deaf condition. Speech delay. Intellectual disability. Movement disorders. Cerebral Palsy Treatment Children and adults with cerebral palsy require lifelong care with a medical care team. In addition to a pediatrician or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist (physiotherapist), and a pediatric neurologist to oversee the child\u2019s medical care, the team includes a variety of therapists and mental health specialists. Remember, there is no cure for cerebral palsy. However, there are many cerebral palsy treatment options that can help improve a person\u2019s daily functioning, including: 1. Medicines Medications that can reduce muscle tension can be used to improve functional ability, treat pain, and manage complications related to spasticity or other cerebral palsy symptoms. Muscle or nerve injections. To treat certain muscle tightening, your doctor may recommend injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), or other agents. You may need to repeat the injections every three months. Oral muscle relaxants. Medications such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, or dantrolene are often recommended by doctors to relax the muscles. Medications to reduce saliva. One option is Botox injections into the salivary glands. 2. Therapy Various therapies play an important role in treating cerebral palsy: Physical Therapy Exercise and muscle training can help a child\u2019s strength, flexibility, balance, motor development, and mobility. Parents will also learn how to safely care for their child\u2019s daily needs at home, such as bathing and feeding the child. For the first 1 to 2 years after birth, both physical and occupational therapists work on issues such as head and trunk control, rolling over, and grasping. Then, both types of therapists are involved in the wheelchair assessment. Braces, splints or other supportive devices may be recommended for your child to help with function, such as improving walking and stretching stiff muscles. Speech and Language Therapy A speech-language pathologist can help improve a child\u2019s ability to speak clearly or communicate using sign language. They can also teach you how to use communication devices, such as computers and voice synthesizers if communication is difficult for you. Speech therapists can also address feeding and swallowing difficulties. Recreational Therapy Some children benefit from regular recreational or competitive or adaptive sports, such as therapeutic horseback riding or skiing. This type of therapy can help improve a child\u2019s motor skills, speech, and emotional well-being. Both adults and children benefit from regular physical activity and exercise for general health and fitness. 3. Operating Procedure Surgery may be necessary to reduce muscle tension or correct bone deformities caused by spasticity. This treatment includes: Orthopedic Surgery. Children with severe contractures or deformities may require surgery on the bones or joints to place their arms, spine, hips, or legs in the correct position. Cutting Nerve Fibers. If other treatments don\u2019t help, the surgeon will cut the nerves that serve certain spastic muscles. One procedure that the doctor may perform is a selective dorsal rhizotomy. This relaxes the leg muscles and reduces pain, but can cause numbness. 4. Other Treatments If necessary, your doctor may recommend medications and other treatments to treat some of the symptoms. Medication may be recommended to treat seizures, pain, osteoporosis, mental health conditions, and problems with sleep, oral health, eating and nutrition, bladder incontinence, vision, or hearing. Cerebral Palsy Prevention You can\u2019t prevent most cases of cerebral palsy, but you can reduce your risk. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you can take the following steps to maintain your health and minimize pregnancy complications: Get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated against diseases, such as rubella, preferably before becoming pregnant, can prevent infections that can cause fetal brain damage. Get regular pregnancy checkups. Visiting your doctor regularly can help prevent premature birth, low birth weight, and infections. Avoid certain intakes. For example, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. Because some of these substances have been associated with the risk of cerebral palsy. Practice good public safety. Prevent head injuries in children by providing appropriate protection and supervision. For example, ensuring that children wear helmets when riding bicycles. Cerebral Palsy Complications Without proper treatment, people with cerebral palsy are at risk of experiencing complications, such as: Communication difficulties, such as speech and language disorders. Spinal problems, such as scoliosis, lordosis (swayback) and kyphosis (hunchback). Osteoarthritis. It is pressure on the joints or abnormal joint alignment due to muscle spasticity. If you want to know more about this disease. Contractures occur when muscles become locked in a painful position. Osteopenia, or poor bone density that can make bones break easily. Dental problems. Incontinence. When to See a Doctor? It is important to get a proper diagnosis for any movement disorder or developmental delay in your child. See a neurologist if you have concerns about symptoms of loss of awareness of surroundings or unusual body or muscle movements, impaired coordination, difficulty swallowing, eye muscle imbalance, or other developmental problems.",

        "title": "Epilepsy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a condition that can cause someone to have repeated seizures. Epilepsy can attack someone when there is damage or changes in the brain. In the human brain, there are neurons or nerve cells that are part of the nervous system. Each nerve cell communicates with each other using electrical impulses. In cases of epilepsy, seizures occur when these electrical impulses are produced excessively, causing uncontrolled behavior or body movements. In fact, epilepsy can happen to anyone. This disease can affect people of all ages and all genders. According to WHO, around 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological diseases in the world. Symptoms of Epilepsy Recurrent seizures are the main symptom of epilepsy. The characteristics of the seizures will vary and depend on which part of the brain is first affected and how far the damage has progressed. Types of epileptic seizures are divided into two based on the disturbance in the brain, namely: 1. Partial seizures In partial or focal seizures, only part of the brain is affected. These partial seizures are divided into two categories, namely: Simple partial seizures This is a seizure in which the sufferer does not experience loss of consciousness. Symptoms can include jerking limbs, or tingling sensations, dizziness, and flashes of light. The part of the body that experiences seizures depends on which part of the brain is affected. For example, if epilepsy disrupts the brain function that controls hand or foot movement, then only those two limbs will experience seizures. Partial seizures can also cause sufferers to experience emotional changes, such as feeling suddenly happy or afraid. Complex partial seizures Sometimes, focal seizures affect the sufferer\u2019s awareness, making them appear confused or semi-conscious for a few moments. This is called a complex partial seizure. Other characteristics of a complex partial seizure are blank stares, swallowing, chewing, or rubbing hands. 2. Generalized seizures In generalized or generalized seizures, symptoms occur throughout the body and are caused by a disorder that affects all parts of the brain. The following are symptoms that can occur when someone has a generalized seizure: Eyes open during seizure. Tonic seizures. The body becomes stiff for a few seconds. This may be accompanied by rhythmic movements of the arms and legs or nothing at all. The muscles in the body, especially the arms, legs, and back, twitch. Atonic seizures, where the body\u2019s muscles suddenly relax, causing the sufferer to fall uncontrollably. Clonic seizures, which are rhythmic jerking movements that usually affect the muscles of the neck, face, and arms. Sometimes, people with epilepsy make noises or scream during a seizure. Bedwetting. Difficulty breathing for a while, so the body looks pale or even blue. In some cases, a generalized seizure leaves the sufferer completely unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the sufferer appears confused for several minutes or hours. There is a type of epilepsy that is commonly experienced by children, known as absence epilepsy or petit mal. Although this condition is not dangerous, the child\u2019s academic performance and concentration can be disrupted. The characteristics of this epilepsy are loss of consciousness for a few seconds, blinking or moving the lips, and a blank stare. Children who experience these seizures will not be aware or remember what happened during the seizure. Epilepsy Risk Factors Several factors that can potentially increase the risk of developing epilepsy include: Age. Epilepsy is generally experienced by children and the elderly. However, this condition can also be experienced by all groups who are at risk of developing epilepsy. Genetics. A family history of health problems can be a trigger for epilepsy. Head injury. Head injury can be one of the causes of epilepsy. Stroke and vascular disease. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can cause brain damage that can trigger this condition. Dementia. Brain infection. Inflammation of the brain or spinal cord can increase the risk of developing epilepsy. History of seizures in childhood. Seizures can be caused by high fever. In this condition, children are more susceptible to epilepsy. Causes of Epilepsy Epilepsy can start at any age, generally this condition occurs since childhood. Based on the cause, epilepsy is divided into two, namely: Idiopathic epilepsy, also known as primary epilepsy. This is a type of epilepsy that has no known cause. Some experts suspect that this condition is caused by genetic factors (hereditary). Symptomatic epilepsy, also called secondary epilepsy. This is a type of epilepsy that has a known cause. A number of factors, such as severe head injury, brain tumors, and strokes are thought to cause secondary epilepsy. Apart from the causes above, there are several other causes including: Immune disorders. Conditions that cause the immune system to attack brain cells, called autoimmune diseases, can cause epilepsy. Developmental disorders. Birth defects that affect the brain are often the cause of epilepsy, especially in people whose seizures are not controlled with anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis of Epilepsy The steps taken before the doctor makes a diagnosis include a physical examination, recording your medical history, asking about your activities, and possibly asking you to have a blood test. Your doctor may also ask about your symptoms during your seizure and ask you or your family if you experience any of the following during your seizure: Brain jerk. Muscle stiffness. Urinating or defecating during a seizure. Changes in breathing. Skin color becomes pale. Blank stare. Loss of consciousness. Difficulty speaking or understanding what people are saying to you. In addition, doctors also perform several tests to find out how the brain is performing by checking: How to walk. Muscle. Sensitivity. Thinking ability. Next, the doctor will recommend the following tests, if you are suspected of having epilepsy, such as: EEG or electroencephalogram. This is a test to find out the problem of electrical activity in the brain. Blood tests. These tests are useful for detecting signs of infection and other health problems. Epilepsy Treatment Although epilepsy cannot be cured, there are many treatment options available. As many as 70 percent of epilepsy sufferers can manage their disease with medication. There are several treatments to control epilepsy ranging from taking anti-seizure drugs, special diets, to surgery. Consumption of anti-seizure drugs This medication can control seizures in about 60 to 70 percent of people with epilepsy. Your doctor may prescribe one or more anti-seizure medications, a dose of medication, or a combination of medications to find the best medication to control your seizures. The choice of anti-seizure medication also depends on several things, such as: Types of seizures. Previous response to anti-seizure medications. Other medical conditions you have. Potential interactions with other drugs currently being taken. Side effects of anti-seizure drugs. Age. Overall health condition. This is because some anti-seizure medications have been linked to birth defects. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Special diet The ketogenic diet and the Atkins diet (a diet high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates) are two of the most common diets sometimes recommended for people with epilepsy. Most diets are recommended for children whose medical treatment is ineffective and whose condition does not allow for surgery. A low glycemic index diet may also reduce seizures in some people with epilepsy. Operation Your doctor may consider surgery if anti-seizure medication does not control your seizures and your seizures get worse. Epilepsy surgery can be a safe and effective treatment option when more than two trials of anti-seizure medications have failed to control seizures. Epilepsy surgery options include: Surgical resection. Removal of abnormal tissue. Severance. Cutting of the bundle of fibers that connects areas of the brain. Stereotactic radiosurgery. Targeted destruction of abnormal brain tissue. Implantation of a neuromodulation device. This device sends electrical impulses to the brain to reduce seizures over time. Epilepsy Prevention Apart from medication, there are several ways that can be done to prevent epilepsy, such as: Drive safely This is done to prevent traumatic brain injury. Be careful when doing activities. For example, use a bicycle helmet when cycling and a motorcycle helmet when riding a motorbike, use a seat belt, and provide a child passenger seat. This is done to reduce motor vehicle and traffic injuries. Pay attention to the steps Falls are a major cause of brain injury. Older adults and children are more likely to suffer a brain injury from a fall. Treat injuries early Get help immediately if a traumatic brain injury occurs. The risk of epilepsy is high in severe brain injuries. Taking good care of injuries can help prevent epilepsy. Healthy lifestyle Eating healthy foods, exercising such as walking every day, and not smoking can prevent epilepsy. Apart from epilepsy, this healthy lifestyle can also reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease. Vaccine Immunization, also known as a vaccine, can reduce the chances of getting an infection which can sometimes cause epilepsy. Maintain cleanliness An infection called cysticercosis is the most common cause of epilepsy. This disease is caused by a parasite and can be prevented through good hygiene and food preparation practices. Health checks and early treatment of cysticercosis can prevent epilepsy. Maintaining health during pregnancy Several problems during pregnancy and childbirth can cause epilepsy. Follow a prenatal care plan with your obstetrician or nurse to keep yourself and your baby healthy. When to See a Doctor? You need to contact a doctor if you experience the following symptoms of epilepsy: The seizure lasted more than 5 minutes. Breathing or consciousness does not return after the seizure stops. The second seizure occurred soon after. High fever. Heat exhaustion. Is pregnant. Have diabetes. Injuring oneself during a seizure. Still having seizures despite taking anti-seizure medication. Having a seizure for the first time. While it may be uncertain whether or not you have had a seizure, it is always a good idea to see a doctor right away if you suspect something or someone tells you about behavior you are not aware of.",

        "text": "Bladder Stones Bladder stones or bladder calculi are stones that form from mineral deposits in the bladder. Everyone is actually at risk of having them. However, men over the age of 50 are at higher risk of experiencing it. Especially for men who have an enlarged prostate. As for bladder calculi, they can block the urinary tract and cause pain when urinating, difficulty urinating or not being able to urinate at all. If not treated immediately, these stones have the potential to cause infection and complications. Treatment of this condition usually requires medical assistance. However, if the stone is small, bladder calculi can come out with urine. Symptoms of Bladder Stones Some bladder calculi pass out of the body in the urine and do not cause any symptoms. However, large bladder stones can irritate the bladder and cause severe pain, bleeding, and problems urinating. Signs and symptoms include: Changes in urine color. The sufferer may have cloudy or dark urine or may see blood in the urine. Frequent urination. You may feel like you always need to urinate, even if you just went. Pain. With stones, there is usually pain or burning when urinating. You may also feel pain that comes and goes in the lower abdomen. In men, sometimes the pain will be felt in the penis or testicles. Stopping and starting. You may have trouble starting a urine stream, even when you really need to go. Sometimes the urine stream stops and starts (intermittent urination). Urinary tract infection. These stones can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). Symptoms of a UTI include frequent, painful urination and cloudy, smelly urine. However, you need to understand that bladder stones and urinary tract infections are two different conditions. Risk Factors for Bladder Stones Men, especially those over 50, are more likely to have bladder stones. Other conditions that can also increase the risk include: Obstruction of urine flow. Any condition that blocks the flow of urine from the bladder to the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, can lead to the formation of bladder calculi. There are several causes, but the most common is an enlarged prostate. Nerve damage. Stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, herniated disks, and a number of other problems can damage the nerves that control bladder function. A person is also at risk for nerve damage and conditions that cause bladder outlet obstruction. These conditions will further increase the risk of stones. Causes of Bladder Stones This condition can develop when the bladder does not empty completely. This condition causes the urine to become concentrated. Concentrated urine can crystallize and form stones. Some infections can cause bladder stones to form. Sometimes underlying conditions that affect the bladder\u2019s ability to hold, store, or excrete urine can also lead to the formation of bladder calculi. Any foreign material present in the bladder is likely to cause bladder stones. The most common conditions that cause this condition include: 1. Prostate Gland Enlargement An enlarged prostate ( benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) can cause bladder calculi in men. An enlarged prostate can block the flow of urine, preventing the bladder from emptying completely. 2. Damaged Nerves Normally, nerves carry messages from the brain to the bladder muscles, directing them to tighten or relax. If these nerves are damaged, either by stroke, spinal cord injury, or other health problems, the bladder may not empty completely. Another term for this condition is neurogenic bladder. 3. Inflammation of the bladder This condition sometimes occurs due to urinary tract infections or radiation therapy to the pelvis, can cause bladder calculi . 4. Use of medical devices The use of a bladder catheter through the urethra to help urine drain from the bladder can cause stones to form. So can objects that accidentally migrate into the bladder. Examples include contraceptive devices or urinary stents. Mineral crystals, which later become stones, tend to form on the surface of these devices. 5. Suffering from kidney stones Stones that form in the kidneys are not the same as bladder stones. But small kidney stones can travel down the ureter to the bladder and grow into stones. Bladder Stone Diagnosis To diagnose this disease, your doctor may need one or a combination of the following tests: Physical exam. The doctor may place his or her hand on the person\u2019s lower abdomen to feel for an enlarged bladder. Urine Test. Your doctor may need a urine sample to check for signs of blood, bacteria, and crystallized minerals. CT Scan. This scan combines several X-ray images to show internal organs in detail. In addition to detecting stones, CT scans can also be useful for detecting a number of other health problems. Ultrasonography. Produces images by bouncing sound off internal organs. Intravenous pyelogram. This procedure involves injecting a special fluid into a vein that will drain to the kidneys and bladder. The doctor will then use X-rays to look for signs of kidney stones. Bladder Stone Treatment If the size of the bladder stone is quite small, then treatment is sufficient by drinking 1200 milliliters of water per day. The goal is to help the stone pass naturally with urine. However, if the size is large enough, the doctor can perform the following medical procedures: Cystolitholapaxy. In this procedure, the doctor will crush the stones in the bladder into small pieces using a laser, ultrasound, or mechanical means. Once the stones are small, they will be easier to pass along with the urine. Surgery. This procedure may be an option if the stone is too large and too hard to pass by cystolitholapaxy. Bladder Stone Complications Although some cases of bladder are asymptomatic, it does not mean that you should take this health condition lightly. Because, without proper treatment, this condition can cause the following two main complications: Chronic bladder dysfunction. This condition is characterized by increased frequency of urination along with pain during urination. Sometimes, bladder calculi can completely block urine from leaving the body. Urinary tract infection. This infection can recur and therefore requires proper treatment. Because, if ignored, this condition is dangerous to health. Well, more complete information about the dangers, Bladder Stone Prevention Bladder stones are usually the result of an underlying condition that is difficult to prevent. However, anyone can reduce their chances of developing bladder stones by following these tips: Check for unusual urinary symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of prostate enlargement or other urological conditions can reduce the risk of developing these conditions. Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking more fluids, especially water, can help prevent stones from forming. This is because fluids dilute the concentration of minerals in the bladder. How much water you should drink will depend on your age, size, health, and activity level.",

        "text": "Urinary Tract Infection Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a condition when the urinary system experiences an infection. It can be in the ureter, kidney, bladder, and urethra. Generally, the infection attacks two parts, namely the urethra and the bladder. Although it can happen to anyone, this infection is more likely to occur in women. In addition, this infection can attack deeper parts and the most common one that occurs is a bladder infection (cystitis). Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections in Women and Men UTIs can cause the lining of the urinary tract to become red and inflamed (irritated). Some of the characteristics of UTI that can occur in men and women include: 1. Characteristics of Urinary Tract Infections in Women Symptoms of urinary tract infections in women can include: Pain or burning sensation when urinating. More frequent urination. Urine smells and has a different color than usual. Pelvic or lower abdominal pain. Feeling weak and unwell. Fever. Shivering. Bloody urine (hematuria). In girls, they tend to be restless or cry when urinating. 2. Characteristics of Urinary Tract Infections in Men Although more common in women, men can also experience urinary tract infections (UTIs) with the following symptoms: Pain or burning sensation when urinating. Difficulty urinating. Frequent urination. Pain in the lower abdomen or lower back. Urine smells and is colored differently than normal. Fever. A feeling of discomfort in the pelvic or genital area. Exhaustion. Intense pain. Risk Factors for Urinary Tract Infections General risk factors for urinary tract infections include: Have urinary tract abnormalities. Having a blockage in the urinary tract. Have a low immune system. Using a catheter. Having surgery or a urinary tract examination. This disease is more common in women, and many women experience it more than once during their lifetime. Several factors that increase the risk of this disease in women, namely: Sexually active. The anatomy of the female body has a shorter urethra than men. Using certain types of contraception. Already menopausal. Women who have the habit of wiping the genital area after urinating from back to front are also at risk of contracting this disease. This is because the urethra is located close to the anus which tends to have a lot of bacteria. Sexual intercourse can also cause bacteria to enter the urinary tract, apart from dirty habits after urinating. Therefore, cleaning the genital area after having sex is very important. Types of Urinary Tract Infections UTIs are divided into several types, depending on which part of the urinary tract is infected. Some common types are: Urethritis. Infection of the urethra, the hollow tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. Cystitis. A bacterial infection of the bladder that often spreads from the urethra. Pyelonephritis. This occurs in the kidneys, usually due to an infection that has spread to the urinary tract, or from a blockage in the urinary tract. Obstruction in the urinary tract causes urine to flow back into the ureters and kidneys. Causes of Urinary Tract Infections The cause of urinary tract infections is bacteria that infect one part of the urinary system. The type of bacteria that most often causes this infection is E. coli. However, there are several other types of bacteria that can also cause UTIs. Such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. This disease can occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and grow in the bladder. Although the urinary system works to prevent bacteria from entering through the urethra, sometimes it can still happen. Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection Some tests and procedures to diagnose urinary tract infections, namely: Urinalysis. Examination of a urine sample, looking for white blood cells, red blood cells, or bacteria. Urine Culture Examination. This is useful to determine the type of bacteria present, in order to determine the right treatment. Imaging tests. Such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, to see images of the urinary tract. Cystoscopy. An examination using a special instrument inserted through the urethra to look inside the bladder. Urinary Tract Infection Treatment The most common treatment for this disease is by administering antibiotics. This drug is able to kill bacteria, thereby eliminating the infection that occurs. However, make sure to finish the antibiotics according to the doctor\u2019s prescription so that the bacterial infection is resolved and the body does not become resistant to the drug later. In addition, it is also necessary to consume more water so that bacteria can be removed from the urinary tract system. So, Can Urinary Tract Infections Be Cured with Pipemidic Acid? If this condition recurs three times in a year or more, ask your doctor to recommend a specific treatment plan. Some treatment options that you can undergo include: Using low doses of antibiotics over a longer period to help prevent recurrent infections. Taking a single dose of antibiotics after intercourse, to prevent common triggers of infection. Take antibiotics for 1 or 2 days whenever you feel symptoms. So, if you experience bladder problems, contact this doctor immediately. Recommended Medications for Treating Urinary Tract Infections The following are recommended medications for treating urinary tract infections: Floxifar 500 mg 10 Caplets. Tablets containing the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin which are useful for treating infections in the urinary tract, bones and joints, and digestive tract. Scopma 10 mg 10 Caplets. Used to treat stomach pain or serious digestive disorders. Spasmolit 10 mg 10 Tablets. A hard drug that can be consumed based on doctor\u2019s instructions. This drug contains Hyoscine Butylbromide to treat digestive disorders such as paroxysmal pain in the stomach or small intestine. Tequinol 500 mg 10 Caplets . Can be consumed to treat severe infections caused by bacteria such as urinary tract infections, urethritis, and infections of the digestive tract and respiratory tract. Baquinor Forte 500 mg 10 Caplets . Antibiotics containing Ciprofloxacin are useful for treating infections of the urinary tract, skin and soft tissue, bones and joints, to acute osteomyelitis. Helixim Dry Syrup 30 ml. Is a type of antibiotic that contains Cefixime to treat urinary tract infections without complications. Cefspan Dry Syrup 30 ml. With Cefixime content, this drug is an antibiotic to treat urinary tract infections, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. Buscopan 10 mg 10 Tablets . Tablets containing Hyoscine-N-butyl bromide are useful for treating spastic disorders in the digestive tract, urinary tract, bile duct, and genital tract in women. Prive Uricran 10 Capsules . Supplements that contain multivitamins and Isoflavones that are useful for maintaining urinary tract health. Complications of Urinary Tract Infections Urinary tract infections that are not treated immediately can trigger urosepsis, a condition where bacteria in the infected kidney spread to the blood. This causes many bad effects, such as shock and even death. In addition, in some cases this disease can also cause: Premature birth, if this disease occurs in pregnant women. Permanent kidney damage if the bacteria spread to the kidneys. Narrowing of the urinary tract. Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections Here are some efforts to prevent urinary tract infections: Not holding urine. Always clean the genital area from front to back after urinating. Drink plenty of water. You should avoid feminine hygiene sprays, feminine fragrances, and other products for the feminine area because they will only irritate the mucosa. Clean the genital area before having sex. After intercourse, urinate. This is to remove any bacteria that may have entered the urethra. Don\u2019t wear underwear for days. Do not wear tight bottoms as they will increase humidity.",

        "text": "Health Benefits of Jasmine Rice: Jasmine rice is a popular variety of rice that is grown mostly in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It has a strong aroma that is caused by the production of natural compounds that are aromatic and have fragrance. The most important aromatic compound in jasmine rice is 2-acetyl-1-purroline.Jasmine rice is sticky in texture and has a slightly sweet taste. It is mostly eaten steamed or boiled because it is not suitable for frying as it can become sticky. Steamed jasmine rice is a good choice for curries and meat. In addition to being a popular form of rice, jasmine rice is also high in calories but has several health benefits. Let us read them below.5 Health Benefits of Brown RiceFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of jasmine rice.1. Promotes Healthy Pregnancy: Folic acid, a synthetic form of folate (Vitamin B9), is a vital nutrient for pregnant women. Consuming folic acid during pregnancy can help prevent neural tube defects in the baby, which are birth defects that affect the brain or spine. Folic acid also plays an important role in the proper growth of the baby's heart and blood vessels. Since jasmine rice is rich in folic acid, it can be a good choice for pregnant women looking to increase their intake of folic acid.2. Prevents Iron Deficiency: Iron plays an essential role in our body. It not only helps in the production of red blood cells but also strengthens the immune system. In addition, iron transports oxygen in the blood and produces energy. Lack of iron in the body can lead to many health issues, including anemia. Anemia is a condition in which patients suffer from fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and various other symptoms. Consuming jasmine rice in a daily diet may help prevent the deficiency of iron and the associated health problems.5 Health Benefits of Black Cumin (Kalonji)3.

        "text": "Sparkling water, also known as carbonated water or seltzer water, contains carbon dioxide bubbles. This gas can be natural or artificial. While it might not replace drinking water, sparkling water can be a refreshing and healthy alternative to soda.There are different types of sparkling water, each with its pros and cons. Some of the most popular include club soda, soda water, seltzer water, mineral water, and tonic water.While some forms of sparkling water exist naturally, others are prepared by adding carbon dioxide bubbles to still water. Nowadays, sparkling water has become quite famous and is often served in restaurants and cafes. It may be a good alternative to regular water due to several health benefits.5 Health Benefits of Jasmine RiceFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of sparkling water.1. Promotes Hydration: Sparkling water is just as hydrating as still water, making it an excellent choice for meeting your daily water intake goals. Adequate hydration is crucial for overall well-being, as dehydration can lead to a range of symptoms, including dry mouth, fatigue, headaches, and impaired cognitive function. Chronic dehydration can also contribute to digestive issues and complications affecting the heart and kidneys.2. Facilitates Weight Management: Staying hydrated is essential for effective weight management. Drinking enough water can help you feel full longer, leading to reduced calorie consumption throughout the day. Additionally, unsweetened sparkling water serves as a refreshing alternative to sugary beverages like soda, which contribute empty calories and increase the risk of conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.5 Health Benefits of Brown Rice3. Improves Digestion: Sparkling water may provide relief for individuals experiencing digestive issues. Research suggests that consuming sparkling water can help alleviate symptoms of constipation, including stomach pain and irregular bowel movements.4. Enhances Swallowing: Surprisingly, sparkling water may enhance swallowing ability. Research indicates that carbonated water stimulates the oral cavity, improving overall swallowing function. Individuals with a history of swallowing difficulties may want to consider discussing sparkling water with their speech-language pathologist.5 Health Benefits of Hibiscus Tea5.

The police said he hit his father on the head with a brick, and finding him dead, tried to disguise it as suicide. Jitendra Srivastava, a senior officer of Uttar Pradesh police, said after a dispute, Kanhaiya Tiwari --- a resident of Gorakhpur -- had hit his father on the head. Then he tried to hang him from the ceiling fan to make it look like a suicide. A CCTV video from the road and a cellphone video by a neighbour captured part of the quarrel. The son, carring a brick, is seen following his father, shouting that he would kill him. The cellphone video from a back lane showed him throw the brick at the older man. But he missed. Then he got hold of a stick his father was carrying and tried beating him with it. When the matter was discovered, the man, Satya Prakash Tiwari, was taken to the hospital, where he was declared dead. The son has been arrested. Satya Prakash Tiwari's wife had died earlier. He lived in the village with his only son. Both worked as laborers. Locals said Kanhaiya Tiwari used to drink alcohol every day, which led to frequent arguments at home.",

        "title": "Acromegaly Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Acromegaly Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder that develops when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones will increase in size. In childhood, this condition causes an increase in height called gigantism. However, in adulthood, body changes do not occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of the hands, feet, and face, and is called acromegaly. Symptoms of Acromegaly Symptoms of acromegaly can vary and usually develop slowly. Initially, symptoms usually include: Swelling of the hands and feet. Usually, marked by changes in ring and shoe size. Fatigue and difficulty sleeping. Snoring. Changes in facial appearance, such as the eyebrows, lower jaw, and nose becoming larger, and the gaps between the teeth becoming wider. Numbness and weakness in the hand caused by pressure on the nerves in the hand. In children and teenagers, it will be very high. In advanced conditions, complaints may increase, such as: Large hands and feet. The size of the nose and lips, as well as the large tongue. Skin changes, such as becoming thicker, rougher, and oilier or sweating more often. The voice becomes deeper. Joint pain. Chest pain. Headache Visual disturbances. Decreased libido. Menstrual disorders in women and erectile dysfunction in men. Risk Factors for Acromegaly Acromegaly is usually related to genetics, so a family history of acromegaly can be a risk factor. It is also important to note that acromegaly can begin at any time after puberty. However, it is more common in middle age. People are usually unaware of the condition. This is because changes in the body occur slowly over many years. Causes of Acromegaly Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of the brain, just behind the bridge of the nose. This area produces growth hormone and a number of other hormones. It is important to note that growth hormone plays an important role in managing physical growth. When the pituitary gland releases GH into the bloodstream, it triggers the liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Insulin is what causes bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH can lead to too much IGF-1, which can cause the signs, symptoms, and complications of acromegaly. In adults, tumors are a common cause of too much GH production: 1. Pituitary tumor In most cases, acromegaly is caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and visual disturbances, are caused by the tumor pressing on surrounding brain tissue. 2. Non-pituitary tumors In some people with acromegaly, a tumor in another part of the body, such as the lung or pancreas, causes the condition. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumor produces a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH. Diagnosis of Acromegaly To diagnose acromegaly, the doctor will ask about the patient\u2019s medical history and perform a physical examination. Then, the doctor may recommend the following tests: IGF-1 measurement. Before performing this test, your doctor will ask you to fast overnight. On the day of the test, your doctor will take a blood sample to measure the level of IGF-1 in your blood. Elevated IGF-1 levels indicate acromegaly. Growth hormone suppression test. This is the best method to confirm a diagnosis of acromegaly. During this test, your blood GH levels are measured before and after you drink sugar (glucose). In people who do not have acromegaly, a glucose drink usually causes GH levels to drop. However, if you have acromegaly, your GH levels will tend to remain high. Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help determine the location and size of a tumor on your pituitary gland. If a pituitary tumor isn\u2019t visible, your doctor may recommend other imaging tests to look for non-pituitary tumors. Treatment and Side Effects of Acromegaly Treatment for acromegaly usually depends on the symptoms experienced. In acromegaly sufferers who have a pituitary gland tumor, it is usually recommended to remove the tumor through surgery, which may need to be followed by drug therapy or radiation therapy. 1. Surgery Tumor removal therapy is one of the effective therapies for acromegaly sufferers due to pituitary tumors. The choice of tumor removal requires prior examination to ensure its benefits. In conditions where the tumor is too large and cannot be removed completely, a partial removal is usually performed. This will then be followed by medication or radiotherapy before further surgery. Pituitary gland tumor removal surgery is an operation that requires general anesthesia and is performed in the operating room. Surgery or surgical procedures to remove pituitary gland tumors have several risks, such as the risk of damaging healthy tissue and infection of the meninges. The surgeon will provide an explanation before performing the procedure and will try to minimize any risks that may occur. 2. Medicine The doctor will give medication after surgery or in conditions where surgery cannot be done for some reason. The purpose of giving medication is to reduce the production of growth hormone. Types of drugs that can be given include dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogs, and growth hormone antagonists. Somatostatin analogs can cause side effects on the stomach or digestive tract, such as diarrhea and nausea or gallstones. 3. Radiation Radiation may be used to destroy large tumors or any remaining tumors after surgery, or when other treatments are ineffective. This method can slowly help lower GH levels when used in conjunction with medications. Reducing GH levels using this method may take several years. At least the sufferer needs to be given radiation therapy in several sessions, four to six weeks. The types of radiation therapy that may be used are: Conventional radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy is usually given daily for four to six weeks. People may not see the full effects of this therapy for 10 years or more after treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery. This method uses 3D imaging to deliver high doses of radiation to tumor cells while limiting the amount of radiation to surrounding normal tissue. Usually, this type of radiation can be given in a single dose. GH levels can return to normal within five to 10 years with this method. Unfortunately, radiation can interfere with fertility. In rare cases, this treatment method can cause someone to lose their vision, have brain injuries, or have secondary tumors. Prevention of Acromegaly Until now, no method has been found that can prevent acromegaly, so early detection and treatment is the most effective step in treating this disease. Complications of Acromegaly If left untreated, acromegaly can cause serious health problems. Complications of this rare disease include: High blood pressure ( hypertension ). High cholesterol. Heart problems, especially an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy). Osteoarthritis. Type 2 diabetes Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Precancerous growths (polyps) in the lining of the colon. Sleep apnea Carpal tunnel syndrome. Changes or loss of vision. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms or complaints that indicate acromegaly, talk to your doctor immediately to get the right treatment.",

        "title": "Albinism Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Albinism Albinism or albino is a congenital disorder that causes sufferers to experience a lack of melanin or even no pigment at all. Therefore, the skin, hair, and eye color of sufferers of this condition are pale and tend to be white. Although this condition cannot be cured, sufferers can still live a normal life and carry out daily activities like normal people in general. Symptoms of Albinism There are several symptoms of albinism that occur with variations in sufferers. Symptoms of this condition generally affect the color of the skin, hair, eyes, and vision. 1. Symptoms on the skin and hair The most obvious symptoms of albinism are white hair and very pale and light skin. However, in some cases, hair color can range from white to brown. In addition, skin coloring can also be in the form of pigmentation, which is when the color is lighter than it should be in certain areas. People of African descent who have this condition may have light brown or reddish-brown skin and have freckles. For some, their skin color can be nearly the same as a parent or sibling without albinism. If people with albinism are exposed to sunlight, they may experience: Spots. Moles, colorless or pink. Large freckles or solar lentigines. Sunburned and unable to sunbathe. For some people with this condition, their skin color will never change. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and adolescence, causing slight changes in color. 2. Symptoms in hair An albino\u2019s hair color can range from very white to brown. However, albinism of African or Asian descent may have yellow, red, or brown hair. Hair color can darken in early adulthood. Hair color changes can also occur due to contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker as you age. 3. Eye color symptoms People with albinism usually have pale eyelashes and eyebrows. Eye color ranges from light blue to brown, and can change with age. In people with albinism, the colored part of the eye (the iris) usually lacks pigment. This allows light to shine through the iris and makes the eyes very sensitive to bright light. As a result, very light-colored eyes may appear red in certain lighting. 4. Symptoms in vision Visual impairment is the main symptom of all types of albinism. Eye problems that may occur may include: Rapid, uncontrolled back-and-forth movements of the eyes (nystagmus). Unusual head position or posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movement and see better. Eyes that cannot look in the same direction at the same time or appear crossed (strabismus). Having trouble seeing objects close up or objects far away, called nearsightedness or farsightedness. Having excessive sensitivity to light (photophobia). There is a difference in the curvature of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye (astigmatism), which causes blurred vision. There is a difference in the development of a thin layer of tissue on the inside of the back wall of the eye (retina). This difference results in reduced vision. Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that do not follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye (optic nerve misrouting). Having poor depth perception, meaning not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. Risk Factors for Albinism Albinism is a condition that someone has since birth. A child is at high risk of being born with this condition if they have parents with the same condition. In addition, it can also occur if the parents carry the gene mutation that causes albinism. To date, research has not found any possible activities or diseases that could increase the risk factors for albinism. Causes of Albinism The cause of this condition is a change in one of the genes. Some genes provide instructions for making one of several proteins involved in melanin production. Then, cells called melanocytes will produce melanin which is present in the skin , hair, and eyes. Genetic changes can cause melanin to be absent altogether or to decrease in quantity. Types of Albinism There are different types of albinism that can occur based on the gene changes that cause the disorder. The types will differ based on how they run in families and the genes that are affected. 1. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) This type is the most common. OCA albinism involves two copies of the altered gene, one from each parent. This condition is also called autosomal recessive inheritance. Oculocutaneous albinism is the result of changes in one of eight genes that range in label from OCA-1 to OCA-8. OCA causes decreased pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, as well as vision. The amount of pigment varies by type. The skin, hair, and eye color that results from OCA also varies by type. 2. Ocular albinism Ocular albinism is limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of this type is type 1. This type is inherited due to a change in the gene on the X chromosome from a mother who carries one X gene. This gene has then changed when it is passed down to the child. This is also called X-linked recessive inheritance. However, ocular albinism usually occurs only in males and is less common than OCA. 3. Albinism related to hereditary syndrome Examples of this type of albinism are Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome which is a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and intestinal diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is also a form of OCA, as well as immune problems and recurrent infections, brain and nerve problems, bleeding disorders, and other serious problems. 4. Griscelli syndrome Griscelli syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder. It occurs due to a defect in one of three genes. Only about 150 cases of the syndrome were recorded worldwide between 1978\u20132018. This condition occurs with albinism, but may not affect the entire body. In addition, Griscelli syndrome also occurs due to immune problems and neurological problems. Griscelli syndrome usually causes death in the first decade of life. Diagnosis of Albinism Albinism occurs at birth. Generally, diagnosing this condition is not difficult and only requires an examination by a doctor. This examination can be done by a doctor by: Physical examination includes examination of skin and hair pigmentation. Comprehensive eye examination. Comparing the pigmentation of a child with albinism with other family members. Review your child\u2019s medical history, including any bleeding that won\u2019t stop, serious bruising, or unexpected infections. Albinism Treatment Although it cannot be cured, treatment for albinism focuses on maximizing the ability to see and protecting the skin by providing proper care. Use sunglasses to protect the eyes from direct exposure to ultraviolet rays. Wear clothing that covers the skin and use sunscreen to protect the skin from sun exposure. Use of special glasses if you experience eye and vision problems. Do skin care and skin cancer prevention. For example, by having a skin exam at least once a year to screen for skin cancer or spots that can lead to cancer. Prevention of Albinism Albinism is not a disease that someone can prevent in some way because it is a hereditary condition. If you want to know about the risk of this condition occurring in children, you can do a genetic counselor to find out what type of albinism might occur. Complications of Albinism The lack of melanin produced by the body causes the skin, hair and eyes to become pale. The following are complications that may occur in people with albinism: Visual impairment However, people with albinism can learn to use their vision over time. Some people with albinism may be able to overcome problems with astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness with glasses or contact lenses. Skin cancer Lack of melanin in the body can cause skin cancer in people with albinism. Check regularly if you experience symptoms of skin cancer. Also, minimize exposure to the sun for a long time. Problems in the social environment People with this condition are at high risk of social isolation, due to the social stigma behind the condition. When to See a Doctor? If you experience signs and symptoms of albinism, you can talk further with a doctor to find out the cause and proper treatment. In addition, you can consult a doctor for treatment if you experience complications or the impact interferes with daily activities.",

        "title": "Cold Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Cold Allergy Not everyone can stay comfortable when facing cold air. Some people experience cold allergy problems, or in medical terms is cold urticaria. This problem can cause itchy welts and redness of the skin within minutes of exposure to cold. The symptoms of cold allergies experienced by each person can vary, ranging from mild to severe reactions. For some people, swimming in cold water can cause loss of consciousness, drop in blood pressure, and even be fatal. This disorder occurs most often in adolescents and may disappear completely after a few years. In addition, preventive measures are very important so that this problem does not recur. Cold Allergy Symptoms Signs or symptoms that can arise when someone experiences a cold allergy can range from mild to severe. For mild symptoms may include: Temporary reddish spots accompanied by itchy welts on the skin areas exposed to the cold. Bad skin reaction when the cold wears off. Experience swelling in the hands when holding cold objects. There is swelling of the lips due to consuming cold food or drinks. Then, for severe reactions, among others: Experiencing anaphylaxis which can cause fainting, heart palpitations, body swelling, and shock. Swelling of the tongue and throat that makes it difficult to breathe. Heart palpitations. Decreased blood pressure. Faint. Symptoms of urticaria begin immediately when the skin experiences a sudden drop in air temperature or cold water. Each episode can last up to about two hours. The most severe problem occurs when the whole body is exposed to cold, such as swimming in cold water. If not treated immediately, the sufferer can lose consciousness and drown. Cold Allergy Risk Factors This disorder, called cold urticaria, is most common in teenagers. About half of those who suffer from it may or may not get better after 6 years. Risk factors can be conditions or situations that increase a person\u2019s likelihood of experiencing an allergic reaction when exposed to cold temperatures or extreme temperature changes. Here are some risk factors you need to be aware of: History of allergies. A person who has a history of allergies to certain substances, such as pollen, animal dander, or certain foods, is more susceptible to this condition. Asthma. People who have asthma or other allergies, such as allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis (eczema), are at higher risk of developing this condition. Age. Children and adolescents tend to be more susceptible to it than adults. Family history. If you have a family history of this condition or other allergies, you may also be at higher risk for developing this condition. Environmental exposure. People who live or work in environments that tend to be cold or are exposed to cold temperatures for extended periods of time may be at higher risk for developing this condition. Outdoor activities. Being active in cold temperatures or extreme temperature changes can increase the risk of cold allergies. Low humidity. Environments with low humidity, especially in winter, can also trigger cold allergies. Physical activity. Some people experience cold allergies especially when doing physical activities, such as running or exercising in cold temperatures. Cholinergic urticaria reaction. Some people develop an allergic reaction called cholinergic urticaria when their body temperature rises due to physical activity, stress, or heat. Causes of Cold Allergies Allergies can appear when the skin is exposed to cold weather and are at risk of appearing in windy and humid conditions. Research has found that this condition is caused by the release of histamine and chemicals into the bloodstream triggered by cold air. People who suffer from it will experience a rash or itching on the skin after: Eat or drink something cold. Put ice on the skin. Swim or soak in cold water. Walking outdoors in cold weather. There are three most common types of cold allergies, namely: Essential cold allergy. This type occurs in people who have no family history of the disease. Symptoms can appear within minutes of exposure to cold. Then, symptoms can subside within an hour or two. Familial or hereditary cold allergy. This type runs in families. Symptoms take a long time to appear, usually 30 minutes to 48 hours after exposure. However, symptoms can last for one to two days. Autoimmune. This type occurs when the body releases histamine in response to cold. Histamine is a chemical made by the immune system in response to allergies. However, the reason for the release of histamine is unknown. Cold Allergy Diagnosis Cold urticaria can be diagnosed by placing an ice cube on the skin for five minutes. If you do have this disease, a red bump may form a few minutes after the ice cube is removed. In addition, this disorder can also be influenced by the immune system. Therefore, the doctor may need to do a blood test or other supporting tests. Cold Allergy Treatment In severe cases of cold allergies, it can have fatal consequences, such as swelling of the throat and tongue. As a result, this can cause difficulty breathing, anaphylactic reactions causing low blood pressure, heart palpitations, fainting, and swelling of the arms and legs (torso). Generally, this condition can disappear on its own within weeks to months, but some can last quite a long time. For this reason, if you suddenly feel signs of an allergy, you should immediately see a doctor. Depending on the severity of the condition, the sufferer may need to manage existing conditions before or after exposure. The doctor may also prescribe medications such as: Antihistamines. These drugs can counteract histamine or the substance that triggers itching. Sufferers can use antihistamines before exposure to cold to prevent a reaction or after exposure to control a reaction that has already occurred. Desensitization. This treatment involves gradually exposing your body to increasingly cold temperatures. For example, taking a cold shower that gets colder and colder over time. Desensitization can help your body adjust and control its reaction to cold. However, never try this treatment without talking to your doctor first. Epinephrine or adrenaline injection. This medication can slow down a severe allergic reaction. This injection can only be given by a doctor in a hospital. Some people who are at risk for a severe reaction may carry an epinephrine auto-injector. Cold Allergy Prevention For sufferers, it is recommended not to swim in cold water. When the entire surface of the skin is exposed to cold, it can cause a severe reaction, causing the sufferer to lose consciousness and drown. Well, there are several other ways that can be done to reduce the possibility of cold urticaria symptoms, namely: Wear protective clothing when the weather is cold, such as jackets, hats, gloves, and scarves. Make sure all parts of the skin are covered. Check the water temperature before you dip in and be sure to avoid cold water. If you like swimming, be sure to choose a heated pool and warm weather. Take a shower with warm water. Do not consume cold food and drinks. Take antihistamines before exposure to cold. If your doctor prescribes an epinephrine autoinjector, always carry it with you to prevent serious reactions. If you need to have certain surgeries, talk to your surgeon about your cold allergy. The surgical team can take steps to prevent symptoms in the operating room. Cold Allergy Complications The main possible complication of cold allergies is a severe reaction that occurs after the skin area is exposed to cold. For example, when swimming in cold water. So, is it true that cold allergies can cause sinusitis? When to See a Doctor? If you experience the signs and symptoms of a cold allergy above, talk to your doctor immediately to find out the cause and get the right treatment. Seek emergency care immediately if you are suddenly exposed to a cold and experience an anaphylactic response or difficulty breathing.",

        "text": "What Is a Peanut Allergy? A peanut allergy is a common condition in which a person\u2019s body reacts to the proteins contained in certain nuts. Nuts that commonly cause allergic reactions include peanuts, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachios. Peanut allergies can cause severe, even life-threatening symptoms and affect a person\u2019s quality of life. A peanut allergy occurs when a person\u2019s immune system perceives the proteins in peanuts as foreign and produces chemicals that damage the body to fight the proteins. When these substances are released into the blood, they cause allergic symptoms. An allergy occurs when the body mistakenly identifies nuts as a harmful food. When you consume nuts, your immune system overreacts, causing a serious, even life-threatening response. Peanut allergies can occur in people of all ages but are most common in children. Some people can outgrow a peanut allergy, but for those who are more sensitive, a peanut allergy can cause a very severe reaction. Nuts that commonly cause allergic reactions include peanuts, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachios. Additionally, Brazil nuts, filbert nuts, Macadamia nuts, pecans, and cashews can also cause allergic reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, it is very important to provide first aid. Peanut Allergy Symptoms Peanut allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe and can occur within minutes of consuming peanuts or even hours later. Some common symptoms of a peanut allergy include: Diarrhea Difficulty breathing Skin rash Nausea and vomiting Stomach cramps Swelling, usually on the tongue or lips More severe peanut allergy symptoms such as anaphylaxis can occur within minutes of consuming peanuts. Anaphylaxis is a very severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Hard to breathe Fast and irregular heartbeat Low blood pressure Cold and pale skin Bloating, nausea, and vomiting Chest pain or discomfort in the chest Death The allergic reactions that appear in each sufferer will be different. In fact, one sufferer may have different allergic reactions when consuming different types of nuts. Risk Factors for Peanut Allergy There are several risk factors that can increase a person\u2019s risk of experiencing a peanut allergy. History of Allergies or Asthma If someone has a history of allergies or asthma, then they have a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy. People who have a history of other allergies, such as other food allergies, are also at higher risk. Family History As explained previously, if a family member has a peanut allergy, the risk of peanut allergies in other family members will increase. Age Children are at higher risk of developing peanut allergies than adults. However, adults can also experience peanut allergies, especially if they have a history of allergies or asthma. Gender Several studies have shown that men have a higher risk of developing peanut allergies than women. Ethnicity Some ethnic groups are at higher risk for developing peanut allergies than others. For example, Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans Causes of Peanut Allergies The exact cause of peanut allergy is not known for certain. However, there are several factors that are thought to play a role in the development of this condition. Genetics Peanut allergies can be passed from parents to their children. If one or both parents have a peanut allergy, their child has a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy. Immune System A peanut allergy occurs when the immune system responds to the proteins in peanuts as harmful foreign substances. The body then produces antibodies to fight these proteins, and each time these proteins enter the body, the immune system releases histamine and other chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Early Exposure to Peanuts Early exposure to peanuts can increase a child\u2019s risk of developing a peanut allergy. Several studies have shown that giving foods containing nuts to babies before the age of 6 months can increase the risk of peanut allergies in the baby. Peanut Allergy Diagnosis The diagnostic process is carried out by a specialist doctor based on the results of interviews and complaints experienced by the sufferer. The following are some supporting examinations including: Medical History The first step in diagnosing a peanut allergy is to conduct a medical interview to determine the patient\u2019s allergy history and symptoms. The doctor will ask about the patient\u2019s allergy history and whether they have had any allergic symptoms after consuming peanuts or foods containing peanuts. The doctor will also ask for information about symptoms by the patient, such as skin rashes, itching, swelling, nausea, vomiting and even difficulty breathing. Skin Test Skin testing is one of the most common methods in diagnosing peanut allergies. The skin test involves injecting a small amount of peanut protein into the patient\u2019s skin and then waiting for a reaction. If an allergic reaction occurs, the skin will become red and itchy. Blood Test Blood tests involve taking a sample of the patient\u2019s blood and testing whether they have antibodies to peanut proteins. This blood test is known as the immunoglobulin E (IgE) test and can help determine whether or not a patient has a peanut allergy. However, blood tests are not always accurate and cannot determine the severity of the allergy. Elimination and Provocation Test An elimination test involves removing nuts from the patient\u2019s diet for a period of time to see if symptoms improve. After that, the patient will be given food containing nuts and then observed to see if the symptoms reappear. An elimination test can help identify a peanut allergy, but it is not always accurate. Meanwhile, provocation tests should be performed under medical supervision and involve gradually introducing foods containing peanuts to see if the patient experiences an allergic reaction. This test can help identify the severity of the allergy and help the doctor plan the appropriate treatment. Diagnostic Tools There are also several tools that can help in the diagnosis of peanut allergies. Peanut Allergy Detector A peanut allergy detector is a device that can detect peanut proteins in food and beverages. This tool works by measuring the levels of peanut protein in food or beverage samples. If the protein content of the peanut is high, then the food may contain peanuts and could potentially cause an allergic reaction. Epinephrine Auto-Injector This is a device used to administer epinephrine injections in an emergency Peanut Allergy Symptoms Prevention To prevent the emergence of allergic reactions to nuts, here are some steps you can take: Read the packaging labels before purchasing groceries. Ask the restaurant waiter before ordering food. Do not breathe air containing peanut residue. Wear a bracelet stating if your child has a peanut allergy. Carry medications such as antihistamines with you wherever you go to treat mild allergic reactions. Carry an epinephrine shot with you wherever you go to treat severe allergic reactions. Peanut Allergy Treatment Medications can help reduce the symptoms of a peanut allergy. Here are some medications your doctor may prescribe to treat a peanut allergy: Antihistamines Antihistamines can help reduce allergy symptoms, such as itching, skin rashes, and nasal congestion. Some examples of available antihistamines are cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. Corticosteroids These compounds can help reduce inflammation and swelling caused by peanut allergies. Corticosteroids are available in pill or injection form. Some examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone. Epinephrine This compound is a drug used to treat serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. Epinephrine works by narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate, thereby helping to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, itching, and swelling.",

        "title": "Food Allergies Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Food Allergies A food allergy is a condition in which the immune system mistakenly assumes a substance, such as a protein in a particular food, is harmful to the body. As a result, the immune system will react to food substances that are classified as dangerous or allergens. Even small amounts of an allergenic food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, this allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. In addition, this condition can be acute or sudden, but it can also be chronic or last for a long time. Food allergies are often confused with another health condition, food intolerance. However, they are two different health conditions. Because food intolerance is a reaction from the digestive system. It has nothing to do with antibodies like food allergies. Food Allergy Symptoms A person who experiences this condition can experience various symptoms in his body. A person can experience these symptoms with mild or high intensity depending on the amount of allergen they consume. The symptoms include: A reddish rash that appears on the surface of the skin. Itchy rash. Tingling in the oral cavity. Difficulty swallowing. Swelling of the mouth, face, and other parts of the body. Nausea and vomiting. Itchy eyes. Sneeze. Shortness of breath or labored breathing. Dizzy. Stomach ache or diarrhea. Dry, cracked, red, and itchy skin. The genital and anal areas appear reddish. Constipation. Heartburn. More frequent bowel movements. There is mucus or blood in the stool when defecating. Pale skin. Seems more fussy in babies. In addition, food allergies in some cases can cause anaphylaxis, the symptoms of which can include: Heart beats fast. Hard to breathe. Sudden anxiety and fear. Blood pressure drops drastically. Unconscious or fainting. Food Allergy Risk Factors Anyone can experience it, but there are several factors that can increase the risk, such as: 1. Family history Allergies can run in families. If a close family member has asthma or any allergic disease, including food allergies, eczema, and seasonal allergies, the person is more likely to develop the condition. 2. History of other food allergies If you already have an allergy to one food, you may be at higher risk of developing allergies to other foods. Likewise, if you have other types of allergic reactions, such as hay fever or eczema, your risk of developing a food allergy is greater. 3. Age Babies and children are more susceptible to food allergies. However, as they get older, their digestive tracts become more mature in digesting foods that can trigger allergies. 4. Gut bacteria Some studies suggest that people with peanut or seasonal allergies may have altered gut bacteria conditions. Foods That Are Prone to Causing Allergies There are several types of food that accumulate approximately 90 percent of allergies that people have. These foods also fall into the category of eight major allergens. Here are the types of food and drinks. Egg. Fish. Milk. Nuts that come from trees. Peanuts. Seafood. Soya bean. Wheat. Causes of Food Allergies Not a few people have difficulty finding the cause of their allergies. However, this condition usually occurs due to the following: 1. Immune system Antibodies are special proteins produced by the immune system to protect the body. Well, antibodies work by identifying potential dangers that threaten the body, such as bacteria and viruses. The job of antibodies is to signal the immune system to release chemicals to kill the threat and prevent the spread of infection. In the most common type of allergy, antibodies known as immunoglobulin E (IgE), mistakenly target certain proteins in food as a threat. IgE can cause several chemicals to be released, the most important of which is histamine. 2. Histamine Most of the typical symptoms that appear during an allergic reaction are due to histamine. Well, this substance can cause symptoms such as: Dilation of small blood vessels, so the skin becomes red and swollen. Affects the nerves in the skin, causing itching. Increases the amount of mucus produced in the lining of the nose which causes itching and burning sensations. In most cases, histamine release is limited to a specific part of the body, such as the mouth, throat, or skin. 3. Non-IgE mediated allergies Another type of food allergy is non-IgE-mediated food allergy, which occurs due to different cells in the immune system. This condition is much more difficult for doctors to diagnose because there is no accurate test to confirm a non-IgE-mediated food allergy. This type of reaction is mostly limited to the skin and digestive system, causing symptoms such as heartburn, indigestion, and eczema. In infants, non-IgE-mediated food allergies can also cause diarrhea and reflux, where stomach acid rises into the throat. 4. Certain foods In children, the foods that most often cause allergic reactions are eggs, milk and milk products, soy, wheat, and nuts. In adults, foods that often cause allergic reactions are nuts, fish, and seafood. Food Allergy Diagnosis To make a diagnosis, the doctor needs to ask a number of questions and perform tests. If symptoms develop rapidly, your doctor may recommend a skin prick test or blood test. However, if symptoms develop more slowly, your doctor may suggest a food elimination test. 1. Ask questions First of all, the doctor will ask you several questions about the patterns and symptoms you are experiencing, such as: How long does it take for symptoms to appear after exposure to food? How long do the symptoms last? How severe are the symptoms? Is this the first time these symptoms have occurred? If not, how often do they occur? What foods might be the culprit and how much to consume? Do you have any allergies or other allergic conditions? Is there a history of allergies in the family? Is (or is) the child breastfed or bottle-fed? In children, the doctor may need to assess the child\u2019s weight and size to ensure that their growth is appropriate for their age. 2. Skin prick test During a skin prick test, your doctor will place a drop of food extract on your arm. The skin is then pricked with a small lancet, allowing the allergen to come into contact with cells of the immune system. Itching, redness, and swelling are signs that indicate a positive reaction. The test is usually painless. 3. Blood test An alternative to the skin prick test is a blood test. This test aims to measure the amount of allergic antibodies in the blood to certain foods. To perform this test, the doctor will take a blood sample for examination in the laboratory. 4. Food elimination test In a food elimination test, a person must avoid foods that are likely to cause an allergic reaction for 2-6 weeks. The food is then reintroduced afterward. If symptoms disappear when food consumption stops, but reappear after the allergic person consumes the food, then this condition usually indicates a food allergy or intolerance. Food Allergy Complications Food allergies rarely cause serious complications. However, in severe cases, they can cause serious complications. Well, here are some food allergy complications that you need to be aware of, namely: 1. Anaphylaxis In some people, allergies can trigger a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. This condition can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, such as: Narrowing and tightening of the airways. A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in the throat that makes it difficult for a person to breathe. Shock with severe drop in blood pressure. Rapid pulse. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness, Seek medical help immediately or go to the emergency room if you or someone around you experiences the above signs. 2. Atopic dermatitis Eczema or atopic dermatitis is another complication of this allergy. This condition can cause itchy skin reactions and redness of the skin (eczema). Food Allergy Treatment The only way to completely treat an allergic reaction is to avoid the food that causes the allergy. However, there are several things you can do to ease the reaction. For mild allergic reactions, over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines can help reduce symptoms. You can take this medicine after being exposed to food that causes allergies to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines cannot treat severe allergic reactions. For severe allergic reactions, you may need an emergency epinephrine injection. If your doctor has prescribed epinephrine for you to use, you should make sure that both you and those around you understand how to operate the injection in an emergency. In addition, make sure to always have an injection ready in case you suddenly experience an allergy. Having extra, unexpired epinephrine on hand is also a good safety measure. Researchers have studied the use of oral immunotherapy as a treatment for food allergies. This therapy delivers small doses of the food you are allergic to. The doctor will ask the patient to swallow or place the food under the tongue (sublingual). Then the dose will be increased gradually under the supervision of a doctor. Food Allergy Prevention The most appropriate way to prevent allergic reactions is to know and avoid foods that cause allergies. Always read food and drink labels carefully to see if there are any ingredients that could cause allergies. If you are visiting a restaurant, ask the waiter about the ingredients on the menu that you want. The goal is to make sure there are no ingredients that can trigger allergies. If there are food and drink ingredients that can trigger allergies, ask the chef to remove them. For children, don\u2019t forget to tell the teacher or childcare staff if your little one has certain food allergies.",

        "title": "7 Facts You Need to Know About Albinism",
        "text": "You must have seen someone whose skin and hair are white. This condition occurs because the person has albinism. This disorder occurs because the body lacks or does not have the pigment melanin. Albinism has several levels of severity, ranging from white skin and hair, thin hair, to vision problems. It can affect anyone, but the likelihood depends on the region. In Africa, albinism can affect one in every 5,000-15,000 people. In Europe and the United States, albinism can affect one in every 17,000-20,000 people. Albinism can affect both sexes equally and all races. What is Albinism? Albinism is a hereditary disease characterized by a much lower level of melanin production than normal people. Melanin is a pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color. People with albinism generally have lighter skin and hair than their family members or people around them. In addition, they may also have vision problems, which is common for them. Melanin normally protects the skin from damage caused by sunlight or ultraviolet. Therefore, someone with albinism will be more sensitive to sun exposure. In addition, people with albinism are also at risk of developing skin cancer if exposed to sunlight for too long. Facts about Albinism Here are some facts about albinism that you may not know: Although albinism is one of the safest genetic disorders a person can have, it can also cause certain health problems. The most common problem is a vision problem called ocular albinism. Certain types of albinism can be passed from mother to child and can cause serious problems, such as blindness. Even if no damage occurs, the lack of pigmentation in the eyes can cause extreme sensitivity to light and abnormal retinal development. The physical appearance of a person with albinism looks different from normal people. Generally, albino people have blue or gray eyes. Even in some cases, the eyes of sufferers of this disorder are pink or red. A person with albinism must pay more attention to their eye health because their vision is considered low. These people must use contact lenses or glasses to correct their weak vision. A person with this skin color disorder does not have the pigmentation that can protect their skin from direct exposure to sunlight. Albinism not only occurs in humans but can also occur in animals. This skin pigmentation disorder cannot be transmitted, either through blood transfusion, skin contact, or through organisms that can spread the disease. Albinism is an incurable disorder, as the root cause of the disease is genetic. However, the eye and skin problems are a result of the disorder and can be treated in the right way.",

        "title": "Alkaptonuria Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria or black urine disease is a rare disease that occurs due to a genetic mutation of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD). The HGD gene mutation that occurs causes the homogentisate oxidase enzyme to fail to work properly. This enzyme functions to break down and decompose two amino acids called tyrosine and phenylalanine. People with this disease experience a buildup of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body, causing urine and certain body parts to turn dark. This disease can occur since childhood but can go undetected until adulthood because it sometimes does not cause symptoms. This disease is quite rare because it only occurs in one in every 250,000 people in the world. There are certain countries that have more cases of this disease than other countries. However, you need to know that this disease can occur in men and women of all ages. Symptoms of Alkaptonuria The typical early symptom of too much HGA in the body is dark to black urine, which usually occurs from birth. Beyond that, symptoms of this condition can occur in almost any part of the body, from tendons, bones, nails, ears, and liver. 1. Ochronosis and ochronotic osteoarthropathy Sufferers can experience ochronosis and ochronotic osteoarthropathy in adulthood with symptoms that are slow. Ochronosis is a bluish-black patch/color due to the accumulation of HGA in certain parts of the body, such as connective tissue. These symptoms usually begin to appear in the 3rd\u20135th decade and are found in the eyes and ears, and can also be present on the skin. In addition to the occurrence of a bluish-black color in the ears, thickening can also occur, such as in the ear cartilage. 2. Joint problems Symptoms such as pain or stiffness in the joints can also occur. Initially, the pain will be felt in the lower back, then spread to the knees, waist, and shoulders. These symptoms are similar to those of osteoarthritis. In severe cases, the sufferer\u2019s cartilage can also potentially weaken and become damaged. This can lead to joint damage and the need for joint replacement surgery. 3. Accumulation of homogentisic acid This can happen to connective tissues such as ligaments, bones (arthropathy), and tendons. These tissues will become blackish, weak, and easily damaged. This can cause thickening of the tendons or inflammation (tendonitis) in sufferers. 4. Organ problems Sufferers can also experience aortic valve stenosis in the heart, kidney stones, and prostate stones. This can occur due to homogentisic acid deposits in the organs so that the organs and blood vessels harden. 5. Discoloration of eyes, skin, and nails This disease can also cause black and brown spots to appear on the whites of the eyes. In addition, the skin and nails can also change color to have bluish or blackish spots. Skin color can change throughout the body. These changes are most visible in areas that have sweat glands such as the cheeks, forehead, and armpits. Risk Factors for Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria is a hereditary disease. This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning it can be inherited when both parents have the same abnormal gene but do not have symptoms. However, if one parent is normal and the other has alkaptonuria, the child is at risk of developing alkaptonuria but without symptoms. This disease can be experienced by anyone, both men and women. However, in men, this condition is more likely to develop with quite severe symptoms. Causes of Alkaptonuria The cause of alkaptonuria is a mutation in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene. This gene functions to control the production of the homogentisate oxidase enzyme which functions to break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine in the body. In the case of alkaptonuria sufferers, this gene is malfunctioning, which causes the sufferer\u2019s body to not have enough enzymes to break down both amino acids. As a result, homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulates in the sufferer\u2019s body. Under normal conditions, if there is excess homogentisic acid it will be excreted from the body by the kidneys. However, alkaptonuria disease causes homogentisic acid to not be excreted completely, so it accumulates in various body tissues and causes symptoms of alkaptonuria. Diagnosis of Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria can usually be diagnosed based on its typical symptoms, family history, and homogentisic acid level testing. In cases of family history, the disease occurs hereditarily from the parents\u2019 genes. A person must inherit two abnormal HGD genes, one from their mother and one from their father, to develop the disease. This is so rare that the condition is considered rare. In some cases, people with alkaptonuria have bone or joint inflammation at a young age, but do not have complaints of dark urine. Homogentisic acid examination can be checked through urine examination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Another way can be done using X-ray and CT scan methods (imaging methods). This is done to determine the presence of joint, spinal, and heart valve disorders. Finally, by detecting HGD gene mutations with molecular examination. Treatment of Alkaptonuria Until now there is no treatment or therapy that can cure alkaptonuria. Because this disease occurs throughout life, the treatment is done to reduce symptoms and reduce the risk of worsening of the disease. Here are some ways to treat the disease that your doctor might recommend. 1. Nitisinone This drug can reduce the level of homogentisic acid in the body. Nitisinone can slow the rate of disease progression and its consumption needs to be with a doctor\u2019s recommendation. Nitisinone can be consumed by sufferers together with pain relievers. 2. Physiotherapy Doing physiotherapy can also be an option for people with alkaptonuria. If stable and routine, physiotherapy can build muscles and strengthen joints. Physiotherapy can also reduce the symptoms that sufferers experience. It is best to avoid strenuous activities while you are undergoing physiotherapy. You can also find out more about whether exercises such as Pilates Can Prevent Alkaptonuria. 3. Meet certain nutritional needs People with this disease should also consume foods low in tyrosine and phenylalanine protein, as well as consume ascorbic acid (vitamin C). A low-protein diet can also reduce the side effects of taking nitisinone. Complications of Alkaptonuria There are several complications that can occur due to this disease. Usually, the complications that occur are due to the severity of the disease and how long the sufferer has had this disease. The complications that can occur are: Arthritis. Heart disease. Kidney disorders. Prevention of Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria can be prevented by gene testing for every couple who are going to get married as an early detection. Especially, if one of the partners has a family history of this disease. When to See a Doctor? If you or your family have indications of symptoms or signs that point to alkaptonuria, immediately discuss it with a doctor to get the right treatment.",

        "title": "Alkalosis Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alkalosis Alkalosis is a medical condition that occurs when the pH level of human blood rises above the normal value, which is around 7.35 to 7.45. Under normal circumstances, human blood pH is well maintained in this range because it plays an important role in healthy body functions. However, when blood pH is too high, it can have negative effects on the human body. Alkalosis can be divided into two types, namely respiratory alkalosis and metabolic alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when a person hyperventilates or takes in too much oxygen. While metabolic alkalosis occurs when the body loses too much acid or produces too much bicarbonate. Symptoms of Alkalosis Minimal alkalosis can cause some unpleasant symptoms, although they are usually not serious. Some of the most common symptoms of minimal alkalosis include: Tingling and numbness in the hands and feet Unusual tiredness and fatigue Muscle cramps or spasms Headache Sleep disturbance or insomnia If the condition is not treated immediately, symptoms will get worse and can progress. These symptoms can lead to shock or even coma. Call emergency medical care immediately if someone experiences symptoms such as: Dizzy; Difficulty breathing; Confusion; Faint; Coma. Risk Factors for Alkalosis The following risk factors can increase the risk of alkalosis: Chronic lung disease; Chronic lung infection; Chronic kidney disease; Acute kidney injury; Loss of excessive fluids (dehydration) Causes of Alkalosis There are several factors that can cause alkalosis. Some of them include: Hyperventilation When someone hyperventilates, they take in too much oxygen and expel too much carbon dioxide from their body. This can cause the blood pH to rise, resulting in alkalosis. Increase consumption of alkaline foods Foods that contain a lot of alkali, such as fruits and vegetables, can increase blood pH. If someone consumes too much of these foods, it can cause alkalosis. Use of certain medications Some medications, such as diuretics and antacids, can cause the body to lose acid and lead to alkalosis. Diagnosis of Alkalosis The symptoms of this condition can be similar to other medical conditions, so it\u2019s important not to try to diagnose yourself. Make an appointment with your doctor to have a health evaluation. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. They will likely order tests to rule out other conditions. Common tests include: Urinalysis; Urine pH level test; Basic metabolic panel; Arterial blood gas analysis. Complications of Alkalosis The following are some complications that can occur in alkalosis: Paralysis Severe alkalosis can cause paralysis, which usually begins in the hands and feet. This condition results from decreased levels of calcium ions in the blood, which affects nerve and muscle function. Seizures Alkalosis can increase the likelihood of seizures. This is because high blood pH can affect nerve activity and trigger seizures. Calcium Loss Alkalosis can cause calcium loss from the bones and can affect long-term bone health. This is especially true in metabolic alkalosis, which is usually due to loss of stomach acid or the use of certain medications. Electrolyte Imbalance Disorders High pH levels can affect the electrolyte balance in the body, which can affect the function of organs and systems in the body. Alkalosis can cause disturbances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels, which can affect general health and fluid balance in the body. Heart Failure and Death Severe alkalosis can affect heart function and can lead to heart failure or death. This is especially true of severe respiratory alkalosis, which is usually the result of a serious medical condition, such as a heart attack or stroke. Treatment and Prevention of Alkalosis Treatment of alkalosis depends on the cause. In mild cases of alkalosis, treatment can be done by stopping the triggering factor, such as stopping drugs that affect the blood\u2019s pH balance. In more severe cases of alkalosis, treatment involves providing therapy aimed at restoring the blood\u2019s pH balance. One treatment for alkalosis is the administration of intravenous fluids containing sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). This therapy aims to increase chloride levels in the blood and reduce bicarbonate levels. If alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation (breathing too fast), then the treatment that can be done is to reduce the frequency and depth of breathing. This therapy can be done by calming the patient or giving sedatives. It is important to identify and treat alkalosis quickly, as it can affect the function of organs such as the heart and brain. If you experience symptoms of alkalosis such as difficulty breathing, muscle cramps, or confusion, contact your doctor immediately for proper treatment. Prevention of alkalosis is also very important, namely by maintaining the acid-base balance in the body by consuming a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. If you have a history of alkalosis or a disease that can cause alkalosis, do not hesitate to consult a doctor for advice and proper treatment.",

        "title": "Egg Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Egg Allergy Egg allergy is a condition that causes an abnormal reaction from the immune system to egg protein. In this condition, the immune system recognizes eggs as a substance that can be harmful to the body. This then causes the immune system to push the body to release histamine. This is what causes allergy symptoms to appear. People with this condition can experience mild to severe symptoms. In general, egg white is the part of the egg that most often triggers allergies than the yolk. This allergy generally occurs in babies and will disappear before entering adolescence. Egg Allergy Symptoms Symptoms of this condition usually appear a few moments to a few hours after the sufferer consumes eggs or foods containing eggs. Some symptoms that appear due to this allergy are: Red rash on the skin. Itchy. Stuffy or runny nose and sneezing. Stomach cramps. Nausea and vomiting. Stomach ache. Diarrhea. Shortness of breath accompanied by wheezing. Cough. Chest pain. In rare cases, allergies to these foods can cause severe, life-threatening symptoms (anaphylaxis). Symptoms that can appear include: Rapid pulse. Swelling in the throat. Blood pressure drops drastically. Dizzy. Loss of consciousness or fainting. Egg Allergy Risk Factors There are several risk factors that make someone more susceptible to allergies, including: 1. Age Babies and children are more susceptible to allergies because their digestive tracts are not yet mature and perfect. The body\u2019s organs are also still unable to digest certain types of food properly, resulting in side effects on the body. 2. Family history Egg allergies can be hereditary. This means that someone can experience it if there are family members who are also allergic to the proteins contained in eggs. Hereditary allergies occur because certain genes are inherited from parents to children. 3. History of other allergies in the family Not only the same allergy, someone can also have a food allergy if one or both parents have other types of allergies. For example eczema, asthma, or rhinitis. This condition can affect the child\u2019s genes and cause allergies to certain foods. 4. Atopic dermatitis People with atopic dermatitis or skin inflammation are at higher risk of developing food allergies because their skin condition is already sensitive. Just like when allergies form, atopic dermatitis also appears in childhood. Causes of Egg Allergy Food allergies can occur because the body\u2019s immune system reacts more strongly than it should. In the context of foods such as eggs, the immune system identifies egg proteins as substances that are harmful to the body and not food. As a result, the body reacts by releasing histamine into the blood and causing an allergic reaction. Allergies can occur due to the egg white, the yolk, or both. In children, the most common allergy is egg white allergy. While in adults, egg yolks are more likely to cause allergies. In breastfed infants, allergies usually occur due to the mother\u2019s breast milk consuming eggs. This condition is also triggered by the imperfect digestive tract of infants and children. Egg Allergy Diagnosis You can get an egg allergy diagnosis through a complete medical examination with a doctor. In general, allergy testing can occur in several different ways, namely blood tests, physical, and consumption. Previously, the doctor will ask for a history of the disease and symptoms experienced by the sufferer, as well as a history of allergic diseases in both parents of the sufferer. Then, the doctor can do one or more tests to prove allergies. First, the doctor can perform a physical examination to see signs of allergies that appear on the sufferer\u2019s body. The doctor will place a small amount of egg protein on the surface of the sufferer\u2019s skin and observe the symptoms of allergies that arise. In addition, doctors can also give sufferers a small amount of eggs to consume so that symptoms can appear. Of course, this test is safe because the amount of allergen consumption is very small. The last option is to have a blood test to see the immune system\u2019s response to eggs by measuring the amount of antibodies in the blood. Once the patient is proven to have an allergy, the doctor will gradually advise the sufferer to eliminate eggs from their daily menu while observing the symptoms that arise. Egg Allergy Treatment Treatment for this allergy is to not consume eggs or foods containing eggs. Medicines from doctors aim to reduce the symptoms that arise. Some commonly used medicines are: 1. Antihistamine Antihistamines are a type of medication that can relieve allergy symptoms. You can use this medication after consuming eggs and feeling the symptoms. The purpose of its use is to avoid severe allergic reactions. For those with severe allergies, it is best to always have this medicine on hand to avoid serious side effects. 2. Adrenaline Not only hormones in the body, adrenaline is also an allergy reliever. Allergy sufferers can use this drug by injecting it into the skin to treat serious allergic reactions in the form of anaphylaxis. Sufferers with serious symptoms should go to the hospital immediately for further treatment. Egg Allergy Prevention The best way to prevent allergies is to not consume eggs or foods and drinks that contain eggs. Some efforts to prevent egg allergies that can be done include: Be careful about the contents of every food consumed, especially when eating out. Ask the waiter or chef about the egg content in the menu you are going to eat. Carefully read the labels on food packaging. In some cases, small amounts of egg content can also trigger allergy symptoms. For breastfeeding mothers whose babies have egg allergies, avoid consuming eggs because they can enter the breast milk that the baby will drink. Replace eggs with other commonly used substitute ingredients for food processing. Use a special bracelet or necklace for allergy sufferers when traveling outside the home. Tell your child\u2019s family or caregiver that your child has an egg allergy and explain what to do when allergy symptoms appear. Discuss with your doctor every time your child is going to be vaccinated because some vaccines, such as influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and yellow fever contain egg protein which can trigger allergic symptoms. Contact This Doctor If You Have an Egg Allergy If you experience signs and symptoms of allergies such as a red rash on the skin, itching, stuffy nose or runny nose and sneezing, or stomach cramps, after eating eggs, contact a doctor immediately. The doctor will provide consultation, advice, and treatment needed according to your condition.",

        "title": "Milk Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Milk Allergy Milk allergy is a condition in which a person\u2019s immune system reacts to cow\u2019s milk protein and its derivatives. This allergy is prone to targeting children, although some adults can also experience this allergy throughout their lives. These allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe and can affect the digestive system, skin, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. This allergy can also mean a reaction of the immune system to products derived from milk. This condition is generally prone to occur in children, especially when consuming cow\u2019s milk or its derivatives. However, it is possible that this condition can be caused by goat\u2019s milk, sheep\u2019s milk, or other mammals. The milk proteins that most often cause allergies are whey and casein. Milk Allergy Symptoms Allergy symptoms usually appear one hour after consuming milk. Symptoms include: Vomit. The breath sounds wheezy. Redness of the skin. Itchy. Swollen. Diarrhea or loose stools accompanied by blood in the stool. Stomach cramps. Cough. Runny nose. Watery eyes. Itchy red rash around the mouth. The presence of colic in babies is characterized by the baby crying non-stop and without any clear reason. Allergy symptoms usually appear within minutes to hours after consuming cow\u2019s milk products and their derivatives. However, in some cases, symptoms may appear within 24 to 48 hours. In severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) the following symptoms may occur: The airways and throat are blocked, resulting in shortness of breath. Blood pressure drops drastically. Red face and itching all over the body. First-aid measures should be taken if anaphylaxis occurs. Sufferers should immediately receive medical help at the hospital. Risk Factors Some people are at higher risk of developing allergies (susceptible) than others. Some of these include: There is a history of allergies in family members, for example asthma, eczema, rhinitis, hay fever. Babies and children are more susceptible to it because their digestive system is not yet perfect. However, this condition will improve with age and maturity of the digestive tract. There is a history of atopic dermatitis (skin inflammation originating from allergies in children). Having allergies to other foods that generally develop after the allergy occurs. Causes of Milk Allergy The main cause of this allergy is a disruption in the sufferer\u2019s immune system which incorrectly identifies the protein in milk as a substance that is harmful to the body. This triggers the immune system to produce Immunoglobulin E to neutralize the allergen and release histamine into the blood, causing allergy symptoms. Milk allergy is different from lactose intolerance. If the allergy is caused by a disorder of the immune system, while lactose intolerance occurs because the body is not yet able to accept certain substances, and has nothing to do with the sufferer\u2019s immune system. This allergy occurs when a person\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies cow\u2019s milk protein as a threat and produces antibodies to fight it. It causes allergic reactions when a person consumes cow\u2019s milk products and its derivatives. Some of the most common cow\u2019s milk proteins that cause allergies are casein and whey. Risk factors for developing this allergy include: Family history of allergies This allergy History of other food allergies Age: children are more likely to experience this allergy than adults. Digestive disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) High environmental exposure to allergens Milk Allergy Diagnosis Some steps that the doctor will take to confirm the diagnosis are as follows: Asking about the sufferer and their family\u2019s history of allergies, including what foods and drinks they have eaten, the allergy symptoms that arise, and whether the symptoms decrease or disappear when the food is stopped. Physical examination to check for indications of allergies in the sufferer\u2019s body. Blood sample testing to check the levels of Immunoglobulin E antibodies in the sufferer\u2019s blood. Test through the skin, usually by making a small wound on the surface of the sufferer\u2019s skin. The small wound on the skin will show a small amount of milk protein. If during observation a small itchy lump appears in the area, it indicates a milk allergy. Milk Allergy Complications Children who experience this condition are at greater risk of experiencing other health problems, such as: Allergies to other foods, such as eggs, soy, peanuts, or beef. Hay fever. This is a common reaction to pet dander, dust mites, grass pollen, and other substances. Milk Allergy Treatment In children, this condition will disappear with age. However, in some cases, there are children who continue to have allergies into adulthood. The most important treatment is to avoid milk and food products containing milk. Consumption of drugs to reduce allergy symptoms are: Antihistamines have the benefit of reducing discomfort due to symptoms originating from allergic reactions. Adrenaline to treat severe allergy symptoms (anaphylaxis) by injection by a doctor. Milk Allergy Prevention Avoiding allergies to milk is by not consuming milk or products containing milk or milk protein. Some products that contain milk or its proteins are butter, yogurt, pudding, cakes, ice cream, cheese, foods containing lactose or lactate, candy, chocolate, caramel, and products containing whey and casein. In breastfeeding mothers, the way to prevent cow\u2019s milk allergy in babies is to provide exclusive breastfeeding without adding formula milk or other drinks and foods during the first 6 months of the baby\u2019s life. Breast milk is considered the best food and can prevent allergies in babies. If a baby has been diagnosed with this allergy, the doctor will advise the mother not to consume cow\u2019s milk or products containing cow\u2019s milk so that the substance does not enter the baby through breast milk. If your child is not breastfed, there are several alternatives. Giving hypoallergenic formula milk, soy milk, or rice milk can be an alternative substitute to prevent symptoms. Mothers can consult a doctor if their child has symptoms and provide replacement formula milk according to the doctor\u2019s recommendations.",

        "text": "Allergies in Children Allergies are a problem with the immune system. Normally, the human body defends itself against harmful things, such as viruses or bacteria. However, sometimes the defense system violently attacks something that is actually harmless, such as dust, pollen, or mold. Allergy triggers are called allergens. When a child with allergies is exposed to that allergen, their immune system mistakenly believes it is harmful to their body. As a result, their body\u2019s defenses overreact, treating the substance as an invader and trying to fight it off. To protect the body, the immune system makes antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). These cause certain cells to release chemicals (including histamine) into the bloodstream to defend against the allergen \u201cinvader.\u201d The release of these chemicals is what causes allergic reactions. Reactions can affect the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and future exposure to the same allergen will trigger the allergic response again. Allergy Symptoms in Children Allergic reactions can occur anywhere in the body. This includes the skin, eyes, stomach lining, nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. This is where immune system cells can be found to fight germs that are inhaled, swallowed, or come into contact with the skin. Allergic reactions can cause children to experience the following symptoms: Stuffy nose, sneezing, itching, or runny nose, and itching in the ears or roof of the mouth. Red, itchy, watery eyes. Red, itchy, dry skin. Hives or itchy bumps. Itchy rash. Asthma symptoms, such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing. A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can also occur. This can cause difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, fainting, or death. Risk Factors for Allergies in Children Any child can develop allergies, but the condition is more common in children from families with a history of allergies. This is because allergies can be passed down through genes from parents to children. However, it does not mean that children who have parents with allergies will definitely experience it too. A person usually does not inherit a specific allergy, but only the possibility of having an allergy. Some children can develop the health condition, even though no family member has allergies. In addition to genetics, children who are allergic to one thing are also at high risk of developing allergies to others. Causes of Allergies in Children There are many things that can trigger allergic reactions in children. However, the most common triggers or allergens are: Tree, grass, and weed pollen. Natural rubber latex. Mold. Dust mites. Fur, urine, or oil from animal skin. Certain types of foods, such as eggs, nuts, milk. Some types of drugs. Hair. Bee sting. Pests such as cockroaches and rats. Diagnosis of Allergies in Children If your child has flu-like symptoms that last more than a week or two or has the \u2018flu\u2019 at the same time every year, take him to the doctor. The doctor will likely take your child\u2019s complete medical history and recommend allergy testing. Here are some tests that can be used to diagnose allergies in children: 1. Skin test This is the most common allergy test. A skin test measures the presence of IgE antibodies to a specific allergen (such as food, pollen, or animal dander). In this test procedure, a small amount of diluted allergen is placed on the skin. The area is pricked or scratched. If a person is allergic to the allergen, a small bump (like a mosquito bite) appears after about 15 minutes. 2. Blood test This test measures IgE antibodies to specific allergens in the blood. A blood test may be used if your child cannot have a skin test because they have a skin condition or if they are very sensitive to a particular allergen. However, a positive blood test does not always mean that the child has a specific allergy. The positive result still needs to be interpreted by a doctor who is familiar with the test and the child\u2019s medical history. 3. Challenge test This test needs to be supervised by an allergist. A small amount of the allergen will be given to the child by mouth (consumed) or inhaled. Only a challenge test can tell how severe an allergy is. A skin or blood test reaction only tells you the likelihood of some type of reaction, not how severe it is. Allergy Treatment in Children There is no cure for allergies, but you can manage the symptoms. The best way to manage them is to avoid the allergen. Parents should talk frequently with their children about allergies themselves and the reactions they may experience if they consume or come into contact with allergens. Tell all caregivers, from nurses to teachers, about your child\u2019s allergies. If avoiding allergens is not possible, your doctor can prescribe medications, including antihistamines, eye drops, and nasal sprays. In some cases, doctors recommend allergy shots (immunotherapy) to help desensitize a child to an allergen. However, this treatment is only useful for allergens such as dust, mold, pollen, animals, and insect stings. Allergy shots are not used for food allergies. Allergy Complications in Children Here are some allergy complications that can occur in children: Anaphylaxis. This is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening for a child. Asthma. If a child has allergies, they are more likely to develop asthma. This is triggered by exposure to allergens in the environment (allergy-induced asthma). Sinusitis and ear or lung infections. The risk of developing these conditions is higher if you have a cold or asthma. Allergy Prevention in Children Here are some ways that can be done to prevent allergies: Stay indoors on windy days to avoid blowing pollen around. Clean as much dust as possible in the house, especially in the child\u2019s bedroom. Use air conditioning instead of opening windows. Place the dehumidifier in a humid area of \u200b\u200byour home. But remember to clean it often. After playing outside, ask your child to immediately take a shower or bath, wash his hair, and change clothes. Avoid traveling or vacationing to places where pollen is high, such as parks, etc.",

        "text": "What is a Drug Allergy? A drug allergy is an allergic reaction of the immune system to a particular drug. The immune system misidentifies a drug as a substance that is harmful to the body. Both chemical and herbal drugs can cause allergic reactions. The immune system basically helps protect the body from disease. The immune system is designed to fight disease-causing agents, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and other harmful substances. However, in cases of drug allergies, the immune system mistakes the drug entering the body as one of the body\u2019s invaders. The body responds to the drug as a threat, so the immune system begins to make antibodies. It is a special protein programmed to attack threats. But unfortunately in this case it is a drug that is being attacked. Drug Allergy Symptoms Symptoms usually occur a few hours after taking the drug. However, symptoms can also develop gradually, not appearing immediately when first using the drug. In some cases, new symptoms appear after a few days or weeks of using the drug. Common symptoms experienced by sufferers include: Red rash or bumps on the skin. Itchy. Fever. Swollen. Shortness of breath or noisy breathing. Runny nose. Cough. Itchy and watery eyes. In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis may be accompanied by: The heart beats fast. The airways and throat narrow, making it difficult to breathe. Restless and anxious. Dizzy. Loss of consciousness or fainting. Blood pressure drops drastically. In very serious and life-threatening conditions, symptoms may be accompanied by: The skin is reddish and painful. The outer skin peels off. The skin looks blistered. Fever. The rash or blisters spread to the eyes, mouth, and genital area. If severe or very serious allergy symptoms are found, the sufferer must be rushed to the hospital immediately. Causes of Drug Allergies It\u2019s possible that you may not be aware of your initial exposure to a drug. Some evidence suggests that some drugs, such as antibiotics, may be good for the immune system in making antibodies. Some drug allergic reactions may occur through a different process. Researchers believe that some drugs may bind directly to a type of white blood cell (T cell) in the immune system. This event triggers the release of chemicals that can cause an allergic reaction the first time a person uses the drug. Allergies are also caused by the immune system incorrectly identifying a drug as a substance that is harmful to the body. As a result, the body will produce antibodies and cause allergic symptoms to arise. Some drugs that can cause allergies are: Antibiotics (for example Penicillin). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (anti-inflammatory). Aspirin. Corticosteroid creams or lotions. Anti-seizure (anticonvulsant). Autoimmune disease medications. Herbal medicines. Insulin. Vaccine. Hyperthyroidism medications. Chemotherapy drugs. Drugs for HIV and AIDS infections. Bee pollen products. Contrast materials used in imaging tests ( radiocontrast media ). Anesthetics. Drug Allergy Risk Factors Not everyone is at risk for it. Some risk factors are: Increased exposure to a drug, for example, due to repeated use, over a long period of time, or at high doses. Heredity. If a family member has an allergy to a drug, a person is at greater risk of developing it. Having other types of allergies, such as food allergies. Having allergies to other drugs, for example, someone who is allergic to penicillin will also be allergic to amoxicillin. Having certain diseases, such as HIV or Epstein-Barr virus infection. Drug Allergy Diagnosis Diagnosis is carried out through several steps, including: Travel history of drug allergies, history of other allergies, and family history of allergies. Physical examination related to allergy symptoms, including red rashes, blisters, and checking the condition of the sufferer\u2019s respiratory tract and heart. Laboratory tests include skin tests and blood tests. Drug Allergy Treatment How to manage this condition depends on how severe it is. With a severe reaction, a person should avoid the drug completely. The doctor may replace the drug with another type of anti-inflammatory drug that does not cause allergies. If someone has a mild reaction, their doctor may still prescribe it. However, it is also possible that the doctor will prescribe other medications to control allergic reactions. Certain medications can help block the immune response and reduce symptoms. These medications include: Antihistamines The body makes histamine when an allergen enters the body. The release of histamine can trigger allergy symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation. Antihistamines block the production of histamine and can calm the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Antihistamines come in the form of pills, eye drops, creams, and nasal sprays. Corticosteroids This condition can cause swelling of the airways and other serious symptoms. Corticosteroids can help reduce the inflammation that causes these problems. Bronchodilator If allergies cause wheezing or coughing, your doctor may recommend a bronchodilator. This medicine helps open the airways and makes breathing easier. Bronchodilators are available as liquids and powders for use in inhalers or nebulizers. Drug Allergy Prevention If you have a drug allergy, the best prevention is to avoid the problem drug. Steps you can take to prevent this include: Inform your doctor or healthcare provider. Make sure that the allergy is clearly identified in your medical records. Also inform other healthcare providers, such as your dentist or other medical specialists. Wear identification that shows drug allergies. This can be a medical alert bracelet that identifies allergies. This information can ensure proper care in an emergency.",

        "text": "Health Benefits of Black Rice: Black rice, also known as forbidden or purple rice, is a variety of rice that belongs to the Oryza sativa L. species. The distinctive black-purple color of black rice comes from a pigment called anthocyanin, which has powerful antioxidant properties. This deep purple-black rice variety is not only beautiful but also has a long history of being consumed by the wealthy and royalty. In ancient China, it was forbidden for all but royalty to eat black rice. However, today it is a staple in numerous cuisines around the world, due to its mild, nutty flavor, chewy texture, and nutritional benefits. There are two varieties of Oryza sativa rice, japonica and indica. Japonica is a stickier and short-grained rice that is grown in drier, upland fields, while indica is a long-grained rice that is grown in submerged, lowland fields.5 Health Benefits of Turmeric CoffeeBlack rice has a number of health benefits. The deep color of the grain is attributed to the presence of anthocyanins, which have potent antioxidant properties. These pigments help to protect cells against damage, and they can also help to reduce inflammation and the risk of cardiovascular conditions. In addition, eating black rice can help to improve heart health and overall fitness.Let us read some more health benefits of black rice below.1. Improves Heart Health: Research on black rice\u2019s impact on heart health is limited. However, many of its antioxidants, including flavonoids and anthocyanins, have been found to contribute to heart health. Flavonoids have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease and death, while anthocyanins may improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels.2. Supports Weight Loss: Black rice is a good source of protein and fiber. These nutrients can aid in weight loss by reducing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness. Early animal research suggests that anthocyanins, present in black rice, may contribute to reduced body weight and body fat percentage. While human studies on black rice\u2019s role in weight loss are limited, it is effective in promoting weight reduction when combined with brown rice.5 Health Benefits of Sparkling Water3. Promotes Eye Health: Black rice contains high amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are carotenoids that support eye health. These compounds act as antioxidants, protecting the eyes from potentially harmful free radicals. Lutein and zeaxanthin, in particular, have been shown to safeguard the retina by filtering out harmful blue light waves.4. Reduces Cancer Risk: Black rice contains anthocyanins, which have been linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, according to a review of population-based studies. More research is needed to fully understand the ability of anthocyanins in black rice to prevent and combat the spread of specific types of cancer.5 Health Benefits of Jasmine Rice5. Helps in Managing Diabetes: Flavonoids, such as anthocyanins present in black rice, have a positive impact on the body. They enhance insulin sensitivity, allowing the cells to make better use of glucose. Additionally, they reduce sugar digestion in the small intestines, leading to low blood sugar levels.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "text": "Health Benefits of Probiotics: Probiotic supplements are live microorganisms that claim to enhance human health by altering the bacteria and other microorganisms in the digestive tract. Probiotics are found in fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, kombucha, and pickles. They are also available as dietary supplements.Although probiotics are gaining popularity due to their potential to promote digestive health and improve symptoms of certain medical conditions, they are not safe for everyone.Probiotic supplements contain high concentrations of beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts. They may contain a single or multiple strains of probiotics. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most common probiotic species in these supplements. Let us read about the health benefits of probiotics below.5 Health Benefits of Black RiceFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of probiotics.1. Maintain Microbiome: Probiotics alter the levels of microorganisms in the intestines, improving the overall composition, which is referred to as microbiome. When that composition is out of balance, doctors refer to it as dysbiosis. Probiotics can treat dysbiosis by increasing the number of beneficial bacteria and decreasing the number of harmful bacteria.2. Promote Weight Loss: It is believed that probiotics can aid in weight loss as the microbes in our gut play a vital role in breaking down food and converting it into energy. A healthy microbiome is thought to enhance calorie burning and reduce fat storage. Research has revealed differences in gut microbes between obese and lean individuals. However, studies on the effectiveness of probiotics for weight loss have yielded inconsistent findings. Some studies have shown that individuals consuming probiotics experienced greater weight and body fat loss compared to those who did not, while other studies reported no significant difference. Surprisingly, a few studies even observed weight gain among those taking probiotics.5 Health Benefits of Turmeric Coffee3. Prevents Infections: The beneficial microbes that live in different parts of our bodies help us in a variety of ways. One of the most important ways is by fighting off the more harmful types of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites that might also want to live with us. Probiotics, in theory, fight on the side of our beneficial microbes. Many probiotic products are formulated with beneficial bacteria and yeasts to prevent or recover from bacterial or yeast infections in different body parts, including atopic dermatitis of the skin, dental cavities, vaginal and urinary tract infections (UTIs), and more.4. Enhance Mental Health: Several studies have linked gut health to mood and mental health. According to researchers, probiotic supplements may play a critical role in some mental health disorders. Supplementing for 1-2 months with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains has been shown to enhance anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and memory, as per a review of human studies.5 Health Benefits of Sparkling Water5. Promote Heart Health: Probiotics may contribute to heart health by lowering LDL bad) cholesterol and blood pressure. Certain lactic acid-producing bacteria can reduce cholesterol by breaking down bile in the gut. Bile, a naturally occurring fluid primarily composed of cholesterol, aids in digestion. By breaking down bile, probiotics prevent its reabsorption in the gut, thereby reducing the amount of cholesterol that can enter the blood. High cholesterol level in the blood is one of the main reasons behind many heart issues.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Hepatitis E: Here's Everything You Need To Know",
        "text": "Hepatitis E is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). It is a waterborne disease that primarily affects the liver and is most common in regions with poor sanitation, such as parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Central America. Hepatitis E can be acute but usually does not become chronic, and in most cases, people recover fully. However, it can be dangerous for pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems. In this article, we discuss the signs, causes, and prevention tips for hepatitis E. Causes 1. Contaminated water The virus is most often spread through drinking water that has been contaminated with faeces containing the hepatitis E virus. Outbreaks typically occur in areas with poor sanitation or during natural disasters that disrupt water systems. 2. Undercooked or contaminated food In some cases, eating raw or undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish (which may carry HEV) can also transmit the virus, especially in developed countries. 3. Poor hygiene practices The virus can be transmitted through contact with an infected person's stool, such as when hygiene practices (like handwashing) are not followed after using the bathroom. 4. Blood transfusions Rarely, hepatitis E can spread through transfusions of infected blood, especially in countries where the virus is endemic. Signs Hepatitis E usually presents symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 6 weeks. While some cases may be asymptomatic (especially in children), the common signs and symptoms of hepatitis E include: Fatigue: Feeling unusually tired and weak.Jaundice: A yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by increased bilirubin levels.Dark Urine and Pale Stools: The liver's reduced ability to process bilirubin causes darker urine and pale, clay-coloured stools.Abdominal Pain: Typically felt in the upper right side of the abdomen, where the liver is located.Nausea and Vomiting: A general feeling of sickness, including loss of appetite and frequent vomiting.Fever: A mild fever may accompany other symptoms.Joint and Muscle Pain: Body aches are common during the acute phase.Enlarged Liver (Hepatomegaly): In some cases, the liver may become swollen and tender. Prevention tips Preventing hepatitis E involves proper hygiene and sanitation practices, especially in areas where the virus is prevalent. Here are some prevention strategies: Always drink clean, safe, and treated water. If you are in a region with questionable water quality, boil water before drinking, or use bottled water for drinking and cooking.Especially in areas with poor sanitation, avoid eating raw or undercooked meats (especially pork and shellfish) and fruits or vegetables that may have been washed in contaminated water.Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water, especially after using the bathroom, handling food, or coming into contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or materials.Ensure proper disposal of human waste and use appropriate sewage treatment systems to avoid contaminating water sources.In regions where hepatitis E is common, blood donations should be carefully screened for HEV.Although not widely available, a vaccine for hepatitis E (Hecolin) is licensed in China and may become more available in the future, especially in high-risk areas. Follow these prevention tips and look out for the signs and causes to reduce your risk of hepatitis E. Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Cod Liver Oil",
        "text": "Cod liver oil, a popular supplement derived from Atlantic cod fish, boasts a wealth of health benefits due to its rich content of essential nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. While similar to regular fish oil, cod liver oil stands out due to its higher vitamin D content, making it a valuable source of this often-deficient vitamin.Consuming cod liver oil may positively impact blood lipid levels, reduce inflammation, and strengthen bones. Athletes commonly use it to aid in muscle recovery.Both cod liver oil and regular fish oil are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are known for their anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects. However, cod liver oil is particularly noteworthy for its vitamin A content, crucial for immune system function, cellular growth, eye health, and reproduction.5 Health Benefits of Ridge GourdVitamin D, another abundant nutrient in cod liver oil, plays a vital role in bone health and brain development. Deficiency in vitamin D is a global concern, affecting over a billion people, and has been linked to various health issues, including bone fractures, metabolic syndrome, and potentially heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.Supplementing with cod liver oil offers a potent way to increase the intake of these essential vitamins and fatty acids, potentially providing numerous health advantages.Following are some of the impressive health benefits of cod liver oil.1. Improves Heart Health: The high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in cod liver oil helps reduce triglycerides, a type of fat in the body, and may contribute to preventing heart disease. While limited studies have specifically examined the effects of cod liver oil, numerous studies support the positive role of omega-3 fatty acids in heart health.2. Reduces Blood Lipid Levels: Cod liver oil can help balance lipid levels in the body, potentially reducing the risk of hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol. Although research specifically on cod liver oil is limited, some studies have observed a decrease in lipid levels when participants combined cod liver oil with cholesterol medications.5 Health Benefits of Probiotics3. Decreases Inflammation: Cod liver oil exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties. Vitamins A and D, both found in cod liver oil, act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, aiding in muscle recovery from soreness caused by inflammation.4. Improves Bone Health: Preserving bone health is of paramount importance as you advance in age. This is because your body starts losing bone mass after you turn 40. This can lead to fractures later in life, especially after menopause. Cod liver oil is an excellent dietary source of vitamin D and may reduce age-related bone loss. It does this by aiding your body in the absorption of calcium from the gut, which is a vital mineral for strong bones.5 Health Benefits of Black Rice5. Supports Eye Health: Over 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from vision loss, which is a serious health issue. Although there are many causes of vision loss, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma are two of the more common ones, and both can be caused by persistent inflammation. According to certain studies, glaucoma risk factors such as nerve damage and ocular pressure are decreased by omega-3 fatty acids. Cod liver oil is rich in Vitamin A, which in turn serves many health benefits. Diets rich in vitamin A may greatly reduce the risk of glaucoma and AMD compared to the low vitamin A diets. Although vitamin A is excellent for eye health, taking excessive amounts may lead to vitamin A toxicity and several associated health issues.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Alopecia Areata Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alopecia Areata Alopecia is the medical term for hair loss. One type is alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease, a condition in which the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body itself. This disease attacks hair follicles. Hair follicles are the structures where hair grows. This disease causes hair follicles on the head, face, or body to become smaller and stop producing hair, initially causing hair loss and eventually baldness if left untreated. Symptoms of Alopecia Areata Symptoms caused by alopecia areata include: Baldness in a circular pattern in one or more areas where hair used to grow, which is temporary but can also be permanent. Baldness that can spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) and even the entire body (alopecia universalis). Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, in the form of nails that change shape, have white lines with a thin and rough surface or are split. Baldness that can be accompanied by a burning or itching sensation on the scalp. Risk Factors for Alopecia Areata Various risk factors for alopecia areata include: History of the same disease in family members. Increasing age. Other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus erythematosus. Having abnormal nail color, shape, texture, or thickness. Psychological problems, such as stress, depression, anxiety, or paranoid disorders. Causes of Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system mistakenly attacks other parts of the body, in this case hair follicles. When this happens, hair growth shrinks and slows, and hair begins to fall out, often in clumps. The more hair follicles the immune system attacks, the more hair will fall out. The extent of hair loss varies. In some cases, it occurs in only a few places. However, hair loss can be more extensive. In some rare cases, a person can lose all the hair on their head (alopecia areata totalis) or their entire body (alopecia areata universalis). It is still not known for certain why the immune system attacks hair follicles. It is believed that a person\u2019s genetic makeup can be a trigger for autoimmune reactions to alopecia areata. In addition to genetics, alopecia areata can also be triggered by other autoimmune disorders. In a study found that people with a family history of alopecia areata, also have a personal history or other family members who suffer from other autoimmune disorders such as atopy. Atopy is a disorder characterized by a tendency towards hypoallergic, thyroiditis, and vitiligo. Types of Alopecia Areata There are several types of alopecia areata. Each type is characterized by the level of hair loss and other symptoms that may be experienced. Here are the types of alopecia areata: Patchy alopecia areata, the main characteristic of this type is that there are areas or patches of hair loss that only occur in certain areas of the body. Alopecia totalis occurs when hair loss affects the entire scalp. Alopecia universalis is hair loss that occurs not only in the head area but also other areas of the body. For example, the face, eyebrows, even eyelashes. Diffuse alopecia areata, this condition occurs when hair thins suddenly all over the scalp. Ophiasis alopecia is hair loss that occurs along the sides and in the lower scalp area. Diagnosis of Alopecia Areata There are several ways to diagnose alopecia areata. These include a physical examination, a medical interview, and if necessary, taking a skin biopsy sample and blood tests. Physical examination The doctor will examine the area of \u200b\u200bhair loss and the level of hair loss. In the area of \u200b\u200bhair loss, the hair will be pulled out slowly and it will be observed whether the hair comes off easily. Next, the doctor will examine the hair and follicles to see what their shape is, whether it is normal or not. Then the doctor will examine the nails. Medical interview Such as asking about current illnesses or family medical history. Performing a scalp biopsy sample The goal is to find out other causes of hair loss, such as a fungal infection called tinea capitis. During the biopsy, a small portion of the scalp is removed and then analyzed in a laboratory using a microscope. Blood test This supporting examination is performed if the patient is suspected of having an autoimmune disease. Blood tests are intended to check for abnormal antibodies, C-reactive protein levels, iron, thyroid hormones, testosterone hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Complications of Alopecia Areata Some complications of alopecia areata include: Baldness becomes permanent. Have a greater risk of developing or having a family history of asthma, allergies, and other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease and vitiligo. Psychological disorders in the form of emotional disorders due to lost self-confidence, which can develop into depression. Alopecia Areata Treatment Until now, a suitable treatment to cure alopecia areata has not been found. The treatment given aims to stimulate hair growth to grow back faster. The most common forms of alopecia areata treatment are corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs that can suppress the immune system. Most of these treatments are given through local injections, ointments, or oral medications. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that affect the body\u2019s immune system. They can be injected through the scalp or other areas. Corticosteroids can also be given as pills or applied to the skin as ointments, creams, or foams. Topical immunotherapy is a type of therapy used to treat baldness and stimulate hair growth. The treatment method is to apply chemicals to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction. If successful, this reaction can cause hair to grow back. Other medications prescribed to promote hair growth and suppress the immune system include minoxidil, anthralin, SADBE, and DCPC. While they help hair regrowth, they do not prevent new bald patches from forming. In addition to the treatment, alopecia areata sufferers are also advised to provide more protection in bald areas. Alopecia areata sufferers can use sunscreen when doing outdoor activities, or wear glasses to protect the eyes from sunlight and dirt. In addition, sufferers also need to use head protection such as hats, wigs, and scarves so that the scalp can be protected from sunlight, or to keep the scalp warm when the air is cold. Prevention of Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata cannot be prevented because the cause is unknown. This autoimmune disorder may be caused by several factors. Including family history, other autoimmune conditions, and even other skin conditions. However, there are several preventive measures that can be taken, including: Limit the use of hair care devices that risk damaging or drying out hair. Limit the use of chemicals for hair.",

        "title": "Aortic Aneurysm Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Aortic Aneurysm\n\nAn aortic aneurysm is a condition where there is a balloon-like bulge that usually occurs due to weakening of the muscles in the aorta wall.\n\nThe aorta is the largest and most important blood vessel in the human body. Its function is to distribute oxygenated blood from the heart to all parts of the body.\n\nThe aorta has thick walls so it can maintain its shape even though the blood pressure inside it is relatively high.\n\nThis wall is actually strong and thick. However, in this condition, the wall becomes weak so that it is unable to withstand blood pressure.\n\nAs a result, the wall will start to enlarge. If the wall is torn or broken, this condition can cause bleeding, and can even be fatal.\n\nSymptoms of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nSymptoms of an aortic aneurysm can vary depending on its location. For example, in the abdominal aorta, chest (thoracic) or both (thoraco-abdominal).\n\nHowever, abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common than thoracic or both locations.\n\nIn some conditions, aneurysms with small swelling or bulging usually do not show any symptoms.\n\nHowever, if it gets bigger, then the sufferer will start to feel many symptoms depending on its location. For abdominal aneurysm sufferers, the symptoms that appear are:\n\nProlonged pain in the inner or side of the abdomen.\nPain in the back.\nIt feels like a throbbing sensation around the navel.\n\nMeanwhile, the symptoms that appear if you experience a thoracic or chest aneurysm include:\n\nBreath becomes short.\nFrequent coughing.\nThe voice becomes hoarse.\nFeeling pressure and pain in the chest.\nPain in the back.\n\nFurthermore, symptoms that may appear if the aortic aneurysm tears or ruptures (dissection), namely:\n\nSevere pain that occurs suddenly in the back, chest, and abdomen.\nDifficulty breathing.\nThe body feels very weak.\nMy head felt like it was spinning.\nThe heart beats very fast.\n\nMake sure a ruptured aortic aneurysm is treated immediately. Otherwise, it can cause severe bleeding which can be fatal.\n\nRisk Factors for Aortic Aneurysm\n\nIt is important to know the risk factors for aortic aneurysm, as this condition often appears during examinations for other conditions.\n\nWell, here are the various risk factors:\n\nThe risk of aortic aneurysm tends to increase with age. Older people have a greater chance of developing an aortic aneurysm.\n\nMen are at higher risk than women. However, women who have a family history of aortic aneurysm or other risk factors are also at higher risk.\n\nSmoking is a major risk factor for developing an aortic aneurysm. The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the artery walls and weaken them.\n\nFamily history\n\nIf a family member has had an aortic aneurysm, your risk of having one may increase because there are genetic factors involved.\n\nHypertension and heart disease\n\nHigh blood pressure can damage artery walls and increase the risk of this disease.\n\nSome congenital heart defects or medical conditions that affect blood flow in the body can also increase the risk of an aortic aneurysm.\n\nHistory of infection and injury\n\nInfections in the wall of the aorta, such as endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), can cause inflammation and damage the artery wall.\n\nInjury to the chest or abdomen, such as in a car accident or other traumatic event, can cause damage to the aortic wall and trigger the formation of an aneurysm.\n\nConnective tissue disease\n\nSome diseases that affect connective tissue, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, or other connective tissue diseases, can weaken the artery walls and increase the risk of aneurysm.\n\nThis condition can increase pressure on the arteries and worsen the risk of aneurysm.\n\nIn addition, doctors usually recommend that someone with the following criteria undergo screening:\n\nAged 65 or older.\nMale gender.\nHaving a bad habit of smoking.\nHave high blood pressure.\nSuffering from high cholesterol.\nThe presence of diabetes mellitus.\nHaving a family history of aneurysms.\nHaving a genetic disorder, such as Marfan syndrome. You can read the article Marfan Syndrome for complete information on this disease.\n\nCauses of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nThe cause of an aortic aneurysm is the weakening of one part of the blood vessel, resulting in a lump that is at risk of rupturing at any time.\n\nThe exact cause of this weakening of the blood vessels can vary from person to person, ranging from blood vessel disease, injury, to uncertain conditions.\n\nThis condition is divided into two types, namely:\n\n1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs along the abdominal aorta. This type of aneurysm is the most common, accounting for about \u00be of cases.\n\nThe cause of abdominal aortic aneurysm is still uncertain, but it is likely related to atherosclerosis, smoking, high blood pressure, and genetics.\n\n2. Thoracic aortic aneurysm\n\nThoracic aortic aneurysms occur along the thoracic aorta. This type of aneurysm is less common.\n\nThis condition is usually genetically related or can occur in people born with bicuspid aortic valve conditions, Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome.\n\nOther causes that can lead to the emergence of an aortic aneurysm are high blood pressure, infection, atherosclerosis, high cholesterol, and trauma.\n\nDiagnosis of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nThe doctor will diagnose an aortic aneurysm by conducting a physical examination, medical interview, and radiological examination.\n\nDuring a physical examination, the doctor will examine the patient\u2019s heart to detect blood flow problems. Then, the doctor will examine the legs and feet.\n\n1. Medical interview\n\nAt this stage, the doctor will ask questions covering the symptoms experienced by the sufferer.\n\nFor example, when the symptoms started, whether the sufferer smokes or not, the patient\u2019s and family\u2019s medical history, and whether the patient has had a recent chest injury.\n\n2. Radiological examination\n\nThis examination has several purposes.\n\nSuch as determining the location of the aneurysm, estimating the size of the lump, how fast it is growing, finding out if there are other blood vessels that are infected, and looking for blood clots or inflammation.\n\nThese tests include ultrasound, CT SCAN or MRA, echocardiogram, and angiogram.\n\nThe ultrasound test aims to help doctors check the size of the aneurysm.\n\nAdditionally, doctors perform this test to follow any changes in the aneurysm and help measure the risk of rupture of the aneurysm.\n\n4. CT scan and MRA\n\nThe doctor will perform a computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) examination if a more detailed examination is necessary.\n\nThis examination aims to determine the relationship between the aneurysm and the renal blood vessels or other organs, as well as to see the growth of the thoracic aortic aneurysm.\n\n5. Echocardiogram\n\nAn echocardiogram is an ultrasound that is used to study the heart.\n\nIn order to diagnose a thoracic aneurysm, a person may undergo one of these procedures, either a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).\n\n6. Angiogram\n\nAn angiogram is a procedure that can help doctors determine the size of the aneurysm, check for aortic dissection or blood clots, and see if other blood vessels are involved.\n\nAortic Aneurysm Treatment\n\nThe main goal of aortic aneurysm therapy or treatment is to prevent the blood vessel from rupturing.\n\nThe doctor will look at the size and other possible risk factors in the sufferer to determine the type of therapy.\n\nHere\u2019s how to treat it based on the type of aneurysm:\n\n1. Abdominal Aneurysm\n\nSpecifically for abdominal aneurysms, doctors usually determine the choice of therapy based on their size.\n\n3-4.4 centimeters: the size is still small, so the doctor will recommend having a routine ultrasound examination every year to monitor the enlargement of the aneurysm.\n4.5\u20145.4 centimeters: medium size, so you need an ultrasound examination every three months to monitor the enlargement of the aneurysm.\n5.5 centimeters or more: size in the large category, usually requires surgery to prevent further enlargement or rupture of the aneurysm.\n\nIn addition to regular check-ups, doctors also prescribe medication to prevent or reduce the risk of a ruptured or torn aorta.\n\nSome types of drugs include:\n\nStatin drugs are used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of aortic blockage due to atherosclerosis.\nBeta-blockers are a group of drugs that help lower blood pressure by slowing the heart rate.\nAngiotensin 2 receptor blocker (ARB) drugs are used to lower blood pressure if beta blocker drugs do not provide optimal results.\n\n2. Thoracic Aneurysm\n\nMeanwhile, in thoracic aortic aneurysm, doctors provide treatment based on the size of the aneurysm, the severity of the symptoms that appear, and the risk of surgery.\n\nThoracic aortic aneurysm therapy includes:\n\nRoutine monitoring\n\nThis type of therapy is a therapeutic option for small aneurysms that are not at risk of rupture.\n\nUsually, the doctor will recommend a routine CT scan or MRI every 6 months (depending on the size of the aneurysm) to see if the aneurysm is enlarged.\n\nBecause it is potentially fatal, you also need to know what first aid is like when experiencing this condition.\n\nConventional surgery\n\nDoctors will recommend this procedure in cases where the aneurysm is large and at risk of rupture.\n\nConventional surgery is performed using general anesthesia and the installation of a special device (graft) to prevent blood flow from pressing on the aneurysm further.\n\nEndovascular surgery\n\nIt is a less invasive surgical procedure. This method uses a special tool that is inserted into the aorta through a small tear or through a catheter inserted into a leg vein.\n\nAfter the surgical procedure, the doctor will usually ask the patient to be disciplined in adopting a healthy lifestyle and diet.\n\nNot only does this habit help speed up the healing process, it also helps reduce the risk of aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\nSome of the efforts that doctors recommend include:\n\nDo not smoke.\nAvoid excessive thoughts and anxiety that can trigger stress.\nDo not do heavy physical activities, such as weight lifting.\nLimit fat intake so that blood cholesterol levels decrease.\n\nComplications of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nComplications from an aortic aneurysm can be life-threatening. Some conditions that may occur include:\n\nAortic dissection, which is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta wall. This condition causes blood to collect between the inner and middle layers of the aorta wall. As a result, the aorta can rupture or organs cannot get enough blood.\nAortic insufficiency and aortic regurgitation. Both occur when the aortic valve does not close properly because the adjacent part of the aorta is enlarged. This allows some blood to flow back into the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder, which can lead to heart failure.\nRupture of the aorta, which causes dangerous bleeding in the body and leads to shock.\nCardiac tamponade. This is compression of the heart due to increased fluid in the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart.\nKidney failure, due to lack of blood flow to the kidneys.\nLack of blood flow to the intestines, which causes inflammation and injury to the colon.\n\nAortic Aneurysm Prevention\n\nSome efforts you can try to reduce the risk of developing an aortic aneurysm are:\n\nImplement a healthy diet\n\nConsume foods that are rich in fiber, low in saturated fat, and low in salt to maintain healthy blood vessels.\n\nFruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and nuts are healthy food choices that can help maintain blood vessel elasticity.\n\nControl blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) can increase the risk of this condition. Therefore, measure your blood pressure regularly and follow your doctor\u2019s recommended guidelines for controlling your blood pressure.\n\nStop smoking\n\nSmoking can damage blood vessel walls and increase the risk of aneurysm.\n\nQuitting smoking is a very important step in maintaining healthy blood vessels and heart. This is why smokers are more susceptible to aortic aneurysm disorders.\n\nStay active\n\nExercising regularly can help maintain a healthy weight, improve blood circulation, and strengthen the heart muscle.\n\nTry to live an active lifestyle by doing physical activities that you enjoy.\n\nCholesterol control\n\nHigh cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increase the risk of aneurysms.\n\nControl cholesterol levels by eating low-cholesterol foods, exercising, and having regular check-ups.\n\nControl diabetes\n\nUncontrolled diabetes can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of this condition. Managing blood sugar levels well is an important step in preventing aneurysms.\n\nReduce stress\n\nChronic stress can negatively impact heart and blood vessel health. Find ways to reduce stress such as meditation, yoga, or enjoyable hobby activities.\n\nRoutine health checks\n\nHaving regular health checks can help detect risk factors or health conditions that require early attention.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nImmediately carry out an examination if you feel the symptoms as previously mentioned.\n\nAlso ask your doctor if you have high risk factors for this disease, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, genetics, or the bad habit of smoking.",

        "text": "Brain Aneurysm\n\nA brain aneurysm is a balloon-shaped bulge that forms in a blood vessel in the brain. At first glance, the bulge looks like a berry hanging from the brain stem. A brain aneurysm can leak or rupture and cause bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).\n\nA ruptured brain aneurysm most often occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A ruptured aneurysm is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nHowever, most cases are unruptured brain aneurysms. This condition does not cause any health problems or cause any symptoms. It is usually detected when the sufferer is undergoing an examination to diagnose another medical condition. In some cases, treatment for an unruptured brain aneurysm can prevent a future rupture.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Symptoms\n\nThe symptoms that appear are differentiated based on the severity of the disease experienced by the sufferer. The two types are unruptured brain aneurysm and ruptured brain aneurysm. Here is an explanation of each:\n\n1. Unruptured Brain Aneurysm\n\nUnruptured brain aneurysms generally do not cause symptoms in sufferers. New symptoms will appear when the size of the aneurysm gets bigger and presses on the nerve tissue in the brain. The following are symptoms experienced by sufferers of unruptured brain aneurysms:\n\nVision problems, such as vision loss or double vision.\nPain above or around the eye.\nNumbness or weakness on one side of the face.\nDifficulty speaking.\n\nLoss of balance.\nDifficulty concentrating.\nHaving problems with short-term memory.\n\n2. Ruptured Brain Aneurysm\n\nSymptoms of a ruptured brain aneurysm start with a sudden and excruciating headache. The pain is like being hit by a blunt object and feels very painful. The following are the symptoms experienced by people with a ruptured brain aneurysm:\n\nLoss of consciousness.\nConvulsions.\nFeeling sick.\nBlurred or double vision.\nSudden confusion.\nNeck feels stiff or sore.\nDecreased sensitivity to light.\nWeakness on one side of the body or a particular limb.\n\nCauses of Brain Aneurysm\n\nA brain aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. The brain requires a large blood supply. This blood supply is sent through 4 major blood vessels that run from the neck to the brain. These blood vessels divide into smaller vessels.\n\nIf you can imagine it, it is like a tree trunk that splits into branches and twigs. Most aneurysms develop at points where blood vessels divide and branch because these areas are considered weaker than other areas.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Risk Factors \n\nThere are several conditions or habits that increase a person\u2019s risk of developing a brain aneurysm. Here are some of them:\n\nSmoking. Smoking can significantly increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm. This is due to the harmful substances in tobacco smoke that damage the walls of blood vessels.\nHigh blood pressure. The risk is higher if you are a high blood pressure sufferer who is obese, consumes a lot of salt, eats less vegetables and fruits, and consumes excessive alcohol.\n\nFamily history. Having a parent, brother or sister with a history of brain aneurysm is an unavoidable risk factor.\n\nAge. The risk of developing a brain aneurysm increases with age. Most cases are diagnosed in people over the age of 40.\n\nGender. Women are at greater risk of developing a brain aneurysm than men because estrogen levels are significantly lower after menopause.\n\nWeakness in the blood vessels. In some cases, brain aneurysms are caused by a weakness in the blood vessels that is present at birth.\n\nSevere head injury. Brain aneurysms can develop after a severe brain injury, especially if blood vessels in the brain are damaged. This trigger is rare.\n\nAutosomal polycystic kidney disease. This is a genetic condition that causes many cysts to develop in the kidneys. Cysts are characterized by small, fluid-filled sacs.\n\nTissue disorders. Tissue disorders in people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan syndrome cause weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the body, including the brain.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta. This condition is characterized by a narrowing of the main artery in the body (aorta), which is present from birth. This disease is a common type of congenital heart disease.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Diagnosis \n\nThe correct step in diagnosing a brain aneurysm is to perform an examination. First of all, the sufferer will be asked about symptoms, previous illness history and family history of illness, as well as daily activities.\n\nIf there is a suspicion of a brain aneurysm, the doctor will perform a number of supporting examinations to confirm the diagnosis. Some of these supporting examinations include:\n\n1. CT Scan (A Computerized Tomography)\n\nThe patient is positioned lying down in this examination. Then the doctor will insert a contrast agent or dye into the patient\u2019s body. The goal is so that the aneurysm can be seen when the image of the brain\u2019s blood vessels is taken.\n\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\nSimilar to a CT scan, the patient will lie down. Then the doctor will scan the blood vessels in the brain. Aneurysms that are larger than 3\u20135 millimeters can be detected using an MRI or CT scan.\n\n3. Angiogram\n\nAngiogram can show weak points in blood vessels is a good test to detect aneurysms. In this test, the sufferer will be given anesthesia and a tube-like device is inserted through the blood vessels in the legs, up to the blood vessels in the head.\n\nThen, the dye will be inserted by the doctor into the blood vessels of the brain and the condition of the blood vessels will be seen on the monitor screen. If there is an aneurysm in the brain, it can be seen directly with this examination.\n\n4. Examination of Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid)\n\nThis supporting examination is carried out by taking spinal fluid using a special needle to see if there are any signs of bleeding.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Treatment\n\nBased on the stages, brain aneurysm therapy is divided into two types. In small aneurysms, which have not ruptured, and do not cause symptoms, therapy is carried out with routine observation, as well as taking preventive measures so that the aneurysm does not get bigger and rupture.\n\nSome efforts made, such as:\n\nDo not take stimulant drugs.\nNo smoking.\nMaintain normal blood pressure.\nAvoid foods that contain high fat.\nGet used to a healthy diet.\nLimit caffeine consumption.\nDo not lift heavy objects.\nLose weight with a healthy diet.\n\nSurgery is recommended if the aneurysm is at risk of rupturing. If a brain aneurysm ruptures, it is a medical emergency, and immediate surgery is required. This therapy aims to prevent blood from flowing to the site of the ruptured aneurysm. The procedures performed include:\n\n1. Surgical Clipping\n\nThis surgery is performed by opening the skull and then attaching a clamp to the ruptured aneurysm.\n\n2. Endovascular Coiling\n\nThis procedure is done by inserting a special tube (catheter) into a blood vessel in the leg until it reaches the head. Next, the doctor will install a device to close the bleeding (coil). This surgery is done without opening the skull.\n\n3. Flow Diverter Surgery\n\nThis procedure is performed if the previous two procedures are not possible. In this type of surgery, a device called a stent will be installed in the blood vessel, so that blood can flow without leaking back. All surgical procedures are therapies that can cause the risk of complications, such as brain damage or stroke.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Prevention \n\nAneurysms cannot always be prevented. However, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing an aneurysm.\n\nQuit or don\u2019t smoke.\nConsume a balanced nutritious diet and reduce salt intake.\nReduce alcohol consumption.\nMaintain ideal body weight by following a healthy diet.\nExercise regularly.\nReduce caffeine intake.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nIt is recommended to immediately check yourself when a number of the symptoms mentioned appear. The right steps can save you from potential complications. Remember, losing your life is a fatal impact that can occur.",

        "title": "Angina Pectoris Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Angina Pectoris\n\nAngina pectoris is a disease that occurs due to disruption of oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart muscle. The typical symptom of this disease is chest pain that can interfere with daily activities.\n\nThe blood supply to the heart muscle can be disrupted due to narrowing or blockage in the blood vessels. This disease can occur suddenly and can affect anyone.\n\nHowever, there are several factors that can increase the risk of angina, starting from high cholesterol levels, having diabetes, having a history of hypertension, stress, being overweight or obese, and actively smoking. A history of heart disease, and rarely exercising can also increase the risk of angina.\n\nSymptoms of Angina \n\nMost people with angina describe chest pain or pressure. Most people also describe a squeezing or tightness sensation in the chest.\n\nMeanwhile, a small number of others said the symptoms of angina felt like indigestion. However, the rest of the sufferers said it was difficult to describe angina symptoms specifically.\n\nWhen angina occurs, here are a number of symptoms that sufferers can feel, including:\n\nChest pain that can spread to the left arm, neck, jaw, and back.\nThe chest feels like it is being squeezed or pressed by a heavy object.\nHard to breathe.\nThe body feels tired.\n\nExcessive sweating.\n\nCauses of Angina\n\nIn order to function properly, the heart needs enough oxygen-rich blood. Two large vessels, called the coronary arteries, supply blood to the heart.\n\nThe main cause of angina is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries. If you look at the triggers, there are three types of angina, namely:\n\n1. Stable angina\n\nGenerally, this condition is triggered by physical activity, such as exercise. When exercising, the heart organ requires more oxygen supply from the bloodstream.\n\nHowever, these needs will not be met if there is a blockage or narrowing of the coronary vessels. Stable angina attacks can also occur due to other things, such as smoking, stress, overeating, and cold air.\n\n2. Unstable angina\n\nThis condition occurs due to fat deposits or blood clots that reduce or block blood flow to the heart.\n\nEven though the sufferer has taken medication and rested, chest pain due to unstable angina will still persist.\n\nIf not treated properly, unstable angina attacks can develop into heart attacks.\n\n3. Variant angina (Prinzmetal\u2019s sitting angina)\n\nIn this condition, there is a temporary narrowing of the heart arteries due to spasm or stiffness of the blood vessels. This type of angina can even attack people who are resting. Because this variant of angina can occur at any time.\n\nTemporary narrowing of the blood vessels causes the oxygen supply from the blood flow to the heart to decrease and chest pain occurs. Symptoms of this type of angina can be treated with medication.\n\nDiagnosis of Angina\n\nIn addition to conducting a physical examination and asking about the history of symptoms experienced by the sufferer, there are several other examinations that doctors will generally perform, such as:\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). The use of an ECG or heart recording aims to see whether the patient\u2019s blood flow is disturbed or decreased.\nEchocardiogram. This examination aims to assess the function of heart muscle contraction and heart valve function which can decrease if there is damage to the heart muscle, due to impaired blood flow or parts of the heart that do not receive enough blood flow.\nExercise Tolerance Test ( Exercise Tolerance Test ). The main purpose of this examination is to measure the heart\u2019s endurance during physical activity before angina symptoms arise.\nCardiac scintigraphy. This examination aims to determine whether blood flow in the blood vessels is disturbed.\nCoronary angiography. This examination aims to determine whether the coronary blood vessels are blocked and how severe the blockage is.\nBlood test. This type of test aims to measure the level of cardiac enzymes in the blood to determine heart damage due to a heart attack.\nChest X-ray (X-ray). This examination aims to see whether the symptoms experienced by the sufferer are due to conditions other than angina or to see if there is an enlarged heart.\nCT scan of the heart. This examination aims to determine how severe the narrowing of the heart vessels is, and whether there is an enlargement of the heart that is not very visible from the results of the chest X-ray.\n\nAngina Treatment\n\nCan angina pectoris be cured? The answer is that angina pectoris cannot be cured. But angina pectoris can be treated if the symptoms appear at any time.\n\nThe goal of angina treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms and reduce the risk of heart attack and death.\n\nThe following are options for angina treatment including:\n\n1. Sitting Wind First Aid\n\nThere are several ways you need to do immediately if you experience angina symptoms. First aid that you can do for yourself, including:\n\nStop Activities and Take a Rest Immediately\n\nIf you experience chest pain during activity, immediately stop the activity and rest, such as sitting or lying down.\n\nTaking Medicines\n\nIf symptoms do not subside after resting, take a dose of angina medication. You are advised to sit or lie down before taking the medication, as the medication can make you dizzy. Take the smallest dose you usually take. For example, a full tablet, half or even a quarter of a tablet. Here\u2019s how to use angina medication:\n\nSpray medication. Spray once under the tongue.\nTablets. Place the medicine under the tongue, but do not swallow. When symptoms stop, spit out the remaining tablet.\nWait Before Taking Additional Doses\n\nWait 5 minutes. If angina symptoms persist, take another dose, then wait another five minutes.\n\nTell the Family\n\nTell your family or closest people about your condition so they can help.\n\nContact the Nearest Hospital\n\nIf angina does not improve after 10 minutes of waiting or gets worse, immediately contact the nearest hospital for an ambulance and emergency medical treatment.\n\n2. Lifestyle changes \n\nHeart disease is a common cause of angina. Making lifestyle changes to maintain heart health is an important part of angina treatment.\n\nHere are some efforts that can be made:\n\nDon\u2019t smoke and avoid exposure to cigarette smoke. It is common knowledge that smoking is one of the habits that can increase many health problems.\nExercise and manage your weight. As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day. If you are overweight, talk to your doctor about safe weight-loss options. Ask your doctor what weight is best for you.\nChange your diet. Eat healthy foods low in salt and saturated fat, and choose healthy foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\nManage other health conditions. Diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol can cause angina. Therefore, it is important for people with these conditions to manage and monitor their conditions.\nPractice stress relief. Exercising more, practicing mindfulness, and connecting with others in a support group are some ways to reduce emotional stress.\nAvoid or limit alcohol. If you choose to drink alcohol, drink in moderation.\n\n3. Medical action \n\nMedical treatment options for angina are divided into two options, namely the use of medication and surgical procedures.\n\nUse of drugs\n\nIf lifestyle changes such as healthy eating and exercise don\u2019t improve heart health and relieve angina pain, medications may be the answer.\n\nMedications to treat angina may include:\n\nNitrates. These drugs help relax and widen blood vessels so more blood can flow to the heart. The most common form of nitrate doctors prescribe for angina is nitroglycerin.\nAspirin. This medication can reduce blood clotting, making it easier for blood to flow through narrowed heart arteries. Preventing blood clots can reduce the risk of heart attack.\nClot-preventing medications. Certain medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta), make blood platelets less likely to stick together, so your blood doesn\u2019t clot.\nBeta-blockers. Beta-blockers cause the heart to beat more slowly and with less force, which lowers blood pressure.\n\nSometimes, a non-drug option or Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) may be recommended by your doctor to improve blood flow to the heart.\n\nWith EECP, your doctor will place a blood pressure-type cuff around your calf, thigh, and pelvis.\n\nEECP requires several treatment sessions. EECP can help reduce symptoms in people with frequent, uncontrolled angina (refractory angina).\n\nOperating procedure \n\nThere are a number of surgical procedures that your doctor may recommend to treat angina, including:\n\nAngioplasty surgery. This procedure involves placing a stent in the blood vessels of the heart. This procedure is the main procedure in treating coronary artery blockages.\nBypass surgery. This procedure aims to divert blood flow so that it does not pass through blocked or damaged blood vessels by using blood vessels from other parts of the body.\n\nRecommended Medicine for Angina Pectoris\n\nThere are various choices of angina medication with a doctor\u2019s prescription that you can take, including:\n\nConcor 1.25 mg 10 Tablets. Antihypertensive drug containing bisoprolol fumarate 1.25 mg. This drug can help treat hypertension, angina, and chronic heart failure.\nZendalat 10 mg 10 Tablets. Zendalat contains nifedipine 10 mg, which can help prevent certain types of chest pain, including angina. It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.\nCardio Aspirin 100 mg 10 Tablets. Aspirin class drug that works as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet. How it works, prevents the platelet aggregation process in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina patients.\nAspilets 80 mg 10 Chewable Tablets. These chewable tablets contain acetylsalicylic acid 80 mg, which is a non-steroidal analgesic compound. You can use this medicine to treat unstable angina, as well as temporary ischemic brain attacks.\nCardicap 5 mg 10 Tablets. Antihypertensive drug Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB), which can be used as first-line treatment for hypertension, stable angina, and variant angina.\nIntervask 5 mg 10 Tablets. Contains amlodipine, a drug that works as an antihypertensive Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB). You can use this drug as a first-line treatment for variant angina and stable angina.\nAdalat Oros 30 mg 10 Tablets. Used to treat hypertension and angina. It contains nifedipine which works by relaxing the heart muscles and blood vessels so that blood flows easily and the heart load is reduced.\n\nIn addition to taking medication, angina sufferers also need to know how to provide first aid when experiencing it.\n\nPrevention of Angina\n\nAngina pectoris is a condition that you can prevent. There are several preventive measures you can take, including:\n\nExercise regularly.

        "title": "The expanding horizons of physiotherapy: Integrating technology with holistic care",
        "text": "The integration of new technologies is revolutionising physical therapy. Wearable sensors are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of physiotherapy Khyatee The critical role of physiotherapy in promoting workforce health, addressing sedentary lifestyle issues, correcting postural imbalances, and enhancing productivity is increasingly being recognised not only by the common man but also by the corporate sector.Needless to say, physiotherapy is a holistic approach that aids individuals in recovering, maintaining, and enhancing their mobility and overall well-being. This evolving field which is continually shaped by technological advancements and shifts in healthcare practices, enhances its effectiveness in patient care in different arenas. Expanding Roles in Mental Health: Physical therapists are increasingly involved in mental health care, particularly in managing depression and anxiety. By leveraging the mind-body connection, physical therapists can offer low-intensity psychological interventions to address symptoms related to mental health conditions. Electroceuticals like Deep Brain Stimulation can help reduce insomnia, anxiety, and depression. We can also help in the well-being of children with autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Deficit. This shift towards integrating physical therapy with mental health care reflects a broader trend toward holistic patient management. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is transforming physical therapy by enabling more personalized and efficient patient care. Advanced algorithms analyse extensive patient data to create tailored rehabilitation programs and forecast pain patterns. AI-powered wearables and immersive technologies like virtual and augmented reality are enhancing therapeutic interventions, allowing for real-time adjustments and improved patient engagement. Adoption of the PRISM Pain Model: The Pain Recovery and Integrative Systems Model (PRISM), developed through collaboration between the APTA and the National Institutes of Health, is set to revolutionize pain management in physical therapy. PRISM addresses the complex nature of pain beyond traditional models, facilitating more effective decision-making and treatment approaches. Boon in Geriatric conditions: Elders are susceptible to various illnesses usually including musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiopulmonary problems, mental illness, balance problems, and chronic pain. Physiotherapy treatment has been successful in managing each of these ailments. Emphasis on Primary Care Physical Therapy: The trend towards preventive and patient-centred care is spotlighting primary care physical therapy. By focusing on non-pharmacological interventions and early intervention, physical therapists are providing alternatives to manage pain and chronic conditions. This approach not only reduces healthcare costs but also enhances patient outcomes through collaborative, holistic care. For instance, take the case of stroke rehabilation. Physical therapy helps stroke survivors regain motor functions and improve muscle strength, coordination, and balance through targeted exercises and treatments. Similarly, the therapy promotes neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganie and form new neural connections. Therapists use techniques to encourage the brain to adapt and compensate for damaged areas.In functional training, therapy includes functional training to help patients perform everyday tasks, which can significantly enhance their quality of life and self-sufficiency. Growing Popularity of Aquatic Therapy: Aquatic therapy, or hydrotherapy, continues to gain recognition for its benefits, including reduced joint stress and increased flexibility. This low-impact therapeutic option is particularly effective for patients with musculoskeletal issues and is becoming a more common feature in rehabilitation facilities. Innovations in Technology: The integration of new technologies is revolutionizing physical therapy. Motion capture technology and wearable sensors are enhancing the precision of care plans. Virtual reality and interactive video games are improving patient engagement and adherence to therapy. Additionally, rehabilitation robotics, such as exoskeletons and intelligent prosthetics, are offering tailored support that adapts to patients' progress. Telehealth is also on the rise, providing patients with flexible, convenient access to therapy. Increasing Need for Referrals: As physical therapists take on more comprehensive roles, collaboration with physicians becomes increasingly important. Physicians are recognizing the benefits of physical therapy interventions, leading to a higher demand for referrals. These trends highlight the ongoing evolution in physical therapy, emphasizing a shift towards more personalized, technology-driven, and integrated approaches.

        "title": "Harvard Students Develop App to Identify Anyone Using Meta Smart Glasses",
        "text": "Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses were used by two Harvard engineering students to build an app that can reveal sensitive information about people without them realising it. The students posted a demo of the video on X (formerly known as Twitter) and showcased the app's capability. Notably, the app is not being made publicly available to users, instead, they made it to highlight the dangers of AI-powered wearable devices that use discreet cameras that can capture photos and images of people. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Used to Build a Doxxing App The app, dubbed I-Xray, uses artificial intelligence (AI) for facial recognition and then uses processed visual data to doxx individuals. Doxxing, a popular Internet slang which is a portmanteau of \u201cdropping dox (informal of docs or documents)\u201d, is the act of revealing personal information about someone without their consent. It was integrated with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, but the developers said that it would work with any smart glasses with discreet cameras. It uses an AI model similar to PimEyes and FaceCheck for reverse facial recognition. The technology can match the face of an individual to publicly available images of them online and scour the URLs. Another large language model (LLM) is then fed these URLs and an automatic prompt is generated to find out the person's name, occupation, address, and other similar data. The AI model also looks through publicly available government data such as voter registration databases. Additionally, an online tool named FastPeopleSearch was also used for this. Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance? @CaineArdayfio and I offer an answer to protect yourself here:https://t.co/LhxModhDpk pic.twitter.com/Oo35TxBNtD \u2014 AnhPhu Nguyen (@AnhPhuNguyen1) September 30, 2024 In a short video demonstration, Harvard students AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio also showcased the workings of this app. They were able to meet strangers with the camera already turned on, and ask their name, and the AI-powered app could take over from there to find personal data about the individual. In a Google Docs file, the developers said, \u201cThis synergy between LLMs and reverse face search allows for fully automatic and comprehensive data extraction that was previously not possible with traditional methods alone.\u201d The students have stated that they do not intend to make the app publicly available and only developed it to highlight the risks of an AI-enabled wearable device that can discreetly record people. However, this does not mean that bad actors cannot make a similar app using a similar methodology. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

The deceased has been identified as Arun, 40, a resident of Mettupalayam in Coimbatore. However, his identity remains to be verified. The incident was reported near the Kaippamangalam fisheries school on Monday around 11.30 p.m. It has since emerged that a four-member gang in a car had summoned the ambulance to take the deceased to a nearby hospital under the pretext that he was injured in an accident. The gang then allegedly fled after having promised the ambulance driver that they would follow the ambulance. The victim was dead by the time the ambulance reached the hospital. Following this, the ambulance driver alerted the Kaippamangalam police. In the ensuing investigation it emerged that the victim was assaulted to death in connection with a money transaction, reportedly to the tune of \u20b910 lakh, for a rice puller. One of the accused had reportedly invested the money with Arun who failed to deliver on the promise. According to the police, the victim who was asked to come near the Paliyekkara toll was abducted by the gang and then beaten up at a secret location. He was being taken around in a car when the gang allegedly summoned the ambulance at Kaippamangalam. As per preliminary information, all the accused were residents of Kannur.

        "text": "Visakhapatnam: Alluri Sitarama Raju district is home to many beautiful waterfalls that attract tourists, especially youngsters from across the state. Unfortunately, many tourists have lost their lives in waterfall-related accidents in the district due to a lack of awareness about the risks. This is because often the youth try to perform adventurous tasks for selfies and short videos. On this problem, ASR district collector A.S. Dinesh Kumar held a meeting with tourism officials. When Deccan Chronicle contacted, Srinivasa Phani, the regional director of the AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC), said, \u201cIn last week's meeting, we discussed that the APTDC has received Rs 30 crore funds under the Swadeshi Darshan 2.0 scheme from the central government. We have proposed that some of this fund be used to develop infrastructure that prevents accidents at these waterfalls.\u201d The Anantagiri Saria Falls gained recognition as a tourist destination since 2015, attracting many visitors from the North Andhra districts. However, several tragic incidents took place at this spot. According to CPI (M) ASR district secretary D. Venkanna, more than 40 reported fatalities occurred at the falls between 2015 and 2024. Worried about these events, the district authorities enhanced safety measures. Notably, at the first step of Saria Falls, where many accidents had occurred, fencing and warning boards were erected. These measures have prevented accidents in the past two years.Unfortunately, a recent incident at Bahubali Waterfalls, the second step of the falls, resulted in the loss of two lives. The recovery of the bodies was quite a challenge for the officials. Pittalaborra Waterfalls at Ginnelakota village in Pedabayalu mandal has been identified as hazardous due to its history of accidents. A tragic incident occurred three months ago when a young man from the Araku area lost his life after slipping into a waterfall while taking a selfie. His body was recovered two days later.Similarly, Duduma waterfalls, situated at a height of 2,600 feet on the border of Andhra and Odisha, has witnessed multiple fatalities, with six reported deaths in 2024. In response, the Odisha government has implemented preventive measures, resulting in fewer accidents at the site. The Gadigummi Falls in Koyyuru mandal is deemed extremely dangerous, with no documented cases of individuals surviving falls. Local reports suggest that approximately 40 fatalities have occurred at this location. On a different note, the Polluru Waterfall at Mothugudem is renowned for its popularity as a filming location. It has also seen several fatal incidents, with around 35 recorded deaths attributed to quicksand in the boulder area near the waterfall.The Chaparai Waterfall in Dumbriguda is a captivating attraction for tourists, including foreigners. Adjacent to the waterfall, there is a hazardous area known as the Hanuma Stone, which had several accidents due to its beautiful nature, uninformed tourists often meet with accidents here. Local guides have reported approximately 30 fatalities in the past decade. However, two years ago, the authorities took protective measures at the waterfalls area. They have demolished the hazardous Hanuma Stone, installed a fence and taken additional protective measures. As a result, the number of accidents at Chaparai Waterfalls has decreased over the past two years.",

The event, which provides students from across the State to showcase their talent, is held every year prior to the commencement of the Dasara festival. The presence of Kannada actors Srimurali and Rukmini Vasanth added more glitter to the inaugural event. While Srimurali was addressing the gathering, youth demanded him to sing for which the actor obliged with the song \u2018Hudugir Kannu Loaded Gannu\u2026\u2019 from his movie \u2018Rathavara\u2019 which set the tone for the celebrations. Srimurali, who said that \u2018Our Nada Habba is Our Pride,\u2019 added that it was only in Mysuru that a grandeur Dasara could be witnessed and no other place in the country. Later, the actor, promoting his upcoming movie \u2018Bhageera,\u2019 urged the youth to watch the film in theatres. Earlier, inaugurating the event, District Minister Dr. H.C. Mahadevappa said that among the 470 colleges which had applied to take part in the Yuva Sambhrama, 150 colleges were selected and another 120 colleges out of those not selected would be given an opportunity to showcase their talent by extending the event by a day. Tribute to \u2018Appu\u2019 Yesterday\u2019s inaugural event also witnessed the organisers paying tributes to late actor Puneeth Rajkumar, fondly called \u2018Appu.\u2019 Dr. Madhusudan and troupe rendered the song \u2018Bombe Heluthaithe\u2026\u2019 from the Kannada movie \u2018Rajakumara\u2019 joined the audience who also sang along by waving their mobile phones turning on the torch. A delayed inauguration The students and audience present at the Open Air Theatre, who had arrived much earlier to scheduled time of inauguration (5 pm as per the banners at the venue; 6 pm as per the invitation) waited for more than two hours for the guests to arrive. Finally, the event was inaugurated at 8.20 pm which caused a great inconvenience to the students who had to wait for long wearing their costumes. On day-1, Holenarasipur Govt. FGC for Women, Hassan presented a dance programme portraying the folk and desi culture; Hunsur\u2019s Sri Mahaveer College of Education showcased Dasara heritage through dance. It was followed by performances of 18 other colleges. MLC C.N.

        "title": "Scientists Reveal It Wasn't Just One Asteroid That Wiped Out Dinosaurs",
        "text": "The massive asteroid that ended the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was not an isolated event, new research has revealed. The study, published in Nature, detailed scans of an underwater crater off the coast of Guinea. It revealed that another large asteroid struck Earth around the same time, potentially contributing to the cataclysmic conditions that led to the dinosaurs' extinction. Scientists recently mapped the Nadir crater, spanning over 8 km in diameter, and revealed that it was created by an asteroid measuring 400 metres wide. This asteroid struck the planet at nearly 72,000 kmph between 65 million and 67 million years ago. While it was smaller than the asteroid linked to the mass extinction, it was still powerful enough to leave a significant mark on Earth. \u201cThe new images paint a picture of the catastrophic event,\u201d said Dr Uisdean Nicholson, a marine geologist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He discovered the Nadir crater in 2022, but the impact details were unclear until now. Using advanced 3D seismic imaging, researchers managed to explore the crater's rim and the geological features lying 300 metres beneath the ocean floor. Dr Nicholson called it \u201cexquisite,\u201d saying, \u201cThere are around 20 confirmed marine craters worldwide, and none of them has been captured in anything close to this level of detail.\u201d The findings suggest the impact triggered intense tremors that liquefied sediments beneath the sea bed, resulting in faults and landslides that left traces of damage visible for thousands of square miles beyond the crater's edge. Furthermore, the collision unleashed a massive tsunami, estimated to have exceeded 800 metres in height, which would have surged across the Atlantic Ocean. Although the exact timing of this asteroid's impact remains uncertain, its discovery raises intriguing possibilities about a cluster of impacts occurring at the end of the Cretaceous period \u2013 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs created a much larger crater \u2013 160 km wide \u2013 at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Dr Nicholson said the \u201cclosest humans have come to seeing something like this is the 1908 Tunguska event\u201d, when a 50-metre asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded in the skies above Siberia. He pointed out that the new 3D seismic data across the Nadir crater provides an unrivalled opportunity to test impact crater hypotheses and develop new models of crater formation in marine environments.",

A variety of colourful and attractive rangolis were drawn, enlivening the festive mood as women, not just from Mysuru, but also from other districts as well, thronged the venue to showcase their talent and creativity. Many attractive designs of rangolis were drawn on the forecourt of the palace. People also visited the palace to watch the colourful rangolis. The event was inaugurated by MLA T.S. Srivatsa. Speaking on the occasion, the MLA said rangoli symbolised our culture and tradition. More than 100 women participated in the competition to showcase their talents oblivious about the prizes. Their participation is appreciating, he added. The MLA recalled how women in villages draw rangolis, and the preparations they make before the rangolis are drawn in front of their houses. Rangoli is an art and a tradition that has continued since ages, with women in the cities also practicing the tradition, drawing attractive rangolis daily in front of their house. Rangolis in the design of elephant carrying Ambari, Mahisha rangoli, and many other impressive rangolis had been drawn in the competition. Women whose rangoli designs were judged the best will get prizes which will be presented on October 8. Three prizes and three consolation prizes will be presented.",

The top court on August 2 had passed its formal order and expanded the remit of the seven-member expert panel, headed by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K Radhakrishnan, to review the functioning of the National Testing Agency (NTA) and recommend exam reforms to make the controversy-ridden NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Undergraduate), transparent and free from malpractices.The NEET-UG is conducted by the NTA for admission in undergraduate medical programs.The top court had also refused to annul the NEET-UG of 2024, saying there was no sufficient material on record at present to indicate a systemic leak or malpractice compromising the integrity of the examination.On Monday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told a bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud that the deadline for filing the report of the expert committee was ending and sought two-week extension.The bench, also comprising Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, took note of the fact that the report of the panel was almost complete and granted two more weeks for filing the same.While expanding the scope of the expert panel, the top court had flagged multiple lapses on the part of NTA like the security breach at an examination centre in Jharkhand's Hazaribagh where the rear door of the strongroom was opened and unauthorised people were permitted to access question papers, transportation of question papers by e-rickshaws and distribution of wrong set of question papers among the candidates.Besides Radhakrishnan, other members of the expert committee are Randeep Guleria, B J Rao, Ramamurthy K, Pankaj Bansal, Aditya Mittal and Govind Jaiswal.The bench said the remit of the committee, in addition to the tasks that it has been entrusted with by the union government and the NTA, shall encompass examination security and administration, data security and technological enhancements.Its responsibilities will also include policy and stakeholder engagement, collaboration and international cooperation, and recommendations for providing mental health support to students and training of NTA staff, it had said.Over 23 lakh students took up the NEET-UG in 2024 for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH and other related courses.",

        "text": "Srinagar: A doctor and six labourers were killed when terrorists struck a tunnel-construction site on the Srinagar-Leh national highway in Jammu and Kashmir's Ganderbal district on Sunday, officials said.The unidentified terrorists carried out the attack when the labourers and other staff working on the tunnel project at Gund in Ganderbal had returned to their camp late in the evening, the officials said.They said the terrorists -- believed to be at least two -- opened indiscriminate fire on the group of labourers that included both locals and non-locals.While two labourers died on the spot, four others and the doctor succumbed to their injuries subsequently, the officials said, adding that five people are undergoing treatment for injuries.The deceased have been identified as Dr Shahnawaz, Faheem Nazir, Kaleem, Mohammad Hanif, Shashi Abrol, Anil Shukla and Gurmeet Singh.Security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to track down the attackers, the officials said.Top security officials, including Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir, V K Birdi, have reached the spot to assess the situation.Condemning the terror attack, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said those involved in the heinous act will not be spared.\"The dastardly terror attack on civilians in Gagangir, J&K, is a despicable act of cowardice. Those involved in this heinous act will not be spared and will face the harshest response from our security forces,\" Shah said in a post on X.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the number of casualties in the attack may go up.\"The casualty figure from the Gagangir attack is not final as there are a number of injured labourers, both local and non-local. Praying that the injured make a full recovery as the more seriously injured are being referred to SKIMS, Srinagar,\" he said in a post on X.Abdullah condemned the attack, which came barely four days after he was sworn in as the chief minister of the Union Territory.\"Very sad news of a dastardly and cowardly attack on non-local labourers at Gagangir in Sonamarg region. These people were working on a key infrastructure project in the area. 2 have been killed and 2-3 more have been injured in this militant attack. I strongly condemn this attack on unarmed innocent people and send my condolences to their loved ones,\" he said in another post on the microblogging platform.Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha strongly condemned the heinous terror attack on civilians. \"I assure the people that those behind this despicable act will not go unpunished. We have given full freedom to J&K Police, Army and security forces,\" Sinha said in a post on X.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and People's Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti also condemned the attack.\"Unequivocally condemn this senseless act of violence against two labourers in Ganderbal. Deepest condolences to their families,\" she said in a post on X before the officials revised the death toll in the incident.In a post on X, People's Conference leader Sajad Gani Lone said: \"Strongly condemn the dastardly act of terror wherein two persons have lost their lives in Sonamarg. This is an insane act of madness. My thoughts with these two families. May the perpetrators be brought to justice.\"Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) president Tariq Hameed Karra expressed grave concern over the attack and said such incidents will vitiate the atmosphere in the Union Territory.

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday said secularism had always been held to be part and parcel of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution.\nA bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar passed the remark while hearing a batch of petitions filed by former Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain and others, who have challenged the inclusion of words \u201dsocialist\u201d and \u201dsecular\u201d in the Preamble of the Constitution.\n\u201dThis court has in a number of judgments held that secularism was always part of the basic structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and the word \u2019fraternity\u2019 used in the Constitution, there is a clear indication that secularism has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,\u201d the bench said.\nThe words \u201dsocialist\u2019 and \u201dsecular\u201d were inserted into the Preamble of the Constitution under the 42nd Constitutional amendment moved by the Indira Gandhi government in 1976.\nThe amendment changed the description of India in the Preamble from a \u201dsovereign, democratic republic\u201d to a \u201dsovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\u201d.\nDuring the hearing, Jain submitted that Dr B R Ambedkar had opined that the inclusion of the word \u201dsocialism\u201d would curtail personal liberty. He added that preamble cannot be amended through amendments.\nJustice Khanna said there were different meanings of socialism and one \u201dshould not take the meaning adopted in Western countries\u201d.\n\u201dSocialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of the country should be distributed equally,\u201d the bench said.\nAdvocate Ashwini Upadhyay, who too had filed a petition, said he was neither against the words \u201dsocialist, secular and integrity\u201d nor their insertion in the Constitution but against the insertion of these words into the Preamble in 1976 and that too with a retrospective effect from November 26, 1949.\nHe said adding a word did not have any real effect in the country but opened a pandora\u2019s box for the future governments, who can play with it and may remove a word from the Preamble.\nSwamy, on other hand, submitted the Preamble was a declaration made on November 26, 1949, and therefore adding further words to it, through a subsequent amendment, was arbitrary.\nHe said it was wrong to depict that as per the present Preamble, the Indian people agreed on November 26, 1949, to make India a socialist and secular republic. The bench said it would examine the matter and posted it for further hearing on November 18.\nOn February 9, the top court had questioned whether the Preamble of the Constitution could be amended while keeping the date of adoption, November 26, 1949 intact.\n\u201dFor the academic purpose, can a Preamble that has the date mentioned, be changed without altering the date of adoption. Otherwise, yes the Preamble can be amended. There is no problem with that,\u201d Justice Datta had remarked.\nJain said that the Preamble of the Constitution of India comes with a specific date, therefore, it cannot be amended without a discussion.\nSwamy said the 42nd Amendment Act was passed during the emergency (1975-77).\nOn September 2, 2022, the top court had tagged Swamy\u2019s plea with other pending matter \u2014 filed by one Balram Singh and others \u2014 for hearing.\nBoth Swamy and Singh has sought deletion of \u201dsocialist\u201d and \u201dsecular\u201d from the Preamble.\nSwamy in his plea has contended that Preamble cannot be altered, varied, or repealed.\nHe said the Preamble not only indicated the essential features of the Constitution but also the fundamental conditions based on which it was adopted to create a unified integrated community.",

        "text": "It was on October 21, 2023, that the first passenger service on the priority section of the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (Delhi-Meerut RRTS) began. On Monday, India\u2019s first RRTS service completed one year of operations and in the last 365 days, it has served more than 40 lakh passengers. This is the first-of-its-kind train service in India connecting Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut.\n\u201c.. Since the launch on October 21, 2023, Namo Bharat trains have significantly transformed commuting across Ghaziabad, Sahibabad, and the surrounding regions, successfully serving over 40 lakh passengers in their first year of operations. Ghaziabad RRTS Station registered the highest footfall over the past year, followed closely by Sahibabad and Modinagar North RRTS Stations,\u201d an official statement from National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) reads.\nThe 17-km priority section connected Sahibabad to Duhai Depot with stations at Ghaziabad, Guldhar, and Duhai on the way. \nIn March 2024, the service was extended on additional 17 kilometres up to Modinagar. It connected Murad Nagar, Modinagar South, and Modinagar North.\nIn August, the service entered Meerut with the starting of the Meerut South station. \nEarlier this month, a trial run for the service in Delhi also started to connect New Ashok Nagar and Anand Vihar RRTS station with the already operational Sahibabad station. \nOn Monday, to mark the one-year anniversary, minister of housing and urban affairs and minister of power Manohar Lal Khattar took a ride on the service and visited key stations along the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor. He boarded the Namo Bharat train from Sahibabad station \u2014 the first operational station from Delhi side. \nThe minister also visited the under-construction Anand Vihar RRTS station. With its proximity to two Metro lines, a railway station, and two inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi and Kaushambi, Uttar Pradesh, Anand Vihar is set to become one of the region\u2019s busiest transit hubs. The station\u2019s multimodal connectivity facilitates smooth transitions between various modes of transportation, enhancing convenience and accessibility for daily commuters and creating a comprehensive network of networks.\nCurrently, Namo Bharat services operate on a 42-kilometer stretch covering nine stations \u2014 Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai, Duhai Depot, Muradnagar, Modi Nagar South, Modi Nagar North, and Meerut South. The corridor will soon extend to 54 kilometres with the addition of the Sahibabad to New Ashok Nagar section, which includes key stations of Anand Vihar and New Ashok Nagar.\nHigh-speed connectivity between suburban areas\nRRTS is the first-of-its-kind train service in India. These are not metro trains and are also not regular railway services. While it offers comfort like a metro train, it has the reach of the railways. \nThe service distinguishes itself from other modes of transport by providing high-speed connectivity between suburban areas, significantly reducing commuting times for longer distances. \nThis system is especially effective in addressing the challenges posed by urban expansion into new regions, such as the National Capital Region (NCR). \nBy enabling travellers to cover greater distances in a shorter time frame, RRTS enhances accessibility and convenience, making it an ideal solution for commuters navigating the growing urban landscape.\nOnce the entire 82-kilometer corridor is completed by June 2025, passengers will be able to travel from Delhi to Meerut in under an hour, revolutionising regional connectivity and enhancing the overall commuter experience.",
