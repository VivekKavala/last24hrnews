        "text": "Meta announced that it's testing facial recognition technology to detect scam ads and assist users in faster account recovery on Monday. The social media giant is specifically targeting \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams, where scammers use images of celebrities and public figures to lure users into interacting with the ad and clicking malicious links. Additionally, the Menlo Park-based tech giant is also testing using video selfies to let users quickly regain access to their compromised accounts. The company said it aims to proactively remove harmful content from its platforms to create a safer experience for users.\r\n\r\nMeta Testing Facial Recognition Technology\r\n\r\nIn a newsroom post, the social media giant detailed its approach to using facial recognition technology. Meta is currently working on using the technology in two ways \u2014 detecting \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams and identity verification for quicker account recovery.\r\n\r\nHighlighting the issue of \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams on Facebook and Instagram, the company said that scammers often use images of public figures to make users interact with ads. Users are asked to click on fraudulent links, and because of the trust factor of the celebrity, some fall for scams.Meta AI on WhatsApp Might Soon Be Able to Remember Your Preferences\r\n\r\nSo far, Meta has used the native ad review system to detect fake ads from legitimate ones. This system is based on machine learning and reviews millions of ads that run on its platforms. The automated system analyses the text, images, and videos featured in the ad. Now, to further bolster the system, the social media giant is testing facial recognition.\r\n\r\nThe company is currently using facial recognition on a limited scale to \u201ccompare faces in an ad to the public figure's Facebook and Instagram profile pictures.\u201d In case a match is confirmed and it is determined that the ad is a scam, Meta said it will automatically block it. The technology is also being used to detect and block accounts that impersonate a public figure.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Meta is in early stages of testing and is using a small group of celebrities and public figures to check and improve the speed and efficacy of detection. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we'll start showing in-app notifications to a larger group of public figures who've been impacted by celeb-bait letting them know we're enrolling them in this protection,\u201d the company added. Public figures who enrol in this protection will be allowed to opt out via Account Centre.Meta Unveils New Facebook Video Tab and AI-Powered Video Ad Tools\r\n\r\nFacial Recognition in Account Recovery\r\n\r\nMeta is also testing the use of facial recognition to help users regain access to compromised accounts. Many times, Meta's automated systems can flag an account incorrectly and lock it. This could be due to suspicious activity or if a hacker attempted to break into the user's account. Alternatively, proving identity is also necessary if users forget their account passwords. In such cases, users so far were asked to verify their identity by submitting a government identity card.\r\n\r\nNow, the social media giant is testing the use of video selfies to quickly let users regain access to their accounts. Users will have to upload a video selfie, and by running facial recognition technology, the company will compare the data to the profile pictures on the account they are trying to access.\r\n\r\nIn both use cases, Meta claims that it will not store any facial data generated after the comparison is made, regardless if there is a match or not. Additionally, in video selfies, the company stated that the video data will be encrypted and \u201cwill never be visible on their profile, to friends or to other people on Facebook or Instagram.\u201d\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "title": "The expanding horizons of physiotherapy: Integrating technology with holistic care",
        "text": "The integration of new technologies is revolutionising physical therapy. Wearable sensors are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of physiotherapy Khyatee The critical role of physiotherapy in promoting workforce health, addressing sedentary lifestyle issues, correcting postural imbalances, and enhancing productivity is increasingly being recognised not only by the common man but also by the corporate sector.Needless to say, physiotherapy is a holistic approach that aids individuals in recovering, maintaining, and enhancing their mobility and overall well-being. This evolving field which is continually shaped by technological advancements and shifts in healthcare practices, enhances its effectiveness in patient care in different arenas. Expanding Roles in Mental Health: Physical therapists are increasingly involved in mental health care, particularly in managing depression and anxiety. By leveraging the mind-body connection, physical therapists can offer low-intensity psychological interventions to address symptoms related to mental health conditions. Electroceuticals like Deep Brain Stimulation can help reduce insomnia, anxiety, and depression. We can also help in the well-being of children with autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Deficit. This shift towards integrating physical therapy with mental health care reflects a broader trend toward holistic patient management. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is transforming physical therapy by enabling more personalized and efficient patient care. Advanced algorithms analyse extensive patient data to create tailored rehabilitation programs and forecast pain patterns. AI-powered wearables and immersive technologies like virtual and augmented reality are enhancing therapeutic interventions, allowing for real-time adjustments and improved patient engagement. Adoption of the PRISM Pain Model: The Pain Recovery and Integrative Systems Model (PRISM), developed through collaboration between the APTA and the National Institutes of Health, is set to revolutionize pain management in physical therapy. PRISM addresses the complex nature of pain beyond traditional models, facilitating more effective decision-making and treatment approaches. Boon in Geriatric conditions: Elders are susceptible to various illnesses usually including musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiopulmonary problems, mental illness, balance problems, and chronic pain. Physiotherapy treatment has been successful in managing each of these ailments. Emphasis on Primary Care Physical Therapy: The trend towards preventive and patient-centred care is spotlighting primary care physical therapy. By focusing on non-pharmacological interventions and early intervention, physical therapists are providing alternatives to manage pain and chronic conditions. This approach not only reduces healthcare costs but also enhances patient outcomes through collaborative, holistic care. For instance, take the case of stroke rehabilation. Physical therapy helps stroke survivors regain motor functions and improve muscle strength, coordination, and balance through targeted exercises and treatments. Similarly, the therapy promotes neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganie and form new neural connections. Therapists use techniques to encourage the brain to adapt and compensate for damaged areas.In functional training, therapy includes functional training to help patients perform everyday tasks, which can significantly enhance their quality of life and self-sufficiency. Growing Popularity of Aquatic Therapy: Aquatic therapy, or hydrotherapy, continues to gain recognition for its benefits, including reduced joint stress and increased flexibility. This low-impact therapeutic option is particularly effective for patients with musculoskeletal issues and is becoming a more common feature in rehabilitation facilities. Innovations in Technology: The integration of new technologies is revolutionizing physical therapy. Motion capture technology and wearable sensors are enhancing the precision of care plans. Virtual reality and interactive video games are improving patient engagement and adherence to therapy. Additionally, rehabilitation robotics, such as exoskeletons and intelligent prosthetics, are offering tailored support that adapts to patients' progress. Telehealth is also on the rise, providing patients with flexible, convenient access to therapy. Increasing Need for Referrals: As physical therapists take on more comprehensive roles, collaboration with physicians becomes increasingly important. Physicians are recognizing the benefits of physical therapy interventions, leading to a higher demand for referrals. These trends highlight the ongoing evolution in physical therapy, emphasizing a shift towards more personalized, technology-driven, and integrated approaches.

        "title": "Harvard Students Develop App to Identify Anyone Using Meta Smart Glasses",
        "text": "Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses were used by two Harvard engineering students to build an app that can reveal sensitive information about people without them realising it. The students posted a demo of the video on X (formerly known as Twitter) and showcased the app's capability. Notably, the app is not being made publicly available to users, instead, they made it to highlight the dangers of AI-powered wearable devices that use discreet cameras that can capture photos and images of people. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Used to Build a Doxxing App The app, dubbed I-Xray, uses artificial intelligence (AI) for facial recognition and then uses processed visual data to doxx individuals. Doxxing, a popular Internet slang which is a portmanteau of \u201cdropping dox (informal of docs or documents)\u201d, is the act of revealing personal information about someone without their consent. It was integrated with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, but the developers said that it would work with any smart glasses with discreet cameras. It uses an AI model similar to PimEyes and FaceCheck for reverse facial recognition. The technology can match the face of an individual to publicly available images of them online and scour the URLs. Another large language model (LLM) is then fed these URLs and an automatic prompt is generated to find out the person's name, occupation, address, and other similar data. The AI model also looks through publicly available government data such as voter registration databases. Additionally, an online tool named FastPeopleSearch was also used for this. Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance? @CaineArdayfio and I offer an answer to protect yourself here:https://t.co/LhxModhDpk pic.twitter.com/Oo35TxBNtD \u2014 AnhPhu Nguyen (@AnhPhuNguyen1) September 30, 2024 In a short video demonstration, Harvard students AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio also showcased the workings of this app. They were able to meet strangers with the camera already turned on, and ask their name, and the AI-powered app could take over from there to find personal data about the individual. In a Google Docs file, the developers said, \u201cThis synergy between LLMs and reverse face search allows for fully automatic and comprehensive data extraction that was previously not possible with traditional methods alone.\u201d The students have stated that they do not intend to make the app publicly available and only developed it to highlight the risks of an AI-enabled wearable device that can discreetly record people. However, this does not mean that bad actors cannot make a similar app using a similar methodology. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",
