However, an often-overlooked nuance in discussions about the Indian diaspora is its diversity.</p>

In his 1975 work Andhras in the United States of America published in Telugu Vani: Voice of the Telugu People, P Venugopala Rao categorised Telugus residing in the US into four distinct groups: students pursuing higher education, individuals who obtained postgraduate degrees in the US and settled as permanent residents, professionals who entered the US for employment, and dependents, who constitute a significant portion of the Telugu-speaking population.</p>

In March 2021, Joel Reifman, former US Consul General, Hyderabad, said one in four Telugu families had an American connection.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The significant number of visa applications originating from Hyderabad, along with the growing interest among Telugu families in securing matrimonial alliances with individuals settled in the US —often referred to as ‘America sambandham’,is as clear evidence of the high rate of Telugu migration to the US.</p>

Preserving Identity

In recent years, numerous Telugu-speaking organisations have intensified their efforts to preserve and strengthen the cultural identity and unity of the community.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These initiatives include promoting teaching and learning of the Telugu language to ensure its continued use among younger generations.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The growing influence of Telugus can be gauged from the fact that in 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared April 2 as Telugu Language and Heritage Day in the State.</p>

Sobering Reality

However, beneath the narrative of success and opportunity that often characterises the Indian American diaspora in the US lies a more sobering reality, marked by the persistent threat of gun violence and the increasing number of shootings.</p>

In the domain of international relations, the post-Cold War years had a huge impact on the political and economic milieu of several nations, marked by the increasing involvement of non-state civic actors on a global scale which can be attributed to several factors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> First, the global expansion of democratic governance created more opportunities for civic engagement.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Third, globalisation facilitated the growth of transnational and multinational civic activities, allowing non-state actors to operate beyond national boundaries.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Finally, the wider dissemination of education and the resulting increase in public awareness empowered individuals and groups to participate more actively in civic and political spheres.</p>

While diaspora communities may play a minor role for smaller countries, for nations like India and China, with large populations dispersed across the globe, these communities serve as a crucial source of soft power and they become the cultural ambassadors of their respective countries.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Additionally, these groups are often afforded special recognition in host countries due to their shared sense of cultural distinctiveness, which allows them to be viewed as a cohesive entity.</p>

Waves of Hope

When legendary producer D MadhusudhanRao made America Abbayi in the late 1980s, it reflected the early wave of Telugu migration to the US, especially among doctors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The film’s central character, a doctor, symbolised the aspirations of that era — where the American dream was largely tied to the medical profession and a stable, prestigious career abroad.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

While many Telugus have traditionally migrated to the US for higher education or to secure white-collar employment, an increasing number are now aspiring to enter the political arena

Fast forward to the millennial generation in the early 2000s, and director Shekhar Kammula’s Dollar Dreams captured a different wave of hope and ambition among youngsters in India who saw an opportunity in various fields, especially IT.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kammula’s film reflected the changing aspirations of young Telugu minds— not just seeking stable professions like medicine and IT but driven by a desire to study, succeed and establish themselves in the US.</p>
