        "title": "\u2018Disheartening\u2019: Oscar Winner Sound Designer Resul Pookutty On Criticism Over Kanguva's Loud Background Score",
        "text": "After much anticipation, Suriya\u2019s fantasy drama Kanguva was finally released in theatres on November 14. The movie has received a mixed reaction from both fans and critics. While some were impressed, others expressed concerns about the film\u2019s sound design. Many found the background score too overwhelming, describing it as excessively loud, with some even complaining that it left them with headaches. In response to the criticism, sound designer Resul Pookutty, who has won an Oscar and a BAFTA for sound mixing, spoke out on Instagram.\nHe shared a screenshot of a review from India Today, which labelled Kanguva as \u201cone of the loudest films currently in theatres.\u201d Along with the post, Pookutty expressed his disappointment over how sound in popular films is often criticised. He pointed out that sound mixing is caught in the \u201cloudness war.\u201d\n\u201cA friend of mine, a re-recording mixer sent me this clip\u2026 It is disheartening to see a review about sound in our popular films like this. Our craft and artistry caught up in the loudness war\u2026 who is to blame?! The sound guy?! Or the innumerable fixes come at the last moment to satiate all insecurities,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cHigh time our fraternity to put your foot down and say things loud and clear. No film will have a repeat value if the audience walks out with a headache!\u201d he added.\nTake a look at the post here:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Resul Pookutty (@resulpookutty)\n\nPookutty is known for being open and candid on social media. In 2022, he criticised Alia Bhatt\u2019s role in RRR. He called her character more of a prop in the story overshadowed by the performances of Ram Charan and Jr NTR.\nDirected by Siva, Kanguva stars Suriya in the lead role, marking his return to the big screen after nearly two years. The film also features Bollywood stars Bobby Deol and Disha Patani, along with popular Tamil actors like Natarajan Subramaniam, Jagapathi Babu, Yogi Babu, Redin Kingsley, Kovai Sarala, and Ananda. Kanguva has been released in five languages: Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, and Malayalam.\nDespite facing tough competition from Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 starring Karthik Aaryan and Singham Again with Ajay Devgn, Kanguva had a solid start on its opening day. Reports suggest the film made Rs 22 crore on its first day with about Rs 13.65 crore coming from Tamil Nadu alone.",

        "text": "Amid Guru Nanak Jayanti 2024 celebrations across the nation, some stock market investors are confused about whether the Indian stock market will remain closed.\nIndian stock exchanges BSE and NSE will be closed for trading on Friday, November 15 on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti. India\u2019s largest non-agri commodity exchange Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) of India will remain shut in the first session between 9 am and 5 pm while resuming trade in the evening session between 5 pm and 11:30/11:55 pm.\nThe National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), an agri-exchange, will remain closed in both morning and evening sessions.\nStock market holidays in 2024\nTo avoid such confusion, people are advised to go to the BSE website \u2014 bseindia.com and click on the \u2018Trading Holidays\u2019 option on the top. After clicking the \u2018Trading Holidays\u2019 option, the complete list of stock market holidays in 2024 is opened. There are three stock market holidays in November 2024 in this list of stock market holidays. Out of these three stock market holidays in November 2024, one has gone on 1st November 2024 on Laxmi Pooja. The following two stock market holidays fall on 15th November 2024 for Guru Nanak Jayanti 2024 and 20th November 2024 for Maharashtra Assembly General Elections.\nEarlier, there were only two stock market holidays in November 2024. Still, due to the announcement of the Maharashtra Assembly General Elections on 20 November 2024, the BSE and the NSE declared stock market holidays on 20 November 2024.\nAccording to the BSE holiday calendar, trading holidays have been announced for 16 days in 2024. So far this year, they have been closed on 13 occasions. The last time they were closed was on Friday, November 1, for Laxmi Pujan.\nNext, markets will remain closed on December 25, Wednesday on account of Christmas.\nOn Thursday, Nifty was trading at 23,522.30 around 2 pm, down by 37 points of 0.16%. If the market ends in the red today, it will be its six straight loss. During this period, it has fallen by 954 points or over 4 per cent.\nThe current weakness is on account of relentless selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and market experts see further correction from current levels.\nNifty has already fallen 10 per cent from its September 27 record high of 26,277 and now analysts are giving out targets as low as 21,300 for India\u2019s headline index. Typically, a fall of 10 per cent is considered a correction zone and a drop of 20% from the peak would place Dalal Street officially in the bear market zone.\nIn the previous trading session, Nifty had breached its 200-DMA in intraday trading and hit a 5-month low near the 23,500 mark.\nFIIs have pulled out a record Rs 1.2 lakh crore from Dalal Street since Nifty\u2019s September peak as weak Q2 earnings are leading to downgrades.",

        "text": "The Congress on Friday complained to the Election Commission against the alleged grounding of party leader Rahul Gandhi\u2019s helicopter in poll-bound Jharkhand and sought its urgent intervention in ensuring a level playing field in poll campaigning.\nIn a letter to the EC, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh alleged that Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi\u2019s chopper was not allowed to take off due to restrictions leading to his public meetings getting either delayed or cancelled.\nAll India Congress Committee general secretary K C Venugopal hit out at the BJP government at the Centre, accusing it of denying the Congress a level playing field in elections.\n\u201cThere should be a level-playing field in campaigning. The PM\u2019s campaign cannot take precedence over that of all others. Today Rahul Gandhi got delayed in Jharkhand on this account,\u201d Ramesh said in a post on X.\nIn his complaint to the Chief Election Commissioner, Ramesh sought his urgent intervention, saying a level playing field should be maintained.\nHe said Gandhi was in Jharkhand for an election rally of the Congress and had secured all the requisite permissions for travelling across the state and attending all the pre-scheduled poll events.\nAccording to the approved schedule and permissions in place, Gandhi and his team were to take off from Godda to fly to other locations across the state at 1.15 pm, he said.\n\u201cHowever, their mode of travel, which was permitted to fly at 1.15 pm IST, has not been allowed to take flight. They have been informed that due to the protocol of other leaders in the vicinity, a no-fly zone restriction had been put in place. In fact, due to the said delay all subsequent programmes of Shri Rahul Gandhi (for which prior permission had been secured) is now either being delayed or cancelled,\u201d Ramesh said in his complaint.\n\u201cWe request your Commission to urgently intervene in this situation and ensure that the level playing field is not disrupted in such a manner.\n\u201cIf such a situation is allowed to prevail, then the ruling regime and its leaders can always take undue advantage of such protocols and limit the election campaign of opposition leaders,\u201d Ramesh said in his complaint.\nIn a post on X, Venugopal accused the Modi government of being \u201cbrazen\u201d and resorting to \u201cpetty tactics\u201d to stop Gandhi from campaigning.\n\u201cThe delay of nearly 2 hours in LOP Shri Rahul Gandhi Ji\u2019s helicopter taking off (caused by the Air Traffic Control) reeks of the BJP\u2019s intention to deny the Congress a level playing field in these elections,\u201d Venugopal said, adding that the Congress has approached the ECI and will demand an explanation.\n\u201cThis mistreatment took place on Dharti Aaba Birsa Munda Ji\u2019s jayanti, when Rahul Ji is in his birthplace Jharkhand to commemorate his contributions towards Adivasi rights.\n\u201cThe Modi government is so brazen that it will resort to such petty tactics to stop Rahul Ji, who has for decades spoken for Adivasi empowerment and protecting the Constitution at all costs. The people of Jharkhand know very well the BJP\u2019s shameless attitude and will punish them on voting day,\u201d Venugopal said.\nCongress leader and former Youth Congress chief B V Srinivas said, \u201cBJP\u2019s brazen tactics exposed! 2-hr delay in Rahul Gandhi\u2019s helicopter takeoff on Birsa Munda\u2019s birthday due to ATC clearance is nothing but an attempt to stop him from campaigning.\u201d \u201cRahul Ji\u2019s long-standing fight for Adivasi rights & Constitution won\u2019t be silenced.

        "title": "Why New Zealand\u2019s Youngest MP, Other M\u0101ori Leaders Protested In Parliament With A \u2018War Dance\u2019",
        "text": "Something unprecedented happened in the New Zealand Parliament on Thursday. Opposition MPs from the M\u0101ori indigenous community performed a traditional war dance to demonstrate their anger and fear over a bill that will redefine their rights.\nWhen the speaker asked Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, how her party would vote on the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill, the 22-year-old MP stood up, tore the copy of the bill and started performing the traditional Haka dance in Parliament.\nShe was joined in the Haka by other opposition leaders on the floor. Speaker Gerry Brownlee temporarily stopped the session. Maipi-Clarke, who was elected last year, was suspended for her protest, which Brownlee described as disrespectful.\nWho Are The M\u0101ori In New Zealand?\nThe M\u0101ori belong to the indigenous tribe of New Zealand for centuries. The M\u0101ori arrived on large ocean-faring canoes and settled throughout Polynesia and New Zealand. Their culture reflects a deep connection to the land and ancestral spirits.\nThe M\u0101ori language, known as Te Reo Maori, is an important part of their identity and is still spoken by many Maori people today.\nThe M\u0101ori have a deep spiritual connection with nature and the land. They call themselves \u2018kaitiaki\u2019 (guardians) of the natural resources. They believe in the concept of \u2018whakapapa\u2019, which means everything in the world is interconnected and has a genealogical link. Ancestors play a significant role in M\u0101ori culture, and their stories and traditions are passed down through generations.\nM\u0101ori make up roughly 20% of New Zealand\u2019s 5.3 million people. They experience material hardship, have worse health indicators and are incarcerated at much higher rates than the population at large.\nThere are six major ethnic groups in New Zealand: European, M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples, Asian, MELAA (Middle Eastern / Latin American / African), and \u2018Other ethnicity\u2019, according to a 2018 census.\nWhat Is The Iconic Haka Dance?\nThe war dance holds immense cultural significance. The haka is performed with powerful synchronised movements, vocal chants, and intense facial expressions, and it is used to express emotions, convey messages, and welcome visitors, according to tribes.world.\nThe dance is a symbol of unity, strength, and resilience for the Maori tribe.\nDespite facing challenges throughout history including colonization and cultural assimilation, the Maori are an integral part of New Zealand\u2019s society.\nWhat Is Treaty Of Waitangi That Maori Are Fighting For?\nThe treaty was signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 M\u0101ori chiefs, and is considered the founding document of New Zealand. It set out the terms of governance between the two parties. Its clauses continue to influence New Zealand\u2019s laws and policies today.\nThe bill, introduced last week by a political party known as \u2018Act\u2019, a junior partner in the centre-right coalition government, said it wanted equal rights for all, thus, undermining the Treaty\u2019s principles. The party argues that non-M\u0101ori citizens are being disadvantaged by policies designed to promote M\u0101ori rights and governance. This has already stoked racial tension in the country.\nAlthough the bill passed its first reading with support from the National Party and New Zealand First, both coalition partners have said they will not back it in subsequent readings, making it unlikely to become law.\nProtests Over The Bill\nAround 10,000 protesters marched through Rotorua, about 450 km north of the capital, with some wearing traditional attire as part of a nine-day hikoi (march). They were met by crowds waving the M\u0101ori flag and chanting in support.\nThousands of people participated in the hikoi moving towards Wellington this week to protest against a controversial bill that seeks to reinterpret the country\u2019s 184-year-old founding document.\nThe Treaty Principles Bill, which passed its first reading in parliament, will now proceed to a public submission process before the next vote. Its author, David Seymour, leader of the ACT party, argues that the proposal seeks to provide clarity on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.\nWho is Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke?\nMaipi-Clarke sees herself as the protector of the Maori people and represents the voice of younger generation of voters in New Zealand.\nShe first gained attention after her election in 2023, where she performed the traditional Haka dance during her maiden parliamentary speech.\nBoth Maipi-Clarke and her father were considered candidates to represent Te Pati Maori in the elections. Eventually, she was chosen for her \u201cyouthful perspective.\u201d\nNotably, Maipi-Clarke has been quite vocal in her criticism of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and his conservative government, which has faced allegations of ripping apart Maori rights.\nMaipi-Clarke also supports incorporating Indigenous knowledge and practices in tackling climate change. Her activism is inspired by her grandfather, Taitimu Maipi, a member of the Maori activist group Nga Tamatoa.\nMaipi-Clarke is from Huntly, a small town located between Auckland and Hamilton.",

        "title": "ICC Champions Trophy Row: Pakistan Provokes India, Cricket Board Announces Trophy Tour In PoK",
        "text": "Amid the uncertainty over the final schedule of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in a provocative move against India, announced that it will conduct a tour with the Champions Trophy across the country. The announcement has raised eyebrows for the inclusion of areas in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) on the list of destinations.\nThe announcement came in the backdrop of a big controversy, with BCCI making it clear that the Indian team will not travel to the neighbouring country due to strained ties and security concerns. Pakistan hold the hosting rights for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025\n\u201cGet ready, Pakistan. The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 trophy tour kicks off in Islamabad on 16 November, also visiting scenic travel destinations like Skardu, Murree, Hunza and Muzaffarabad\u201d, a post by PCB said on Thursday.\nWhy This Is Provocation From Pakistan\nWhat stood out in its social media messaging was the specific mention of Skardu, Hunza and Muzaffarabad, all of which are in PoK, a disputed region India claims as its own.\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)\u2019s refusal to play in Pakistan has irked PCB, which is currently run by Mohsin Raza Naqvi, who is also a federal minister.\nThe cold war has roiled the International Cricket Council (ICC)\u2014and there have been reports that it is considering several formulas for avoiding a situation where the tournament is played without world cricket powerhouse India. A hybrid model where India play matches in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been in the news. So, have speculations over a complete change of venue and an indefinite postponement of the tournament. PCB, however, wants to go ahead without India. ICC, the world cricket governing, have yet to speak on the final venue.\nThe glittering trophy, meanwhile, has reached Islamabad from Dubai. The move to use PoK for provocation is from an old Pakistan playbook. It routinely invites foreign dignitaries for trips to PoK, a ploy that has drawn sharp Indian rebuttals time and again.\nEarlier, the global cricketing body cancelled a major event marking the 100-day countdown to the Champions Trophy, that was supposed to be announced on November 11 in Lahore, owing to the hiccups they have encountered in scheduling, especially India games.\nIndia Won\u2019t Travel To Pakistan\nThe ICC has conveyed to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) about India\u2019s inability to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy. The global cricketing body sent an email to PCB, mentioning that India has decided against travelling to their neighbouring country for the 8-team tournament.\n\u201cThe Pakistan Cricket Board has received an email from the ICC (International Cricket Council), stating that the Indian board has informed them that their team will not travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy 2025,\u201d PCB spokesman Sami Ul Hasan was quoted as saying by AFP.\nThe BCCI has reportedly informed the global cricket body about the Indian government\u2019s denial of permission to travel to Pakistan for the showpiece event.\nICC Champions Trophy Controversy\nPakistan is due to host the eight-nation event in three cities \u2013 Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi \u2013 from February 19 to March 9 next year but the final schedule was hanging in the balance with India yet to confirm its participation.\nEver since the ICC announced the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan, there have been concerns over India\u2019s participation in the marquee event given the diplomatic tensions between the two neighbouring countries. However, Pakistan travelled to India to play in the 2016 T20 World Cup and 2023 50-over World Cup.\nIndia and Pakistan have only faced off in ICC multi-nation events since their last bilateral series in the 2012-13 season. Pakistan did not host any international cricket between 2009 and 2015 after gunmen attacked the Sri Lanka team 15 years ago.",

Vulnerable sections of society, especially women and children, are disproportionately affected in such crimes,\u201d said a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Pankaj Mithal.\nThe apex court said the victims of such crimes are often mistreated by their traffickers and have to endure physical and mental forms of violence that are inflicted upon them.\n\u201cThey stand at a greater risk of sustaining several life-threatening injuries and contracting infections and illnesses, including sexually transmitted diseases.\n\u201cAdditionally, the mental health consequences can range from anxiety disorders, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and substance abuse as well,\u201d the bench said.\nA majority of such victims may require continuous access to doctors and other mental health professionals who can tend to their specific needs, it added.\n\u201cAlienation and ostracism by the larger society is also inherently associated with such crimes. Individuals who are trafficked are often abruptly alienated from their immediate family and other social groups due to the attribution of sentiments like guilt and shame on the victims,\u201d the bench said.\n\u201cThis has the unfortunate consequence of them being further isolated, secluded and withdrawn from society. The crime is also of such nature that it seriously hampers the pursuit of further education and learning,\u201d the bench added.\nThe top court was hearing a plea seeking compliance of a 2015 judgement on victims of sexual assault.",
