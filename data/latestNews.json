He is working as an agent of the National Conference. This is all a conspiracy by the National Conference. What happened there today, and the use of marshals that led to injuries to some leaders, is condemnable. They all were knowing it earlier that this kind of situation would happen.

The festival, spanning over next four days will see a series of meticulously planned rituals and offerings.\n\nThe festival begins with Nahay Khay (bathing and feasting), where participants take a ritualistic bath and consume a simple meal. The subsequent day, devotees observe Kharna, which involves fasting throughout the day, breaking it only after sunset as an offering to the deities. The person observing the fast takes the meal of roti (chappati) and kheer (rice pudding) before the family members and friends gather to eat the same meal on a banana leaf together.\n\nOn the third day, the main ritual having immense devotion ascribed to it, takes place. Chhath devotees gather at the water bodies including rivers, ponds and something, before sunrise. Standing waist-deep in water, they offer \u2018arghya\u2019 (offering of water) to the rising Sun, chanting prayers.\n\nDevotees, clad in traditional attire, gather at riverbanks and sacred water bodies, engaging in elaborate rituals that include singing devotional songs and performing dances, creating a vibrant atmosphere of community and spirituality. The sight of colourful decorations, offerings laid on woven baskets, and the collective spirit of devotion paints a striking picture of unity and faith.\n\nIn essence, Chhath is not just a festival; it is a celebration of life, health, and the enduring connection between humanity and nature. As Bihar residents around the world partake in these rituals, the festival continues to thrive as a symbol of cultural identity and spiritual richness, bridging the past with the present in a beautiful tapestry of tradition.\n\nThe festival is dedicated to the worship of Lord Surya and his sister Chhathi Maiya, the sixth form of Devi Prakriti and is popularly observed in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal.\n\nDuring the festival, the devotees observe fasting to express gratitude to the Sun god for sustaining life on Earth. This year, the festival is being celebrated from November 5 (Tuesday) to November 8 (Friday).\n\nThis year, Chhath Puja will take place from November 6th to November 9th.",

Today, Kolhan is determined to uproot the corrupt JMM government.\u201d\n\nHe prophesied that BJP will be next to form government in the state..\n\n\u201cThis is my second rally here, and from the enthusiasm I see, I can confidently say that BJP will form the government with record-breaking seats.\u201d\n\nPM Modi underscored the BJP\u2019s commitment to Jharkhand, invoking a popular slogan that has gained traction among the masses: \u201cRoti, beti aur maati ki pukaar, Jharkhand me BJP-NDA sarkar,\u201d affirming that if the NDA assumes power, it will focus on addressing local demands symbolised by \u201cRoti, Beti, Maati\u201d (livelihood, daughters, and land).\n\nHe praised the BJP\u2019s historical role in advancing Adivasi rights, stating, \u201cWhen the BJP first formed a government at the Centre, it was under Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s leadership that Adivasis were granted their own states, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. For the past decade, we have tirelessly advocated for Adivasi demands nationally and globally.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister contrasted BJP\u2019s pro-Adivasi approach with the Congress, RJD, and JMM, accusing them of being \u201canti-Adivasi\u201d forces.\n\n\u201cNo one has been a bigger enemy to the Adivasi community than Congress and RJD,\u201d he asserted, urging young people to remember the Gua Goli Kand incident of the 1980s, where Adivasis were reportedly oppressed and even shot at under the Congress government in Bihar for demanding statehood for Jharkhand.\n\nContinuing his critique, PM Modi claimed that RJD leaders once vowed that Jharkhand would only be formed \u201cover their dead bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the JMM is aligned with the RJD, which resisted Jharkhand\u2019s formation from the start. No party has been a bigger enemy of Jharkhand than the Congress and RJD,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Prime Minister also highlighted that the Congress, with \u201cAdivasi blood on its hands,\u201d is now supporting JMM, illustrating what he described as the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Adivasi aspirations by these alliances.\n\nThe Prime Minister pointed out that, unlike the Congress, the BJP has appointed Adivasi leaders to top positions, including President Droupadi Murmu, Chhattisgarh\u2019s Vishnu Deo Sai and Union Minister Savitri Thakur.\n\nHe noted that the BJP-led NDA was responsible for giving India its first female Adivasi President.\n\n\u201cEven when we chose an Adivasi woman as the President of India, these Congress leaders opposed it,\u201d he said, underlining BJP\u2019s commitment to empowering the Adivasi community.\n\nPM Modi also accused the Congress, JMM, and RJD of repeatedly \u201cinsulting\u201d the Adivasi community, citing the dismissal of Champai Soren from the Chief Minister post as a direct affront to Adivasis.\n\n\u201cToday, the voice of Adivasis is represented by our President, but Congress, JMM, and their allies cannot tolerate an Adivasi President. They didn\u2019t shy away from hurling insults at her,\u201d he stated, concluding with a strong appeal to Jharkhand\u2019s electorate.",

This rush to register lands under the Waqf Board is resulting in thousands of poor families and farmers losing ancestral lands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the Waqf Board has claimed ownership of temple lands, monasteries, and other Hindu religious institutions, with even Hindu cremation grounds reportedly being listed as Waqf property.\n\n\u201cThe claims by the Waqf board include 1.28 acres belonging to the historic Virakta Math in Sindagi, the Someshwara Temple in Vijayapura, and the Birdevara Gudi in Kalaburagi. This has led to fears among farmers that they might lose their lands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged that merely withdrawing notices is insufficient and demanded that farmers\u2019 names be restored in property records and that the 1974 gazette notification be repealed.\n\n\u201cThis has caused public unrest, leading to violence and riots in places like Haveri. In light of these events, Ashoka has urged the JPC to engage with Karnataka\u2019s Chief Secretary and immediately halt the registration of Waqf-related lands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the Central government has established the JPC to draft the Waqf Amendment Bill with a focus on ensuring efficient and transparent management of Waqf properties.\n\n\u201cHowever, the state government and Waqf Board in Karnataka are attempting to alter revenue records and acquire ownership of farmers\u2019 lands,\u201d Ashoka stated.\n\n\u201cI am writing this to bring to your attention the recent developments in Karnataka where hasty attempts are made to register lands claimed by the Waqf board perhaps in anticipation of the amendment that Joint Parliamentary Committee could bring to the Waqf Act,\u201d he stated.\n\nAshoka noted that as part of this pre-emptive attempt, the state government and Waqf board have reportedly begun altering land revenue records, transferring ownership of farmers\u2019 lands to the Waqf board.\n\n\u201cThis hurried whitewashing and registering of unjust claims of land to Waqf boards will deprive thousands of farmers and poor people of Karnataka of their just and ancestral property rights,\u201d he said.",
