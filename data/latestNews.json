Three people were hurt when unidentified persons opened fire on the group. The attack also caused some damage to Goswami\u2019s car.\n\nReacting to the incident, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma lashed out at Congress party alleging that the opposition party which does photo-op with the Constitution is actually resorting to violence and attacking the BJP workers.\n\nTaking to X, Sarma wrote, \u201cI strongly condemn the attack on Hon\u2019ble MLA Shri Jitu Goswami in Samaguri by @INCAssam supporters. This is the same Congress that proudly holds up the Constitution for the cameras, yet resorts to violence under cover of darkness to intimidate our karyakartas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real question is, why has Congress stooped to such low in this by-election?

But it\u2019s his own misconception,\u201d Joshi remarked.\n\nJoshi countered Siddaramaiah by saying that it wasn\u2019t Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the BJP who accused the state excise ministry and government of Rs 700 crore in corruption; rather, it was the excise dealers themselves. He urged Siddaramaiah to understand this first.\n\n\u201cThe excise dealers are part of his own government. These very dealers have accused Excise Minister R.B. Thimmapur of corruption, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi simply referenced this issue. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Joshi questioned.\n\n\u201cIn his 25 years in politics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has never faced defeat. He has been Chief Minister of Gujarat three times and has been elected as the Prime Minister twice. He\u2019s a seasoned politician who has never lost in his career. And yet, you dare speak about him,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cThe people of Mysore rejected you in the 2018 Assembly elections from the Varuna segment, even though you were the Chief Minister from 2013 to 2018. But the people have never turned away from Prime Minister Narendra Modi,\u201d Joshi retorted to Siddaramaiah.\n\nHe added that as more and more corruption scams within the state government are coming to light, the Siddaramaiah is becoming desperate. \n\n\u201cIn the MUDA scam, a tehsildar\u2019s report even shows that stamp duty payments were made on behalf of the Siddaramaiah, which has come out in the open, leaving him cornered,\u201d he added.\n\nReacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s attack during the campaigning in Maharashtra state that the Congress government in Karnataka has \u2018collected\u2019 Rs 700 for assembly elections, Siddaramaiah had stated in Haveri that \u201cI am surprised to see the Prime Minister of this country lie so much.\u201d\n\nWhile campaigning in Maharashtra, the Prime Minister claimed that the Karnataka Congress was involved in a scam in the excise department, mobilising Rs 700 crores to send to Maharashtra, and Jharkhand, and to spend on the bypolls.\n\n\u201cToday, I challenge PM Modi: if he can prove these allegations, I will retire from politics. But if he cannot, then he should retire. When a Prime Minister makes such allegations, they should at least be close to the truth, but these claims are far from it. In independent India, we have never seen a Prime Minister who lies like this,\u201d he said.",

Saxena\u2019s court over formulation of a policy for long-term engagement of 10,000 Civil Defence Volunteers (CDVs) as bus marshals.\n\nIntensifying the political tussle between the elected government and the Raj Niwas that reports to the Central government, CM Atishi urged the L-G to draft the policy which she claimed was beyond her domain.\n\nShe also urged Saxena to immediately reinstate 10,000 bus marshals on \u201cas-is-where-is basis\u201d so that women safety in buses is not compromised over the next four-five months that might be needed to draft a policy for their permanent engagement.\n\nAs chances of long-term engagement of bus marshals continue to diminish with each passing day of the AAP government\u2019s tenure, the latest move by the AAP government appears an attempt to shield itself from any blame for delay over the matter in an election year.\n\nCM Atishi\u2019s decision to ask the L-G to draft the proposal comes within a week of an advice given by Raj Niwas to her on similar lines for directing officials to formulate a policy for long-term engagement of CDVs and bus marshals.\n\nFor now, the L-G is considering a proposal from the AAP government to engage the 10,000 out-of-job CDVs as green warriors for four months.\n\nPointing to rise in harassment of women in buses in the absence of bus marshals, CM Atishi said at a press conference that after a long discussion with officials she had come to the conclusion that the issue of re-engagement of bus marshals was related to service department and public order, both of which were reserved subjects that come under the domain of L-G Saxena.\n\n\u201cWe have requested the L-G to formulate a policy on the matter so that bus marshals can be deployed in two shifts in public transport buses,\u201d said CM Atishi at a joint press conference with Health Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj.\n\nReiterating the AAP government\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s safety, CM Atishi said travelling in public transport buses was a harrasing experience for women and to check this bus marshals were deployed in 2015 by then Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\n\u201cBut, the BJP through its officials raised objections to the scheme. In April 2023, the salary of bus marshals was stopped and from October 2023 Civil Defence Volunteers working as bus marshals were removed,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the past one year, bus marshals, supported by AAP ministers and leaders, were agitating on roads for re-engagement and finally the Central government had to bow before their demands, she said.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the AAP government has decided to re-engage the CDVs for anti-pollution duties. But, the bigger question that needs to be addressed is that of women safety in public transport buses over the next four months,\u201d she said.\n\nBhardwaj said the L-G and Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta of BJP were playing tricks and delaying the re-appointment of bus marshals.\n\n\u201cMy request to the L-G is not to delay the matter and use his powers to immediately reinstate the bus marshals,\u201d he said.",

If they don\u2019t, then my men will do the needful,\u201d cautioned Thackeray.\n\nThe ECI has mandated the checking of the aircraft of most VVIPs in the polling season ostensibly to prevent ferrying any unauthorised or objectionable allurements to sway the voters.\n\n(Quaid Najmi can be contacted at: qnajmi@gmail.com)",

Our standing in the field of research and innovation will define our prowess to the global community and give cutting edge to our soft diplomacy,\u201d he said.\n\nSharing an emotional personal experience, the Vice President said: \u201cI was selected for IIT Kharagpur.

They are ambassadors of the institution. It is an acknowledged method globally and nationally that the best way to pay back to your institution is to be an active member of the alumni association.\u201d\n\n\u201cI strongly urge you to have an alumni fund\u2026 making annual contributions is all important. Some of the best institutions globally have been on an upward trajectory because these institutions are fueled by alumni energy. You have to conserve and converge your alumni energy for better prospects of all those who step into this institution to get an education,\u201d he said.\n\nCalling for unflinching commitment to nationalism in its fullness, he said national interest has to have precedence or partisan or otherwise interests.\n\n\u201cEconomic nationalism has to be a dominant concern for business. Howsoever justifiable, howsoever big in volume or fiscal quantum, there is no excuse for compromising economic nationalism. This denudes our commitment to the principle of keeping the nation first,\u201d he said.\n\nHe appealed to chambers of commerce and industry and associations of trade to come forward to fuel research and spur innovation through liberal financial contributions.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the name of commitment to research, let us not have something that is just surface scratching.

Stalin visited Virudhunagar district as part of his statewide tour to monitor government projects. \n\nDuring his visit, he stopped by a fireworks factory in the district, where he met with the workers and staff to inquire about their well-being.\n\nStalin inspected the firecracker production areas and the warehouse and reviewed the required certifications for the factory\u2019s operation.\n\nThe Chief Minister directed the factory owner to provide insurance facilities for all the workers. He was informed that the factory was well-equipped, adhered to all safety protocols, and had not experienced any accidents.\n\nIt may be noted that Virudhunagar district, particularly Sivakasi, is the largest firecracker-producing region in India. During the 2024 Deepavali festival, Sivakasi reported a sales turnover of Rs 6,000 crore, solidifying its reputation as the \u2018firecracker capital of India\u2019.\n\nUpon arrival at Madurai airport from Chennai, the Chief Minister was accorded a warm welcome. Crowds gathered along the roads to greet him as he travelled to Virudhunagar.\n\nThis visit is part of a larger tour that Stalin began in Coimbatore on November 5.\n\nIn a letter to party members, he shared his plans to conduct ground-level inspections across the state to evaluate the progress of various government schemes.\n\nHe emphasised his commitment to visiting every district to inform the public about the achievements and successes of these welfare initiatives. Although he has not specified a timeline for the tour, Stalin\u2019s visits will be spread out over time.\n\nSince taking office in May 2021, his government has introduced various programmes aimed at uplifting marginalised communities.\n\nKey initiatives include the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam scheme, which provides Rs 1,000 monthly to 1,15,16,292 women; free bus travel for women; the Makkalai Thedi Matuthuvam (Health at Doorstep) scheme; and the Chief Minister\u2019s Free Breakfast Scheme for schoolchildren.\n\nAnother notable scheme, Pudhumai Pen, offers Rs 1,000 per month to girl students from government and government-aided schools pursuing college education. Around 3.28 lakh girl students have benefitted from this initiative.\n\nFollowing the success of the abovementioned scheme, it was extended to boys in government and government-aided schools through the Tamizh Pudhalvan scheme, which now aids approximately 3.18 lakh boys.\n\nThe government\u2019s Naan Mudhalvan (I am the First) scheme has trained 28 lakh students to improve employability and facilitate skill development.\n\nThrough these schemes, the government has distributed over Rs 6,569 crore across Tamil Nadu. The initiatives have drawn attention from other states, with ministers and officials visiting Tamil Nadu to learn about the welfare programmes inspired by the Dravidian model.\n\nThe Chief Minister\u2019s office announced that Stalin would meet with government officials, MPs, MLAs, and local representatives to review the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nOn Sunday, he will meet with sanitary workers and traders of Virudhunagar to hear their grievances. Stalin will also inaugurate the new District Collector\u2019s Office and the Integrated Commercial Tax Office in Virudhunagar on November 10.",
