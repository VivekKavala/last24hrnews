                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Although many people commonly use the term “color blindness” for this condition, color blindness in the sense that everything is seen in shades of black and white is very rare.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> So most people who are color blind see a different color than they should see.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Color blindness is usually an inherited condition, and men are more likely to be born with the condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Most people with color blindness cannot distinguish between certain shades of red and green.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Less commonly, a person with this vision disorder cannot distinguish between blue and yellow.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In addition, certain eye diseases and some medications can also cause color blindness.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The most common color blindness is the inability to see some shades of red and green.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Often, a person who is less able to see red-green or blue-yellow is not fully sensitive to either color.</p>
