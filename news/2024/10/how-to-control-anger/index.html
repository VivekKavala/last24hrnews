                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Yes, this is a kind of meditation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Along with this, you should always try to laugh while being with people.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If you want, you can sit and laugh with your whole family every day because by doing this you are relieving the stress of the whole family.</p>

You just have to do yoga and exercise for 15 minutes in your daily life because it eliminates the stress and anxiety inside you, therefore you should do pranayam daily due to which your mind remains calm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

But you have to learn yoga and exercise from a teacher who has complete knowledge about it.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Note – Laughing acts as a medicine to reduce anger, due to which the anger of any person ends immediately, that is why by doing this daily, we get a happy life and get rid of the habit of anger.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Get angry at yourself and give yourself time

If you get angry a lot, then you should take out time for yourself in which you can sit quietly and calm your mind.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For this, you just have to calm your mind and sit quietly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This is a kind of meditation which helps in controlling anger.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Note – In such a situation, after keeping your mind calm for some time, you can slowly and comfortably think about the disadvantages of anger 

take deep breaths when angry

People who get angry a lot can do this process when they get angry.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In this, you have to take long breaths slowly, after which you release them slowly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This is the best process to calm the whole body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> You have to do this work a maximum 3 times.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In this, you just have to close your eyes and take a deep breath, after which your anger slowly calms down, that is why if you like it, you can meditate daily

Note – Research done by Professor Robert Nicholson of Saint Louis University found that if we take deep breaths when we are at the peak of anger (anger is about to come out now), then our anger reduces.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

An angry person should keep his mind clear

Every person who gets angry a lot should not suppress anything in his mind because when something stays in a person’s mind, it either gives him happiness or sadness.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But if something is giving you happiness, then it is okay.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

But you should not keep the sad thing in your mind because by doing so, that thing either keeps hurting you forever or it turns into anger and weakens you mentally.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This is the reason why people keep getting angry all the time.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Sometimes we take out the anger of one person on another person.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Share your heart’s feelings with someone close to you

Yes, because when people have something in their mind or heart, then they get more angry, but if this is the case with you, then you should share your thoughts with someone close to your heart because by doing this you feel better.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Don’t let anger increase your stress

You all know that most of people get very angry due to stress, due to which they become irritable but to keep this away you have to reduce stress.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Express anger appropriately

Sometimes you are not a person who gets angry on small things but you suddenly get angry on some matter, then in such a case you should recognize your anger and do something about that work that was making you angry.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

For example, you saw injustice being done to someone due to which you got angry but here you have to understand the meaning of your anger by raising your voice against it, after which you can control your anger by satisfying your mind.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Think once before speaking in anger (one should speak after thinking)

People who get angry a lot, say anything to anyone in anger, but this creates distance in people’s relationships.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> That is why if you think once before saying your words in anger, then you can save your important relationships from breaking.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Note- Take special care of this thing, otherwise you may say something to a close person in anger which can hurt his/her feelings.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Boxing on a punching bag (calm down anger)

Sometimes there are some people who are unable to control their anger by staying calm, this is normal but anger of most of the people ends by staying calm but if your anger is very high and you cannot remain calm in anger

So in such a situation it does not work, in this you should calm your anger by boxing on a punching bag or by doing some gym exercise, by doing this you do things like boxing on a punching bag, boxing on a pillow, etc.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> to bring out your anger.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Note – Although this is wrong, but it is very important to calm down your anger as soon as possible, otherwise it will cause you mental harm because it calms down anger but disturbs your mental peace.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Start counting when you are angry

Yes, this work is very useful for you, whenever you are angry, you have to count to relax, after which your anger slowly calms down
