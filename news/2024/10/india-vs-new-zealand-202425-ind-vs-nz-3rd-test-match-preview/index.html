                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But barely anyone would have predicted that "2" would not be against India's name.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>It's taken a series of firsts for New Zealand to find themselves in the position they are in.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And now as they head to Mumbai with the series in the bag, they have the chance to do the unthinkable - inflict a series sweep over India in India.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Only once have India been swept in a series of more than one Test at home - against South Africa in 1999-2000 - and never in a series of more than two Tests.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Can India save themselves the blushes?While there is pride at stake for the home team, there are also crucial WTC points up for grabs for both sides.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> India are still leading the WTC points table but that lead has been cut short big time with these two defeats.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Another loss here and they will have plenty of catching up to do in Australia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>For New Zealand, getting to the WTC final seemed far-fetched when this series started but these two wins have brought them right back into contention.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A win in Mumbai and then in the three-match series at home against England will keep them in the mix for a second WTC final in a row.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>It's taken a lot of grit, determination and long spells of brilliant cricket for New Zealand to be able to dictate terms.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They cleaned up India for 46 in Bengaluru and then stuck it out in the second innings when Rishabh Pant and Sarfaraz Khan were hitting them around.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The naysayers would say the conditions in Bengaluru were more suited to New Zealande than to India.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> So they went to Pune and beat India in conditions that were completely different.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They also have Ajaz Patel, who is scene of his epic ten-wicket haul from 2021.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>For India, it's more about how to bounce back from these shock defeats and get a win under their belt ahead of the Australia tour.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> On paper, this is a dead rubber.</p>
