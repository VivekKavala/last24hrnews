Many young people in non-cosmopolitan or Global South settings might connect with the spirit of \u201cbrattiness\u201d but lack the avenues to embrace it fully due to economic or social constraints.\u201cThen there\u2019s the question of mental health, which varies widely across cultures. Climate change and other existential threats affect us differently, depending on where we live. Given these differences, \u201cbrat\u201d risks becoming an ableist term, promoting one-sidedness while also overlooking the cultural nuances that shape our everyday experiences. Many young people lack the economic security or stable family backgrounds to explore this cosmopolitan notion of brightness. So, does this aesthetic truly capture Gen Z across the globe? No, it\u2019s largely centred in urban, privileged spaces,\u201d says Prodosh.JUDGEMENTAL NO MORESaumya Baijal, strategy director at Virtue Worldwide, feels language shapes thought, just as thought shapes language, and that these expressions guide cultural shifts. \u201cAs a word, it was originally a descriptor laden with judgment by an older generation, aimed at rejecting its authority and ideas. It is the rejection that is being overturned, with the word shifting from an adjective to a noun. Today\u2019s generation is reclaiming the idea of rejecting authority, within the context of their confidence,\u201d she asserts. Comedian Mohammed Hussain compares the \u201cbrat\u201d aesthetic to past generational trends, suggesting that it indicates a craving for originality amidst shifting societal realities, but warns it can also reinforce materialism. \u201cThe current financial climate is unsettling. If having a \u2018brat\u2019 summer means wearing a simple white T-shirt and blue jeans, embracing it as a statement, at least it promotes societal acceptance of not constantly chasing the newest.

        "title": "5 Best & Worst Juices For Your Health",
        "text": "Juices can be a convenient way to consume vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, especially from fresh fruits and vegetables. However, not all juices are created equal. While fresh, whole fruit and vegetable juices offer health benefits, some store-bought or overly processed juices can be high in added sugars and lack fibre, potentially leading to blood sugar spikes and weight gain. The best juices are nutrient-dense, with minimal added sugars and fibre to support digestive health. Read on as we share the best and worst juices for your health.\n\nBest juices for your health\n\n1. Carrot juice\n\nCarrot juice is packed with beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant that supports eye health, immune function, and skin health. It also provides vitamins A, C, and K, and potassium, helping improve heart and skin health. Drinking carrot juice in moderation can be a delicious way to boost these nutrients.\n\n2. Pomegranate juice\n\nThis juice is rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support heart health. Studies have shown pomegranate juice may also lower blood pressure and cholesterol, making it a heart-healthy choice.\n\n3. Beet juice\n\nKnown for its high nitrate content, beet juice can help lower blood pressure and improve blood flow. This makes it especially beneficial for athletes, as it may improve endurance and exercise performance. Beet juice can also support brain health and cognitive function.\n\n4. Green juice\n\nA juice made from leafy greens like spinach, kale, and celery provides vitamins C, K, and minerals like calcium and magnesium. Low in sugar and high in fibre, green juices support digestion and provide a powerful dose of antioxidants.\n\n5. Orange juice\n\nFreshly squeezed orange juice is a good source of vitamin C, potassium, and folate. It supports immune health, skin health, and heart function. Just be cautious with portion sizes, as it's easy to over-consume.\n\nWorst juices for your health\n\n1. Juice blends with added sugars\n\nMany commercial juices are mixed with added sugars or high-fructose corn syrup, which can spike blood sugar levels and contribute to weight gain and metabolic issues. Always check labels for added sugars and avoid these options.\n\n2. Fruit punches\n\nThese juices typically contain only a small percentage of actual fruit juice and are mostly made of water, artificial flavours, and sugars. They offer little to no nutritional value and are best avoided in favour of real fruit juices.\n\n3. Cranberry cocktail\n\nWhile pure cranberry juice has health benefits, cranberry cocktails are often mixed with sugars to reduce tartness. High in sugar and low in fibre, these cocktails can quickly raise blood sugar without the full benefits of pure cranberry juice.\n\n4. Grape juice\n\nWhile it may contain antioxidants, grape juice is also naturally high in sugars. Many store-bought versions contain added sugars, making it very calorie-dense and a contributor to weight gain and blood sugar spikes when consumed in excess.\n\n5. Apple juice (processed)\n\nProcessed apple juice often lacks fibre and has added sugars, which can lead to blood sugar spikes and offer few health benefits compared to whole apples. Whole apples are a much better choice, as they provide fibre and a slower release of sugars.\n\nChoosing juices that are minimally processed, have no added sugars, and are consumed in moderation can make a difference in health benefits.\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Actor Govinda, who recently made headlines for accidentally shooting himself (on the left leg) with a loaded revolver, finally shared details about how he injured his leg during a recent press conference, shortly after being discharged from the hospital today (October 4).Govinda, speaking about the incident that occurred on October 1, told the media that he initially couldn\u2019t believe it had happened. \"Thoda gehra lag gaya tha, jab laga tab vishwas nahi hua. Aisa laga ke yeh kya hua? (The wound was deep, but I couldn\u2019t believe it had happened. I was thinking, \u2018What just happened?\u2019).\"According to the Indian Express, Govinda recounted the shocking incident, which took place early in the morning, around 4:45-5:00 a.m., while he was preparing to leave for a show in Kolkata. He explained how the revolver accidentally fell and misfired, causing a sudden jolt. The incident resulted in a gush of blood, leaving him shocked by the unexpected turn of events.113842639He further explained that after the incident, he chose not to involve anyone else to avoid causing trouble. Instead, he recorded some videos and was quickly taken to Dr Agarwal, who then accompanied him to the hospital for treatment.When asked why he had a loaded revolver, the 'Naseeb' actor admitted that he can be a bit carefree by nature and didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. He explained that in the rush of getting ready in the morning, he thought everything was fine, but now emphasizes the importance of being cautious. He hopes others can learn from his experience and avoid similar incidents. \"Main thoda sa mast raha karta hoon (I\u2019m a bit carefree by nature). I felt nothing was wrong,\" he added.113843671Govinda attributed his need to carry a revolver to the challenges of fame, explaining that success is like a flame that requires caution. \"Fame is a flame, and you have to be aware of it all over the world. It is like fire when you become successful, and you have to tread carefully,\" he stated. While he acknowledges the love and support from many, he also recognizes the presence of competition and jealousy. However, he urged that no misconceptions or misunderstandings should arise from the incident, and it should not be linked to anyone or anything else.\"I would like to say that this incident should not be attached to anyone or anything. There should be no galatfehmi (misunderstandings) around,\" Govinda added before thanking his fans and followers for their outpouring of love and support.",

In a recent interview, Ananya revealed that she gets her \u201cnazar\u201d taken out every week to ward off negativity. \u201cI take out my nazar every week. The help at my house does the mirchi thing. You know the Mirchi thing? So, if it smells a lot, it means you have nazar. If the mirchi burns a lot, you have nazar. I don't know the science behind it,\u201d Ananya said in a video shared on Netflix India's YouTube channel. The actress also mentioned that her mother, Bhavana Panday, often puts \u201ckaala teeka\u201d behind her ear to shield her from the evil eye. She said, \u201cMy mom put two black dots behind my ear before I came here. Everyone thinks I don't shower or have something dirty behind my ear, but my mom keeps putting it again and again.\u201d(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Last month, Netflix dropped the trailer for CTRL. The story follows Ananya Panday's character Nella and her seemingly perfect life. She stumbles onto Control Your Life, an AI-based program. Her life changes after logging into the app. Nella's relationship with her boyfriend Joe (Vihaan Samat) comes to an end after he cheats on her but everyone blames her. In resentment, Nella says to CTRL, \u201cI just want to erase my ex.\u201d While Nella wants to take away her suffering, the app has different ideas. Soon after, Joe's presence in the real world starts fading along with his social media blueprint. After a phone conversation, Nella learns that Joe has gone missing. \"But isn't that what you wanted?\" an AI-generated character asks Nella in the last few seconds of the trailer.Sharing her thoughts on playing Nella, Ananya Panday said in a statement, \u201cMy character Nella is like any of us. She's caught up in a world dominated by technology and social media. CTRL explores how we navigate the fine line between our online presence and who we are in real life. Working with Vikram sir and Nikhil sir has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait for you to watch it on Netflix and uncover the connection between Nella and Allen,\u201d reported News18. CTRL is produced by Nikhil Dwivedi and Arya Menon under Saffron and Andolan Films.",
