By addressing the situation, Trump is seen by his supporters as championing minority rights worldwide, a cause they believe many political figures overlook. Commenters also admired his courage in tackling a sensitive issue tied to religious and ethnic persecution, noting that such statements carry diplomatic weight and are seldom made by leaders who prefer to avoid complex international conflicts. Some users connected Trump’s advocacy to his strong ties with India and the Indian diaspora, interpreting his comments as a sign of continued support for Hindu communities and a reinforcement of the US-India relationship. There is a shared hope that Trump’s statements will catalyse greater awareness and global intervention, helping to shed light on the challenges faced by Hindus in Bangladesh and supporting a push for international action on their behalf.What is the California caste bill and why was it vetoed? When Donald Trump spoke about the \\'radical left agenda\\' he was referring to the the \\'California caste bill\\' that had been dubbed a move to discriminate against Hindus. The California caste bill, or Senate Bill 403 (SB403), was introduced by State Senator Aisha Wahab to outlaw discrimination based on caste by adding it to California’s civil rights protections. While the bill aimed to explicitly address caste discrimination — a social stratification often associated with South Asian communities — it faced significant controversy and opposition, leading to its eventual veto by Governor Gavin Newsom.Governor Newsom’s veto was based on his view that the bill was “unnecessary” because existing civil rights laws already prevent discrimination based on race, ancestry, religion, national origin, and other protected categories. Newsom asserted that these existing protections were sufficient to address any caste-based discrimination without singling out specific communities.The proposal of SB403 brought a heated debate within the Hindu American community. Some groups, like the Hindu American Foundation, opposed the bill, arguing that it would increase discrimination against Hindus and unfairly target the community by associating them with caste-based discrimination. They argued that caste is not inherently a part of Hinduism, and many in the South Asian diaspora have left caste-based practices behind when they moved to the United States. These opponents viewed the bill as creating unnecessary suspicion toward South Asian, especially Hindu, Americans, who they felt were being stereotyped by the association with caste. This opposition mobilized a wide range of Hindu American groups and activists who saw the bill as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Hinduism and the South Asian community.Conversely, other Hindu groups and activists, including Hindus for Caste Equity, supported the bill. They argued that caste discrimination persists within some South Asian communities and that explicit legal protection would help address issues of bias and exclusion that can still arise. Advocates of the bill, including Equality Labs, argued that caste-based discrimination needed to be recognized and addressed explicitly to protect those who continue to face caste oppression. Some activists even held a hunger strike to encourage Newsom to sign the bill, underscoring their view of the importance of caste protections.Despite the veto, the debate around SB403 has underscored the growing political engagement of Hindu Americans in the United States. As the Hindu American population has increased, so has its participation in the political sphere, with organizations focusing on civic engagement, advocacy, and community representation. The opposition to SB403 became a unifying moment for some in the Hindu American community, who rallied against what they saw as a potential mischaracterization of their religion and community. For others, the bill represented an opportunity to confront caste discrimination more directly.Ultimately, Newsom’s veto has postponed, rather than resolved, the issue. Both sides of the debate have expressed a commitment to continuing their advocacy, reflecting broader questions about how immigrant communities navigate and address complex social issues in new cultural contexts. The conversation surrounding caste discrimination is likely to persist, with some seeing the veto as a victory for Hindu representation and others as a setback in the fight against caste oppression.Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh Following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, Bangladesh has witnessed a significant surge in violence targeting minority communities, particularly Hindus. Incidents of vandalism, looting, and arson have spread fear and instability across affected regions, leaving many minority families devastated.Reports reveal that in the weeks following Hasina’s departure, over two thousand incidents of violence have been recorded against Hindus in nearly half of the country’s districts. Dozens of temples have been attacked, homes have been looted or set alight, and several individuals have lost their lives amidst this wave of aggression. The damage inflicted on businesses and community structures has left families in financial ruin, compounding the challenges of securing basic safety and recovery.The interim government, now led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has publicly condemned these attacks and expressed a commitment to protect vulnerable communities. However, many members of the minority population feel that efforts to address their safety concerns have been insufficient, with ongoing reports of targeted violence and intimidation. Calls for stronger action and effective measures to safeguard minority rights are mounting, with community leaders pushing for faster, more robust protections.International observers have reacted to the crisis with mounting concern. Figures from around the world have expressed disapproval of the attacks, calling on Bangladesh’s government to ensure justice for the victims and protect the integrity of minority communities. Calls have also been made for a comprehensive investigation into these human rights violations, pressing for accountability for those responsible for the violence.As the unrest continues into November, minority communities remain on edge. Local leaders have emphasised the importance of governmental action to restore a sense of safety and order. The interim administration faces mounting pressure to provide assurances of security and uphold minority rights amidst this tense period of political transition.Trump on ModiAmidst the US Presidential campaign\\'s fervour, Donald Trump made an appearance on the Flagrant Podcast, hosted by Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh, where he shared his admiration for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a segment dedicated to Modi, Trump remarked, “Modi… India, he’s a friend of mine, he’s great. Before he took charge, they had leaders changing every year—very unstable.” Comparing Modi\\'s appearance to that of “your father,” Trump noted, “He’s the nicest guy, but he’s a total killer when it comes to leadership.”Trump reminisced about the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston, describing it as “a beautiful gathering that filled up the stadium.” He recounted moments when Modi’s resolve impressed him: “We had occasions when someone was threatening India, and Modi would completely change. I offered help, saying I’m very good with these situations, but Modi was firm. He told me, ‘I will handle it; I will do anything necessary. We’ve faced this for centuries.’” Trump continued, hinting at a specific neighbouring country, saying, “You can probably guess the country, but Modi’s determination was striking. He’s incredibly sharp and a genuinely good person.”The rapport between Trump and Modi has been visible on numerous occasions, notably during the \"Howdy Modi\" rally in Houston in September 2019. With over 50,000 Indian-Americans in attendance, it was a milestone in US-India relations. Both leaders took to the stage, exchanging praise and highlighting the deepening partnership between their nations. Modi called Trump a “true friend,” while Trump lauded Modi’s leadership and the contributions of the Indian diaspora to the United States.In a reciprocal gesture, Trump visited India in February 2020 for the \"Namaste Trump\" event in Ahmedabad. Set in the world’s largest cricket stadium and attended by over 100,000 people, it marked Trump’s largest rally outside the US. Trump used the occasion to commend Modi’s leadership and India’s economic progress, reinforcing the shared democratic principles that underpin their bond. Most recently, Trump referred to “fantastic Modi” in the context of the Quad Summit, though the anticipated meeting didn’t take place.', 'summary': 'He added: “We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi. Kamala Harris will destroy your small businesses with more regulations and higher taxes. By contrast, I cut taxes, cut regulations, unleashed American energy, and built the greatest economy in history. We will do it again, bigger and better than ever before—and we will Make America Great Again. Also, Happy Diwali to All. I hope the Festival of Lights leads to the Victory of Good over Evil!”', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-praised-on-social-media-for-speaking-up-for-hindus-in-bangladesh/articleshow/114848859.cms', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-114848890/114848890.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-01 11:22:38', 'author': 'Toi World Desk', 'authors': ['Toi World Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': 0.147}]}, {'news': [{'id': 261899148, 'title': 'India’s first analog space mission launched in Leh', 'text': 'New Delhi: The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Friday announced the launch of its first analog space mission, to study the challenges of extraterrestrial conditions that will help in future space missions.\\n\\nThe mission, which includes a compact, inflatable habitat named Hab-1 will simulate life in an interplanetary habitat.

Ladakh’s extreme isolation, severe climate, and unique geographical features make it an ideal setting to mimic the challenges astronauts would face on these celestial bodies. This mission will contribute valuable data to support India’s Gaganyaan program and future space exploration.Ladakh’s dry climate, high altitude, and barren terrain closely resemble Mars and lunar conditions, making it ideal for analog research. Dr Aloke Kumar, one of India’s prominent scientists, initially proposed the idea of using Ladakh for space research.According to NASA, analog missions are field tests in Earth environments that mimic extreme space conditions. Analog missions allow scientists and engineers to understand how humans, robots, and technology might respond in space-like conditions. “NASA engineers and scientists work with government agencies, academia, and industry to gather requirements for testing in harsh environments before they are used in space,” NASA explains. The tests include “new technologies, robotic equipment, vehicles, habitats, communications, power generation, mobility, infrastructure, and storage.”These missions also observe behavioral effects such as isolation, team dynamics, and confinement, aiding NASA’s preparation for deep-space missions like those to asteroids or Mars.

Looks a reasonably good surface, hopefully put some runs on the board again and put a little bit of pressure later on. Definitely focusing on this game. We spoke about it before the second Test in Pune. What we did in Bangalore was great, but we had to switch our focus quickly to that second Test and nothing changed. A new opportunity in this game.”Latham went on to remark that the change in fortunes for the side from a series loss to Sri Lanka away from home to a historic series win in India makes Test cricket a “funny game”. He also said that Mitchell Santner will miss out on the match due to a side strain while Matt Henry will come in for Tim Southee. “In Sri Lanka, I don’t think we played all that badly. Unfortunately, you can just fall on the wrong side of the result. I do not think we have changed a lot in the last two weeks. We have tried to keep things simple and play our brand of cricket. We are hoping for more of the same this game. It’s about adapting to the surface as quickly as possible. Mitch Santner has got a little bit of a side strain. Ish Sodhi comes in. Matt Henry is fit and he comes in for Tim Southee.”For India, Mohammed Siraj comes in for an unwell Jasprit Bumrah. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma said at the toss, “We understand and accept that we have not played well through the series. This gives us another opportunity to try and correct those things. Looks like a good pitch. Hopefully we can restrict them as quickly as possible and then focus with the bat. Our focus is on this Test match. We want to try and play well in this Test match. In the back of your mind, you need to look at what lies ahead, but it is important to stay in the present, focus on what we need to do today and worry about all those things later.

He led the creation of the Jamkash Vehicleades Group, a multi-crore enterprise, and a cable TV channel from scratch, establishing himself as a top entrepreneur in Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nRana began his political career with the National Conference (NC), where he rose to prominence as a key strategist and advisor, expanding the party\\'s base in Jammu as Provincial President.\\n\\nAs a trusted aide to Omar Abdullah, he played a significant role in shaping party strategies in Jammu.

Daryl Mitchell was keeping him company on 11 runs.\\n\\nThe trick for early success at the Wankhede Stadium is to use the juice on offer in the first hour and cause some damage. After New Zealand opted to bat first, India tried that, and in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, who sat out as he has not “fully recovered from his viral illness” claimed one wicket.\\n\\nThe hosts had a couple of more opportunities as an edge from Devon Conway off Akash Deep flew in between the third and fourth slips. India, however, managed to claim three wickets in the first session of a match they have to win to avoid series whitewash.\\n\\nAkash Deep, who moved the ball both ways and extracted puffs of dust on a couple of occasions, made the breakthrough in the fourth over when Conway was trapped in front by a delivery that pitched on the good length and swung in, evading the edge. It also stayed a bit low, which did not help much when Conway opted to review the decision and the decision went against him. New Zealand were 15/1 in the fourth over.\\n\\nSkipper Latham and Young took the BlackCaps past 50 runs off 84 balls in the 14th over, though they had some moments that kept the Indians quite interested. A top edge off Young, who struck Akash Deep for a couple of boundaries in the 10th over, and a leading edge from Latham’s bat fell in the safe zone.\\n\\nYoung showed his attacking instinct by using his feet and carting Ashwin over wide long-on off and swept Sundar to the left of the keeper for a boundary.\\n\\nSundar, who was brought in as the second change to replace Akash Deep, struck two quick blows to grab the initiative for India. He first castled Latham with a superb delivery that landed on the off-stump and straightened, evaded the bat, and rearranged the furniture. Latham perished for 28 off 44 balls, hitting three boundaries.\\n\\nThe big breakthrough for India was sending back Rachin Ravindra cheaply as Sundar repeated the delivery that got Latham, sending this one from wider of the crease to spin past the defensive prod to clip the off stump.

The unveiling of NTR’s statue today made us forget the struggles of the past five years,” he said.Gannavaram MLA Yarlagadda Venkata Rao on the NTR Centenary Celebrations, said “NTR, a great personality who established a regional party at the age of 60, brought it to power within nine months. The revolutionary reforms he introduced serve as a model for today’s leaders. No government has dared to provide rice at two rupees a kilogram, but our leader NTR did during his period. NRIs play a crucial role in the economies of India and Andhra Pradesh.”Gannavaram MLA further said “NTR was a great personality who brought the Equal Rights Act for women in property. Unfortunately, former Chief Minister Jagan does not respect that law and has wronged his mother and sister.”He urged for investments in Amaravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh. He called for support for Chandrababu and Lokesh, who are working towards the goal of providing 2 million jobs in five years.Nagari MLA Gali Prakash emphasized that the enthusiasm displayed by NRIs in the area creates an atmosphere reminiscent of Andhra Pradesh. “Lokesh played a key role behind the grand victory with 164 seats. He undertook foot marches to save the state’s future and the TDP. As the Minister for Panchayati Raj, he has constructed 25,000 kilometres of rural roads and provided LED lights in ways no other minister has. The party’s future will be bright under Lokesh’s leadership. There is so much to say about NTR, yet it feels insufficient. After the establishment of the TDP, Telugu people gained recognition on a global scale. He called upon all NRIs to be partners in the state’s development in the coming days” he said.Udayagiri MLA Kakarla Suresh also mentioned that Nara Lokesh is the only leader among Indian politicians who studied at a prestigious institution like Stanford and entered politics. He acknowledged Lokesh’s role in his election as an MLA. USA NRI TDP President Komati Jayaram stated that they celebrated NTR’s centenary events grandly.,”As long as the Telugu community exists, NTR’s name will remain immortal. We NRIs will always support the government. He urged recognition for the NRIs who selflessly worked for the party, believing that they would lead the state on the path of progress.” He affirmed that they will continue to support the party’s success in the future', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/ntrs-statue-unveiled-in-atlanta-at-ntr-centenary-celebrations-tdp-mlas-celebrate/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ntrs-statue-unveiled-in-atlanta-at-ntr-centenary-celebrations-tdp-mlas-celebrate.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-01 09:04:24', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.565}, {'id': 261916002, 'title': 'Andhra Pradesh Minister Nara Lokesh unveils NTR statue in Atlanta;\\xa0wraps up U.S. visit', 'text': 'Andhra Pradesh (A.P.)

By addressing the situation, Trump is seen by his supporters as championing minority rights worldwide, a cause they believe many political figures overlook. Commenters also admired his courage in tackling a sensitive issue tied to religious and ethnic persecution, noting that such statements carry diplomatic weight and are seldom made by leaders who prefer to avoid complex international conflicts. Some users connected Trump’s advocacy to his strong ties with India and the Indian diaspora, interpreting his comments as a sign of continued support for Hindu communities and a reinforcement of the US-India relationship. There is a shared hope that Trump’s statements will catalyse greater awareness and global intervention, helping to shed light on the challenges faced by Hindus in Bangladesh and supporting a push for international action on their behalf.What is the California caste bill and why was it vetoed? When Donald Trump spoke about the \\'radical left agenda\\' he was referring to the the \\'California caste bill\\' that had been dubbed a move to discriminate against Hindus. The California caste bill, or Senate Bill 403 (SB403), was introduced by State Senator Aisha Wahab to outlaw discrimination based on caste by adding it to California’s civil rights protections. While the bill aimed to explicitly address caste discrimination — a social stratification often associated with South Asian communities — it faced significant controversy and opposition, leading to its eventual veto by Governor Gavin Newsom.Governor Newsom’s veto was based on his view that the bill was “unnecessary” because existing civil rights laws already prevent discrimination based on race, ancestry, religion, national origin, and other protected categories. Newsom asserted that these existing protections were sufficient to address any caste-based discrimination without singling out specific communities.The proposal of SB403 brought a heated debate within the Hindu American community. Some groups, like the Hindu American Foundation, opposed the bill, arguing that it would increase discrimination against Hindus and unfairly target the community by associating them with caste-based discrimination. They argued that caste is not inherently a part of Hinduism, and many in the South Asian diaspora have left caste-based practices behind when they moved to the United States. These opponents viewed the bill as creating unnecessary suspicion toward South Asian, especially Hindu, Americans, who they felt were being stereotyped by the association with caste. This opposition mobilized a wide range of Hindu American groups and activists who saw the bill as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Hinduism and the South Asian community.Conversely, other Hindu groups and activists, including Hindus for Caste Equity, supported the bill. They argued that caste discrimination persists within some South Asian communities and that explicit legal protection would help address issues of bias and exclusion that can still arise. Advocates of the bill, including Equality Labs, argued that caste-based discrimination needed to be recognized and addressed explicitly to protect those who continue to face caste oppression. Some activists even held a hunger strike to encourage Newsom to sign the bill, underscoring their view of the importance of caste protections.Despite the veto, the debate around SB403 has underscored the growing political engagement of Hindu Americans in the United States. As the Hindu American population has increased, so has its participation in the political sphere, with organizations focusing on civic engagement, advocacy, and community representation. The opposition to SB403 became a unifying moment for some in the Hindu American community, who rallied against what they saw as a potential mischaracterization of their religion and community. For others, the bill represented an opportunity to confront caste discrimination more directly.Ultimately, Newsom’s veto has postponed, rather than resolved, the issue. Both sides of the debate have expressed a commitment to continuing their advocacy, reflecting broader questions about how immigrant communities navigate and address complex social issues in new cultural contexts. The conversation surrounding caste discrimination is likely to persist, with some seeing the veto as a victory for Hindu representation and others as a setback in the fight against caste oppression.Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh Following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, Bangladesh has witnessed a significant surge in violence targeting minority communities, particularly Hindus. Incidents of vandalism, looting, and arson have spread fear and instability across affected regions, leaving many minority families devastated.Reports reveal that in the weeks following Hasina’s departure, over two thousand incidents of violence have been recorded against Hindus in nearly half of the country’s districts. Dozens of temples have been attacked, homes have been looted or set alight, and several individuals have lost their lives amidst this wave of aggression. The damage inflicted on businesses and community structures has left families in financial ruin, compounding the challenges of securing basic safety and recovery.The interim government, now led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has publicly condemned these attacks and expressed a commitment to protect vulnerable communities. However, many members of the minority population feel that efforts to address their safety concerns have been insufficient, with ongoing reports of targeted violence and intimidation. Calls for stronger action and effective measures to safeguard minority rights are mounting, with community leaders pushing for faster, more robust protections.International observers have reacted to the crisis with mounting concern. Figures from around the world have expressed disapproval of the attacks, calling on Bangladesh’s government to ensure justice for the victims and protect the integrity of minority communities. Calls have also been made for a comprehensive investigation into these human rights violations, pressing for accountability for those responsible for the violence.As the unrest continues into November, minority communities remain on edge. Local leaders have emphasised the importance of governmental action to restore a sense of safety and order. The interim administration faces mounting pressure to provide assurances of security and uphold minority rights amidst this tense period of political transition.Trump on ModiAmidst the US Presidential campaign\\'s fervour, Donald Trump made an appearance on the Flagrant Podcast, hosted by Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh, where he shared his admiration for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a segment dedicated to Modi, Trump remarked, “Modi… India, he’s a friend of mine, he’s great. Before he took charge, they had leaders changing every year—very unstable.” Comparing Modi\\'s appearance to that of “your father,” Trump noted, “He’s the nicest guy, but he’s a total killer when it comes to leadership.”Trump reminisced about the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston, describing it as “a beautiful gathering that filled up the stadium.” He recounted moments when Modi’s resolve impressed him: “We had occasions when someone was threatening India, and Modi would completely change. I offered help, saying I’m very good with these situations, but Modi was firm. He told me, ‘I will handle it; I will do anything necessary. We’ve faced this for centuries.’” Trump continued, hinting at a specific neighbouring country, saying, “You can probably guess the country, but Modi’s determination was striking. He’s incredibly sharp and a genuinely good person.”The rapport between Trump and Modi has been visible on numerous occasions, notably during the \"Howdy Modi\" rally in Houston in September 2019. With over 50,000 Indian-Americans in attendance, it was a milestone in US-India relations. Both leaders took to the stage, exchanging praise and highlighting the deepening partnership between their nations. Modi called Trump a “true friend,” while Trump lauded Modi’s leadership and the contributions of the Indian diaspora to the United States.In a reciprocal gesture, Trump visited India in February 2020 for the \"Namaste Trump\" event in Ahmedabad. Set in the world’s largest cricket stadium and attended by over 100,000 people, it marked Trump’s largest rally outside the US. Trump used the occasion to commend Modi’s leadership and India’s economic progress, reinforcing the shared democratic principles that underpin their bond. Most recently, Trump referred to “fantastic Modi” in the context of the Quad Summit, though the anticipated meeting didn’t take place.', 'summary': 'He added: “We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left.

Ladakh’s extreme isolation, severe climate, and unique geographical features make it an ideal setting to mimic the challenges astronauts would face on these celestial bodies. This mission will contribute valuable data to support India’s Gaganyaan program and future space exploration.Ladakh’s dry climate, high altitude, and barren terrain closely resemble Mars and lunar conditions, making it ideal for analog research. Dr Aloke Kumar, one of India’s prominent scientists, initially proposed the idea of using Ladakh for space research.According to NASA, analog missions are field tests in Earth environments that mimic extreme space conditions. Analog missions allow scientists and engineers to understand how humans, robots, and technology might respond in space-like conditions. “NASA engineers and scientists work with government agencies, academia, and industry to gather requirements for testing in harsh environments before they are used in space,” NASA explains. The tests include “new technologies, robotic equipment, vehicles, habitats, communications, power generation, mobility, infrastructure, and storage.”These missions also observe behavioral effects such as isolation, team dynamics, and confinement, aiding NASA’s preparation for deep-space missions like those to asteroids or Mars.

India will be looking to save their pride as they take on the Kiwis at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium. With the hosts being 0-2 down in the three-match series and having endured their first series loss in Tests at home in 12 years, they will be aiming to play out of their skins in order to avoid an embarrassing whitewash.Speaking at the toss, Latham said, ” We are gonna have a bat. Looks a reasonably good surface, hopefully put some runs on the board again and put a little bit of pressure later on. Definitely focusing on this game. We spoke about it before the second Test in Pune. What we did in Bangalore was great, but we had to switch our focus quickly to that second Test and nothing changed. A new opportunity in this game.”Latham went on to remark that the change in fortunes for the side from a series loss to Sri Lanka away from home to a historic series win in India makes Test cricket a “funny game”. He also said that Mitchell Santner will miss out on the match due to a side strain while Matt Henry will come in for Tim Southee. “In Sri Lanka, I don’t think we played all that badly. Unfortunately, you can just fall on the wrong side of the result. I do not think we have changed a lot in the last two weeks. We have tried to keep things simple and play our brand of cricket. We are hoping for more of the same this game. It’s about adapting to the surface as quickly as possible. Mitch Santner has got a little bit of a side strain. Ish Sodhi comes in. Matt Henry is fit and he comes in for Tim Southee.”For India, Mohammed Siraj comes in for an unwell Jasprit Bumrah. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma said at the toss, “We understand and accept that we have not played well through the series. This gives us another opportunity to try and correct those things. Looks like a good pitch. Hopefully we can restrict them as quickly as possible and then focus with the bat. Our focus is on this Test match. We want to try and play well in this Test match. In the back of your mind, you need to look at what lies ahead, but it is important to stay in the present, focus on what we need to do today and worry about all those things later. It’s important that we play our best cricket which we haven’t in this series. Unfortunately, Jasprit Bumrah is not well, Siraj comes in for him.”New Zealand (Playing XI): Tom Latham(c), Devon Conway, Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell(w), Glenn Phillips, Ish Sodhi, Matt Henry, Ajaz Patel, William ORourkeIndia (Playing XI): Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Sarfaraz Khan, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj.

He led the creation of the Jamkash Vehicleades Group, a multi-crore enterprise, and a cable TV channel from scratch, establishing himself as a top entrepreneur in Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nRana began his political career with the National Conference (NC), where he rose to prominence as a key strategist and advisor, expanding the party’s base in Jammu as Provincial President.\\n\\nAs a trusted aide to Omar Abdullah, he played a significant role in shaping party strategies in Jammu. In his debut bid for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Rana contested from the Nagrota assembly segment — a BJP stronghold — and won it for the NC, defeating the BJP’s Jugal Kishore Sharma, a three-time MP.\\n\\nThis victory underscored his ability to connect with a diverse voter base. He had previously served as an MLC and as NC’s Provincial President since 2009.\\n\\nAfter the abrogation of Article 370, Rana became a vocal advocate for the Jammu Declaration, calling for statehood restoration specifically for the Jammu region. His stance clashed with the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a coalition seeking the restoration of Article 370 and statehood for the entire Jammu and Kashmir region.\\n\\nIn October 2021, after more than two decades with the NC, Rana resigned and joined the BJP. His deep roots in the Jammu region and close connections with local communities made him a prominent figure in J&K politics, particularly for the BJP.', 'summary': 'Jammu: Senior BJP leader and Nagrota MLA Devender Singh Rana, brother of Union minister Jitendra Singh, died Thursday at a private hospital in Haryana&#8217;s Faridabad.

Earlier on Thursday, Armies of both the countries exchanged sweets at various border points in the Ladakh sector on the occasion of Diwali. Indian and Chinese Army exchange of sweets took place at Hot Springs, Karakoram Pass, Daulat Beg Oldi, KongkLa and Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in Ladakh.Ladakh MP Haji Hanifa welcomed the disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“Those of us who live near the border know what war feels like. We desire peace along the border. We welcome the agreement between the two countries, but we want to see it implemented on the ground. Tensions along the border should be reduced through diplomatic means,” said MP Hanifa.Earlier, Chief of Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi stressed that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations. He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions.Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said that it was natural for India and China to have differences as neighbouring countries but the important thing is how to handle and solve these differences.India and China have recently agreed on patrol arrangements along the LAC at the India-China border. The border standoff between India and China began in eastern Ladakh along the LAC in 2020, triggered by Chinese military actions.

The verification process after disengagement was in progress and patrolling modalities were to be decided between ground commanders, the sources had said on Wednesday. “Talks will continue at the local commander level,” they had added.

In his debut bid for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Rana contested from the Nagrota assembly segment -- a BJP stronghold -- and won it for the NC, defeating the BJP\\'s Jugal Kishore Sharma, a three-time MP.\\n\\nThis victory underscored his ability to connect with a diverse voter base. He had previously served as an MLC and as NC\\'s Provincial President since 2009.\\n\\nAfter the abrogation of Article 370, Rana became a vocal advocate for the Jammu Declaration, calling for statehood restoration specifically for the Jammu region. His stance clashed with the People\\'s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a coalition seeking the restoration of Article 370 and statehood for the entire Jammu and Kashmir region.\\n\\nIn October 2021, after more than two decades with the NC, Rana resigned and joined the BJP. His deep roots in the Jammu region and close connections with local communities made him a prominent figure in J&K politics, particularly for the BJP. \\n\\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)', 'summary': \"Senior BJP leader and Nagrota MLA Devender Singh Rana, brother of Union minister Jitendra Singh, died on Thursday at a private hospital in Haryana's Faridabad.

Daryl Mitchell was keeping him company on 11 runs.\\n\\nThe trick for early success at the Wankhede Stadium is to use the juice on offer in the first hour and cause some damage. After New Zealand opted to bat first, India tried that, and in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, who sat out as he has not “fully recovered from his viral illness” claimed one wicket.\\n\\nThe hosts had a couple of more opportunities as an edge from Devon Conway off Akash Deep flew in between the third and fourth slips.

The revolutionary reforms he introduced serve as a model for today’s leaders. No government has dared to provide rice at two rupees a kilogram, but our leader NTR did during his period. NRIs play a crucial role in the economies of India and Andhra Pradesh.”Gannavaram MLA further said “NTR was a great personality who brought the Equal Rights Act for women in property. Unfortunately, former Chief Minister Jagan does not respect that law and has wronged his mother and sister.”He urged for investments in Amaravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh. He called for support for Chandrababu and Lokesh, who are working towards the goal of providing 2 million jobs in five years.Nagari MLA Gali Prakash emphasized that the enthusiasm displayed by NRIs in the area creates an atmosphere reminiscent of Andhra Pradesh. “Lokesh played a key role behind the grand victory with 164 seats. He undertook foot marches to save the state’s future and the TDP. As the Minister for Panchayati Raj, he has constructed 25,000 kilometres of rural roads and provided LED lights in ways no other minister has. The party’s future will be bright under Lokesh’s leadership. There is so much to say about NTR, yet it feels insufficient.

Military disengagement with China in the eastern Ladakh has taken place. Armies of China and India have reportedly pulled back in Depsung and Demchok. This is good. But there is still a veil of silence over the ‘Finger’ points in the Pangong Tso lake area. Previously India used to patrol till Finger 8. After the Chinese incursion this came down upto Finger 4. What will happen here? Would India have to cede the area between the two above mentioned Fingers? Till now no clear cut official standpoint is available.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo causes of worry remain. At the same time there are glimmers of hope also. Xu Feihong, Chinese envoy to New Delhi, has expressed that relations between China and India are now standing at a new starting point with new development opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it really so? In 1962 also Chou en Lai, the then Chinese Premiere, had said many such pious words before his army swooped down on North Eastern India and reached upto Bomdilla, situated deep in Arunachal Pradesh and right upto the borders of Assam.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Delhi must always keep it in mind that in Chinese geopolitical interests Arunachal Pradesh is much more important to them than the Ladakh sector where, in many stretches, “not even a blade of grass grows”. By a blitzkrieg in this sector they can overrun Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO), India’s last military post on the foot of the Karakoram pass and cut off the Siachin glacier.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how much China can gain by doing this? The DBO outpost can hardly threaten the China controlled Aksai Chin which is five miles to the East. On the other hand China is already in Pakistan through the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) coming through Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo strategically the importance of the western Himalayas is much less to China than what it is in regard to the eastern Himalayas. Why is it so? The principal reason is China’s burgeoning water shortage and at the same time increasing demands for electricity. To overcome it Beijing is building up hydro electric dams on the Brahmaputra in Tibet thereby blocking free flow of the river water to India.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the river valleys of Arunachal Pradesh have immense hydro-power potential currently estimated at 50,328 megawatt or approximately 22 percent of India’s power generating capacity. Control over this state would give China immense strategic security.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly we have not heard anything from China in recent times for settling of border problems in the eastern Himalayas particularly in the McMahon Line sector that involves Arunachal Pradesh. On the contrary it ‘renamed’ 30 places of this Indian state this year. On several occasions China has included Arunachal Pradesh in its map.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a certain motive China is increasing its military capacity in the depth areas across Arunachal Pradesh. It is now well known that four sectors of the state namely Asaphila, Tuting Axis, Chang Tze and Fishtail 2 are under some kinds of Chinese threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no scope of over satisfaction on the part of New Delhi over Bejing’s future moves vis-a-vis Arunachal Pradesh. It is because the Tawang monastery of the state is invaluable to China for control over Tibetan Buddhism which in turn means complete control over Tibet, an area now occupying the central position in China’s foreign policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would be New Delhi’s approach now? Confabulations over the proper alignment of the McMahon Line is welcome. But at the same time New Delhi should always be prepared for some surprises.\\r\\n\\r\\n( The author is a senior journalist and commentator)', 'summary': 'Xu Feihong, Chinese envoy to New Delhi, has expressed that relations between China and India are now standing at a new starting point with new development opportunities', 'url': 'https://telanganatoday.com/news-analysis-ladakh-disengagement-is-good-but-what-about-the-eastern-himalayas', 'image': 'https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ci.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-01 10:16:31', 'author': 'Telangana Today', 'authors': ['Telangana Today'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.239}, {'id': 261915432, 'title': 'Indian Army team heads to Jakarta for Garud Shakti 24 exercise', 'text': \"New Delhi: An Indian Army contingent comprising 25 personnel departed for Cijantung, Jakarta, Indonesia to take part in the 9th edition of India-Indonesia Joint Special Forces Exercise Garud Shakti 24.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exercise will be conducted from November 1 to 2, a statement said on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian contingent is being represented by troops from The Parachute Regiment (Special Forces) and an Indonesian contingent comprising 40 personnel is being represented by Indonesian Special Forces Kopassus, the statement said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of Garud Shakti 24 is to acquaint both sides with each other’s operating procedures and enhance mutual understanding, cooperation and interoperability between the Special Forces of both armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exercise is designed to develop bilateral military cooperation and strengthen the bond between two armies through the conduct of discussions and rehearsal of tactical military drills.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exercise will involve planning and execution of special operations, orientation to advance special forces skills, and sharing of information on weapons, equipment, innovations, tactics, techniques and procedures, the defence ministry said in a statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoint Exercise Garud Shakti 24 will also involve jointly practising Special Forces Operations in jungle terrain, strikes on terrorist camps and a Validation Exercise integrating basic and advanced special forces skills apart from gaining an insight into the lifestyle and culture of both countries to foster military cooperation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exercise will provide an opportunity for both contingents to strengthen their bond and share best practices.

One wonders, then, what can be new in Mohar Basu’s book on Shah Rukh Khan.\\n\\nFor starters, Mohar, a film journalist with Mid-Day, says it’s a compilation of intimate stories and fan accounts from all over the world peppered with snippets from articles and interviews he’s given over his three-and-a-half decades in films to understand how he has influenced their lives and why he continues to inspire them.\\n\\nThe first chapter is a fan slogan, ‘The Return of the King’ and narrates the dramatic comeback SRK made in 2023 with his two back-to-back Rs 1,000 cr box office hit films, Jawaan and Pathaan. It captures how despite facing immense backlash and many challenges, personal, political, and cultural, the movie Pathaan pressed through relentlessly to break records at the box office. Coming after a four-year sabbatical forced on him due to a string of flops for nearly a decade that wrote his unceremonious obituary, SRK’s return to form is celebrated as the one which has finally relegated the pandemic to a distant memory and brought the audience-starved cinema theatres in the country, back to life.\\n\\nA mythological hero\\n\\nMohar likens SRK’s career to be of a mythological hero – one whose life is full of obstacles but who always has the Gods shining on him to help him fulfill his dreams.\\n\\nThe book focuses largely on his films; a brief chapter, pieced together from various interviews SRK gave to Simi Garewal, Filmfare, Stardust and from his speeches at award nights and film premieres, details how the SRK-Gauri romance blossomed, how he chased her to Mumbai and eventually persuaded her family to agree to the inter-caste marriage. Another one collaged from his interviews with David Letterman, Anupama Chopra and Farida Jalal summarises his childhood. Nothing new, just that the whole story is compiled smartly into one piece.\\n\\nIf there’s a missing POV, it’s that of SRK himself. Mohar hasn’t interviewed him for this book, so much material is from secondary accounts sourced from media.\\n\\nSo, what is the reason for his fandom? SRK’s fans believe it’s his ordinariness. The fact that he wasn’t a good looking, chocolate hero like his peers, nor did he have any film industry lineage, that he was just that - a normal guy, an outsider, who came to Mumbai and with his hard work earned a place amongst the stars. He makes them believe it’s possible to dream of doing something big and to achieve it.\\n\\nMohar chronicles the early beginnings of SRK as an anti-hero as he took upon roles others refused to do. As distinct from the villain, an anti-hero has justifications for the dark shades in his character. He would be a passionate and obsessive lover, selfish and violent for his love, an avenger and a victim at the same time, thus endearing himself to the audiences. SRK frequently added his own improvisations to the characters he was playing, like adding the stammer or having the mentally unstable man chat with his dead mother in Darr.\\n\\nLandmark film\\n\\nThe biggest landmark of his film career, SRK admits, is Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenga (DDLJ), a film that contemporised the fight against patriarchy and set up the image and cult of SRK. In contrast to the stories of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak where the patriarchal fight ends in tragedy or Maine Pyaar Kiya where the boy challenges the family by showing his self-worth, in DDLJ the boy simply charms the girl’s stern, traditional and conservative father into letting him marry the girl. In the mid-nineties, this plot line enjoyed a wide appeal amongst the audience, so much so that it has become the longest running film in the history of the Indian film industry.\\n\\nThat SRK has kept a squeaky-clean reputation as a family man and has stayed away from any scandals has endeared him to female fans who see him as every mother’s son, every sister’s brother, and every college girl’s fantasy. They say that they love him, but don’t lust after him. They love his characters’ vulnerability, sensitivity and the ability to be silly in contrast to a macho man. He’s like a friend they can talk to and love that fact that he’s protective about his family in real life too. \\n\\nEvery time I have met SRK, the one thing he exudes besides his wit, is his warmth. For a superstar, that’s a rare quality.\\n\\nFor such a well-chronicled life and with the great access that the late Pradeep Bandekar had, the photographs chosen for this book could be better.\\n\\nMohar’s book is a thoroughly researched and well-organised collector’s edition of everything you’ve seen and heard about Shah Rukh Khan, perhaps, the last of the stars.\\n\\nCheck out the book on Amazon.\\n\\n(The reviewer runs 91 Film Studios that produces and distributes feature films in Indian regional languages)', 'summary': 'The book is a collector’s edition of perhaps the last of the stars', 'url': 'https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/books/the-saga-of-king-khan/article68819055.ece', 'image': 'https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/news/8qjsnv/article68819036.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/SRK%20Book%20cover.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-01 09:24:27', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.405}, {'id': 261916974, 'title': \"Madhya Pradesh's West Discom To Participate In NABL Conference In New Delhi\", 'text': 'During the event, West Discom will showcase its NABL-certified meter testing laboratory at Pologround in Indore, as well as its cable, conductor, and transformer testing lab located in Shankarpur, Ujjain.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/madhya-pradeshs-west-discom-to-participate-in-nabl-conference-in-new-delhi', 'image': 'https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-04/c06a04e6-58d1-4afd-82d4-5ebab70425a0/power_story.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-01 10:40:20', 'author': 'Staff Reporter', 'authors': ['Staff Reporter'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': 0.724}, {'id': 261914136, 'title': '5 popular eateries loved by celebrities and politicians in Visakhapatnam!', 'text': 'In today’s world, public figures are often viewed as other-worldly and elite. But as some say, “Celebrities are just normal people,” and the common language that all regular folks speak is just one: food! Many celebrities love food as we do, and some even adore our favourite dishes and restaurants. Vizagites, don’t fret, for we aren’t left out of this loop. A couple of eateries in Visakhapatnam are known to be appreciated by celebrities and politicians, and we’ve got a list of them:\\n\\n1. Venkatadri Vantillu\\n\\nThe legendary director, SS Rajamouli, visited this iconic restaurant back in 2019. He even took to social media to express his feelings after eating here, and said, “It is very rare to find healthy food that tastes really good. Indirakka at Venkatadri Vantillu in Vizag does it with korralu dosa..Delicious..😋.” Check out his post on X here.\\n\\nStarted by Indira Vankineni, Venkatadri Vantillu is one woman’s dream come true. To financially support her family, she ventured into the food businessin 2002 with just Rs 5,000/-. In a tiny, rented space, she began making punukulu, mirchi bhajji, masala vada and other snacks. Much positive feedback motivated her to introduce her signature dish – sponge dosa. Since its inception, Venkatadri Vantillu and Vizag have never been the same.\\n\\nKnown for its mesmerizing Ghee Karam Sponge Dosa which is served with a variety of rich chutneys and sambar, this place presently offers an extensive range of dosas, pesarettus, and idlis at prices that won’t burden your wallet. Venkatadri Vantillu also offers an array of fresh fruit juices, shakes, and desserts.\\n\\n2. Vasena Poli\\n\\nThere’s no better brag than impressing the (former) Vice President of India, and Vasena Poli – a humble tiffin stall in Vizag – did just that! On a visit to the coastal town in 2021, M Venkiah Naidu enjoyed a signature meal of “Vasena Poli” idli, i.e., idli made from millet flour and steamed in conically-folded leaf-plates or Vistarakulu!\\n\\nBeyond satisfied with his food, the politician went on social media to make a viral post about his experience. “Had a sumptuous breakfast of millet idlis today made by ‘Vasena Poli’ stall run by a young agri-entrepreneur Chittem Sudheer in Visakhapatnam. With a rich flavour and taste, such millet-based food offer a healthy and organic alternative to our diet… Such innovative efforts by our youth to go back to our traditional diet & lifestyle are commendable.”\\n\\nChittem Sudheer, the owner of the stall, hails from Guntur and takes a health-focused approach to his cooking. In an interview with Yo Vizag, he shared that he uses Vistaraku leaf because it is anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and contains antioxidants.\\n\\nOne of the most popular eateries in Visakhapatnam, you can find hearty dishes here including Millet Dosa, Millet Soup, Jowar Roti, and over 6 kinds of Millet Idlis!\\n\\n3. Hut Arabica\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, on his radio show, ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ expressed his love for Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC)’s Araku Valley coffee globally. The brand plays a big role in the ‘Make in India’ movement and its mission of helping local products attain global recognition. More importantly, the coffee, produced in the highlands of Alluri Seetharamaraju region, has an exceptionally rich taste and aroma that one can’t forget!\\n\\nThe Prime Minister was first seen enjoying this coffee with Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu at the G20 Summit in Delhi. Though he did not physically visit the cafe in Vizag, the same mesmerizing taste of Araku Valley Coffee can be found at Hut Arabica in Vizag, a Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd initiative! You can find a variety of hot and cold coffees, cappuccinos, americanos, and lattes, coming in vanilla, chocolate, and caramel flavours.\\n\\n4. S kota’s Hotel Muntaj\\n\\nIf you’ve heard of Hotel Muntaj, you’ve probably heard of the tagline that goes with it – “Prabhas’ favourite fry piece biryani!” Being a staple since 1974, this restaurant is a favourite among our favourite celebrities!

Today, their three sons run the place and have opened its branches in Visakhapatnam – which have risen to become some of the most popular eateries here.\\n\\nFamous celebrities including Sathyaraj, Nani, Saptagiri, Raghu Kunche, and more have dined at the original outlet in S Kota.\\n\\nSome of the specialities here (apart from the Chicken Fry Piece Biryani) include the Chicken Dum Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Biriyani, and Mutton Kheema Biriyani.\\n\\n5. Taj’s Korean Food Truck\\n\\nThis is a first-of-its-kind food truck in Vizag that serves exciting Korean dishes including ramen, Korean fried chicken, corndogs, Korean sandwiches and more. Visakhapatnam MP Bharat Mathwas recently seen trying their Chicken Tenders and complimenting them for tasting good. The MP also said that they had ordered in from the place previously, and liked the food then too! His visit to the food truck was a part of Bharat’s outing with popular food Youtuber Street Byte. You can watch the video here.\\n\\nDespite being a new addition to Vizag’s food scene, the food truck has quickly grown in popularity for bringing flavourful Korean cuisine to the city.\\n\\nWhile there are likely many more such restaurants, cafes, and food stalls that are frequented by the stars, these five eateries in Visakhapatnam have been publicly visited by the aforementioned figures.

Proposed in 2023, this venture is designed to connect Duvvada (in Vizag) and Shamshabad (in Hyderabad) through Vijayawada. Bringing exciting perks for commuters, local communities, and businesses, the rail line, if approved, will surely be a big leap forward for travel between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana! Here’s a look at five big reasons why this project matters:\\r\\n1. Get there faster than ever\\r\\nOne of the biggest wins? You can say goodbye to the long, tiring journey between Hyderabad and Vizag. Right now, travelling to and from the cities by train takes about 12 hours (or around 8.5 hours if you’re lucky enough to snag a spot on the Vande Bharat Express). But with this new line reaching speeds up to 220 km/h, the trip will be slashed to just 4.5 hours. Whether you’re heading out for a weekend getaway or an important meeting, the shorter travel time makes a huge difference.\\r\\n2. Connectivity across key towns and cities\\r\\nWith 12 well-placed stations, this rail corridor will make stops in vital cities and towns. Suryapet, a key spot along the way, will now be more accessible than ever, along with other important locations like Vijayawada. And for those living in areas like Umdanagar, it’s a first-ever chance to hop on a direct, high-speed train. This expanded access connects smaller communities with big cities, helping people get where they need to go while also initiating new growth in these areas.\\r\\n3. Effortless travel from Shamshabad Airport\\r\\nFor travellers landing at Shamshabad Airport and needing to reach Visakhapatnam, the new semi high-speed rail corridor will be a convenient, quick ride. This route will make travel seamless, allowing visitors to reach Vizag or return to Hyderabad with equal ease. This high-speed connection will result in an ideal journey for those with tight schedules.\\r\\n4. Big boost for local economies\\r\\nWith quicker travel times and improved connectivity, this rail line is set to boost economic activity. Businesses in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana can tap into a broader market, with faster ways to transport goods and easier commutes for employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis makes it an attractive spot for new businesses to invest in, especially around the stations where real estate, hospitality, and other businesses could thrive. It’s an all-around economic lift that will support growth in the region.\\r\\n5. A greener way to travel\\r\\nChoosing the train over road travel could mean a big reduction in the carbon footprint of intercity transportation. Rail travel is generally a cleaner option compared to road or air, and this semi-high-speed corridor offers an eco-friendly alternative for travellers. As more people switch to this efficient mode of travel, we could see reduced road congestion and air pollution, making it a great choice for the environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shamshabad-Vizag Semi High-Speed Rail Corridor is currently in the survey stage, and the Preliminary and Traffic Surveys have recently been completed. If operational, this project would be a new infrastructure milestone with a lasting impact. From helping passengers get to their desired cities quicker to fueling local economies, this rail line will make travel easier, greener, and more connected across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\\r\\n\\r\\nStay tuned to Yo!

Chandrachud is due to retire on November 10 on attaining the age of 65 years. During the period, he pronounced several notable judgements. \\n\\nHere are the 10 key judgments authored by him when he was in the highest judicial office of the country after taking over as the CJI on November 9, 2022.\\n\\n1. Revocation of Article 370\\n\\nA 5-judge Constitution Bench, headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, had upheld the revocation of Article 370. It had ordered the Election Commission of India to take steps to conduct elections to the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024.\\n\\nThe Constitution Bench, also comprising Justices S.K. Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, had left open the question of whether Parliament can extinguish the character of statehood by converting a state into one or more union territories, relying on the statement made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that statehood would be restored to Jammu and Kashmir, but, it had said that “restoration of statehood shall take place at the earliest and as soon as possible”.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court had upheld the status of Ladakh as a union territory under Article 3(a) read with Explanation I of the Constitution, which permits the formation of a union territory by separating a territory from any state.\\n\\nIn May this year, the apex court refused to review the Constitution Bench verdict and dismissed a batch of review pleas filed against the decision upholding the revocation of Article 370 as valid.\\n\\n2. Same-sex marriage\\n\\nA 5-judge bench headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud had declined to strike down or read into gender-neutral “person” in place of “male” and “female” existing under the Special Marriage Act. All five judges of the Constitution Bench had unanimously agreed that there exists no unqualified right to marriage and accepted the Centre’s proposal that a committee to be headed by the Cabinet Secretary be set up to examine what administrative steps could be taken to address basic social benefit concerns relating to same-sex couples.\\n\\nThe Constitution Bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Hima Kohli, B.V. Nagarathna and P.S. Narasimha, had left it to the legislature to take a call on enacting the marriage equality law. It had asked the Union and state governments to ensure that the LGBTQ+ community is not discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation and queer individuals are not refused access to any goods or services.\\n\\n3. Electoral bonds\\n\\nA five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, had struck down the electoral bonds scheme, saying that denying voters the right to know the details of funding of political parties would lead to a dichotomous situation and the funding of political parties cannot be treated differently from that of the candidates who contest elections.\\n\\nIn a unanimous verdict, the Bench, also comprising Justices B.R. Gavai, Sajiv Khanna, J.B. Padriwala and Manoj Misra, had directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to forthwith stop the issuance of electoral bonds and ordered the Election Commission of India (ECI) to publish on its official website the details of the political parties which have received contributions through electoral bonds since April 2019.\\n\\nSubsequently, a bench headed by CJI Chandrachud declined to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a Special Investigative Team (SIT) probe under the supervision of a retired apex court judge into an alleged scam in poll financing using electoral bonds.\\n\\nThe top court said that an SIT cannot be formed to probe “quid pro quo” unless there is an FIR already registered on the issue espoused in the PIL, adding that the ordinary course of law may remedy the allegations raised in the plea.\\n\\n4. Caste-based division of labour in prisons\\n\\nA bench headed by CJI DY Chandrachud held it unconstitutional the practice of employing “lower caste” jail inmates in cleaning and manual scavenging work in prisons. The Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, directed that the “caste” column and any references to caste in prisoners’ registers inside the prisons be deleted.\\n\\nIn its October 2024 verdict, the Supreme Court asked all states and union territories to revise their prison rules providing caste-based division of labour in jails within three months. It also asked the Union government to make changes in the Model Prison Manual 2016 and the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act 2023 within three months.\\n\\n5. Effective implementation of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006\\n\\nA bench headed by CJI Chandrachud issued a slew of directions for the effective implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.\\n\\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, ordered the state governments and union territories to appoint officers solely responsible for discharging the functions of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers (CMPOs) at the district level.\\n\\nIt said that child marriage deprives children of their agency, autonomy and right to fully develop and enjoy their childhood. “Both sexes are adversely affected by forced and early marriage. Marrying in childhood has the effect of objectifying the child. The practice of child marriage imposes mature burdens on children who are not physically or mentally prepared to comprehend the significance of marriage,” ordered SC.\\n\\n6. Section 6A of Citizenship Act\\n\\nA Constitution Bench, headed by CJI Chandrachud, upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which was inserted to give effect to the Assam Accord and formed the basis of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam in 2019.\\n\\nThe 5-judge Bench was dealing with a clutch of petitions challenging Section 6A of the Citizenship Act 1955, on the ground that it violates Articles 6,7,14, 29 and 355 of the Constitution.\\n\\nIn his opinion, CJI Chandrachud held that Section 6A of the Citizenship Act does not have the effect of amending Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution, which prescribe a cut-off date for conferring citizenship for migrants from East and West Pakistan at the “commencement of the Constitution” (i.e., on January 26, 1950).\\n\\n7. NEET-UG 2024\\n\\nRefusing to order a fresh exam, a bench headed by CJI Chandrachud observed there was no systematic leak of the question paper of the NEET-UG 2024 examination.\\n\\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said there was no sufficient material available on the record to order a re-test but clarified that its judgment won’t prevent authorities from taking action against candidates who had secured admission using malpractices.\\n\\n8. Adani-Hindenburg controversy\\n\\nA bench presided over by CJI Chandrachud refused to form any SIT or group of experts to conduct the investigation in the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and said the facts of the case did not warrant a transfer of investigation from SEBI.\\n\\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said that reports prepared by third-party organisations such as the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Hindenburg Research cannot be regarded as “conclusive proof”.\\n\\n9. Manipur violence\\n\\nA bench headed by CJI Chandrachud took suo moto cognizance of the disturbing viral videos where two tribal women were paraded naked and sexually assaulted in Manipur.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court had set up a committee comprising three woman judges tasked with collecting information related to violence against women in Manipur as well as monitoring the conditions at relief camps and deciding on compensation to victims.\\n\\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, had also appointed former Maharashtra DGP Dattatray Padsalgikar to investigate the allegations that certain police officers colluded with perpetrators of violence, including sexual violence, during the conflict in Manipur.\\n\\n10. Cases against MPs/MLAs\\n\\nA bench headed by CJI Chandrachud directed Chief Justices of all High Courts across the country to register suo moto cases to monitor the expeditious disposal of criminal cases pending against MPs and MLAs.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court said that the special bench to be formed in every High Court will issue continuing directions to curb the criminalisation of politics and may seek assistance from the Advocate General and other officers of the state government.\\n\\nFurther, it said that the High Court may also call for status reports on the issue from all District and Session Courts under their jurisdiction.\\n\\nJustice Chandrachud was first appointed as judge of the Bombay High Court on March 29, 2000, and served as Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court since October 31, 2013, until his elevation as an apex court judge on May 13, 2016.\\n\\nCJI Chandrachud passed BA with honours in economics from St Stephen’s College, New Delhi and completed LLB from Campus Law Centre, Delhi University. He also served as Additional Solicitor General of India from 1998 till 2000. In June 1998, he was designated as a senior advocate by the Bombay High Court.\\n\\nAfter CJI Chandrachud recommended the name of Justice Sanjiv Khanna as his successor last month, the Centre has cleared the appointment of Justice Khanna as the 51st CJI with effect from November 11.', 'summary': 'New Delhi, Nov 1 (IANS) After a two-year-long stint as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y.

A search was also underway for four people who went hunting in the mountains of central Taiwan on Wednesday and have not been heard from since that evening.Two Czech hikers who were trapped in the Taroko Gorge in Hualien county during the typhoon were rescued on Friday.Kong-rey weakened to a severe tropical storm as it moved across the Taiwan Strait towards China on Friday, the Central Weather Administration said.In Taiwan, life was returning to normal, with offices, restaurants and schools reopening.

The 2015 Aruvikkara bypoll saw Congress candidate K.S. Sabarinadhan emerge victorious following the vacancy created by the death of his father and former Speaker G. Karthikeyan.

The Pala seat became vacant after the death of Kerala Congress (M) leader K.M. Mani. This seat was won by Mani. C. Kappan, who was then with the National Congress Party, however, after trouncing Jose Tom Pulikkunnel, the KC(M)‘s nominee. \\n\\nThe Indian Union Muslim League’s M.C.

Likewise, Shanimol Usman secured the Aroor Assembly seat, compensating for her earlier defeat in the Alappuzha Lok Sabha elections. While Mr. Kumar and Mr. Prasanth successfully defended their seats in the 2021 Assembly polls, Ms. Usman was unable to retain her seat.\\n\\nThe Congress party is now experimenting a similar strategy by nominating Ramya Haridas, who previously lost her Alathur Lok Sabha seat, as its candidate for the Chelakkara Assembly bypoll.

From the temple town of Baijnath, where Dussehra is not celebrated in honour of Lord Shiva’s eternal meditation, to the haunting tale of Sammoo village in Hamirpur, where Diwali is never observed, the state’s cultural landscape is both captivating and mysterious.\\n\\nWhile the rest of India lights up with the brilliance of Diwali, the villagers of Sammoo, located 25 km from Hamirpur, observe a haunting silence. There are no sparkling diyas, no sounds of bursting crackers, and no feasts to mark the occasion. The reason? A centuries-old curse is believed to bring misfortune and death if the festival is celebrated.\\n\\nAccording to local legend, generations ago, a pregnant woman set out to her parents’ home to celebrate Diwali, only to receive the devastating news that her husband, a soldier in the king’s court, had died. Overcome by grief, she committed Sati—burning herself on her husband’s funeral pyre—and cursed the village, declaring that they would never be able to celebrate Diwali again. Since then, the villagers have abstained from any celebration on this day, fearing the dire consequences of defying the curse.\\n\\nLiving Under the Shadow of the Past\\n\\nThe tale has been passed down for generations, and to this day, the people of Sammoo strictly observe the custom, believing that defying the curse would invite disaster. Village elder, who has lived through over 50 Diwalis without celebration, recalls the many attempts made to break free from the tradition. “Whenever someone tries to observe Diwali, something tragic happens. If a family even accidentally bursts crackers or prepares festive dishes, misfortune is inevitable,” she explains.\\n\\nOver the years, the villagers have sought to rid themselves of the curse through religious rituals, such as havans and yagyas, but nothing has lifted the shadow that hangs over their village. Gulshan, another resident, speaks of a family that moved far from the village and tried to celebrate Diwali, only to see their house consumed by fire. “The curse follows us wherever we go,” he says, adding that instead of festive celebrations, the villagers light diyas only to worship the woman who committed Sati, ensuring they honour her spirit.\\n\\nThe Weight of Tradition\\n\\nDespite the unrelenting belief in the curse, the younger generation in Sammoo has started questioning whether they should continue adhering to the tradition. Many express a desire to break free, yet the fear of the curse remains strong, reinforced by stories of past tragedies. “Even today, the elders warn us that observing Diwali will lead to misfortune,” says a younger villager.\\n\\nWhat makes Sammoo’s story even more intriguing is the contrast it shares with other parts of Himachal, where unique customs define their own relationship with festivals. In Baijnath, Dussehra is never celebrated, as the locals believe it would disturb Lord Shiva’s eternal meditation at the ancient temple there. These customs, though vastly different, both stem from a deep reverence for tradition and the fear of upsetting the spiritual order.\\n\\nFrom Baijnath’s reverence for Lord Shiva to Sammoo’s fear of a Sati’s curse, Himachal Pradesh is a land where myth and reality intertwine. These customs, while unusual, offer a glimpse into the state’s cultural diversity and the power of collective memory in preserving ancient traditions. As the state progresses, the challenge for many villagers lies in balancing respect for their past with the desire to embrace modernity.

In response, the Congress submitted a “counter response” to the ECI on Friday, describing its initial reply as “generic” and focused on dismissing the complaints and their petitioners.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh shared the letter on X, stating, “The ECI gave a non-reply to INC India’s specific complaints in 20 Vidhan Sabha constituencies in Haryana.”The party further remarked, “Not surprisingly, the ECI has given a clean chit to itself. Ordinarily, we would have left it there. However, the tone and tenor of the ECI’s response, the language used, and the accusations levelled against the INC compel us to submit this counter-response.”The Congress also criticised the “pattern” outlined by the ECI in Paragraph 8 of its reply, calling it “disingenuous.”“The majority of issues raised concern the period between the announcement of the Model Code of Conduct and the end of the election, i.e., the date of counting. Grievances arise quickly, often within minutes, and sometimes only become apparent once results are declared or information from other booths can be compared. If not addressed on the ground, these issues become moot, leaving only the option of an Election Petition, which is a lengthy process that can take years to resolve,” it stated.The party added, “We approach the ECI with whatever information we possess, and the ECI, with its vast resources, examines and reviews this information to assess its accuracy. Often, the ECI finds our information correct; at other times, it does not. Yet we refrain from ‘naming and shaming’ the ECI after the election concludes.”The Congress also claimed that, despite filing over a hundred complaints against the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, the ECI has taken action on none, while holding Congress’s president and former president to account for their actions or speeches.“As mentioned, it is unsurprising that the ECI has reviewed our complaints and exonerated itself. The response on the fluctuating battery levels of the voting machines is more obfuscating than clarifying. In essence, the ECI’s reply is a standard, generic explanation of machine functionality, rather than a specific response to the particular complaints we raised. While our complaints were specific, the ECI’s response is generic and focused on dismissing the complaints and the petitioners,” the Congress said.On October 29, the ECI had categorically rejected the Congress’s allegations, describing them as “baseless, misplaced, and devoid of facts.”Reacting to the developments, Congress leader Pawan Khera commented, “If the Prime Minister considers himself God, his CEC will, naturally, see himself as God’s gift to mankind.” (ANI)', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/reply-is-generic-focused-on-diminishing-complaints-and-petitioners-congress-writes-counter-response-to-eci/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/reply-is-generic-focused-on-diminishing-complaints-and-petitioners-congress-writes-counter-response-to-eci.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-01 11:08:32', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.303}, {'id': 260223256, 'title': 'Baba Siddique murder: 5 more nabbed from Raigad, sent to police custody for a week', 'text': 'The information contained in this website is for general information purposes only.

KKR announced on Thursday that they have retained Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, and Varun Chakravarthy ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction.In IPL 2024, KKR secured their third title under Shreyas Iyer’s captaincy with an 8-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad. However, Iyer, who led the Knights in the 17th season, has not been retained. Several big stars including Shreyas Iyer, Mitchell Starc, Phil Salt, Venkatesh Iyer, Nitish Rana have been released. Speaking on the KKR’s website, Mysore said, “Obviously the number of retentions do feel less, because we first build a squad and try to put all pieces in place in order to compete. And when you compete, and particularly in our case, thankfully, we won our third championship, and after that, it becomes even more difficult, because you really want to keep the squad that you have carefully built, who are also the defending champions. So in an ideal world, we would have wanted the whole team back. But the reality is that you cannot, and therefore making those decisions within the parameters provided makes it definitely challenging.”“The no brainers would have been maybe 10 or 11 players, but trying to trim that down to six was very challenging, because it is about the players that you have built an equation with and who have done fantastic for KKR. Sunil has been with us for 12 years while Andre has been with us for 10 years. Varun has been associated with KKR for a long time, since 2019 and Rinku as well has been with us for a significant amount of time, since 2018.”“Harshit has been with the team for three years while Ramandeep came in last year and really made a big impact. So I think it is a good combination. And at the same time, some of the thinking around how you want to handle the auction also came into play, but we thought that this was a really good combination for us. And, obviously leaving out some of the players is never easy,” he concluded.

Over the past year, he has transitioned into coaching, working with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and the Afghanistan team.His role with KKR marks his second coaching position in the IPL.

The information was later confirmed by the Japanese Coast Guard.According to South Korean and Japanese sources, the launch of an unknown type of missile was made from the Pyongyang area. The flight trajectory was specific. Having started at an acute angle, the missile reached a high altitude, performed a maneuver, and immediately went down. Although the product covered a little more than 300 kilometers in a straight line, its flight time was several tens of minutes. This means that with a relatively flat trajectory, the missile could have reached a target at a distance of 10 thousand kilometers or even further.

But it is highly likely that Western figures are incorrect.Most likely, we are talking about 50-70 nuclear warheads. At the same time, Pyongyang has, at a minimum, several charges with a capacity of over a hundred kilotons. And such ammunition is already approaching the capabilities of strategic nuclear weapons. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});The North Korean arsenal is gradually growing. According to conservative Western estimates, by 2030 Pyongyang will have 80 to 90 nuclear warheads. Most likely, there will be more charges. Moreover, the emphasis will be on creating special warheads of increased power.Over the past few years, the North Korean military-industrial complex has managed to develop a whole line of ballistic missiles. Thus, the Hwasong-15, -17, and -18 products are capable of hitting targets at a distance of 13 to 15 thousand kilometers. These missiles caused the most negative reaction from the United States and Japan. In addition to intercontinental missiles, the DPRK's arsenal includes a large number of products with a flight range of 300 to 2500 kilometers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});North korean Nuclear missile test [PHOTO: OUTRIDER]This year, Pyongyang was able to radically improve its intercontinental ballistic missiles. Thus, in the spring, two tactical missiles with a new control system werelaunched. Analysis of the missiles' flight parameters suggests that at least one of them was an ICBM. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});North Korean developers have tried to implement a new control system on one of the Hwasong family missiles, which can ensure the execution of maneuvers during the active section of the trajectory.Already in September, the Hwasong-11 missile with a new high-power warhead was tested. And here it should be noted that this was not a combat test. A mass-dimensional model of the missile's warhead was tested. The new product is designed for the use of high-power nuclear warheads. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Unlike its older “sisters”, the “eleventh” is a tactical missile. Its flight range does not exceed 800 kilometers. Meanwhile, in terms of dimensions and technical solutions, it is virtually identical to the longer-range Hwasong-15, -17, -18. Therefore, with a high degree of probability, the new warhead is not intended for the tactical “eleventh”, but for heavier intercontinental ballistic missiles of this family.The current launch allowed Pyongyang to once again test the complex control system for its ICBMs. That is why the missile launched on October 31 had such a complex flight profile. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});These facts indicate that North Korea will receive an updated arsenal of ICBMs in the very near future.First, the missiles will be able to perform maneuvers during the active part of the trajectory — when the engines are still running. This is necessary to evade the American missile defense systems that Washington is deploying on the Korean Peninsula. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});According to Aljazeera, THAAD batteries usually are made up of 95 soldiers, six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors – eight for each launcher – one radar system, and a fire control and communications component.In its southern part, several batteries of American THAAD anti-missile systems were deployed back in 2017. In 2022 and 2023, they underwent major modernization. In particular, radars, control, and information exchange systems were updated in each system. But most importantly, their arsenal included new PAC-3 MSE anti-missiles. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Formally, THAAD is designed to protect against short- and medium-range missile attacks.But in reality, the main goal of the American missile defense is to intercept ICBMs launched by Pyongyang. With the PAC-3 MSE, THAAD crews will be able to confidently hit North Korean missiles precisely in the active part of the trajectory.But now the negative situation for Pyongyang is starting to change. Thanks to the updated control system, North Korean ICBMs will be able to perform a special maneuver at least once while the engines are running. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});It is important to understand that the “window of opportunity” for interception for THAAD is extremely narrow – only a few minutes. At the same time, due to the enormous launch speeds of ICBMs, the anti-missile will not be able to maneuver much.Therefore, a maneuver by a North Korean missile, where it first changes trajectory and then returns to it, will, with a high degree of probability, lead to a failure of the interception. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Secondly, Pyongyang is betting on equipping ICBMs with single-block high-power nuclear warheads. The warheads of missiles for such products have already been tested. And most likely, they are already being installed on Hwasong with an intercontinental range.The target is American megacitiesWhy did North Korean engineers and military personnel choose this path? After all, global trends in the development of missile and nuclear technologies indicate the need to equip intercontinental ballistic missiles with separate warheads with individual guidance. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});The North Korean military and political leadership soberly assesses its capabilities for producing special ammunition. The option with warheads will require a serious increase in the production of nuclear warheads, as well as making them high-tech. Most likely, Beijing's scientific, technical, and production levels do not yet allow for such developments. But special ammunition with a capacity of over 100 kilotons will become a terrible threat to American urban agglomerations.The nuclear deterrence strategy chosen by Pyongyang is simple. In case of aggression, the strike will be carried out on the main megalopolises. At the same time, even several North Korean nuclear warheads will be enough to turn enemy cities with multi-million populations into radioactive ashes.Also Read:- The architect of the “Kim family cult” in North Korea dies- US warns North Korea against nuclear attacks- North Korea tests missile technology, ignoring UN Security Council resolutions (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});And if just a few years ago the US could guarantee the interception of North Korean ICBMs, now the chances of the American missile defense system are melting away before our eyes.Pyongyang will receive intercontinental missiles capable of performing maneuvers in the active section of the trajectory and also carrying heavy warheads as early as the beginning of next year. To inflict irreparable damage on the US, the North Koreans will need only two or three missiles.\", 'summary': 'The DPRK conducted another test of a long-range ballistic missile.
