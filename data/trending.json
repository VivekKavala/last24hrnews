        "text": "Zomato has rolled out a new feature for users in India which aims to minimise food wastage caused by cancelled orders. This feature, announced by Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal on Twitter, allows customers near a cancelled order\u2019s original delivery route to claim the food at a significant discount, provided it\u2019s still in its untampered, original packaging.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t encourage order cancellation at Zomato, because it leads to a tremendous amount of food wastage. In spite of stringent policies, and a no-refund policy for cancellations, more than 4 lakh perfectly good orders get canceled on Zomato, for various reasons by customers,\u201d he Goyal on X.\nThe cancelled orders will be made available for a short time period (to ensure freshness) in their original untampered packaging. Customers will now be able to grab the order at an \u2018unbeatable price\u2019 and receive it within minutes. Food Rescue will automatically show up on the app home page if there is indeed a canceled order available.\nGoyal said most restaurants affiliated with the food aggregator platform had agreed to the change. Restaurant partners will now receive compensation for the original canceled order as well as a portion of the amount paid by the new customer if the order gets claimed. The eateries will also be able to easily opt out of the initiative if they wished to make a change.\n\u201cZomato will not keep any proceeds (except the required government taxes). The amount paid by the new customer will be shared with the original customer (if they made payment online), and with the restaurant partner. Orders containing items sensitive to distances or temperature such as ice creams, shakes, smoothies, and certain perishable items, will not be eligible for Food Rescue,\u201d Goyal clarified.\n\nWe don\u2019t encourage order cancellation at Zomato, because it leads to a tremendous amount of food wastage.\nInspite of stringent policies, and and a no-refund policy for cancellations, more than 4 lakh perfectly good orders get canceled on Zomato, for various reasons by customers.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fGFQQNgzGJ\n\u2014 Deepinder Goyal (@deepigoyal) November 10, 2024\n\nHow Does It Work?\nWith Food Rescue, customers within a 3km radius of a delivery partner carrying a cancelled order will see it appear on their app\u2019s home screen, available to \u201crescue\u201d at a reduced price. This listing will remain visible for only a few minutes to ensure the order\u2019s freshness. Orders with temperature-sensitive items such as ice creams, smoothies, or items that could degrade in quality during transit will be excluded from this program.\nTo assure that the initiative supports those impacted financially by cancellations, Zomato has arranged that any payment from new customers claiming a rescued order will be divided between the original customer (if prepaid) and the restaurant, while Zomato itself takes no proceeds beyond necessary taxes.\nRestaurants, compensated for the original order, will additionally receive a portion of the resale amount. Delivery partners are fully paid for both the initial pickup and any redelivery required, ensuring no loss in their earnings.\nAddressing why the food isn\u2019t simply donated, Goyal noted logistical and legal obstacles: \u201cMost places where we can distribute them are away from urban centers, and distributing free food to the needy is fraught with liability challenges.\u201d Thus, Zomato has limited the initiative to orders that were already en route.\nThe Food Rescue feature is now being gradually rolled out across the Zomato app, allowing users to refresh their home page and view any nearby cancelled orders that are available to claim.",

President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office to Justice Khanna at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today.\nJustice Khanna, 64, will serve a six-month tenure as the Chief Justice of India and will retire on May 13, 2025.\nAs Supreme Court judge, Justice Khanna has been part of several landmark judgments including the ones of electoral bonds, abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).\nEarly Life And Career\nBorn on May 14, 1960 to late Justice Dev Raj Khanna, former Judge of Delhi High Court, 64-year-old Justice Khanna completed his schooling at Delhi\u2019s Modern School, Barakhamba Road. He later studied law at the Campus Law Centre of Delhi University and enrolled as an advocate with the Bar Council of Delhi in 1983. He initially practiced in the district courts at the Tis Hazari complex in the national capital and, later, in the Delhi High Court.\nJustice Khanna has served on tribunals in diverse fields like constitutional law, direct taxation, arbitration, commercial law, company law, land law, environmental law and medical negligence.

Once allotted, investors will received bank debit messages. They can also check the IPO allotment status online on the websites of BSE and NSE, as well as on Link Intime India\u2019s portal. However, its GMP remains below 1 per cent, indicating a subdued listing on November 13.\nThe initial public offering, which was opened for public subscription between November 6 and November 8, received a 3.59 times subscription garnering bids for 57.53 crore shares as against the 16.01 crore shares on offer.\nThe shares of Swiggy are scheduled to be listed on both BSE and NSE on November 13.\nThe allotment status can be checked online on the websites of BSE and NSE, as well as on the registrar Link Intime India\u2019s portal.\nSwiggy IPO: How to Check Allotment Status?\nOnce the IPO allotment is finalised, the status can be checked by following these steps:\n1) Go to the official BSE website via the URL \u2014https://www.bseindia.com/investors/appli_check.aspx.\n2) Under \u2018Issue Type\u2019, select \u2018Equity\u2019.\n3) Under \u2018Issue Name\u2019, select \u2018Swiggy Ltd\u2019 in the dropbox.\n4) Enter your application number, or the Permanent Account Number (PAN).\n5) Then, click on the \u2018I am not a robot\u2019 to verify yourself and hit \u2018Search\u2019 option.\nYour share application status will appear on your screen.\nYou can also visit direct Link Intime India Pvt Ltd\u2019s portal \u2014 https://linkintime.co.in/initial_offer/public-issues.html and check the Swiggy IPO allotment status.\nSwiggy IPO GMP Today\nAccording to market observers, unlisted shares of Swiggy Ltd continue to trade at just Rs 1 higher in the grey market than its issue price. The Rs 1 grey market premium or GMP means the grey market is expecting a muted listing or discount listing.\nThe GMP is based on market sentiments and keeps changing. \u2018Grey market premium\u2019 indicates investors\u2019 readiness to pay more than the issue price.\n\u201cOn October 29, the GMP stood at Rs 25 (6.4 per cent), but it has since dropped significantly to 0.26 per cent. This decline can be attributed to the recent correction in benchmark indices and the prevailing negative market sentiment. However, Swiggy\u2019s CFO has noted that the October volatility was factored into their pricing strategy,\u201d said Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk.\nSwiggy IPO: More Details\n\u201cGenerally, pure-play companies in the market are awarded a premium. Until now, Zomato was the sole listed player in the quick commerce and food delivery space. With Swiggy\u2019s listing, this premium may diminish, potentially leading to an overall valuation correction across the industry,\u201d Garg added.\nThe Swiggy IPO is a combination of a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 6,800 crore, they added.\nThose selling shares in the OFS route are \u2014 Accel India IV (Mauritius) Ltd, Apoletto Asia Ltd, Alpha Wave Ventures, LP, Coatue PE Asia XI LLC, DST EuroAsia V B.V, Elevation Capital V Ltd, Inspired Elite Investments Ltd, MIH India Food Holdings B.V, Norwest Venture Partners VII-A Mauritius and Tencent Cloud Europe B.V.\nEarly investors like Accel, Elevation Capital and Norwest Ventures are making up to 35 times in returns on the portion they decided to sell. On the other hand, SoftBank continues to stay invested.\nBig investors including Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Norges and Fidelity have placed bids worth more than $15 billion in the Swiggy IPO, 25 times the $605 million portion reserved for such investors, according to Reuters.\nGoing by the IPO papers, proceeds from the fresh issue to the tune of Rs 137.41 crore will be used for debt payment of subsidiary Scootsy.\nAdditionally, Rs 982.40 crore will be invested in Scootsy for expanding the Dark Store network in the quick commerce segment, with Rs 559.10 crore allocated for setting up dark stores and Rs 423.30 crore for lease or licence payments.\nThe company will also invest Rs 586.20 crore in technology and cloud infrastructure, Rs 929.50 crore for brand marketing and business promotion, and funds will be allocated for inorganic growth and general corporate purposes.\nFounded in 2014, Swiggy had a valuation of nearly USD 13 billion in April. The company\u2019s annual revenue stood at USD 1.09 billion as on March 31, 2023, and has more than 4,700 employees, according to Tracxn, a global startup data platform.\nSwiggy\u2019s confidential offer document was approved by Sebi in September and following this updated draft papers were filed.",

        "text": "All work and no play seems like a dreadful proposition, right? Regardless of our age, what we do, and where we are, we cannot deny the importance of staying physically active and striving toward a state of optimal health. The proclivity towards fitness however should be developed early. This is why sports must complement academics so that the former takes care of physical development while the latter offers mental and intellectual replenishment. Together they make a learner balanced, well-rounded, and more capable of handling the challenges that life may throw.\nBy integrating sports with regular, conventional curricula, a school can introduce a plethora of multifaceted skills to learners. By participating in sports, young learners can understand the importance of discipline, the criticalities of teamwork, and the importance of working in collaboration to achieve specific goals. It is through sports that they imbibe the essence of leadership where they have specific and tangible goals to aspire to and specific results to obtain. Time management is another invaluable skill that is learned through sports where learners develop and enhance their productivity within a stipulated time frame. Needless to say, all these qualities are extremely pertinent for the personal and professional success of individuals.\nThe combination of sports and academics is also very fruitful for the achievement of not just physical but mental health. Challenges faced by young people today are myriad and mental health problems have become a far too common malaise. Resilience is a skill that is non-negotiable today and indulging in sports allows young people to tap into their inner reservoir of strength, allowing them to resurface with renewed vigor after a setback.\nSchools are where young learners spend the most part of their formative years. It is in schools that they should get the opportunity to explore the innumerable benefits of dabbling in sports. In addition to this, the schools also have the responsibility to nurture innate sports talent that could potentially bring laurels and glory to the nation.\nIndian athletes and sportspersons have brought great plaudits to the nation and over the decades, sports infrastructure has grown exponentially. It is imperative to offer a variety of sports to students so that they can make organic choices about what resonates most with them. The inclusion of sports in educational philosophy enriches the holistic, well-rounded development of individuals and empowers them to be capable and confident.\n\u2014 Authored by Abhishek Mohan Gupta, Founder and President of the Board of Management at Shrewsbury International School India.",

        "text": "There is a major warning for people using the internet regularly and searching for information via platforms like Google. UK-based cybersecurity firm SOPHOS has warned about a new hacking tactic targeting users who enter certain words into their computer\u2019s search engine. \nAccording to a report by The New York Times, SOPHOS advises against searching for six specific terms, as doing so could heighten the risk of cyberattacks. One example cited is users who search \u201cAre Bengal Cats legal in Australia?\u201d\u2014allegedly had their personal information exposed online after clicking on a top search result link.\u201cVictims are often enticed into clicking on malicious adware or links disguised as legitimate marketing, or in this case a legitimate Google search,\u201d the firm explained in a post. \nIn addition, the alert stated that hackers appear to target users who include the word \u201cAustralia\u201d in their searches, indicating that citizens of the country are more vulnerable to these cyberattacks.\nSOPHOS noted that customers\u2019 bank account information and personal information are taken by a program called Gootloader when they click on the search result that comes at the top and appears to be authentic. Moreover, this application has the capacity to lock the user out of their computer.\nThe cybersecurity firm asserted that although the word \u201cBengal cats\u201d may seem rather specialised, users don\u2019t need to enter any malicious information to be vulnerable to these attacks and have their private data taken and shared online.\nThese days, cybercriminals use programs to snoop on clean and innocent Google searches employing a technique known as \u201cSEO poisoning.\u201d The Daily Mail has described this practice as an \u201cinsidious technique in which criminals manipulate search engine results to push websites they control to the top of the page.\u201d SOPHOS advised anyone who may have been a victim of SEO poisoning to change their password as soon as possible and enhance their security systems.\nReportedly, Hackers steal people\u2019s data and even take over their devices by using malware, which is software created expressly to damage computers, networks and gadgets. Malware comes in a variety of types, such as trojan horses, bots, viruses, worms, ransomware (which prevents users from accessing their computers unless they pay) and more.",

The actor was spotted in Mumbai for the promotion of his upcoming music video Sahiba with Radhikka Madan, when the incident happened. Recently, Vijay reacted to the viral moment with a hilarious video, sportingly taking his \u201cfall\u201d and using it as a clever marketing strategy.\nOn Sunday, November 10, Vijay dropped a reel on his Instagram account, which opened with the clip where he slipped down the stairs. The very next moment, he popped up in the frame wearing a green-coloured tee from his clothing brand RWDY. He paired it with beige trousers and a yellow cap. As the video played further, Vijay winked at the camera while \u201cFall, Falling, Falling in Looove with my RWDY boys and girls\u201d was displayed on the screen. \nHe posted the video with the caption: \u201cI fell & it went crazy ? That is the RWDY life. RWDYs go all out always. Irrespective of highs and lows. & RWDY essentials sell out always. Lots of love. Stay RWDY,\u201d followed by a red heart emoji.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Vijay Deverakonda (@thedeverakonda)\n\nSoon, Vijay\u2019s fans flooded the comment section of the post, appreciating the actor\u2019s marketing strategy. One fan wrote, \u201cThat was savage!!!!\u201d Another said, \u201cHahaha, love this. Nobody could have done this any better or thought about using the fall video and use it for own advantage.\u201d A third fan penned, \u201cThat\u2019s my boy, fallen hard but came back harder, lessggoooooo.\u201d\nOn November 8, Vijay Deverakonda was seen in Mumbai with Radhikka Madan and singer Stebin Ben to promote their upcoming song Sahiba. In a video shared by a paparazzo page, they were exiting a venue when the 35-year-old lost his control, and as he was walking close to the wall without holding the railing, he slipped down the stairs. His team immediately rushed to help him out and the actor got up with grace while maintaining his composure. Meanwhile, the singer and other people rushed to cover the cameras of the paparazzi stationed outside the venue.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood)\n\nSpeaking about Vijay\u2019s work front, he had two releases in 2024: The Family Star, co-starring Mrunal Thakur, and the multi-starrer sci-fi film Kalki 2898 AD, in which he had a cameo appearance as Arjuna.

        "text": "Vivek Ramaswamy, the top Indian-American aide to President-elect Donald Trump, expressed his support for the mass deportation plan of illegal immigrants and said that the legal immigration system in the country is \u201cbroken\u201d.\nHe said that those who broke the law while entering the United States have no right to stay here and they need to go.\n\u201cDo we have a broken legal immigration system? Yes, we do. But I think the first step is going to be to restore the rule of law, to do it in a very pragmatic way,\u201d entrepreneur turned-politician told ABC News in an interview.\n\u201cThose who have entered in the last couple of years, they haven\u2019t established roots in the country. Those who have committed a crime, should be out of this country. That is by the millions. That alone would be the largest mass deportation. Combine that with ending government aid for all illegals. You see self-deportations,\u201d he said.\nRamaswamy appeared on multiple Sunday talk shows, the first after the stunning win of Donald Trump in the November 5 presidential elections. He told ABC News that he is having some \u201chigh impact\u201d discussions on his future role in the administration, Congress of the party.\nFrom being a rival of Trump during the Republican primaries, Ramaswamy has emerged as a staunch supporter and confidant of Trump.\n\u2018Trump Cares About Uniting The Country\u2019\n\u201cI think he cares about uniting the country. I think that is Donald Trump\u2019s number one focus. I do think we have to get back to a place after this election after that decisive victory, which I do think was a gift to the country, get back to a place where ordinary Americans who might have voted differently amongst their family members or their colleagues or their neighbours, to be able to get together at the dinner table and say, we\u2019re still Americans at the end of this, that\u2019s very much Donald Trump\u2019s headspace,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s also learned a lot from that first term, and I think he\u2019s going into this second term even to take to new heights some of the things he wasn\u2019t able to accomplish in the first term, which I think is going to be a good thing,\u201d Ramaswamy said.\nThe Republican Party, he said, is now a multi-ethnic working-class coalition. \u201cYou saw black voters, Hispanic voters, young voters. That was a big one. A much younger composition of the Republican primary base came together on basic principles that really weren\u2019t as beholden to older Republican orthodoxies, but principles like free speech, anti-censorship, meritocracy, and staying out of World War III. These are some of the common threads that bring together what is a pretty diverse and broad tent coalition to restore those basic constitutional principles,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHere\u2019s a big one. And Donald Trump talked for a long time about the deep state. But this idea of restoring self-governance is big in this new coalition. The idea that the people we elect to run the government, they haven\u2019t been the ones actually running the government for a very long time,\u201d Ramaswamy said.\n\u201cDonald Trump is going to be the president of the United States in the real sense of that word. Capital P president where he is actually making the decisions with the democratic will of the people behind him, not the unelected bureaucratic class underneath him,\u201d the Indian American said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that unites a common thread of even former Democrats to independents, to libertarians, to, of course, traditional Republicans as well. I think that that\u2019s a common thread that unites us,\u201d he said.\nTrump, he said, is focused on what makes people\u2019s lives better. \u201cAnd actually, my message to Democrats out there, even those who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump, is to give them a chance to actually make your life better. A lot of people across the country, even those who have bought into some false narratives about Donald Trump, are going to be pleasantly surprised to find more money in their paychecks, prices coming down in the country, and a secure border. Those are things most Americans actually care about,\u201d Ramaswamy said.",

I am sure they have got a lot of fire to achieve a lot of success for the nation, and you should never doubt their passion for the country.\u201d\nHe also confirmed that star pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who is the designated vice captain of the Indian Test team, will lead the side in the opening Test if regular skipper Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the game due to personal reasons.\nThe first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is scheduled to take place at Optus Stadium in Perth from November 22.\n\u201cAt the moment, there is no confirmation. We will let you know exactly what the situation will be. Hopefully, he is going to be available, but everything you want to know, you will get to know before the start of the series,\u201d Gambhir said. \u201cBumrah is the vice captain, so obviously if Rohit is not available, he is going to lead in Perth,\u201d the coach added.\nThe straight-talking former opener also indicated that KL Rahul could be asked to open the innings in place of Rohit.\n\u201cObviously, there is Easwaran; there is KL there. We will take a call closer to the first Test match if Rohit is not available. There are options. There are quite a lot of options in this spot. Once it gets closer to the first Test match, we will try and play the best playing XI who is going to do the job for us,\u201d he added.",

        "text": "Former cricketer and ex-judge of Kapil Sharma\u2019s show, Navjot Singh Sidhu has reunited with Kapil after five years. The new promo of The Great Indian Kapil Show has revealed that Navjot Singh Sidhu will be seen on the show in the upcoming episode. The promo revealed that Navjot was seated in the judge\u2019s seat while Archana Puran Singh looked lost. \nIn the promo, Kapil pretended that Archana Puran Singh got a makeover that made her look like Navjot. The former judge clarified that it was indeed him. Archana then walked on stage and asked Kapil to intervene. \u201cKapil, tell Sardar sahab to get off my seat. He\u2019s taken over my spot,\u201d she said. Harbhajan Singh, who will be seen in the episode as well, jumped in to side with Navjot. He said that no matter who takes over the seat, they cannot replace Sidhu. \nThe makers then revealed that he is not returning as the judge but appearing on the show as a guest with his wife, Navjot. They will be joined by Harbhajan and his wife, actress Geeta Basra. Watch the trailer below: \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Riddhi Bansal (@bollyxxholly)\n\nNavjot reunited with Kapil six years after Navjot was asked to leave The Kapil Sharma Show in 2019. At the time, a source told The Indian Express that the channel asked him to leave the show after his controversial comments on Pulwama attack. He was replaced by Archana Puran Singh. While the channel airing the show did not shed light on his exit, Navjot had commented on being replaced from the show at the time on X. \n\u201cI had to attend Vidhan Sabha\u2019s session due to which I couldn\u2019t go for the shoots of The Kapil Sharma Show and they got somebody else in my replacement for two episodes. I have no intimation about my termination from the channel. If it is regarding my statement, I will stick to what I have been saying yesterday, today and ever tomorrow,\u201d he said at the time.",
