Our standing in the field of research and innovation will define our prowess to the global community and give cutting edge to our soft diplomacy,\u201d he said.\n\nSharing an emotional personal experience, the Vice President said: \u201cI was selected for IIT Kharagpur. Couldn\u2019t join, I didn\u2019t have money. A major setback. A hard reality. You don\u2019t have that situation now. When I focused on the alumni fund, it was on this emotive platform.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the crucial role of alumni in strengthening the educational ecosystem and urging active participation and contributions to alumni associations, the Vice President said: \u201cAlumni of an institution are in several ways its lifeline. They are ambassadors of the institution. It is an acknowledged method globally and nationally that the best way to pay back to your institution is to be an active member of the alumni association.\u201d\n\n\u201cI strongly urge you to have an alumni fund\u2026 making annual contributions is all important. Some of the best institutions globally have been on an upward trajectory because these institutions are fueled by alumni energy. You have to conserve and converge your alumni energy for better prospects of all those who step into this institution to get an education,\u201d he said.\n\nCalling for unflinching commitment to nationalism in its fullness, he said national interest has to have precedence or partisan or otherwise interests.\n\n\u201cEconomic nationalism has to be a dominant concern for business. Howsoever justifiable, howsoever big in volume or fiscal quantum, there is no excuse for compromising economic nationalism. This denudes our commitment to the principle of keeping the nation first,\u201d he said.\n\nHe appealed to chambers of commerce and industry and associations of trade to come forward to fuel research and spur innovation through liberal financial contributions.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the name of commitment to research, let us not have something that is just surface scratching. It must be real and authentic,\u201d he said.",

Stalin visited Virudhunagar district as part of his statewide tour to monitor government projects. \n\nDuring his visit, he stopped by a fireworks factory in the district, where he met with the workers and staff to inquire about their well-being.\n\nStalin inspected the firecracker production areas and the warehouse and reviewed the required certifications for the factory\u2019s operation.\n\nThe Chief Minister directed the factory owner to provide insurance facilities for all the workers. He was informed that the factory was well-equipped, adhered to all safety protocols, and had not experienced any accidents.\n\nIt may be noted that Virudhunagar district, particularly Sivakasi, is the largest firecracker-producing region in India. During the 2024 Deepavali festival, Sivakasi reported a sales turnover of Rs 6,000 crore, solidifying its reputation as the \u2018firecracker capital of India\u2019.\n\nUpon arrival at Madurai airport from Chennai, the Chief Minister was accorded a warm welcome. Crowds gathered along the roads to greet him as he travelled to Virudhunagar.\n\nThis visit is part of a larger tour that Stalin began in Coimbatore on November 5.\n\nIn a letter to party members, he shared his plans to conduct ground-level inspections across the state to evaluate the progress of various government schemes.\n\nHe emphasised his commitment to visiting every district to inform the public about the achievements and successes of these welfare initiatives. Although he has not specified a timeline for the tour, Stalin\u2019s visits will be spread out over time.\n\nSince taking office in May 2021, his government has introduced various programmes aimed at uplifting marginalised communities.\n\nKey initiatives include the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam scheme, which provides Rs 1,000 monthly to 1,15,16,292 women; free bus travel for women; the Makkalai Thedi Matuthuvam (Health at Doorstep) scheme; and the Chief Minister\u2019s Free Breakfast Scheme for schoolchildren.\n\nAnother notable scheme, Pudhumai Pen, offers Rs 1,000 per month to girl students from government and government-aided schools pursuing college education. Around 3.28 lakh girl students have benefitted from this initiative.\n\nFollowing the success of the abovementioned scheme, it was extended to boys in government and government-aided schools through the Tamizh Pudhalvan scheme, which now aids approximately 3.18 lakh boys.\n\nThe government\u2019s Naan Mudhalvan (I am the First) scheme has trained 28 lakh students to improve employability and facilitate skill development.\n\nThrough these schemes, the government has distributed over Rs 6,569 crore across Tamil Nadu. The initiatives have drawn attention from other states, with ministers and officials visiting Tamil Nadu to learn about the welfare programmes inspired by the Dravidian model.\n\nThe Chief Minister\u2019s office announced that Stalin would meet with government officials, MPs, MLAs, and local representatives to review the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nOn Sunday, he will meet with sanitary workers and traders of Virudhunagar to hear their grievances. Stalin will also inaugurate the new District Collector\u2019s Office and the Integrated Commercial Tax Office in Virudhunagar on November 10.",

In Dasa Sangeetha, each of the verses sung by the Dasas reaches us without language barriers. The verses are a humble plea of these Dasas, who lived on Bhiksha, followed a Guru and attained Diksha with that Guru\u2019s guidance, she said.\n\nMs. Sitharaman was speaking after inaugurating the three-day Mysuru Sangeetha Suganda, a music festival celebrating the Dasa tradition of Carnatic music, at the KSOU Convocation Hall here.\n\nThe music festival is jointly organised by the Central Ministry of Tourism and State Ministry of Culture and the Tourism Department. The event aims to celebrate Mysuru\u2019s rich Carnatic music traditions, and also promote lesser-known tourist destinations, cuisine, handicrafts and textiles of Karnataka. Many renowned musicians are attending the festival and also performing.\n\nIn her inaugural address, Ms. Sitharaman, who was instrumental in organising the music festival for promoting Carnatic music, said language does not come as a barrier in Dasa Sangeetha as it reaches everybody.\n\nThe Finance Minister, who spoke on the greatness of Mysuru\u2019s Carnatic music traditions and the Dasa Sangeetha, said the festival organised jointly by the Tourism and Culture Ministries should become a calendar event organised annually to promote Kannada language and the Dasa Sangeetha. The Karnataka government must come forward to support the event every year.\n\nWhile complimenting the Tourism Ministry for choosing Mysuru for the music festival, Ms. Sitharaman said the Dasas during the Bhakti movement kept the entire population together and helped people to remain positive. Because of their roles, Karnataka contributed immensely despite the difficult era. Mysuru is a blessed place.\n\nExplaining the vision of the Modi government, she said \u2018Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi\u2019, which highlights the country\u2019s development and at the same time emphasises on safeguarding our heritage and culture. India has diverse languages and cultures. The Prime Minister\u2019s message is, that besides the country\u2019s economic progress, we also need to preserve our cultural heritage. We need language, culture, music and so on, she explained.\n\nShe also spoke on the programme \u201cEk Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\u201d. India is blessed by diverse languages. Every language is superior or \u201cShrestha\u201d. All the beautiful languages make Bharat where different languages are spoken. There is a need to strengthen these languages, the finance minister opined.\n\nDuring her talk, Ms. Sitharaman also spoke on the contributions of the Mysuru kings for the promotion of Carnatic music, and mentioned about the songs composed by Sri Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.\n\nShe said the music festival needs to be supported and all Kannadigas, even through the digital modes, have to come together to promote Carnatic music as many stalwarts of Carnatic music hailed from Mysuru, which was a nerve centre for culture, and who set golden standards for music. It was Purandara Dasaru, known as \u201cPitamaha\u201d of Carnatic music, who codified Carnatic music.\n\nBesides Mysuru, the performances of Dasa Sankeerthana as part of the music festival are also being held simultaneously at the National Gallery of Modern Art, Bengaluru; Sri Aprameya Swamy Temple; Rudrapatna in Hassan district and Araga.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas and Tourism Suresh Gopi, Minister in charge of Mysuru district H.C. Mahadevappa, and Mysuru MP Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar also spoke. Additional Secretary to the Tourism Ministry Suman Billa welcomed. MLA T.S.

        "text": "Drones will emerge as a gamechanger in the fisheries sector, addressing several critical challenges with precision and efficiency, Union Minister of State for Fisheries George Kurian said here on Friday.\n\nHe was inaugurating an awareness workshop and demonstration of drone applications in the fisheries sector at the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. \n\n\u201cDrones play a pivotal role in managing aquaculture farms, monitoring fish markets, and assessing damage to fisheries infrastructure, particularly during natural disasters, when rescue operations are essential. On their part, underwater drones help closely monitor fish behaviour in natural habitats, to detect signs of distress like erratic swimming patterns and also provide real-time data that strengthen sustainable fisheries management,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event saw live demonstration of drone applications in fisheries, including transportation of fish from the farm, dispensing aquafeeds and rescue operation.\n\nThe Minister said the Centre would develop 100 climate-resilient coastal fishermen villages across the country, to help fisher communities who encounter climate-change challenges, by allocating \u20b92 crore per village under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana. This would help ready common facilities like fish-drying yards, processing centres, fish markets, and emergency rescue facilities, whilst promoting climate-resilient practices like seaweed cultivation, artificial reefs, and green fuel initiatives. \n\nThe Union Department of Fisheries would install transponders in about one lakh marine fishing vessels this year at an estimate of \u20b9364 crore. \n\nThis would provide a two-way communication system enabling real-time tracking of fishing vessels and help fishermen to send short messages using their Android mobile phone while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast.\n\nThe system would also provide weather alerts to the fishermen, including cyclone warning. The Indian Space Research Organisation developed this technology indigenously using GSAT 6 satellite. Information related to potential fishing zones too would be made available to the fishermen on their mobile in regional languages, Mr Kurian said.\n\nNeetu Kumari Prasad, Joint Secretary in Union Department of Fisheries; B.K. Behra, Chief Executive of National Fisheries Development Board; Grinson George, Director of CMFRI; and George Ninan, Director of CIFT, spoke on the occasion",

        "text": "\u201cThe BJP is trying to convert Vijayapura district into a Hindutva laboratory and divide people on the basis of religion. But its plans will not succeed as it is a land of communal harmony,\u201d Minister M.B. Patil said in Vijayapura on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is using the waqf issue to create rifts between communities and spread hatred. It will not succeed, as the people can see through the conspiracy,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is trying to portray Congress as an anti-Hindu party by saying that we are supporting Waqf Board in reclaiming its land. This is not true because the Waqf Board is a statutory body that regularly issues notices to remove encroachments from its land. During its tenure, the BJP has taken several pro-Waqf Board steps, including issuing notices and mutation of Record of Rights, Tenancy and Crops (RTCs),\u201d he said.\n\nReleasing a list of documents to support his claim, he said that the Congress will also release a booklet containing the BJP\u2019s pro-Waqf Board activities.\n\nThe BJP, which has been in power at the Centre since 2014 and also in the and State intermittently, is very concerned about the protection of waqf properties. Its leaders and Ministers have made several statement and took steps towards that end. When the BJP was in power in the State, it allowed the Waqf Board to take back property of farmers, religious places and people from all religions, he said. \u201cIt is now conducting a false campaign propaganda against us in the State and national level,\u201d he added.\n\nHe claimed that the BJP government mutated in favour of the Waqf Board land belonging to many farmers in 2023, citing examples.\n\nThe then Revenue Minister issued circulars in 2010, regarding updating of waqf documents. The Chief Secretary issued a circular in 2010 to remove all encroachments from waqf land by private individuals, government bodies and corporations. The Regional Commissioner of Kalaburagi issued orders in 2011 on protecting waqf property and regularization of records, the Minister pointed out, to show that clearing encroachments is an ongoing process.\n\nThe Principal Secretary, Minority Welfare, issued orders in 2011, on compulsory depositing of compensation against acquisition of waqf land to the board\u2019s account. In 2020, the Deputy Secretary (Land Grant, Land Reforms and Revenue Department) issued orders for flagging wakf property in the Bhoomi portal. In 2021, the BJP government set up district-level task forces to protect waqf property.\n\nIn 2021, the BJP government issued orders for flagging and locking of waqf property in gramthana land in the Panchatantra and e-Swattu software.\n\nIn 2014, the BJP\u2019s election manifesto proposed, in consultation with religious leaders, to empower the Waqf Board and clear encroachments.\n\nIn 2019, MP Shobha Karandlaje asked a question in Parliament seeking information about steps taken to preserve waqf property like geo-tagging and digitization, lease terms, financial assistance to State Waqf Boards, video conferencing facilities, Mr. Patil said, citing these instances.\n\nIn Karnataka, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has ordered withdrawal of all notices when the BJP started making false allegations about waqf assets, he said.\n\n\u201cEven after all this, the BJP is spreading false information among farmers, religious leaders and public for political gains and publicity. Were they not following anti-Hindu policies, when they were in power? Why are they posing now that the BJP is the only party in favor of the Hindus?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said that the BJP has politicised religious institutions. The BJP has dragged into the anti-waqf agitation innocent swamis of various maths who have no clear idea of the double-speak of the party, he added.\n\n\u201cBut then, we will take steps to convince them of the BJP\u2019s hypocrisy. Sri Adrushya Kadasiddeshwar Swami of Kaneri Math, who addressed the rally in Vijayapura, will turn against the BJP. That is because we are true Hindus, but the BJP has fake Hindu leaders who are carrying out a false propaganda for political gains,\u201d Mr. Patil claimed.",

Thajuddin submitted a memorandum containing 11 demands to Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin in Thanjavur on Thursday, detailing the requirements of fishermen in the State.\n\nAccess to hospitals and medical assistance was among the issues raised by the board. \u201cFishermen who get injured while at sea due to natural calamities, accidents, or health problems are left waiting for medical attention. The authorities should organise ambulance and helicopter rescue services at the ports in order to save lives,\u201d the memorandum said. \n\nThe document pointed out that despite the heavy footfall and vehicular traffic at the Mallipattinam fish market, the nearest hospital was in Tiruchi or Thanjavur. \u201cA full-fledged hospital closer to the market would be able to attend to accidents and injuries,\u201d it said.\n\nAmong the other demands were to early installation of curved groynes to protect the Mallipattinam port from sea erosion and climate change. \n\nThe body sought official help to settle disputes between fishermen in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. \u201cWe urge the authorities to resolve the issue of fishermen straying into foreign waters through high-level bilateral talks and secure the release of those who have been arrested along with their vessels from Sri Lankan custody,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFishermen of Thanjavur district could be permitted to stay at sea with their power boats for at least three days, like those of Nagapattinam district, in order to increase the size of their catch, and profits, said the body.

To maintain transparent and efficient distribution, the department had directed fertilizer vendors to display their sales licences prominently, list stock levels and prices clearly, and sell fertilizers exclusively at government-mandated rates. Sales are restricted to farmers within Karaikal district to prevent unauthorised distribution to neighbouring areas. \n\nThe guidelines stipulate that vendors must avoid combining fertilizer sales with unrelated products and are prohibited from selling unapproved items. All sales are to be documented via POS systems, with receipts provided to farmers. Vendors are required to submit inventory and sales reports bi-monthly, on the 15th and 30th. \n\nMr. Ganesan reiterated that any violations of these regulations would lead to action under the Fertiliser Control Order of 1985, reinforcing the department\u2019s commitment to ensuring a fair and efficient fertilizer supply chain.",
