                                </h1>

                                
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>The South African government has refused to rescue hundred of illegal miners, who are reportedly trapped in an abandoned gold mine in South Africa’s North West province after access to the site was cut off from essential supplies that include food and water.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Why did South African Government Took This Step?

The move by the government is part of Operation Vala Umgodi, or “Close the Hole”, which is directed at illegal mining activities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> As part of its plan to starve the miners, known locally as “zama zamas” out, police have blocked all routes leading to the mine.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> According to police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe, it is aimed at forcing miners to surrender to authorities and decrease illegal mining activities that cost this country more than one billion dollars annually.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Thousands of Miners Trapped

There are reportedly some 3,000 miners trapped underground, three of them have come out of the mine recently, though police later revised that figure saying the number of miners currently trapped in the mine probably stands at somewhere between 350 and 400.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

“We believe that the estimates were overreported.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Based on our intelligence operatives, there are about 350 to 400 miners here,” Mathe said Thursday as he briefed the reporters on the operation that has seen 1,172 miners already come out of the ground voluntarily, police reports have indicated.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chilling Conditions

At this time, reports on the ground indicate that the miners-the miners, who most often spend months underground-have now been denied basic needs such as food and water.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “They could be in critical condition through starvation, dehydration, and exposure to toxic dust,” said David Van Wyk of the Benchmarks Foundation, a researcher.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

“At this stage, they are starving, becoming dehydrated and breathing toxic dust.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They’re going to come out very weak and ill when they do come up,” Van Wyk told CNN.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

As if things weren’t serious enough, one decomposed body was also brought to the surface on Thursday, and pathologists are currently examining the scene.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Families Beg for Help

The families of the miners trapped underground have begun gathering near the mine, fearing their loved ones might not see daybreak.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Ntomboxolo Qwanti, whose husband has been underground for eight months, spoke to Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

“We are here for our brothers and sisters,” she said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “If they don’t get medication and water to sustain them, more could die,” warned community member Emily Photsoa.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Government Stance on the Crisis

The South African government has been hardline and refused to help the miners, whom they classify as criminals.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, the Minister in the Presidency, said on Wednesday, “We are not sending help to criminals.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> We are going to smoke them out.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

But this approach is being heavily critised.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Mametlwe Sebei of the General Industries Workers Union of South Africa criticized the government for “criminalizing” desperate people.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Many of the zama zamas are former mine workers who lost their jobs and, in many cases, are forced to work in illegal mining under the command of organized crime syndicates.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

There are locals who have organized their rescue activities and plan to come and take out the miners.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Authorities allow it as long as volunteers sign indemnity forms absolving the government in case of accidents.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Illegal Mining Issues of Long Standing

More than probably the other challenges facing South Africa, illegal mining has become rampant through poverty and the lack of other jobs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The country is estimated to have 100,000 artisanal miners who operate mainly in abandoned mines that large corporations failed to seal up.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There are about 6,000 mines that were not sealed up, according to Van Wyk, which oils the wheels of the illicit mining trade.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The police and the ministers of defense are expected to visit the area with local officials and members over possible solutions to this crisis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
