        "title": "Gurugram Real Estate: The Future of High-End Living with Luxury Realty Market",
        "text": "Gurugram has strongly established itself as an epicenter of luxury real estate in India. Over the years, the city has transformed into a modern metropolis, with expansive high-rise developments, gated communities, and futuristic townships that cater to those seeking a sophisticated lifestyle. These developments come with state-of-the-art amenities, making Gurugram an attractive destination for HNIs and affluent homebuyers.\nAs per JLL\u2019s report, in the first half of 2024, Delhi-NCR showcased a notable 64 per cent share of luxury residential launches among the top seven cities in India. Gurugram has excelled as the leading performer in the luxury real estate segment, with 88 per cent of all launches concentrated in the Dwarka Expressway and Southern Peripheral Road regions. This substantial growth indicates a rising demand for upscale residences in these specific areas. In addition, this impressive performance can also be attributed to factors such as rising disposable income, a growing aspiration for a luxurious lifestyle, and the continuous development of infrastructure in the region.\nSalil Kumar, director (marketing and business management) of CRC Group, said, \u201cWith the well-planned and improved infrastructure, the Delhi-NCR region is rapidly urbanising. New roads and improved public transport make it easier to live in and around the city. As areas become more accessible, the demand for luxury homes in well-connected locations rises. Places like Gurugram and Noida have emerged as favoured destinations for luxury real estate due to their modern infrastructure and amenities.\u201d\nNotably, millennials now account for 54 per cent of home purchases, reflecting their growing influence in the real estate market. Additionally, high-net-worth buyers are driving demand for properties that not only offer luxury but also promise returns on investment, he added.\nGurpal Singh Chawla, managing director of TREVOC, said, \u201cThe future of high-end living in Gurugram is being shaped by a new breed of luxury homebuyers digitally savvy, aspirational, and keen on living in spaces that reflect both status and innovation. Today\u2019s affluent buyers are not just looking for larger homes; they want residences that embody cutting-edge design, sustainability, and a seamless blend of technology and comfort. At TREVOC, we are focused on creating future-ready luxury homes that cater to this growing demand for personalised experiences while also ensuring long-term value and investment returns.\u201d\nMoreover, the report highlights how Gurugram led the market with a 55% share of the new launches, with 88 per cent of them focused on the Dwarka Expressway and Southern Peripheral Road regions. One of the key factors driving this change is the growing awareness of sustainability. Evolving buyer preferences toward eco-friendly and technologically advanced homes are reshaping the luxury real estate landscape.\nThe desire for a premium lifestyle is also evident in the demand for homes with exclusive amenities that elevate the living experience. These elements reflect the trend toward bespoke interiors and carefully curated designs that cater to individual tastes and preferences.\nRaheja Developers\u2019 Nayan Raheja said, \u201cThe city\u2019s real estate has become synonymous with innovation and exclusivity. As the demand for premium residences continues to rise, we foresee a greater emphasis on craftsmanship, smart integration, and strategic locations. Our projects not only offer premium amenities but also maximize future growth potential, making them the ideal investment for discerning buyers.\u201d\nSaurab Saharan, group managing director of HCBS Developments, said, \u201cGurugram\u2019s luxury real estate market is evolving, with buyers seeking more than just spacious homes. As the city\u2019s realty market expands, developers meticulously craft projects that boast world-class amenities that cater to the desires of today\u2019s sophisticated buyers. Therefore, we see a future where high-end finishes, exclusive facilities, and thoughtful layouts will be key to the luxury market.\u201d\nThus, Gurugram\u2019s luxury real estate market is poised for even greater heights as it continues to attract affluent buyers and investors. With its impressive growth trajectory, driven by robust infrastructure, strategic location, and cutting-edge developments, the city has solidified its position as the leading destination for luxury living in the NCR.",

        "text": "Pune-based software professional Jairaj Ravi earns well, but also pays a high tax because all the allowances in his salary are taxable and he has not opted for the deductions available to him. TaxSpanner estimates that Ravi can reduce his tax by around Rs.55,000 if he opts for the NPS benefit offered by his employer. 114867234Ravi lives in his own house and has no home loan. With very few deductions available to him, he finds it beneficial to opt for the new tax regime, where the tax slabs are wider and rates are lower. However, there are few exemptions and deductions under the new tax regime. Besides, all other allowances in his paycheque, including conveyance allowance and meal coupons, are fully taxable. 114867252However, Ravi can still avail of the tax deduction for NPS contributions under the new regime. Under Section 80CCD(2), up to 10% of the employee\u2019s basic salary put in the pension scheme is tax-free. This limit is higher at 14% of the basic pay under the new tax regime. Ravi should opt for the NPS benefit offered by his company. If his company puts Rs.14,318 (14% of his basic salary) in the NPS on his behalf every month, his annual tax will reduce by about Rs.53,600. However, contributions to the NPS will reduce his monthly take-home salary by about Rs.9,850. 114867253Ravi should also avoid investing in fixed deposits, where the interest earned is taxed at the slab rate every year. If he shifts to debt funds, the gains will be taxed at the same rate but only at the time of withdrawal. If he goes for arbitrage schemes and holds for more than a year, gains of up to Rs.1.25 lakh will be tax-free in a year.WRITE TO US FOR HELPPaying too much tax?

        "title": "Sensex Crashes 1,400 Points, Investor Wealth Worth Rs 8 Lakh Cr Wiped Out; Why Is Market Falling?",
        "text": "Indian benchmarks\u2014the 30-stock Sensex and the Nifty 50\u2014fell around a percent each in opening trade on November 4, kicking off an action-packed week marked by the US Presidential election and the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy meeting on a weak note.\nThe BSE Sensex plunged 1,409 points, or 1.77 per cent, to 78,316, while the Nifty50 declined 454 points, or 1.87 per cent, to 23,850 at around 10:58 am.\nThe market capitalisation of all listed companies on BSE declined by Rs 8.44 lakh crore to Rs 439.66 lakh crore.\nReliance Industries, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Sun Pharma were the top laggards on the Sensex, contributing a decline of 420 points. L&T, Axis Bank, TCS, and Tata Motors also weighed down the index.\nWhy Is the Market Falling Today?\nUS Elections\nThe uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election on November 5 has contributed to a cautious sentiment in the Indian market today. With Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump in a close contest, investors are wary of the potential economic implications.\nAnalysts suggest that the outcome could lead to varying policy approaches affecting the Indian economy. A victory for Harris may prompt a more accommodative stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, potentially leading the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ease domestic rates, which would benefit non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).\nConversely, a Trump win could keep U.S. interest rates elevated, prompting the RBI to maintain higher rates and delaying any rate cuts, favoring public sector banks (PSBs) instead. This uncertainty is causing investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach, impacting market performance.\n\u201cIn the next couple of days markets globally will be focused on the US presidential elections and there can be near-term volatility in response to the election outcome. However, this is likely to be short-lived and economic fundamentals like US growth, inflation and the Fed action will influence the market trend,\u201d said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\nUS Fed Outcome\nThe major event on the radar this week is the US Presidential election on November 5, followed by the Fed\u2019s monetary policy outcome on November 7. While the US central bank is widely expected to deliver another rate cut\u2014a quarter-percentage point this time around\u2014the results of the US Presidential election have kept investors on edge. Touted as one of the most closely contested elections in US history, the outcome is expected to play a decisive role in shaping policies in the world\u2019s largest economy and impacting global markets.\n\u201cA double dose of potentially market-moving events arrives in the coming week as Americans vote on their next president and the Federal Reserve offers more insight on the path of interest rates at its monetary policy meeting,\u201d said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.\nWeak Q2 Earnings\nInvestor sentiment has been dampened by disappointing Q2 earnings from Indian corporates, contributing to a decline in the equity market and prompting FIIs to offload Indian stocks.\n\u201cThe Indian market is facing headwinds from decelerating earnings growth. Nifty EPS growth as indicated by Q2 results may dip below 10% in FY25 which will render the present valuations of about 24 times estimated FY25 earnings, difficult to sustain. FIIs may continue to sell in this difficult earnings growth environment, constraining any rally in the market,\u201d said Vijayakumar.\nOil On The Rise\nIn the midst of that, oil prices ticked nearly 2 percent higher, gaining over $1 per barrel after OPEC+ stated it would delay a planned December output hike by one month due to soft demand and rising supply outside the group.\nNifty Technicals\nOn the technical front, Palka Arora Chopra, director of Master Capital Services, sees key resistance for the Nifty 50 at 24,500. A breakout above this level could potentially trigger a rally towards 24,800.\nConversely, Arora suggests that if the Nifty breaks below 24,100, it could experience further selling pressure, possibly testing the 23,800 level. \u201cThe market remains under pressure, suggesting a cautious stance. The strategy remains to sell on any rise until a decisive breakout above resistance confirms a bullish reversal,\u201d Arora recommended.\nThe market\u2019s uneasiness was also reflected in a more than 5 percent spike in the \u2018fear gauge\u2019 India VIX, which hovered above the 16-point mark.",

        "text": "The Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn on November 4, with the Sensex crashing by 1300 points and the Nifty hitting a four-month low. This drastic fall was primarily driven by heavy selling in the auto, metal, realty, and energy stocks. By mid-session, the BSE Sensex was trading at 78,609, marking a decrease of 1,317 points or 1.65 per cent. Concurrently, the NSE Niftywas trading at 23,862.55, down by 441.80 points or 1.82 per cent. This downward trend was reflected across almost all sectoral indices, with auto, IT, PSU Bank, financial services, pharma, MMCG, metal, realty, media, private bank, infra, and commodities sectors being the major losers. In the Sensex pack, shares of all companies, with the exception of M&M and Tech Mahindra, were trading in the red. Sun Pharma, Reliance, NTPC, Tata Motors, Power Grid, and Tata Steel were among the top losers. Historical Market Volatility This widespread decline in the market was also reflected in the afternoon trade, with the Nifty Bank, Nifty Midcap 100 index, and the Nifty Small Cap 100 index all experiencing significant falls. The market trend remained negative, with 1,062 shares trading in green on the BSE, while 2,856 shares were trading in red. There was no change in 131 shares. However, this is not the first time the Indian stock market has experienced such volatility. In fact, the market has shown resilience and the ability to bounce back from such downturns in the past. For instance, on January 8, 2022, the indices soared with the Sensex ending above 58,000 and the Nifty topping 17,300. This rally was led by the auto and banking sectors, with M&M and Tata Motors gaining more than 6%, while Sun Pharma lost 2.5%. Global Factors and Market Trends Similarly, on June 5, 2022, the Sensex ended over 800 points lower, and the Nifty was near 16,400, with metals and realty being the worst hit. This slump was in line with global peers, as Asian and European equities tumbled following a rout on Wall Street. The cause of this downturn was worries that aggressive rate hikes by central banks to check inflation could hurt global growth. These historical events highlight the inherent volatility of the stock market, which is influenced by a multitude of factors, including global events, economic indicators, and investor sentiment. Market experts have suggested that the global market's focus will be on the US presidential elections in the coming days, and instability may persist for some time regarding the election results.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Demand for air purifiers has witnessed a surge as air quality, especially in Delhi-NCR, dropped to hazardous levels, according to manufacturers of the product.\n\nCompanies, including Kent RO Systems, Xiaomi, and LG Electronics India, said in the festive season, air purifiers sales grew up to 50 per cent as the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi and the adjoining moved towards an alarming level.\n\nLike the previous year, the appliance makers have witnessed growth in the last 2-3 weeks in sales and enquiries for air-purifiers and expect a further uptick with the increase in the AQI index in the coming weeks.\n\nAir purifier is a very small segment of the appliances market and its sales generally peaks in October and November, when the pollution level in North India, particularly Delhi NCR, and some other parts worsens due to stubble burning and Diwali celebrations.\n\nLG Electronics India Senior VP- Home Appliances Sanjay Chitkara said: \u201dAs Delhi battles one of its worst pollution seasons yet, suddenly the demand for air purifiers has surged in Delhi NCR\u201d.\n\nThe city\u2019s AQI has crossed hazardous levels, with pollutants that are much smaller than the common PM2.5 particles, making them extremely dangerous and hard to filter out, he said.\n\nKent RO Systems CMD Mahesh Gupta said sales of air purifiers and filters witnessed a significant surge during the winter months in India, coinciding with the deterioration in air quality.\n\nThe alarming levels of pollution, especially in the northern regions, create a sense of urgency among consumers to protect their health, he said\n\n\u201cDuring the festive season, we observe a noticeable increase in sales of about 20- 25 per cent as consumers become more conscious of indoor air quality and their overall well-being,\u201d he said.\n\nXiaomi said amid rising pollution levels, particularly in the North region, there has been a noticeable shift in consumer behaviour, with a growing focus on health and cleaner indoor environments.\n\n\u201cThis has driven a sharp rise in Xiaomi\u2019s air purifier & air purifier filter sales, with numbers climbing over 50 per cent higher than usual in the past month,\u201d said a Xiaomi spokesperson.\n\nAccording to a report from EMR, the India air purifier market size attained a value of Rs 777.75 crore in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.30 per cent between 2024 and 2032, it said.\n\nSome of the makers such as Panasonic and Daikin have either scaled down their presence in the segment or have exited due to below-expectation growth and seasonal sales.\n\nBritish tech firm Dyson, a global market leader in the premium range of air purifiers said, \u201cWith the continued spike in pollution, it\u2019s important for people to take proactive measures to protect their family members from the harmful effects of smog and pollutants. To safeguard themselves from the AQI outside, many restrict their movement and prefer to stay indoors.\u201d\n\nLast month, Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi had criticised air purifier manufacturers for making false claims about their products, and called for increased consumer awareness ahead of winter when air pollution worsens in Delhi due to crop stubble burning in neighbouring states.\n\nHe had expressed concern over misleading marketing tactics adopted by some air purifier companies.",

Industrial-UPS and Solar also enjoyed strong demand momentum during the quarter. However, excess channel inventories for Auto OEMs dampened demand across the Auto OEM space, Exide said.\r\n\nDuring the second quarter, Exide Industries invested \u20b9250 crore as equity in its wholly-owned subsidiary Exide Energy Solutions (EESL). With this, the total equity investment made in EESL to date stood at \u20b92,852.24 crore. \n\nPositive outlook\n\nCommenting on the results, Avik Roy, MD & CEO, said, \u201cIn the first half of the year, we have delivered EBITDA and PBT margin of 11.4 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.

For the near-term, the business outlook is positive and commodity prices have started easing, which is expected to support profitability.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the company scrip ended the day at \u20b9 445.40 apiece on BSE, down 2.92 per cent from the previous close.",

        "text": "Chhattisgarh, known for its rich cultural heritage and abundant natural resources, is embarking on a significant industrial journey. This path opens up new opportunities for the people of the State while marking a crucial step toward realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s vision of a developed and self-sufficient India. Our Industrial Policy 2024-29 aligns with the \u201cAmritkaal: Chhattisgarh Vision@2047\u201d, aiming to transform the State into a self-reliant industrial hub.\n\nLaunched on the State\u2019s foundation day, the new policy introduces special provisions for surrendered Naxals, women, and the third gender community, marking a commitment to inclusivity in development.\r\n\nThis policy is not only designed to accelerate economic growth but also to empower those groups that have often been left behind in the progress stream. By fostering industrial development, we seek to give every citizen a chance to participate in and benefit from economic growth.\r\n\nThe key highlights of the policy include a special package for the economic empowerment of the third gender community, surrendered Naxals, and women, helping them integrate into the mainstream of society. This package aims to provide support and training for these groups to start new journeys toward self-reliance.\r\n\nOne primary objective is to rehabilitate surrendered Naxals, offering new hope and opportunities. A special incentive package provides entrepreneurship training and financial assistance, enabling individuals to leave behind conflict and regain respect through meaningful work and community involvement.\r\n\nNew avenues will be created for the third gender community, offering support and training to build independent futures. With government-backed financial assistance and incentives, individuals from this community can establish their own enterprises, breaking through long-standing social and economic barriers.\r\n\nWomen, who play an essential role in Chhattisgarh\u2019s social and economic life, are a vital focus of this new policy. We have included measures to support women entrepreneurs through investment concessions, tax exemptions, and financial assistance.\r\n\nIn addition, targeted training programmes will equip women with the skills needed for self-employment and business management. This initiative is aimed at empowering women to successfully operate enterprises and achieve economic independence.\r\n\nBalanced growth\r\n\nTo foster entrepreneurship across sectors, the policy also raises the grant subsidy from 18%-20% to 30%-35%, providing a substantial boost to new enterprises and small businesses. Additionally, a special fund of \u20b950 crore has been set aside to support start-ups, helping turn innovative ideas into tangible enterprises.\r\n\nTo streamline processes, we have introduced a simplified \u201cSingle Window System 2.0\u201d, digitising permissions, licences, and registrations across various government departments. This system is designed to make investment processes quicker and easier, attracting significant investments and promoting sustainable growth.\r\n\nIncentives are being extended to small, medium, and large industries, with a focus on strengthening logistics and establishing new industrial zones and clusters. This initiative supports balanced growth and the development of industrial clusters across the State, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for businesses.\r\n\nAnother crucial aspect of the policy is the focus on pollution-free industries, with specific emphasis on manufacturing electric vehicles and environmentally friendly products. This commitment ensures that Chhattisgarh\u2019s growth is not only economically significant but also environmentally sustainable.\r\n\nThrough this new industrial policy, Chhattisgarh is set to emerge as a strong, self-reliant State. As we celebrate the first year of our government, we are moving systematically under Prime Minister Modi\u2019s vision of a developed India, striving toward the ideal of \u201cDeveloped India \u2013 Developed Chhattisgarh\u201d. We are confident that the day is not far when Chhattisgarh will be recognised as a developed State, making substantial contributions to the vision of a prosperous India.\n\n(The Writer is the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh)",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: India's manufacturing sector growth recovered from September's eight-month low to 57.5 in October fuelled by faster increases in total new orders and international sales, a monthly survey said on Monday. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose from September's eight-month low of 56.5 to 57.5 in October, indicating a substantial and accelerated improvement in operating conditions.\n\nIn PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction. \u201cIndia's headline manufacturing PMI picked up substantially in October as the economy's operating conditions continue to broadly improve. Rapidly expanding new orders and international sales reflect strong demand growth for India's manufacturing sector,\u201d Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC, said. The upturn in performance was boosted by stronger demand for Indian goods. Moreover, the introduction of new products and successful marketing initiatives helped enhance sales performance.\n\nNew export orders also exhibited stronger growth, following the weakest uptick in a year-and-a-half during September. Panel members reported gains in new contracts from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the US.\n\nOn the prices front, the October data signalled stronger inflationary pressures across India's manufacturing sector. Goods producers were also more willing to take on additional staff, which coupled with rising material costs, added to business expenses. Both input prices and selling charges increased at stronger rates.\n\n\u201cInput and output prices are both increasing as a result of persistent inflationary pressures in materials, labour and transportation costs,\u201d Bhandari added. On the employment front, not only did manufacturers hire extra staff at the start of the third fiscal quarter, but also to a greater degree than in September. Around one in ten panellists reported an increase in employment, while 1 per cent shed jobs. Going ahead, Indian manufacturers became more optimistic regarding future output volumes.\n\n\u201cTo start the third fiscal quarter, business confidence is also very high due to expectations of continued strong consumer demand, new product releases and sales pending approval,\u201d Bhandari said.\n\nThe HSBC India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.",

It clocked \u20b91,303 crore as profit after tax (PAT), up almost 17 per cent, over the same period last year. \n\nGiving an overview, Vohra said, the company was on track to achieve its margin guidance for the year, \u201cbetween 24.5 %, 25.5%.\u201d The last 12 months, he said, \u201chave been audit heavy with our facilities of Invagen, Kurkumbh, Patalganga, China and Goa audited. All these facilities have cleared with either a VAI (Voluntary Action Indicated) or NAI (No Action Indicated) except for Goa where the classification is still awaited.\u201d Further, on Lanreotide, he added that the company was in the process of resolving its supply issues. \n\nSupply issues \n\nCipla\u2019s generic version of Lanreotide injection is indicated to treat Acromegaly (defined by medical institutions as a rare condition involving too much growth hormone in the body) and Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. In May 2024, Cipla received US regulatory approval for the generic equivalent of this product. Lanreotide is from biopharmaceutical company Ispen, sold as Somatuline Depot. \n\nOn issues involving Lanreotide, Vohra explained, \u201cCurrently, we are facing some supply challenges in Lanreotide, and hence we expect the Q3 Lanreotide franchise sales to be lower than Q2. However, these issues are anticipated to be resolved by the end of Q3, and starting quarter four FY25, we should be able to recover sharply in the Lanreotide franchise. We\u2019re also working to increase the overall capacity of Lanreotide through capex investments made by our partner.\u201d Industry estimates pegged US sales of Somatuline Depot (Lanreotide) at about $ 898 million, for the 12 months upto March 2024.\n\nCipla\u2019s US business posted $237 million in revenues in the quarter, its South Africa region grew 22 per cent, led by the private market and the emerging markets and Europe delivered 18 per cent growth, said Vohra, adding that the focus will be on growing key markets and building flagship brands, among other things.",

Traders forecast that the price could go up further up to Rs.21,000. The area under oil palm cultivation had increased to 12,000 acres in the district, which is second only to Khammam district. Farmers who cultivated the crop in 2021 have started getting their first harvest this year. Many farmers would get their first harvest in December.\r\n\r\nThe farmers in the district have harvested nearly 80 tonnes of the crop so far, which they sent to an oil palm factory in Khammam. However, the farmers of Siddipet can sell their produce in the district by next June. Since the government is building an oil palm factory at Naremtta in Nanganur mandal, the marketing of their produce will become much easier. Officials have already announced that the factory will be opened by next June when a good number of Siddipet farmers will get their harvest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Siddipet Horticulture Officer Suvarna said they had set a target of adding another 4,000 acres this year, of which 800 acres were achieved so far. To encourage the farmers, she said they were offering 80 to 90 per cent subsidy on drip and other agriculture implements besides extending Rs.57,000 through the horticulture department and Rs.47, 000 to MNREGS in a phased manner for four years.\r\n\r\nFarmer Samala Sanjeeva Reddy, who got his first harvest, said they were elated over the price rise. He had cultivated oil palm on 33 acres in a phased manner at Ippalagudem in Markook mandal. Former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao and Minister T Harish Rao had encouraged the farmers to take up oil palm cultivation. The aim was to increase the cultivation to 50,000 acres.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 5 (KNN) The recent earnings reports of large industrial players reveal a notable trend: companies are experiencing a significant reduction in energy costs, driven by a strategic shift towards renewable power sources.\n\nMajor firms like Ambuja Cement, ACC, L&T, JSW Steel, and Hindustan Zinc are reporting reductions in energy bills, a result of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for renewable energy that offer a cheaper alternative to conventional coal-based electricity.\n\nExperts note that these renewable PPAs allow companies to lock in energy prices for up to 25 years, providing cost stability and a lower per-unit cost than the grid-sourced power.\n\nKartikeya Sharma, co-founder of solar energy firm Sunsure, highlights that many industrial giants are now opting for renewable power for up to 75 per cent of their needs through open-access solar, wind, and energy storage, reported mint.\n\nThis shift is particularly prevalent in high-consumption sectors like cement, metals, and mining, where companies benefit from both cost savings and compliance with government-mandated Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs).\n\nRPOs require companies to source a percentage of power from green energy or face penalties, further incentivising the switch.\n\nAmbuja Cement is a prime example, with its power costs per tonne dropping by 27 per cent year-on-year in the July-September quarter. The company attributes these savings to a growing focus on green energy, which now accounts for nearly 25 per cent of its power mix.\n\nSimilarly, ACC, a subsidiary of Ambuja Cement, reported a 23 per cent reduction in power expenses through increased use of waste-heat recovery systems (WHRS), solar, and wind power.\n\nHindustan Zinc, another prominent player, has doubled its renewable energy share to 14 per cent over the past quarter. The company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Modi, underscored the impact, noting that the shift to renewables reduced energy costs by USD 9 per tonne.\n\nJSW Steel, another heavyweight, has also made strides, securing 375 MW of renewable energy, with plans to expand this capacity to 2.5 GW by FY27.\n\nThe price advantage of renewables is stark. For instance, a solar-wind hybrid project can deliver power at around Rs 5.50-5.75 per unit, compared to grid prices of Rs 8.90-9.50 per unit, offering savings of nearly 40 per cent. This cost difference is particularly compelling for industries with high energy demands.\n\nThe move away from grid power reflects a broader trend among commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers, who are increasingly sourcing power directly from renewable energy producers.\n\nThis transition marks a significant step in India\u2019s journey toward a sustainable energy future, with corporations leading the charge in reducing carbon footprints while bolstering financial efficiency.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

The company had reported a consolidated net profit of \u20b9916 crore in the year ago period.\n\nThe total income was up by 26 per cent to \u20b913,660 crore in Q2FY25 as compared to \u20b910.837 crore in Q2FY24.\n\n\u201cAfter a muted Q1, Q2 witnessed encouraging growth across key businesses. Jewellery clocked healthy double-digit growth for the quarter. Our portfolio approach in this business of straddling diverse customer needs through the brands of Tanishq, Mia, Zoya and CaratLane is working well,\u201d said C K Venkataraman, Managing Director.\n\nHe said that the buyer growth metrics were strong and in good double-digits across gold and studded product categories. \r\n\nCustom duty reduction\n\nThe profit before tax was lower by 24 per cent at \u20b9948 crores compared to \u20b91,252 crore in Q2FY24 mainly due to impact of custom duty reduction. \n\n\u201cOn account of the customs duty related losses, as well as the need to invest in growth of various businesses, the profitability of Q2 was quite depressed. However, we are quite confident about the competitiveness of each of our businesses and we remain optimistic about our performance for rest of the financial year,\u201d he added.\r\n\nThe jewellery divison saw its total income for the quarter growing 26 per cent to \u20b9 10,763 crore.

The ensuing gold rush lasted well into mid-September. Buyer growth was healthy and well accompanied by increase in average selling prices, both exhibiting double-digit growths,\u201d said Titan in its regulatory filing.\r\n\nThe watches and wearables division total income grew by 19 per cent to \u20b91,301 crores. The Analog segment recorded a strong 26% revenue growth led by Titan brand clocking 32 per cent growth in the same period.\n\nThe premium segment with Helios channel (international brand sales) clocked a growth of 43per cent, while the wearables segment saw a 13 per cent drop in their revenue primarily due to reduction in average selling prices.\n\nThe eyecare business grew 7 per cent while the emerging businesses comprising Indian dress wear fragrances, fashion accessories recorded a total income of \u20b9 106 crore for Q2FY25. The emerging businesses together recorded a loss of Rs 29 crores for the quarter.\n\nThe International Jewellery business recorded an income growth of 62 per cent to \u20b9 273 crores.

        "title": "Empower seniors digitally",
        "text": "Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the expanded Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana to cover 60 million eligible senior citizens, allocating \u20b912,850 crore for the initiative. But to access the benefits, and utilise the other benefits of digital public infrastructure, senior citizens will require the requisite skills to use technology. Digital inclusion is crucial to ensure that elderly citizens can navigate the digital processes associated not only with this scheme but also to enjoy the other benefits of the digital world.\n\nThe internet has transformed how the older generation participates in society, whether it is in talking to their children, buying medicines, or improving their general physical and mental well-being. Despite the potential benefits, a substantial \u2018digital divide\u2019 persists among older adults. There are many factors that contribute to this.\n\nWhy the digital divide\n\nFirst, there is limited financial resources to procure digital devices and internet plans and unequal access to technology, particularly in rural areas or low income communities. Second, is the lack of digital literacy and skills. Navigating the complex interfaces with both IT software and hardware can be challenging for older generations.\n\nThird, there are physical and cognitive limitations faced by most people in the older generation, including declining eyesight, hearing and other age-related cognitive decline that has impacted the ability to learn new skills and remember complex instructions.\n\nAnd lastly, there is excessive fear contributed by rising online scams and cyber threats which can deter the older generation from using digital tools. Recent reports show cyber criminals deploying increasingly sophisticated technology and deceptive methods to frequently target older people causing them significant financial and emotional distress.\n\nIndia is experiencing a significant demographic shift, with a growing proportion of its population entering the 60+ age bracket. An Agewell Foundation Survey has found that approximately 85.8 per cent respondents were found to be digitally and computer illiterate and, of this, 76.5 per cent were elderly men and 95 per cent, elderly women. This trend underscores the urgent need for digital inclusion among older adults.\n\nIndia\u2019s goal of a $1 trillion digital economy by 2028 necessitates a comprehensive approach to digital inclusion. To ensure a smart ageing population, there\u2019s need for a comprehensive plan to help the older generation navigate the digital world confidently and participate fully in society. Firstly, designing ICTs (information and communications technologies) with accessibility and universal design principles in mind that can cater to diverse needs of the older generation. High-speed, affordable internet can transform the lives of all persons, including the elderly as this would provide access to online services like telemedicine, e-learning, digital payments, etc.\n\nInitiatives like PM-WANI can play a vital role in expanding internet connectivity and bridge the digital divide \u2014 for instance, even booking a cab or even making a call would be easier with public Wi-Fi facilities. During Covid-19 and beyond, there were a few NGOs that organised specific workshops and \u2018Digital Literacy Classes\u2019 for the older generation.\n\nLastly, there is a clear need for more targeted policies and programmes for digital inclusivity amongst older citizens. While Digital India Mission, National Digital Literacy Mission and other State government initiatives for digital literacy are there, it is essential to have a dedicated policy at the Central level focusing on digital literacy amongst the elderly.\n\nAt this juncture, policymakers, industry and civil society organisations should focus on leveraging ICTs to empower senior citizens.\n\nThe writer is President, Broadband India Forum.

        "text": "With over 24 years of experience, Mahadu Vinayak Kurkute is a results-driven IT Service Management professional whose expertise and visionary approach have placed him at the forefront of IT operations. As a certified ITIL expert and a gold-medalist in engineering, Mahadu has led pivotal projects, consistently enhancing service delivery, optimizing IT infrastructure, and driving operational excellence on a global scale. Currently serving as Director of IT Service Management, Mahadu has pioneered an ITSM program that aligns IT services with business goals. His initiatives have transformed a traditionally process-focused IT department into a user-centric, value-driven function. By forging close partnerships with technology teams and business stakeholders, Mahadu ensures that IT policies, standards, and frameworks meet ITIL standards, enhance productivity, and reduce risk. His holistic approach has fostered continual improvement through regular reviews, trend analysis, and metrics reporting, ensuring IT services remain efficient and reliable. Among Mahadu's impactful projects is his work on automating security patch management for over 4,000 servers worldwide. Previously a manual process, patch management now operates on a structured cycle, reducing cyber risk and ensuring compliance. By helping in designing a formal patch management policy and best practices, Mahadu has empowered IT teams to proactively address zero-day vulnerabilities. His proactive reporting to executive leadership provides visibility into ongoing risks, facilitating informed decision-making. In his drive to enhance service delivery, Mahadu spearheaded the development of a robust IT Service Catalog, redesigning over 100 service catalogs for 35,000+ business users globally. This streamlined, user-friendly interface improved productivity and user satisfaction. His leadership involved collaboration with key stakeholders to identify gaps and provide a more accessible solution. With a strategic change management plan, he ensured users were well-equipped to leverage the catalog's features, driving adoption and engagement. In August 2022, Mahadu led a major overhaul of the company's major incident management process, reducing service restoration time by 30%. By analysing and optimizing workflows, he introduced improvements that minimize disruptions to business operations. His restructured approach to incident reporting, combined with timely updates to stakeholders, has created a more responsive IT support system that reduces downtime. In 2023, Mahadu's expertise in risk management led to the implementation of an Integrated Risk Management solution using ServiceNow, enabling real-time visibility into high-risk areas and non-compliant controls. This initiative allowed the company to automate risk workflows, manage policy lifecycles, and continuously monitor for compliance, strengthening the organization's risk framework. One of Mahadu's key achievements has been the establishment of a Configuration and Asset Management Database for over 40,000 assets. Previously, the company had limited visibility into its asset inventory. Mahadu's solution provided a \"single source of truth\" for data-driven decisions on asset upgrades, with a data accuracy rate exceeding 98%. This database has streamlined ITSM processes and empowered the organization to manage resources proactively. Mahadu successfully transitioned IT Service Management from a staff-augmentation model to a managed service approach, resulting in significant cost savings and operational efficiencies. This effort earned him the prestigious IT Excellence Award, recognizing his role in defining service levels, monitoring critical processes, and establishing robust support structures that enable the organization to focus on core objectives. Mahadu's career is distinguished by his leadership qualities of accountability, integrity, and vision. His proactive approach to managing incidents and strategic planning has made him a trusted leader. Recognized with awards such as the IT Excellence Award, his work exemplifies the impact of a forward-thinking IT professional dedicated to innovation. As Mahadu continues to drive transformation, his legacy is marked by a commitment to excellence and a vision for a user-driven IT service organization. His work in building resilient systems has safeguarded operations and set new benchmarks for IT service management. With extensive experience and a record of impactful leadership, Mahadu Kurkute is shaping the future of IT service management, ensuring technology serves as a foundation for growth and success.",

        "text": "Lead Image Suggestion:** An image of a Swiggy delivery rider on a motorbike, set against an urban backdrop, conveying the energy and scale of Swiggy\u2019s operations in India.\n\n### **Swiggy\u2019s Growth Story and IPO Prospects**\n\nSwiggy, established in 2014, has evolved from a food delivery startup to a multi-service platform additionally offering grocery delivery, meal planning, and cloud kitchens. Swiggy\u2019s IPO is anticipated to attract the attention of investors keen on India\u2019s tech-driven consumer market.\n\nSwiggy\u2019s IPO opened today, November 6, for bidding by investors and is set to close on November 8. It comprises both a fresh issue and an offer for sale. Swiggy plans to raise \u20b94,499 crore through fresh issue of equity shares, with the IPO listing on the BSE and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The remaining \u20b911,327 crore of the total offer will comprise offer for sale of existing shares. Swiggy\u2019s corporate and individual selling shareholders include prominent venture capital players such as Accel India IV and Tencent Cloud Europe.\n\nObjectives of the Swiggy IPO\n\nSwiggy\u2019s primary goal with this IPO is to strengthen its logistics and expand its food delivery network to meet rising demand. The funds raised will support infrastructural advancements like cloud kitchens and last-mile delivery solutions. Swiggy is also exploring tech-driven innovations such as AI-powered restaurant recommendations and customer personalisation.\n\nDiversification and Service Scaling\n\nSwiggy\u2019s foray into quick grocery deliveries and its subscription-based service, Swiggy One, are expected to be scaled further with the aid of IPO funds. The company aims to deepen its footprint in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and improve offerings, especially through its cloud kitchen services and Instamart grocery delivery.\n\nInvestment Risks and Market Competition\n\nMarket competition in food-tech and e-commerce is an evident risk that consumer tech firms face. Despite Swiggy\u2019s dominant position, the food delivery market is intensely competitive, with key rivals like Zomato (with its established brand and its own success with its IPO), as well as other rising regional players, could present a challenge for Swiggy.\n\nGetitng to profitability is generally a challenge in sectors with a high cash-burn. Swiggy\u2019s financials, like those of many high-growth tech companies, reflect significant investments in customer acquisition and delivery subsidies, leading to high cash-burn rates. Prospective investors should consider the path to profitability and how Swiggy intends to address operational costs while scaling up. The company\u2019s consolidated revenue growth has been impressive; however, investors may view continued cash burn with caution, emphasising the need for efficient spending and a focus on unit economics.\n\nThe other risk that Swiggy\u2019s prospectus filed with the SEBI showed has to do with the the digital payment and delivery infrastructure in the country. Any regulatory shifts in online payments or data privacy laws could impact its operations. The company\u2019s payment mechanisms and user data handling may be affected by regulatory updates, creating a potential risk factor.\n\nInvestor sentiment and market expectations are other risks that the company flags. The Indian IPO market has seen robust investor interest in tech and e-commerce listings, and Swiggy\u2019s IPO aligns with this trend. The recent positive performance of IPOs in the consumer tech sector may fuel investor optimism for Swiggy\u2019s listing. Swiggy\u2019s strong brand recall, loyal customer base, and experienced management team further add to its IPO appeal.\n\nInvestor sentiment will likely hinge on Swiggy\u2019s future growth strategies, particularly its approach to scaling up in a cost-effective manner. With consumer demand shifting online, Swiggy\u2019s role in India\u2019s digital ecosystem is expected to grow, drawing investor confidence. However, maintaining a balance between growth and profitability will be crucial for Swiggy\u2019s long-term success in the public market.\n\n(This article was generated using AI and reviewed by a journalist)",

As of the opening bell, the BSE Sensex had surged by 283 points, or 0.36%, to 79,759, while the Nifty 50 stood at 24,271, up 57 points, or 0.24%.\n\nGlobal markets were closely monitoring early election results from the U.S., particularly trends showing Donald Trump leading the race. This was contributing to a cautious but optimistic mood across major stock markets worldwide.\n\nStock Movements and Sectoral Trends\n\nOn the Sensex, more than half of the stocks were in the red at the open, with Titan leading the losses, down 3.27%, followed by Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Hindustan Unilever, and Tata Motors. On the other hand, stocks such as HCLTech, ICICI Bank, Infosys, Bajaj Finance, and Bajaj Finserv helped offset the declines, pushing the index higher.\n\nThe Nifty 50 saw a similar trend, with 27 of its 50 stocks in the red. Titan again led the losses, dropping 3.46%, while Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Hindalco, and SBI Life also posted losses. However, stocks like Apollo Hospitals, Dr. Reddy\u2019s, HCLTech, Infosys, and ICICI Bank were among the gainers, lifting the index.\n\nAmong sectoral indices, the Metal index saw a decline of 1%, while the Consumer Durables index was down 0.18%.

The Nifty 50 ended above 24,200 at 24,213, up 218 points, or 0.91%. Analysts attributed this rebound to a technical bounce, short-covering, and hopes for a demand revival in the second half of FY25.\n\nIn the broader markets, both the BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap indices rose by 0.4%. Sectorally, the Nifty Metal index saw the largest gain, rising nearly 3%, followed by the Nifty Private Bank and Bank indices, which were up by 2%. Meanwhile, the Nifty FMCG and IT indices ended lower.\n\nFocus on the BFSI Summit\n\nToday\u2019s trading activity is likely to be influenced by the Business Standard BFSI Summit, which kicks off today. Key speakers at the event include RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, IRDAI Chairperson Debasish Panda, CEA V Anantha Nageswaran, and Sebi whole-time member Ananth Narayan G. Market participants will closely watch for any policy-related announcements or insights from the summit.\n\nGlobal Market Performance\n\nAcross the Asia-Pacific region, most markets were higher on Wednesday following a surge on Wall Street overnight, driven by anticipation ahead of U.S. election results. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose by 1.3%, while the Topix added 1.1%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi was up 0.2%, and the Kosdaq gained 0.55%. However, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell 1.3%, and mainland China\u2019s CSI 300 was down 0.33%, though the Shanghai Composite gained 0.36%.\n\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 also saw a rise of 0.8%. Investors were particularly focused on news from the Bank of Japan, which released its September monetary policy meeting minutes, showing broad agreement on continuing rate hikes as long as certain economic targets are met.\n\nU.S. Election and Market Reactions\n\nU.S. stock futures and the dollar strengthened on Wednesday as early results from the U.S. presidential election suggested a tight race. Republican Donald Trump won in Indiana and Kentucky, while Democrat Kamala Harris captured Vermont. Investors were waiting for further results to gauge the likely outcome. Treasury yields climbed, with 10-year yields reaching 4.34%, up from 4.28%, approaching a four-month high.\n\nS&P 500 futures rose 0.5%, Nasdaq futures added 0.2%, and European markets were also in positive territory, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures up 0.2% and DAX futures gaining 0.4%. The dollar index climbed 0.6% to 103.98.\n\nOil and Commodity Markets\n\nIn the commodities space, oil prices dipped slightly as markets remained cautious ahead of the U.S. election results.

        "text": "Following the path taken by manufacturing, the services sector also signalled strong growth in October, private survey results released on Wednesday showed. The results, better known as Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), rose to 58.5 in October, as against 57.7 in September, which was a 10-month low. At the same time job creation was the quickest in 26 months.\n\nEarlier, with a pick-up in festival demand, Manufacturing PMI rose to 57.5 in October, as against an eight-month low of 56.5 in September. Services has an over 53 per cent share in Gross Value Added (GVA), while manufacturing contributes nearly 15 per cent. This means over two-thirds of the economy is doing well and this should reflect in the GDP (Gross Domestic Products) number in the October-December quarter (Q3) of Fiscal Year 2024-25, whose date will be made public February next year.\n\nIn more good news, job creation in both the sectors was good. Indices for both the sectors is created on the basis of the response from purchasing managers of 400 companies each. An index of 50 reflects expansion, while a figure below 50 means contraction.\n\nTalking about services PMI, Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC, said: \u201cDuring October, the Indian services sector experienced strong expansion in output and consumer demand, as well as job creation, which achieved a 26-month high.\u201d The report accompanying PMI highlighted that October saw a marked expansion in services employment, one that was the quickest for 26 months. Around 13 per cent of panellists reported job creation, compared to 9 per cent in September. Anecdotal evidence showed that a sustained improvement in new business has induced firms to hire full- and\n\n\u201cAlthough input price inflation is accelerating from higher food and wage costs, the general inflation trajectory remains below the long-run average. Underlying data indicated that capacity pressures also boosted job creation,\u201d the report said.\n\nTalking about price pressure in the services sector, the report said input price inflation accelerated to a three-month high in October, with services companies mainly reporting greater food and wage costs. The overall rate of inflation remained below its long-run average, however. Out of the four monitored sub-sectors, cost pressures were highest in Consumer Services. Companies shared part of their additional cost burdens with clients by continuing to lift selling prices. The rate of charge inflation picked up to the strongest since July and outpaced the series trend. The Finance and Insurance segment again registered the strongest upturn.\n\n\u201cAlthough input price inflation is accelerating from higher food and wage costs, the general inflation trajectory remains below the long-run average,\u201d Bhandari said.\n\nOn sentiment, the report mentioned that it remained positive in October, despite receding a little from September. Exactly one-quarter of the survey panel forecast higher output volumes over the coming year, linked to healthy demand trends, marketing efforts and new client enquiries. At the same time, 74 per cent of firms foresee no change in business activity from present levels. \u201cFuture activity index still indicates broadly positive expectations for the year ahead,\u201d Bhandari concluded.",

        "text": "Vijayapura: A new 10.8-km pipeline costing Rs 52 crore will soon replace the existing, damaged pipeline supplying drinking water from the Alamatti dam backwaters to Vijayapura city. Vijayapura district in-charge minister, M.B. Patil, announced this following a progress review meeting with officials on Wednesday. The meeting held in Bengaluru was attended virtually by the Vijayapura deputy commissioner and Zilla panchayat CEO and focused on drinking water projects for Vijayapura city and several district taluks. The city currently receives water from Kolhara, situated 43 km away, but a 10.8 km segment of the supply pipeline has been damaged over the years, causing significant water leakage. Despite prior attempts to address this issue, a comprehensive solution has not been implemented until now. \u201cInitially estimated at Rs 32 crore, the project\u2019s cost was revised to Rs 52 crore due to delay. The revised estimate has now received approval from the finance department,\u201d Patil said. In addition, as part of the third phase of the Vijayapura city drinking water supply project, a jack well needs to be constructed near Rambhapuri in the Alamatti backwaters. This will have a water purification capacity of 111 million litres. An amount of Rs 1.36 crore will be allocated to prepare the detailed project report for this unit. He instructed officials to commence the work immediately. Meanwhile, there are plans to increase the daily drinking water supply for residents of Babaleshwara and Tikota towns in Vijayapura district, which were recently elevated to town panchayats, from the current 55 LPCD (litres per capita per day) to 135 LPCD. The minister directed officials to coordinate with the Urban Water Supply and Sewage Board for this initiative. In the Vijayapura district, Amrit 2.0 project works are at various stages in Chadachan, Alamel, Muddebihal, Nalatwad, Sindagi, and Talikote. Additionally, tenders have been invited for the construction of water supply networks in Muddebihal (Rs 17.45 crore), Sindagi (Rs 26.53 crore), and Basavana Bagewadi (Rs 14.58 crore) towns, and these will soon be finalised.",

        "text": "The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved an infusion of equity to the tune of Rs 10,700 crore in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for working capital in the financial year 2024-25. \"The decision is aimed at bolstering the agricultural sector and ensuring the welfare of farmers nationwide. This strategic move shows the government's steadfast commitment to supporting farmers and fortifying India's agrarian economy,\" a cabinet communique said. The FCI started its journey in 1964 with an authorised capital of Rs 100 crore and equity of Rs 4 crore. The operations of the FCI increased manifold resulting in the increase of authorised capital from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 21,000 crore in February 2023. The equity of FCI was Rs 4,496 crores in the financial year 2019-20 which increased to Rs 10,157 crore in the financial year 2023-24. Now, the government has approved a significant amount of equity of Rs 10,700 crore for FCI which will strengthen it financially and will give a big boost to the initiatives taken for its transformation, the statement said. The FCI plays a pivotal role in ensuring food security by procurement of food grains at minimum support price (MSP), maintenance of strategic food grain stocks, distribution of food grains for welfare measures, and stabilisation of food grain prices in the market. The infusion of equity is a significant step towards enhancing the operational capabilities of the FCI in fulfilling its mandate effectively. FCI resorts to short-term borrowings to match the gap of fund requirements. This infusion will help to lower the interest burden and will ultimately reduce the subsidy of the government. The government's dual commitment to MSP-based procurement and investment in FCI's operational capabilities signifies a collaborative effort towards empowering farmers, fortifying the agricultural sector, and ensuring food security for the nation, the statement added.

        "text": "As the country focuses on achieving its net zero 2070 goals, it is keeping a strong focus on the energy sector and increasing efforts around green real estate. This provides opportunities for manufacturers of household appliances and electrical products to introduce energy efficient devices. This is where Group Legrand India wants to tap on. In a conversation with ET Digital, Tony Berland, MD & CEO, Group Legrand India, talks about how energy-efficient home appliances are paving the way for sustainability in real estate. Edited excerpts:Economic Times (ET): How do you see India\u2019s real estate sector adapting to sustainability? What needs to be done to push this?Tony Berland (TB): Sustainability in the Indian real estate market is gaining momentum, as seen in the growing adoption of green building certifications and energy-efficient trends. One notable example is the increasing popularity of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings, which place a strong emphasis on energy efficiency and reducing operational costs. However, the sector still has significant ground to cover to fully embrace sustainable practices. For instance, the use of sustainable construction materials and energy-efficient electrical installations can reduce energy consumption by up to 30%. We are already addressing this shift by offering smart lighting solutions and energy-saving electrical products for both commercial and residential buildings. By implementing intelligent energy management systems, real estate developers can cut electricity costs by as much as 20%, making sustainability not only environmentally beneficial but also economically profitable.Our environment commitment includes providing our customers with eco-designed products and services that enable them to reduce their energy consumption. For each product family, we draw up an EPD (environmental product declaration) or PEP (product environmental profile) \u2014 a declaration that is like an environment photograph of the product. It is based on the ISO 14025 international standard and a multi-criteria life cycle analysis. It is a recognised and reliable programme with international scopePEP is a significant contributor to the group\u2019s green building policy. Informing users about the environmental impact of the products they use is our top priority.ET: As a company that manufactures electrical products for homes and buildings. Is Legrand India also working on building products which will help in energy efficiency?TB: Yes, one notable advancement is our smart lighting systems, which reduce energy consumption by 30-40% through automation and daylight sensors. These systems adapt to natural light levels and optimise usage, making them highly efficient.Our building management systems (BMS) are deployed in numerous high-rise offices to manage lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and other electrical loads based on real-time temperature conditions. These systems enable up to 20% savings in energy costs, making them an essential solution for modern infrastructure. We are also proud of our energy-efficient designs for switches and sockets, which help households reduce electricity consumption. Additionally, our smart meters have revolutionised energy management, allowing users to monitor and track their real-time energy usage, empowering them to make informed decisions about consumption.ET: How has Legrand India adopted sustainability in its supply chain and manufacturing?TB: With respect to supply chain, from route optimisation to load capacity enhancement and deploying EV/CNG vehicles, our supply chain team is committed to reducing carbon footprint. And, through such various best practices, we have reduced approximately 20% CO2 emission in our downstream transportation since 2021. We also work with our suppliers, sensitising, training and supporting them to commit to our sustainability goals.Our purchase team works closely to identify suppliers who share our commitment to develop a circular economy, and work with recyclers with EPR certification, ensuring right recycling procedures.We have implemented efficient practices at all our manufacturing sites, cutting down our waste generation by 500 tonnes with 99% recovery rate. Through our water conservation efforts, we have recycled 5,600 KL of water through after treatment use. Our commitment to sustainability extends to packaging as well, with 93% of our packaging being eco-friendly. There has been a 10% reduction in the weight of our products over the last few months. We are actively eliminating single-use plastics from our packaging and incorporating sustainable packaging. To further reduce our environmental footprint, we regularly conduct energy audits across all our sites. These audits have resulted in reducing energy costs by more than 25% compared with 2021. Our inhouse innovative digital platform for environmental data reporting empowers us to track specific environmental parameters like energy usage, waste management, water management and emissions with great precision. ET: What are the sustainability targets and goals of Legrand India?TB: We aim to reduce CO2 emissions across our supply chain by 30% by 2030. We have set a target to source 70% of our energy from renewable sources by 2024 and to achieve 85% by 2027. In line with our commitment to social responsibility, we have facilitated 500 KW of renewable energy at 20 institutions through various community projects, actively involving local populations in the transition to sustainable energy.",

        "text": "Gurugram has strongly established itself as an epicenter of luxury real estate in India. Over the years, the city has transformed into a modern metropolis, with expansive high-rise developments, gated communities, and futuristic townships that cater to those seeking a sophisticated lifestyle. These developments come with state-of-the-art amenities, making Gurugram an attractive destination for HNIs and affluent homebuyers.\nAs per JLL\u2019s report, in the first half of 2024, Delhi-NCR showcased a notable 64 per cent share of luxury residential launches among the top seven cities in India. Gurugram has excelled as the leading performer in the luxury real estate segment, with 88 per cent of all launches concentrated in the Dwarka Expressway and Southern Peripheral Road regions. This substantial growth indicates a rising demand for upscale residences in these specific areas. In addition, this impressive performance can also be attributed to factors such as rising disposable income, a growing aspiration for a luxurious lifestyle, and the continuous development of infrastructure in the region.\nSalil Kumar, director (marketing and business management) of CRC Group, said, \u201cWith the well-planned and improved infrastructure, the Delhi-NCR region is rapidly urbanising. New roads and improved public transport make it easier to live in and around the city. As areas become more accessible, the demand for luxury homes in well-connected locations rises. Places like Gurugram and Noida have emerged as favoured destinations for luxury real estate due to their modern infrastructure and amenities.\u201d\nNotably, millennials now account for 54 per cent of home purchases, reflecting their growing influence in the real estate market. Additionally, high-net-worth buyers are driving demand for properties that not only offer luxury but also promise returns on investment, he added.\nGurpal Singh Chawla, managing director of TREVOC, said, \u201cThe future of high-end living in Gurugram is being shaped by a new breed of luxury homebuyers digitally savvy, aspirational, and keen on living in spaces that reflect both status and innovation. Today\u2019s affluent buyers are not just looking for larger homes; they want residences that embody cutting-edge design, sustainability, and a seamless blend of technology and comfort. At TREVOC, we are focused on creating future-ready luxury homes that cater to this growing demand for personalised experiences while also ensuring long-term value and investment returns.\u201d\nMoreover, the report highlights how Gurugram led the market with a 55% share of the new launches, with 88 per cent of them focused on the Dwarka Expressway and Southern Peripheral Road regions. One of the key factors driving this change is the growing awareness of sustainability. Evolving buyer preferences toward eco-friendly and technologically advanced homes are reshaping the luxury real estate landscape.\nThe desire for a premium lifestyle is also evident in the demand for homes with exclusive amenities that elevate the living experience. These elements reflect the trend toward bespoke interiors and carefully curated designs that cater to individual tastes and preferences.\nRaheja Developers\u2019 Nayan Raheja said, \u201cThe city\u2019s real estate has become synonymous with innovation and exclusivity. As the demand for premium residences continues to rise, we foresee a greater emphasis on craftsmanship, smart integration, and strategic locations. Our projects not only offer premium amenities but also maximize future growth potential, making them the ideal investment for discerning buyers.\u201d\nSaurab Saharan, group managing director of HCBS Developments, said, \u201cGurugram\u2019s luxury real estate market is evolving, with buyers seeking more than just spacious homes. As the city\u2019s realty market expands, developers meticulously craft projects that boast world-class amenities that cater to the desires of today\u2019s sophisticated buyers. Therefore, we see a future where high-end finishes, exclusive facilities, and thoughtful layouts will be key to the luxury market.\u201d\nThus, Gurugram\u2019s luxury real estate market is poised for even greater heights as it continues to attract affluent buyers and investors. With its impressive growth trajectory, driven by robust infrastructure, strategic location, and cutting-edge developments, the city has solidified its position as the leading destination for luxury living in the NCR.",

However, there are few exemptions and deductions under the new tax regime. Besides, all other allowances in his paycheque, including conveyance allowance and meal coupons, are fully taxable. 114867252However, Ravi can still avail of the tax deduction for NPS contributions under the new regime. Under Section 80CCD(2), up to 10% of the employee\u2019s basic salary put in the pension scheme is tax-free. This limit is higher at 14% of the basic pay under the new tax regime. Ravi should opt for the NPS benefit offered by his company. If his company puts Rs.14,318 (14% of his basic salary) in the NPS on his behalf every month, his annual tax will reduce by about Rs.53,600. However, contributions to the NPS will reduce his monthly take-home salary by about Rs.9,850. 114867253Ravi should also avoid investing in fixed deposits, where the interest earned is taxed at the slab rate every year. If he shifts to debt funds, the gains will be taxed at the same rate but only at the time of withdrawal. If he goes for arbitrage schemes and holds for more than a year, gains of up to Rs.1.25 lakh will be tax-free in a year.WRITE TO US FOR HELPPaying too much tax?

        "title": "Sensex Crashes 1,400 Points, Investor Wealth Worth Rs 8 Lakh Cr Wiped Out; Why Is Market Falling?",
        "text": "Indian benchmarks\u2014the 30-stock Sensex and the Nifty 50\u2014fell around a percent each in opening trade on November 4, kicking off an action-packed week marked by the US Presidential election and the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy meeting on a weak note.\nThe BSE Sensex plunged 1,409 points, or 1.77 per cent, to 78,316, while the Nifty50 declined 454 points, or 1.87 per cent, to 23,850 at around 10:58 am.\nThe market capitalisation of all listed companies on BSE declined by Rs 8.44 lakh crore to Rs 439.66 lakh crore.\nReliance Industries, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Sun Pharma were the top laggards on the Sensex, contributing a decline of 420 points. L&T, Axis Bank, TCS, and Tata Motors also weighed down the index.\nWhy Is the Market Falling Today?\nUS Elections\nThe uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election on November 5 has contributed to a cautious sentiment in the Indian market today. With Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump in a close contest, investors are wary of the potential economic implications.\nAnalysts suggest that the outcome could lead to varying policy approaches affecting the Indian economy. A victory for Harris may prompt a more accommodative stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, potentially leading the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ease domestic rates, which would benefit non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).\nConversely, a Trump win could keep U.S. interest rates elevated, prompting the RBI to maintain higher rates and delaying any rate cuts, favoring public sector banks (PSBs) instead. This uncertainty is causing investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach, impacting market performance.\n\u201cIn the next couple of days markets globally will be focused on the US presidential elections and there can be near-term volatility in response to the election outcome. However, this is likely to be short-lived and economic fundamentals like US growth, inflation and the Fed action will influence the market trend,\u201d said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\nUS Fed Outcome\nThe major event on the radar this week is the US Presidential election on November 5, followed by the Fed\u2019s monetary policy outcome on November 7. While the US central bank is widely expected to deliver another rate cut\u2014a quarter-percentage point this time around\u2014the results of the US Presidential election have kept investors on edge. Touted as one of the most closely contested elections in US history, the outcome is expected to play a decisive role in shaping policies in the world\u2019s largest economy and impacting global markets.\n\u201cA double dose of potentially market-moving events arrives in the coming week as Americans vote on their next president and the Federal Reserve offers more insight on the path of interest rates at its monetary policy meeting,\u201d said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.\nWeak Q2 Earnings\nInvestor sentiment has been dampened by disappointing Q2 earnings from Indian corporates, contributing to a decline in the equity market and prompting FIIs to offload Indian stocks.\n\u201cThe Indian market is facing headwinds from decelerating earnings growth. Nifty EPS growth as indicated by Q2 results may dip below 10% in FY25 which will render the present valuations of about 24 times estimated FY25 earnings, difficult to sustain. FIIs may continue to sell in this difficult earnings growth environment, constraining any rally in the market,\u201d said Vijayakumar.\nOil On The Rise\nIn the midst of that, oil prices ticked nearly 2 percent higher, gaining over $1 per barrel after OPEC+ stated it would delay a planned December output hike by one month due to soft demand and rising supply outside the group.\nNifty Technicals\nOn the technical front, Palka Arora Chopra, director of Master Capital Services, sees key resistance for the Nifty 50 at 24,500. A breakout above this level could potentially trigger a rally towards 24,800.\nConversely, Arora suggests that if the Nifty breaks below 24,100, it could experience further selling pressure, possibly testing the 23,800 level. \u201cThe market remains under pressure, suggesting a cautious stance. The strategy remains to sell on any rise until a decisive breakout above resistance confirms a bullish reversal,\u201d Arora recommended.\nThe market\u2019s uneasiness was also reflected in a more than 5 percent spike in the \u2018fear gauge\u2019 India VIX, which hovered above the 16-point mark.",

        "text": "The Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn on November 4, with the Sensex crashing by 1300 points and the Nifty hitting a four-month low. This drastic fall was primarily driven by heavy selling in the auto, metal, realty, and energy stocks. By mid-session, the BSE Sensex was trading at 78,609, marking a decrease of 1,317 points or 1.65 per cent. Concurrently, the NSE Niftywas trading at 23,862.55, down by 441.80 points or 1.82 per cent. This downward trend was reflected across almost all sectoral indices, with auto, IT, PSU Bank, financial services, pharma, MMCG, metal, realty, media, private bank, infra, and commodities sectors being the major losers. In the Sensex pack, shares of all companies, with the exception of M&M and Tech Mahindra, were trading in the red. Sun Pharma, Reliance, NTPC, Tata Motors, Power Grid, and Tata Steel were among the top losers. Historical Market Volatility This widespread decline in the market was also reflected in the afternoon trade, with the Nifty Bank, Nifty Midcap 100 index, and the Nifty Small Cap 100 index all experiencing significant falls. The market trend remained negative, with 1,062 shares trading in green on the BSE, while 2,856 shares were trading in red. There was no change in 131 shares. However, this is not the first time the Indian stock market has experienced such volatility. In fact, the market has shown resilience and the ability to bounce back from such downturns in the past. For instance, on January 8, 2022, the indices soared with the Sensex ending above 58,000 and the Nifty topping 17,300. This rally was led by the auto and banking sectors, with M&M and Tata Motors gaining more than 6%, while Sun Pharma lost 2.5%. Global Factors and Market Trends Similarly, on June 5, 2022, the Sensex ended over 800 points lower, and the Nifty was near 16,400, with metals and realty being the worst hit. This slump was in line with global peers, as Asian and European equities tumbled following a rout on Wall Street. The cause of this downturn was worries that aggressive rate hikes by central banks to check inflation could hurt global growth. These historical events highlight the inherent volatility of the stock market, which is influenced by a multitude of factors, including global events, economic indicators, and investor sentiment. Market experts have suggested that the global market's focus will be on the US presidential elections in the coming days, and instability may persist for some time regarding the election results.",

Efficient working capital management, along with current profitability levels, enabled the company to maintain its track record of generating positive cash flows, it said, adding the balance sheet remained comfortable with zero debt and high net worth.\n\nMarket demand\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the two-wheeler and four-wheeler replacement markets experienced robust demand, leading to double-digit revenue growth. Industrial-UPS and Solar also enjoyed strong demand momentum during the quarter. However, excess channel inventories for Auto OEMs dampened demand across the Auto OEM space, Exide said.\r\n\nDuring the second quarter, Exide Industries invested \u20b9250 crore as equity in its wholly-owned subsidiary Exide Energy Solutions (EESL). With this, the total equity investment made in EESL to date stood at \u20b92,852.24 crore. \n\nPositive outlook\n\nCommenting on the results, Avik Roy, MD & CEO, said, \u201cIn the first half of the year, we have delivered EBITDA and PBT margin of 11.4 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. Efficient procurement, coupled with cost optimisation initiatives has led to stability in operating performance, despite high commodity prices. For the near-term, the business outlook is positive and commodity prices have started easing, which is expected to support profitability.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the company scrip ended the day at \u20b9 445.40 apiece on BSE, down 2.92 per cent from the previous close.",

        "text": "Chhattisgarh, known for its rich cultural heritage and abundant natural resources, is embarking on a significant industrial journey. This path opens up new opportunities for the people of the State while marking a crucial step toward realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s vision of a developed and self-sufficient India. Our Industrial Policy 2024-29 aligns with the \u201cAmritkaal: Chhattisgarh Vision@2047\u201d, aiming to transform the State into a self-reliant industrial hub.\n\nLaunched on the State\u2019s foundation day, the new policy introduces special provisions for surrendered Naxals, women, and the third gender community, marking a commitment to inclusivity in development.\r\n\nThis policy is not only designed to accelerate economic growth but also to empower those groups that have often been left behind in the progress stream. By fostering industrial development, we seek to give every citizen a chance to participate in and benefit from economic growth.\r\n\nThe key highlights of the policy include a special package for the economic empowerment of the third gender community, surrendered Naxals, and women, helping them integrate into the mainstream of society. This package aims to provide support and training for these groups to start new journeys toward self-reliance.\r\n\nOne primary objective is to rehabilitate surrendered Naxals, offering new hope and opportunities. A special incentive package provides entrepreneurship training and financial assistance, enabling individuals to leave behind conflict and regain respect through meaningful work and community involvement.\r\n\nNew avenues will be created for the third gender community, offering support and training to build independent futures. With government-backed financial assistance and incentives, individuals from this community can establish their own enterprises, breaking through long-standing social and economic barriers.\r\n\nWomen, who play an essential role in Chhattisgarh\u2019s social and economic life, are a vital focus of this new policy. We have included measures to support women entrepreneurs through investment concessions, tax exemptions, and financial assistance.\r\n\nIn addition, targeted training programmes will equip women with the skills needed for self-employment and business management. This initiative is aimed at empowering women to successfully operate enterprises and achieve economic independence.\r\n\nBalanced growth\r\n\nTo foster entrepreneurship across sectors, the policy also raises the grant subsidy from 18%-20% to 30%-35%, providing a substantial boost to new enterprises and small businesses. Additionally, a special fund of \u20b950 crore has been set aside to support start-ups, helping turn innovative ideas into tangible enterprises.\r\n\nTo streamline processes, we have introduced a simplified \u201cSingle Window System 2.0\u201d, digitising permissions, licences, and registrations across various government departments. This system is designed to make investment processes quicker and easier, attracting significant investments and promoting sustainable growth.\r\n\nIncentives are being extended to small, medium, and large industries, with a focus on strengthening logistics and establishing new industrial zones and clusters. This initiative supports balanced growth and the development of industrial clusters across the State, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for businesses.\r\n\nAnother crucial aspect of the policy is the focus on pollution-free industries, with specific emphasis on manufacturing electric vehicles and environmentally friendly products. This commitment ensures that Chhattisgarh\u2019s growth is not only economically significant but also environmentally sustainable.\r\n\nThrough this new industrial policy, Chhattisgarh is set to emerge as a strong, self-reliant State. As we celebrate the first year of our government, we are moving systematically under Prime Minister Modi\u2019s vision of a developed India, striving toward the ideal of \u201cDeveloped India \u2013 Developed Chhattisgarh\u201d. We are confident that the day is not far when Chhattisgarh will be recognised as a developed State, making substantial contributions to the vision of a prosperous India.\n\n(The Writer is the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh)",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: India's manufacturing sector growth recovered from September's eight-month low to 57.5 in October fuelled by faster increases in total new orders and international sales, a monthly survey said on Monday. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose from September's eight-month low of 56.5 to 57.5 in October, indicating a substantial and accelerated improvement in operating conditions.\n\nIn PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction. \u201cIndia's headline manufacturing PMI picked up substantially in October as the economy's operating conditions continue to broadly improve. Rapidly expanding new orders and international sales reflect strong demand growth for India's manufacturing sector,\u201d Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC, said. The upturn in performance was boosted by stronger demand for Indian goods. Moreover, the introduction of new products and successful marketing initiatives helped enhance sales performance.\n\nNew export orders also exhibited stronger growth, following the weakest uptick in a year-and-a-half during September. Panel members reported gains in new contracts from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the US.\n\nOn the prices front, the October data signalled stronger inflationary pressures across India's manufacturing sector. Goods producers were also more willing to take on additional staff, which coupled with rising material costs, added to business expenses. Both input prices and selling charges increased at stronger rates.\n\n\u201cInput and output prices are both increasing as a result of persistent inflationary pressures in materials, labour and transportation costs,\u201d Bhandari added. On the employment front, not only did manufacturers hire extra staff at the start of the third fiscal quarter, but also to a greater degree than in September. Around one in ten panellists reported an increase in employment, while 1 per cent shed jobs. Going ahead, Indian manufacturers became more optimistic regarding future output volumes.\n\n\u201cTo start the third fiscal quarter, business confidence is also very high due to expectations of continued strong consumer demand, new product releases and sales pending approval,\u201d Bhandari said.\n\nThe HSBC India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.",

On an overall basis, One India growth stood at 5 percent,\u201d he said. Cipla\u2019s One India business includes its branded prescription, trade generics and consumer health businesses.\n\n\u201cWith the revival in the season and the respiratory uptick starting in quarter three of this year, we should revert back to our growth trajectory. While we are seeing slower growth, we have continued to invest both in field force and investments in the field. Our number of people on the field has now reached 8,700 people,\u201d he said. \n\nCipla\u2019s revenues were \u20b97,051 crore in the second quarter for three months ended September 30th, 2024, up 9 percent. Its One India business earned \u20b92,948 crore in the period under review, accounting for 42 per cent of its revenue in Q2FY25. It clocked \u20b91,303 crore as profit after tax (PAT), up almost 17 per cent, over the same period last year. \n\nGiving an overview, Vohra said, the company was on track to achieve its margin guidance for the year, \u201cbetween 24.5 %, 25.5%.\u201d The last 12 months, he said, \u201chave been audit heavy with our facilities of Invagen, Kurkumbh, Patalganga, China and Goa audited. All these facilities have cleared with either a VAI (Voluntary Action Indicated) or NAI (No Action Indicated) except for Goa where the classification is still awaited.\u201d Further, on Lanreotide, he added that the company was in the process of resolving its supply issues. \n\nSupply issues \n\nCipla\u2019s generic version of Lanreotide injection is indicated to treat Acromegaly (defined by medical institutions as a rare condition involving too much growth hormone in the body) and Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. In May 2024, Cipla received US regulatory approval for the generic equivalent of this product. Lanreotide is from biopharmaceutical company Ispen, sold as Somatuline Depot. \n\nOn issues involving Lanreotide, Vohra explained, \u201cCurrently, we are facing some supply challenges in Lanreotide, and hence we expect the Q3 Lanreotide franchise sales to be lower than Q2. However, these issues are anticipated to be resolved by the end of Q3, and starting quarter four FY25, we should be able to recover sharply in the Lanreotide franchise. We\u2019re also working to increase the overall capacity of Lanreotide through capex investments made by our partner.\u201d Industry estimates pegged US sales of Somatuline Depot (Lanreotide) at about $ 898 million, for the 12 months upto March 2024.\n\nCipla\u2019s US business posted $237 million in revenues in the quarter, its South Africa region grew 22 per cent, led by the private market and the emerging markets and Europe delivered 18 per cent growth, said Vohra, adding that the focus will be on growing key markets and building flagship brands, among other things.",

        "text": "Siddipet: The far-sighted decision of the previous BRS government to encourage farmers to cultivate oil palm is helping Siddipet farmers reap rich benefits.\r\n\r\nJust as the Siddipet farmers started going for the first harvest of their palm oil crop, the price of oil palm per tonne has increased from Rs.13,000 to Rs.19,000. Traders forecast that the price could go up further up to Rs.21,000. The area under oil palm cultivation had increased to 12,000 acres in the district, which is second only to Khammam district. Farmers who cultivated the crop in 2021 have started getting their first harvest this year. Many farmers would get their first harvest in December.\r\n\r\nThe farmers in the district have harvested nearly 80 tonnes of the crop so far, which they sent to an oil palm factory in Khammam. However, the farmers of Siddipet can sell their produce in the district by next June. Since the government is building an oil palm factory at Naremtta in Nanganur mandal, the marketing of their produce will become much easier. Officials have already announced that the factory will be opened by next June when a good number of Siddipet farmers will get their harvest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Siddipet Horticulture Officer Suvarna said they had set a target of adding another 4,000 acres this year, of which 800 acres were achieved so far. To encourage the farmers, she said they were offering 80 to 90 per cent subsidy on drip and other agriculture implements besides extending Rs.57,000 through the horticulture department and Rs.47, 000 to MNREGS in a phased manner for four years.\r\n\r\nFarmer Samala Sanjeeva Reddy, who got his first harvest, said they were elated over the price rise. He had cultivated oil palm on 33 acres in a phased manner at Ippalagudem in Markook mandal. Former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao and Minister T Harish Rao had encouraged the farmers to take up oil palm cultivation. The aim was to increase the cultivation to 50,000 acres.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 5 (KNN) The recent earnings reports of large industrial players reveal a notable trend: companies are experiencing a significant reduction in energy costs, driven by a strategic shift towards renewable power sources.\n\nMajor firms like Ambuja Cement, ACC, L&T, JSW Steel, and Hindustan Zinc are reporting reductions in energy bills, a result of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for renewable energy that offer a cheaper alternative to conventional coal-based electricity.\n\nExperts note that these renewable PPAs allow companies to lock in energy prices for up to 25 years, providing cost stability and a lower per-unit cost than the grid-sourced power.\n\nKartikeya Sharma, co-founder of solar energy firm Sunsure, highlights that many industrial giants are now opting for renewable power for up to 75 per cent of their needs through open-access solar, wind, and energy storage, reported mint.\n\nThis shift is particularly prevalent in high-consumption sectors like cement, metals, and mining, where companies benefit from both cost savings and compliance with government-mandated Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs).\n\nRPOs require companies to source a percentage of power from green energy or face penalties, further incentivising the switch.\n\nAmbuja Cement is a prime example, with its power costs per tonne dropping by 27 per cent year-on-year in the July-September quarter. The company attributes these savings to a growing focus on green energy, which now accounts for nearly 25 per cent of its power mix.\n\nSimilarly, ACC, a subsidiary of Ambuja Cement, reported a 23 per cent reduction in power expenses through increased use of waste-heat recovery systems (WHRS), solar, and wind power.\n\nHindustan Zinc, another prominent player, has doubled its renewable energy share to 14 per cent over the past quarter. The company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Modi, underscored the impact, noting that the shift to renewables reduced energy costs by USD 9 per tonne.\n\nJSW Steel, another heavyweight, has also made strides, securing 375 MW of renewable energy, with plans to expand this capacity to 2.5 GW by FY27.\n\nThe price advantage of renewables is stark. For instance, a solar-wind hybrid project can deliver power at around Rs 5.50-5.75 per unit, compared to grid prices of Rs 8.90-9.50 per unit, offering savings of nearly 40 per cent. This cost difference is particularly compelling for industries with high energy demands.\n\nThe move away from grid power reflects a broader trend among commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers, who are increasingly sourcing power directly from renewable energy producers.\n\nThis transition marks a significant step in India\u2019s journey toward a sustainable energy future, with corporations leading the charge in reducing carbon footprints while bolstering financial efficiency.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

While BSE Sensex moved above the 79,700 mark, Nifty50 was near 24,300. At around 6:36 PM, BSE Sensex was trading at 79,796.80, up 408 points, or 0.51%.

Other prominent stocks showing positive movement included NTPC, Axis Bank, Titan, IndusInd Bank, Tata Steel, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, and Bharti Airtel.Indian benchmark indices have demonstrated strong performance since the previous Diwali, with Nifty and S&P BSE Sensex showing gains of 25% and 23% respectively from their 2024 peaks. The broader market indicators showed even stronger performance, with BSE 500, BSE Midcap, and BSE Smallcap indices recording gains of 37%, 47%, and 47% respectively during this timeframe.The annual Diwali Muhurat trading session is being held on Friday, November 1, 2024, at both NSE and BSE exchanges. The session is from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, initiating Samvat 2081. Regular trading was suspended for Diwali, with only the special one-hour evening session taking place. This traditional trading session aligns with auspicious planetary positions and is considered beneficial for initiating new business ventures during the festival's celebrations.Analysis of previous special sessions reveals positive outcomes, with the BSE Sensex recording gains in 13 out of the last 17 sessions.The approach to the new Samvat has been challenging, with Nifty experiencing a decline of 1,470 points (5.7%) in October, influenced by underwhelming Q2 earnings and valuation concerns. Several upcoming events could impact market performance, including US elections, state elections in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and Delhi, plus the Union Budget in February.SBI Securities stated in their analysis: \"We believe Samvat 2081 will be a bottoms-up stock pickers market.

        "title": "Solar Energy Saves Dairy Cooperative in Brazil's Semi-Arid Region",
        "text": "by Alvaro Queiruga (monteiro, brazil)Friday, November 01, 2024Inter Press Service\n\nIxe is a word used in the Northeast region of Brazil, which means Virgin and reflects its deep-rooted religious culture.\n\nMonteiro, with just over 33,000 people, is a municipality in the driest part of the semi-arid ecoregion, with an area of 1.03 million square kilometres covering several states in the Northeast and a population of 27 million, where rainfall averages only about 600 millimetres per year.\n\nThe semi-arid region is also affected by severe droughts that can last for several years, as happened in 2012-2017 in most of the ecoregion. Located on a plateau, at an altitude of 600 metres, Monteiro has a pleasant climate in its 992 square kilometres.\n\nThanks largely to Capribom, Monteiro, where extensive livestock farming has been the main economic activity since the 18th century, has gone from ranking 126th in gross domestic product (GDP) to 14th among the municipalities of the state of Paraiba, of which it is the largest.\n\nWhen talking about solar energy, Cazuza was referring to the 316 panels and other photovoltaic generation equipment installed in 2018 on the roofs of the cooperative's plant headquarters, in the district of Fazenda Morro Fechado, a transition zone between the rural area and the urban centre of Monteiro.\n\nThe investment was made with non-refundable resources from an International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) loan to the government of Para\u00edba, equivalent to US$62,970, with a counterpart of US$1,830 from the cooperative itself.\n\n\"The solar system caused a 90% reduction in energy costs, which guaranteed operations, even during the pandemic,\" the cooperative's president, Fabr\u00edcio de Souza Ferreira, told IPS. These costs used to be as high as US$2,280 dollars a month.\n\nSavings brought trucks\n\nThe savings enabled the purchase of a truck for distribution of products, which was previously carried out by hired transporters.\n\nNow, the cooperative has six trucks for milk collection and product distribution (yoghurt, cheese, butter, dulce de leche, cottage cheese and others), which have grown from six to 20, with different flavours and presentations.\n\nIn recent years, the governments of the Northeastern states have been promoting the production and consumption of goat cheeses. Between 23 and 26 October, the Para\u00edba Cheese and Cacha\u00e7a Salon was held in the Paraiba capital, Jo\u00e3o Pessoa. Capribom presented 12 products and all of them won medals: eight gold and four silver.\n\nCapribom faced great difficulties when the covid-19 pandemic hit the region and the public procurement programmes for food from family farming were suspended for four months.\n\n\"Before the pandemic, we had 400 members, four of whom died. With the pandemic, the number of those still supplying milk dropped to 250 because we were still working and could not leave them stranded, although all our employees got sick,\" said an emotional Ferreira.\n\nWhat sustained production then was the supply of milk to the army and the emerging local private market. Deliveries to schools resumed after a few months. Despite the suspension of classes, students still picked up their processed meals.\n\nAs the pandemic passed, recovery was vigorous. Today, Capribom, founded in 2006, has 583 registered members and 80 members awaiting approval of their applications by the members' assembly.\n\nIncreased production\n\nIn September this year, the dairy plant was processing 18,000 litres of milk per day, of which 12,000 were cow milk and 6,000 were goat milk. Some 15% was produced in three settlements (communities of farmers settled by the agrarian reform) in the region.\n\nBefore the pandemic, there were 10,000 litres in total, which in 2020 was reduced to 7,000, of which 3,000 were from goats, explained Ferreira during a tour of the plant.\n\nInitially, the solar installation generated surplus energy, which was used in the milk coolers at the collection centres. The recent expansion required the installation of another 100 solar panels and related equipment, now with the cooperative's own resources.\n\n\"We still have a deficit because the new machines, cooler, pasteuriser and yoghurt maker (3,000 litres) consume a lot of energy, but they have reduced losses. We will need 50 more\", said Ferreira, with satisfaction. Expanding production will require another cold room and more energy, he adds.\n\nIn fact, turnover has multiplied. Before the pandemic, Capribom sold the equivalent of two million litres a year; now it's around seven million.\n\nAnd the results directly benefit the cooperative's members, who are guaranteed placement of their production and receive the equivalent of US$0.40 per litre delivered, while other buyers pay only US$0.32.\n\nCapribom's achievements do not only benefit its members. Although cooperatives in Brazil are exempt from some taxes, the agribusiness contributes around 25% of the revenue of the municipality of Monteiro.\n\nIn addition to tax benefits, Brazilian cooperatives have preferential treatment in public tenders.\n\nThis allows family farming cooperatives to place their products with stable prices and terms, but has bureaucratic drawbacks and relies on public policies.\n\nAmong these initiatives is the National School Feeding Programme (PNAE), which reaches 41 million students in public schools throughout the country, with resources from the federal government transferred to states and municipalities.\n\nThis is also the case of the Food Acquisition Programme, through which the government buys food produced by family farming and transfers it to public and welfare entities and so-called popular restaurants.\n\nPublic procurement used to absorb 90% of Capribom's production, a percentage that is now down to 70%. Reducing dependence on government programmes and expanding its market are two of the cooperative's objectives.\n\n\"With other family farming cooperatives, we created a central cooperative, called Nordestina, to jointly sell everything from dairy products to fruit pulp, tubers, free-range chickens and eggs, which allows us to reach more markets with reduced costs,\" Ferreira said.\n\nSlaughterhouse recovery\n\nThe most important project for the end of 2024 is to put into operation the Goat and Sheep Slaughterhouse of Monteiro, located next to Capribom's own slaughterhouse.\n\nThis agro-industry was built by the national government in 2000 and handed over to a consortium of municipalities. The management contract expired and the facilities were never put into operation. They were looted or became scrap metal.\n\n\"In the current government, technicians visited us and saw the potential. We negotiated with the state government and the mayor's office. The national government passed the facilities to the state, which passed them on to the mayor's office, and the mayor's office gave Capribom a transfer of use,\" Ferreira said.\n\nThe cooperative recovered part of the equipment. The government of Para\u00edba is acquiring new cold rooms and installing them on site.\n\nWith a capacity to slaughter 120 small animals daily (goats and sheep, and eventually pigs), the slaughterhouse will be the only one in Para\u00edba complying with the sanitary standards required by Brazilian legislation and will be able to participate in public procurement programmes.\n\nDeboned cuts of sheep and goat meat will be sent to schools. Whole pieces will be sent to other entities, but Ferreira does not lose sight of the market for special cuts. \"It's a small market, but it's a gourmet type market,\" he explained.\n\nCapribom has 50 employees, and another 30 will work in the slaughterhouse when it starts to operate normally.\n\nAccording to administrative director Cazuza, 80% of the employees are children of the cooperative members.\n\nThis is the case of Wesley Cristyan Batista da Silva, who has a degree in agro-ecology and has been working for two months evaluating the milk delivered by the producers to the dairy and providing them with technical assistance.\n\nHistorically, young people from family farming emigrated from the semi-arid region due to a lack of study and work opportunities.\n\nDa Silva is part of a different generation. He has a university degree and combines collaboration in the family property with employment in the cooperative. \"Am I satisfied? Yes. It was what I wanted and what I intend to continue doing,\" he told IPS confidently.\n\n\u00a9 Inter Press Service (2024) \u2014 All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press Service",

        "title": "Dhanuka Agritech: What should investors do?",
        "text": "Investors with a two-three year investment horizon can consider accumulating the stock of Delhi-based agrochemical maker Dhanuka Agritech. An expected recovery in the global agrochemical market, a ramp-up in sales of its new products launched for the first time in the country, good monsoon rainfall and demand for crop protection products should help the company sustain healthy growth in the near-to-medium term. At the current price of \u20b91,501, the stock trades 29 times FY24 earnings and about 24 times and 19 times its estimated FY25 and FY26 earnings. The estimated earnings for FY25 and FY26 are at a good discount to large-cap players such as PI Industries. We recommend investors to accumulate the stock on declines, considering that the global agrochemical market is expected to recover from FY25. \n\nDhanuka Agritech started operations through acquisition of a sick unit \u2014 Northern Minerals Pvt Ltd, with an office in Delhi, in 1980. Over the years, the company has built capabilities both on the manufacturing and research and development (R&D) front. The company currently has four formulation manufacturing units located at Udhampur (Jammu), Keshwana (Rajasthan), Sanand (Gujarat) and Dahej (Gujarat), wherein it manufactures the over-330 active SKUs that are currently sold in the market. \n\nIn 2023, the company commissioned its technical manufacturing plant in Dahej as a backward integration initiative, aimed at improving profitability and operational efficiencies. The first full-year impact of Dahej plant is expected to accrue in the current fiscal.\n\nOn the R&D front, the company operates an R&D facility at Gurgaon for generating scientific data and evaluation of new chemistry. Besides this, Dhanuka has tied up with several global innovators such as Oro Agri, Sumitomo Chemicals, FMC, Bayer, OAT Agri Co, Mitsui and Nissan Chemical Industries to name a few for launching new products in India and also collaborate for other markets. \n\nWith a large distribution network of over 6,500 distributors and 75,000 dealers, the company caters to North, West, East and South Indian markets. South and West are the two large markets accounting for over two-thirds of the company\u2019s revenues. \n\nSustaining growth\n\nWe believe Dhanuka to be well poised to sustain healthy growth in the next two-three years for three reasons. \n\nFor one, a recovery in prices and good domestic volumes. Global agrochemical markets have been under the weather over the last two years due to significant dumping by China and channel inventory pile-up. With most of the capacity expansions at China done, prices are expected to stabilise from hereon. The favourable base is expected to aid growth globally. Good monsoons in India is another positive for volumes domestically. \n\nThis should help the company\u2019s revenue and operating profit margin in the near to medium term. Though exports currently contribute less than a fifth of the company\u2019s total revenue, stable prices globally will help growth and margins in this segment. This will also support prices in the domestic market, as the pricing for key molecules largely track the global market.\n\nSecond, the Dahej plant, which houses technical and formulation manufacturing units, commenced production during the second half of last year. FY25 will be the first full year of operations at Dahej. The company has already started manufacturing two technical formulations from Dahej and expects to scale up going forward. Efficiencies and cost savings from backward integration will help margins in the medium to long term. \n\nThird, Dhanuka had launched three new products in Q1FY25, the full benefit of which is expected In FY25. New launches include Lanevo(an insecticide), in collaboration with Nissan Chemicals, Japan, with a \u20b91,050-crore addressable market; Purge(a herbicide), targeting soybean and groundnut with an addressable market of \u20b9700 crore; and Mycore Super(PGR) with a \u20b9470-crore addressable market. The company targets mid-single-digit market share in these products in the current year. Further, the company is working on a robust pipeline of products in herbicides and fungicides, besides insecticides. These should help fuel the company\u2019s growth over the next two-five years.\n\nA strong balance sheet with negligible debt is yet another positive. Despite being in an inventory and working-capital intensive business, the company\u2019s cash flow from operations remains comfortable at 40 per cent of the operating profit. While the working capital cycle has seen a marginal increase in FY24, owing to global factors and the cascading effect on the home market, there is scope to improve its cash conversion cycle from FY24\u2019s 170-days level to the 130-levels as seen in FY23. The inventory de-stocking in the global market should help this. \n\nIn FY24, though Dhanuka reported a flat revenue growth at \u20b91,759 crore, thanks to better product mix, operating profit margins improved over 300 basis points to 19 per cent. However, higher depreciation due to Dahej plant and marginally higher tax, led to a flat performance at the net profit level. In FY25, the management targets mid-teen growth in revenue and flattish margins. However, in FY26, Dhanuka is expected to clock higher revenue growth at about 20 per cent with an improvement in operating profit margin too. \n\nDelay in the ramp-up in operations at Dahej plant as well as in the recovery of the global agrochemical industry are risks.",

        "text": "Perhaps, the single-largest outlay for most of us is directed towards buying a house \u2013 mostly an apartment. \n\nAnd post-Covid, there has been a propensity among many of the young in the workforce towards buying their own \u2018spacious\u2019 houses early on in their careers.\n\nRecent studies by real estate research firms and home loan providers indicate that the average age of home loan customers has fallen from 40-45 years a decade ago to the early 30s and often to the mid- or late-20s.\n\nFrom a traditional societal viewpoint, we are often asked to \u2018settle down\u2019 quickly and one of the gauges for doing so is owning a house.\n\nBut from a financial wellness viewpoint, is it a good idea to buy a house with a loan within a few years of starting your working life? \n\nFrom a financial and even practical standpoints, buying a house in the early years of your career may not be a sound decision.\n\nEMIs create cash crunch\n\nWith back-to-office becoming the norm, typically, most of us would like to buy a house as close to our office as possible, so that the commute time is reduced. \n\nBut the catch here is that the apartments that are, say, 30 minutes or less away from your workplace are likely to cost more.\n\nEven modest-sized apartments that are relatively nearer to office spaces and IT parks in the top 10 cities in India are likely to cost a lot \u2013 usually north of \u20b91 crore.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you somehow zero in on a property \u2013 new or second-hand \u2013 that costs \u20b91 crore (including all taxes and registration charges) and is ready for occupation. Delay in handover from builders is another problem, which we ignore for our discussion.\n\nNow, banks offer 80-90 per cent of the property\u2019s price as loan, which translates to \u20b980-90 lakh in this case.\n\nTo be eligible for the loan amount in the range mentioned above, your net monthly salary must at least be \u20b91.2-1.25 lakh.\n\nLet\u2019s further assume that you have done well in your career thus far and earn that kind of money.\n\nIf you avail a loan of \u20b985 lakh (85 per cent of the property cost) at 9 per cent for 20 years, the EMI will work out to \u20b976477.\n\nFurther, you would need to have \u20b915 lakh for down-payment and other registration charges.\n\nYou would you have to save up by being extremely prudent in the early years of your career. \n\nThe EMI in the above case works out to more than 60 per cent of your monthly salary, whereas financial planners recommend 30-40 per cent as the ideal allocation for all loan commitments put together. \n\nIf you service any other personal or education loan, your surplus further diminishes significantly. \n\nThus, you will have to run a tight ship with respect to your finances in the initial stages of your career, with very little leeway for indulgences.\n\nRenting and investing\n\nInstead of loading yourself with EMIs, you could consider living on rent. Consider our case mentioned earlier. \n\nYou could get a house on rent for \u20b925,000. Or, if the area near your office is expensive on the rent front, you could opt for a property available for a rent of \u20b950,000 by sharing it with another person \u2013 paying \u20b925,000 each.\n\nCompared to an EMI in excess of \u20b976,000, your outgo would only be \u20b925000. \n\nNow, if \u20b950,000 is deployed in even conservative avenues such as balanced advantage funds over a period of 10 years, and the returns are 10 per cent a year, you would have \u20b91 crore at the end of 10 years.\n\nBesides, over the 10-year period, your salary would have grown substantially, thus increasing your loan eligibility amount.\n\nSure, there is chance that property prices would have risen, too, over the period. \n\nBut then, you would be in a position to buy a house worth even \u20b93 crore at that time!\n\nNon-financial factors\n\nApart from money and investing angles that we discussed earlier, there are other non-financial factors that would necessitate delaying your house purchase decision to your mid-30s \u2013 about 10-12 years into your career.\n\nFirst, in the initial stages of your working life, you may move jobs periodically or even frequently. You could be experimenting with your career to decide what suits you best. In such a situation, you could be moving across cities or even go abroad for employment. So, locking yourself with a property investment and EMI commitments drag you back from moving around freely. Besides, maintaining the property from another city or ensuring that the tenant takes good care of your house is a challenge.\n\nSecond, when you marry and have kids or if you plan to have your parents with you, the space requirements of an apartment would rise substantially. You would end up looking for a larger apartment, while probably having to sell your old property to afford the new one.\n\nThird, you cannot take sabbaticals or higher education breaks easily, as paying the EMI without a salary would be challenging. \n\nWhen should you buy?\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, you must have at least 40-50 per cent of the property price as financial investments with you, so that your outgo in loan servicing is kept low. \n\nThis would happen only in the middle stages of your career \u2013 at 35-40 years of age.\n\nIf you have a working spouse, your joint income would be large and EMIs would not be more than 25 per cent of the household income.\n\nBy 35-40, you would have figured out your career path and settled in your workplace. Also, there is good chance that you would have decided the best city to settle down for the rest of your life.",

        "text": "A separate manufacturing line for the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) by the private sector is economically unviable, sources said ruling out any such possibility while stating that the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) will have capability to produce 24 jets next year with the private industry involved in a big way. This has one of the suggestions from various quarters to speed up the delayed LCA production.\n\n\u201cA single type of aircraft is not produced by two different companies anywhere in the world. It will be too much duplication, will increase costs and is economically unviable. Private sector will be involved more and more in the current programme with HAL being the lead integrator,\u201d an informed source said. For instance, in addition to the big companies, there are also 270 Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) working with HAL.\n\nNow the LCA orders are for 180 aircraft beyond the earlier 40, which is a sizeable number. So HAL has gone for a third line, next year the production rate of the LCA will reach 24 aircraft per year, the source noted. Deliveries of the LCA-Mk1A by HAL to the Indian Air Force (IAF) have been delayed, in a major part due to non-delivery of F-404 engines by General Electric. The engine manufacturer has only two engines with which HAL will be able to handover two jets to the IAF this fiscal, sources said. \n\nOn the LCA-Mk1A, integration of the Israeli radar has been completed while weapon integration is on, sources said which includes air to air and air to ground weapons. The aircraft will be delivered while the integration will take sometime, sources said.\n\nIn 2021, the Defence Ministry had signed a \u20b948,000 crore deal with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to supply 83 LCA-Mk1A, a more capable fighter than the current LCA-MK1 in service. As per contract, three jets were scheduled to be delivered to the IAF in February 2024 and 16 aircraft per year for subsequent five years. An order for 97 additional LCA-Mk1A is under process.\n\nIn September 2022, the Cabinet Committee on Security gave sanction for the development of the LCA-Mk2 at a total cost of \u20b99,000 crore, a bigger and more capable fighter than the present LCA, and is currently under development. The LCA-Mk2 will be powered by the GE F-414 engine which produces 98kN thrust compared to 84kN thrust of the GE-404 engine powering the LCA Mk1 and MK1A. Discussions are in advanced stages for license manufacturing the engine in India. \u201cCommercial terms of the agreement are being negotiated between HAL and GE. It is expected to be concluded this financial year,\u201d sources said.\n\nOn the LCA-Mk2, IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal A. P. Singh said last month that it is supposed to do its first flight by October 2025 and by December 2027 is supposed to be end of the Research & Development phase. Officials had stated that deliveries of the LCA-MK2 are expected to commence from 2032 by which time the deliveries of all 180 LCA-MK1A are expected to be completed. As of now, the IAF has committed to procuring around 120 LCA-Mk2.\n\nIn September, then IAF Chief ACM V.R. Chaudhari while stating that while HAL remain the lead, suggested more public-private partnerships or joint ventures with private partners to ramp up production of the LCA. \u201cOur present orders of 83 LCA-Mk1As, which will be followed up with 97 more, will definitely take a few years to fructify. The way forward is to diversify the production lines, have more public-private partnerships or joint ventures with private partners to have multiple weaponry lines as well as multiple production lines,\u201d he had said. \n\n\u201cThat is the way we can catch up with our requirements and be able to export to other nations as well,\u201d he added while stressing that HAL should take the lead in any model evolved.",

They are dissuaded by the repeat nature of the exercise. As per Election Commission of India (ECI) orders, graduates should enrol as voters for every MLC election. New voters are ready to enrol their details, but senior others are not as enthusiastic. November 6 is the last date. There were around 2 lakh graduates in the previous election. Around 2.3 lakh voters have enrolled so far for the constituency which consists of undivided Karimnagar, Adilabad, Nizamabad and Medak districts. It is expected that around 3 lakh graduates will be enrolled as voters, though the number far exceeds that figure. The ECI has provided an opportunity for graduates to enrol online. Their details, however, should be verified by the booth level officers. Instead of facilitating enrolment, it is becoming a hindrance as officials are reportedly asking the online applicants to visit tahsildar offices to show their original certificates. Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, Karimnagar graduates MLC constituency aspirant Narender Reddy said they are trying their level best to encourage graduates to enrol. \u201cI visited 16 educational institutions in Kamareddy district on Saturday to interact with the graduates,\u201d he said. On the other hand, graduates, who mostly engage in private organisations for employment, are not showing interest to enrol. However, a few resident associations of colonies and apartments are urging them to sign up. Voters awareness campaign by the officials is also not up to the mark. J. Chandrashekar, a private employee, said he enrolled his name for previous poll. Enrollment as a voter for every election is not convenient for people, he said. Election Commission of India should alter the norms for ease of franchising of votes in Legislative Council elections, he said.",

        "title": "Why construction gear is less in demand",
        "text": "The $9.5-billion Indian construction equipment (CE) sector is likely to record muted sales growth in FY25 as the Lok Sabha elections held in May this year led to a delay in award of infrastructure projects, including road construction.\n\nConstruction equipment sales comprises earthmoving (around 70 per cent), material handling (14 per cent), concrete (11 per cent), and road construction and material processing (5 per cent). Around 60 per cent of the earthmoving equipment sold is used in road construction.\n\nOwing to the drop in sales, CRISIL Ratings Senior Director Anuj Sethi pegs revenue growth in FY25 to be the slowest across the FY17-25 period, barring FY20 and the partly Covid-impacted FY21.\n\nEmission norm impact\n\n\u201cRevenues for CE makers are expected to grow by 4-6 per cent year-on-year in FY25, largely driven by higher realisation following migration to the CE vehicles stage-V (CEV5) emission norms, while sales volumes are expected to remain flattish to moderately negative,\u201d Sethi says.\n\nMoreover, a hike in product prices due to compliance with CEV5 emission norms will also impact sales, especially in Q4 FY25. The last quarter is otherwise usually strong on sales, Sethi adds.\n\nSounding a positive note, Shalabh Chaturvedi, Managing Director of CASE Construction Equipment (India and SAARC region), says, \u201cDuring H1 FY25, the domestic CE industry\u2019s sales increased in single-digit percentage, which is a far cry from the about 20 per cent increase in the last two years, but still encouraging despite the general elections and protracted monsoons.\u201d\n\nCASE India, however, foresees that the anticipated surge in demand in Q3 FY25 may be offset by a slowdown in the next quarter due to higher prices after the new emission standards kick in from January 1, 2025.\n\n\u201cOverall, we expect this year to remain in single-digit growth. FY26, however, looks robust with the market digesting the CEV5-related price increase, coupled with a surge in the execution of infrastructure projects that are in award phase currently,\u201d Chaturvedi says.\n\nFocus on innovation\n\nChaturvedi says the transition to CEV5 emission standards for wheeled equipment would significantly impact original equiment manufacturers (OEMs) and the industry at large, since it compels them to embrace more modern and innovative approaches to improve operator safety, lower ambient noise levels, and safekeep the environment.\n\nThe transition will also present short-term difficulties such as customers taking time to adjust to the higher pricing of the new features and technologies. However, the sector may see a spike in equipment demand in Q3 FY25 to avoid buying higher priced equipment later, Chaturvedi says.\n\n\u201cAt CASE we are set to transition towards new emission and safety norms with the latest engine technological platform, which offers reduced cost of ownership while ensuring environmental sustainability,\u201d he says.\n\nCRISIL\u2019s Sethi notes that the CEV5 emission norms will lead to 10-15 per cent price increase.\n\nHe, however, thinks the dip in sales would be transient. \u201cOver the medium to long term, the implementation of CEV5 norms will uplift the revenues of CE makers, and volumes are expected to recover with the government\u2019s continued focus on infra spending. Besides, mining activity is expected to gain momentum,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe original timeline for the implementation of CEV5 norms was March 31.\n\n\u201cHence, there was a lot of pre-buying in H2 FY24. The sales volumes in H2 FY25 will largely depend on the pace of infra projects execution. Moreover, while only CEV5 models can be produced from January 1, 2025, vehicles meeting earlier emission norms can be sold for a finite interval in calendar year 2025,\u201d Sethi says.\n\nRaw materials\n\nIndustry and analysts point to steel prices and freight costs as key factors in FY25.\n\nSteel is the chief material for the manufacture of CEs. During FY25, raw material prices are expected to be stable. However, any increase in steel cost may impact profitability amid muted demand, with limited scope to pass on the price hike, Sethi says.\n\nBesides, 30-35 per cent of critical or specialised components are still imported, so higher freight costs can affect profitability, he explains.\n\nChaturvedi points out that since steel is a vital component in making machinery such as loader backhoes and excavators, price changes will immediately impact the cost structure. \n\nSimilarly, freight expenses, both domestic and foreign, directly impact supply chain and logistics.\n\n\u201cEven though supply constraints have caused volatility, steel prices are expected to remain range-bound as a global slowdown is partially being offset by growth in India. Freight costs, however, remain concerning due to factors such as fluctuations in fuel prices and geopolitical uncertainty. For efficient management, we at CASE are keeping close tabs on the cost of raw materials,\u201d he says.",

        "text": "As the global economy begins stabilising after the pandemic-led disruption, the focus is shifting to the debt accumulated by the countries to fight the slowdown. IMF\u2019s fiscal monitor for 2024 has gone to great lengths to highlight the need to bring the burgeoning sovereign debt under control. Its projection of global public debt exceeding $100 trillion or 93 per cent of global GDP in 2024 and 100 per cent of GDP by 2030, is disconcerting. Although the report says that public debt is projected to grow higher in only one-third of the countries, this list notably includes the US, China, Brazil, France and the UK. As the largest economies grow their debt pile, it will have serious implications for sovereign bond yields and cost of finance of all emerging economies, including India.\n\nThe situation in India is far from comfortable. General government gross debt at 83.1 per cent of GDP is higher than the average for Asian countries at 83.8 per cent of GDP and for G20 countries\u2019 average of 75.8 per cent of GDP. Though India\u2019s debt is projected to reduce from 2025, it will decline at a very gradual pace, to reach 78.4 per cent of GDP by 2029. However, the Centre is cognizant of this risk. A shift in stance was indicated during the Budget this year, from targeting a lower fiscal deficit to getting the debt to GDP ratio under control. But, as the fiscal monitor points out, \u201cin most countries, fiscal adjustments currently in the pipeline are insufficient to deliver, with confidence, stable or declining public debt ratios. Additional efforts are necessary.\u201d Efforts to bring down public debt are impeded by the impossible trilemma facing governments. This involves \u2013 one, the pressure to spend more to support growth, two, the political resistance to increase in taxes and three, the objective to have sustainable debt along with macroeconomic stability. If governments spend on capital investments without increasing revenue, public debt will continue to rise.\n\nIt is imperative for the Centre to look for additional means to augment its revenue by broadening the tax base, improving tax administration and increasing formalisation of the economy. Similarly, expenditure also needs to be reined in. While the debt level of the Centre could move lower in the coming years, checking the borrowing of States will be far more challenging. Nudging States to increase their own tax revenues and to reduce subsidies will run into far more political resistance. But States need to get fiscally prudent, if the overall fiscal balance and government debt has to be controlled. \n\nThe fiscal monitor also makes valid points about the risks posed by unidentified public debt. These debts include losses of state-owned enterprises, loan guarantees, extra-budgetary spending and other contingent liabilities. The Centre has sought to recognise a large part of such unidentified debt. But States have been relatively tardy in this respect. This is a subject matter for the sixteenth Finance Commission.",

In the initial trade, it touched 84.06, registering a rise of 1 paisa over its previous close.\n\nOn Thursday, the rupee edged up 1 paisa to 84.07 against the US dollar.\n\nThe Forex market remained closed on Friday on account of Diwali.\n\n Also read: Crude oil futures rise as OPEC delays production output increase\n\nThe local currency has been hovering around its all-time low level. It touched its lowest closing level of 84.10 against the dollar on October 11, 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.62 per cent lower at 103.63.\n\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 1.52 per cent to $74.21 per barrel in futures trade.\n\nLast week saw a relatively quiet period in India due to Diwali celebrations, with low volatility and limited market movement. The USD-INR pair continued to trade within a familiar range, as the RBI effectively capped the upside at the 84.10 level, CR Forex Advisors Managing Director Amit Pabari said.\n\nThis week, however, brings heightened interest as a lineup of IPOs unfolds, with Swiggy's anticipated listing in the spotlight as it aims to raise $1.3 billion. This could lend some support to the rupee, with expectations for the USD-INR pair to trade within a range of 83.80 to 84.20, with a downside bias.\n\nOn the domestic equity market front, Sensex declined 703.89 points, or 0.88 per cent, to 79,020.23 points.

This strategic transition will ensure a fair and just shift towards sustainable energy while also boosting the state\u2019s economy\u201d.\n\nThe Chief Minister said the state is on track to replace its current thermal power consumption of 1,500 million units (MUs) with renewable sources, including hydro, solar, and wind power. He said currently the state consumes 13,500 MUs of power, with a large portion already derived from renewable sources.\n\nAchieving 90 per cent renewable energy consumption in the power distribution network will enable Himachal Pradesh to be certified as a fully green state of the country. This transition is expected to be completed within a year and will also allow industries in the state to apply for the \u2018Eco Mark\u2019, enhancing the value of their products.\n\nHe said the government is also laying a strong focus on solar power generation, with plans to establish a capacity of 2,000 MW over the next four to five years. \u201cSolar power generation has doubled in the past two years, reflecting the government\u2019s commitment to this clean energy source,\u201d reads the letter.\n\nThe Chief Minister said, in addition, the government has launched the \u2018Green Panchayat\u2019 scheme, a decentralised renewable energy initiative. Under this scheme, 500 KW grid-connected ground-mounted solar power plants are being set up at the panchayat level. Income from the sale of this power will be used to fund eco-friendly and sustainable development projects.\n\nHe said the state is also making significant progress in the production of \u2018Green Hydrogen.\u2019 The first facility, in collaboration with Oil India Ltd is underway and discussions with private investors for more such facilities are ongoing.\n\nSukhu said as part of the state\u2019s efforts to promote electric vehicles (EVs), 1,500 buses from the state transport corporation\u2019s fleet of 3,200 buses will be replaced with electric buses over the next two to three years. He said the government is also transitioning its own fleet of diesel and petrol vehicles to electric. Additionally, six major national highways have been developed as green corridors for EVs.\n\nUnder the Rajiv Gandhi Startup Yojana, unemployed youth are being provided with a 50 per cent grant to purchase EV taxis and buses, ensuring the deployment of environment-friendly vehicles within government services.",

Moreover, the introduction of new products and successful marketing initiatives helped enhance sales performance.\n\nNew export orders also exhibited stronger growth, following the weakest uptick in a year-and-a-half during September. Panel members reported gains in new contracts from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the US.\n\nOn the prices front, the October data signalled stronger inflationary pressures across India\u2019s manufacturing sector.\n\nGoods producers were also more willing to take on additional staff, which coupled with rising material costs, added to business expenses.

Around one in ten panellists reported an increase in employment, while 1 per cent shed jobs.\n\nGoing ahead, Indian manufacturers became more optimistic regarding future output volumes.\n\n\u201cTo start the third fiscal quarter, business confidence is also very high due to expectations of continued strong consumer demand, new product releases and sales pending approval,\u201d Bhandari said.\n\nThe HSBC India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.",

        "text": "Microsoft predicted increased spending on artificial intelligence this quarter but slower growth in its cloud business Azure, signaling that big AI investments were not enough to keep pace with capacity constraints at its data centers.\r\n\r\nShares of the Redmond, Washington-based company dipped 3.6% in after-market trading, giving up earlier gains. The company beat Wall Street's estimates for first-quarter revenue and profit.\r\n\r\nFacebook-owner Meta, which reported results ahead of analyst expectations as well, warned of \"significant acceleration\" in AI-related infrastructure expenses, sending its share price down 3.1% in after-market trading.Meta Might Be Developing an AI-Powered Search Engine\r\n\r\nBrett Iversen, Microsoft's vice president of investor relations, reiterated that Microsoft will not be able to address AI capacity constraints until the second half of its fiscal year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft forecast second-quarter Azure revenue growth of 31% to 32%, lagging the 32.25% growth expected on average by analysts, according to Visible Alpha. Azure revenue rose 33% in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, slightly ahead of estimates.\r\n\r\nAI contributed 12 percentage points to Azure's growth in the first quarter, compared with 11 percentage points in the prior three-month period.Microsoft Could Make BTC Investment Progress by December\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has been pouring billions into building its AI infrastructure and expanding its data-center footprint. For the quarter, Microsoft said capital expenditures rose 5.3% to $20 billion, compared with $19 billion in the previous quarter. That was higher than Visible Alpha estimates of $19.23 billion.\r\n\r\nIts hefty spending has raised concerns among some investors.\r\n\r\nThe company has been the worst performer among Big Tech names this year, having gained just over 15%, while Meta has surged 68% and Amazon.com climbed 28%.Microsoft, OpenAI Spending Millions to Help News Outlets Adapt to AI\r\n\r\nMicrosoft will spend over $80 billion this fiscal year, which began in July, according to analyst estimates from Visible Alpha. That is an increase of more than $30 billion from its last fiscal year.\r\n\r\n\"Microsoft is escalating a CapEx war that it may not be able to win. That level of investment is very high, it created a very big drag on free cash flow and will create a very big drag on margins going forward,\" said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's rival Google has benefited from AI growth. On Tuesday, Alphabet said AI helped drive a 35% surge in its cloud business. Its shares closed up over 2.8% on Wednesday and were down 0.4% after the market closed.Microsoft Launches AI Agents, Deepening Rivalry With Salesforce\r\n\r\nOpenAI Partnership\r\n\r\nThe quarterly earnings are Microsoft's first since it restructured the way it reports its businesses to align them more closely with how they are managed. That move has, however, made it harder to estimate the quarter's performance.\r\n\r\nEarnings per share stood at $3.30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.10, according to LSEG data.IBM Releases New AI Models for Businesses as GenAI Competition Heats Up\r\n\r\nRevenue rose 16% to $65.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter ended September, compared with analysts' average estimate of $64.5 billion, according to LSEG.\r\n\r\nThe company is seen as the leader among Big Tech peers in the AI race thanks to its exclusive partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft's Azure customers get access to OpenAI's latest models, such as its o1 models, capable of answering challenging math, science and coding problems.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Microsoft gets early access to infuse OpenAI's technology across its product portfolio, such as in Bing and its enterprise applications such as Excel and PowerPoint, but that effort has not gone as well as expected.Microsoft's Vice President of Generative AI Research to Join OpenAI\r\n\r\nOutside its cloud business, Microsoft reported revenue of $28.3 billion in its productivity business, which houses its Office suite of applications, 365 Copilot and its AI and speech-technology services.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's personal-computing unit, home to its Windows operating system as well as devices including Surface and gaming products including Xbox hardware, content and services, reported a 17% rise in revenue to $13.2 billion.\r\n\r\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2024\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\r\n\r\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

According to fireworks manufacturers, over 300 factories in Sivakasi and neighbouring villages produce joined crackers.\n\nA.P. Selvarajan from Kaliswari Fireworks said: \u201cSound crackers account for 40 per cent of the total production in Sivakasi. Of those sound products, around 20 per cent were joined crackers.\u201d\n\nHe added that many manufacturers of joined crackers have kept their factories closed for months, resulting in workers migrating to other factories.\n\nAdditionally, heavy rains in parts of Sivakasi further impacted production, reducing the output to about 75 per cent of the usual volume.\n\nApproximately 4 lakh workers from 1,150 fireworks factories in Sivakasi were involved in producing Rs 6,000 crore worth of firecrackers this year.\n\nSivakasi is considered the hub of India\u2019s firecracker industry, producing around 70 per cent of the country\u2019s firecrackers.\n\nHowever, it is also worth noting that several accidents have occurred during the manufacturing process, leading to loss of life.

        "text": "ISLAMABAD: The government's initial attempt to privatise Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) faced a significant setback on Thursday, as the only bidder, Blue World City, proposed a mere PKR 10 billion for a 60 per cent stake in the loss-making airline--far below the government's minimum sale price of PKR 85.03 billion, the Express Tribune reported.During a publicly televised bidding event, Blue World City, a real estate developer, presented its offer, which accounted for only 12 per cent of the government's stipulated price.In dollar terms, the bid equated to approximately USD 36 million, starkly contrasting with the minimum sale price of USD 305 million set by the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation.Prior to the bid opening, the Privatisation Commission board and the Cabinet Committee convened separately, yet no government ministers attended the ceremony, which was only attended by two federal secretaries.The Cabinet Committee had approved the minimum sale price following recommendations from the Privatisation Commission board, and despite being invited to match the government's offer, Blue World City declined to raise its bid.\"We have considered the government price and decided to stand with our best price of PKR 10 billion,\" stated Saad Nazir, the owner of Blue World City. The firm was the only one to submit a bid after five other pre-qualified parties withdrew, citing the government's strict conditions regarding tax liabilities, guaranteed investments, and employee retention, reported the Express Tribune.The government's efforts to privatise PIA, which ranks as the fourth-largest loss-making entity in the country, reached a disappointing conclusion as Blue World City was the only firm to participate. The government had anticipated stronger interest, especially after it carved out approximately PKR 625 billion in PIA debt into a separate holding company, leaving PIA with PKR 202 billion in liabilities and about PKR 163 billion in assessed assets.Seham Raza, Chief Operating Officer of Blue World City, expressed disappointment over the lack of competition. \"I wished there would have been healthy competition and feel sad that all other bidders have pulled out,\" she remarked.The government had offered between 51 per cent to 100 per cent stakes in the airline but ultimately decided to sell a 60 per cent share. Additionally, it declined bidders' requests for reduced duties and tax waivers and required the buyer to inject USD 500 million to USD 700 million into PIA to ensure operational sustainability, the Express Tribune reported.Privatisation Commission secretary Usman Bajwa highlighted that PIA would not achieve operational sustainability without new investments and resolution of its outstanding liabilities.The failed attempt to privatise PIA may have broader implications for the government's overall privatisation strategy as it seeks to address its financial challenges.",
        "summary": "The government's effort to privatise Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) failed as the only bidder, Blue World City, offered PKR 10 billion for a 60% stake, significantly lower than the PKR 85.03 billion minimum. The lack of competition and high government demands discouraged other bidders.",

        "title": "Only 10% of 15 lakh engineering graduates likely to land jobs this year",
        "text": "For years, engineering has reigned supreme in the landscape of India\u2019s academic and career aspirations, so much so that it almost became a rite of passage. The trend, which took off in the late 20th century, was fuelled by India's rapid need for industrialisation and reinforced by a subsequent global reputation as an emerging technological powerhouse. Families viewed engineering not just as a career path, but a secure future. A degree in this field promised not only lucrative job opportunities but also prestigious social status. However, as the years passed, the dream of engineering turned from a national obsession into an oversaturated reality.From a hot trend to an overcrowded landscapeFollowing India's independence, the country's need for engineers skyrocketed as it embarked on a journey of self-reliance, industrialisation, and technological development. The boom was further spurred by the IT revolution in the 1990s, which made engineering synonymous with success.Parents nudged their children into the field, and universities mushroomed to meet the soaring demand. By the early 2000s, engineering had become the default academic track for many, with the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) leading the charge in producing world-class talent.Yet, this golden era of engineering as a guaranteed ticket to success has faded. Over the years, the market has become saturated with graduates, and even premier institutions like IITs are witnessing a decrease in placements. According to recent reports, even the top performers are not immune to this trend.For instance, in 2024, only 60% of IIT graduates secured placements, suggests a survey by TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship, a provider of degree apprenticeships, working with 22 universities, including TeamLease Skills University. This is an alarming figure given the reputation of these institutes. The question is: If the best struggle, what hope remains for the millions of graduates from other engineering colleges? 114686548Reality check: Only 10% of engineering graduates to secure employment in 2024The report by TeamLease has delivered a sobering statistic: only 10% of the 15 lakh engineering graduates expected to pass out this year will find jobs. This stark figure underscores a deep-rooted problem in India's education system: A massive disconnect between academic training and industry demands, leaving millions of graduates underprepared and unemployed.According to AR Ramesh, CEO of TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship, the calculation hinges on a combination of factors, including the employability rate, industry demands, and a significant skills gap.\u201cTo break it down, India produces approximately 1.5 million engineering graduates each year. While roughly 60% of them actively seek employment, only 45% meet industry standards in terms of skill readiness,\u201d says Ramesh. 114686889 Moreover, the emergence of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), electric vehicles, and semiconductors has shifted the demand toward specialised, high-tech skills, skills that many graduates lack.Anikit Aggarwal, Founder and CEO of Unstop, a prominent talent upskilling platform for students, spoke to TOI, pointing out the growing gap between fresh graduates and industry-specific skill demands due to a lack of hands-on experience. \"While students may grasp the fundamentals of AI, ML, cloud computing, and cybersecurity\u2014key emerging skills in engineering\u2014they lack exposure to real-world problem-solving and project-based learning,\" observes Aggarwal. \"The core problem lies in the disconnect between the skills taught in academic settings and the practical competencies employers seek,\" he adds. 114686990The National Employability Report for Engineering, 2019, reflects similar concerns, highlighting that 80% of Indian engineers did not possess the skills needed to thrive in the job market, despite having a degree. 114687091Reiterating similar thoughts, Ramesh explains that the issue isn\u2019t necessarily the lack of jobs but rather a mismatch in expectations and skill sets. \"If we break down the numbers, you\u2019ll find that out of the 60% of graduates who are employable, only 45% meet the industry\u2019s expectations. Now, with the additional demand-supply gap created by the rise of AI and advanced technology skills, this figure drops further to around 10-15%,\" he says. Essentially, while jobs exist, they aren\u2019t accessible to the majority of graduates due to their inability to meet the evolving demands of the tech-driven market. 114687390Explained: The gap between degree and skill among budding engineersIndia\u2019s technology sector continues to grow at a rapid pace, yet the gap between academic output and industry needs is widening. According to the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), the country will need over one million engineers skilled in AI and other advanced technologies within the next 2-3 years. Yet, the demand-supply gap for digital talent, the TeamLease report projects, is expected to widen from 25% to almost 30% by 2028. This is particularly concerning given the current oversupply of general engineering graduates and their lack of readiness to fill these niche and specialist roles.A key challenge is the misalignment between academic curricula and industry expectations. Ramesh points out that despite the vast number of engineering colleges, the training these students receive is often outdated. \u201cThe focus has to shift towards apprenticeships and internships that blend theoretical knowledge with hands-on industry experience. This is the only way to ensure that graduates are ready for the job market,\u201d he notes. Yet, only a fraction of students pursue such opportunities during their academic years.The rise of new technologies, from semiconductors to AI, has also exacerbated the situation. According to a Niti Aayog report titled Electronics: Powering India\u2019s Participation in Global Value Chains, 80% of India\u2019s electronics engineers lack the skills needed to thrive in their field. This skills gap is not limited to one sector but is pervasive across multiple industries, causing a bottleneck in hiring even as companies ramp up recruitment in tech-focused areas.Bridging the gap: Stronger academia-industry ties can be the saviour Given the current scenario, the question one would ask is, what can be done? Ramesh suggests a multi-pronged approach, beginning with stronger collaborations between academia and industry to align curricula with market needs. The New Education Policy (NEP) has already initiated some of these reforms, aiming to integrate vocational training and real-world experience into academic frameworks. But the progress is slow, and in the meantime, millions of graduates are left in limbo.TOI also spoke to Abhimanyu Sexena of ed-tech platform Scaler, specialising in upskilling techies in AI, Data Science and a host of other domains. Talking about the issue of lack of an industry-centric curriculum, he observes, \"The main issue is that no one, including mainstream academic institutions, is working directly with industry leaders. We must understand the essential skills and capabilities required by these industries, design our curricula and teaching methods accordingly, and include professionals who are actively working in the field to guide students.\"When asked about what possible changes can be made in the present engineering pedagogy in India, Saxena shared that one of the key ways is to mandate industry experience through internships or apprenticeships. \u201cAt the University of Waterloo, all students must complete at least 12 months of industry internships. It is recommended that students gain practical experience by working in the industry for two years of their four-year degree,\u201d he suggests.For students graduating in the next few years, taking on internships or apprenticeship roles, even at lower salaries, might be the most practical way to bridge the gap between education and employability. \"The idea is to gain industry knowledge and experience, which will eventually lead to better opportunities down the line,\" Ramesh explains.As the market evolves, so must India\u2019s approach to education. Only then can the country truly harness the potential of its engineering talent, ensuring that the next generation of graduates can contribute meaningfully to the nation\u2019s growth. Until then, the dream of engineering will remain just that, a dream for many, with only a few realising its full potential.",
        "summary": "For years, engineering was the dominant field in India, with 1.5 million graduates annually. However, only 10% are expected to secure jobs in 2024 due to a significant skills gap.

        "text": "Stock market today: Indian stock markets ended a five-day losing streak on Monday as upbeat quarterly results from ICICI Bank and other lenders powered gains in banking stocks, despite ongoing foreign selling and lackluster corporate earnings. The BSE Sensex climbed 0.76 per cent or 602.75 points to close at 80,005.04, while the Nifty50 rose 0.65 per cent or 158.35 points to settle at 24,339.15.Key factors for major gains1. Strong banking sector performanceAmong the 30 Sensex stocks, ICICI Bank led the gains, climbing 3 per cent following its report of a 14.5 per cent increase in standalone profit to Rs 11,746 crore for the second quarter ending September 2024.While other major gainers included JSW Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra, Adani Ports, Tata Steel, Sun Pharma, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Motors, and State Bank of India.On the downside, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, and Maruti were among the lossers.All sectoral indices on the Nifty were trading in positive territory, with the Nifty PSU bank index leading the pack, up 3.8 per cent. The Nifty witnessed a correction of approximately 8.3 per cent from its recent peak, while the mid and small cap indices experienced corrections of 9-10 per cent, respectively.The Indian rupee remained stable at 84.0775 against the US dollar, as expectations that the central bank would maintain its stance on the currency offset pressure from a strong dollar.2. Positive earnings reports fuel market optimismThe Indian stock market experienced a positive shift in sentiment, largely attributed to the sharp correction in global crude prices on international markets, according to traders.Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, Vinod Nair said: \"The market exhibited a rebound after continuous selloff last week. Positive results from banks and a slump in oil prices in expectation of an ease in retaliations in the Middle East aided investor sentiment.\u201d\"Stability in the broad-based rally requires more evidence from earnings, which are currently in the doldrums of weak demand and margin pressure. We expect companies with a less leveraged balance sheet and growth prospects to outperform when the market stabilizes,\" Nair added.The market opened on a positive note, with the Sensex crossing the 80,000 mark and Nifty50 moving above 24,400.During the intra-day trading session at 12.22 pm, the Sensex had surged to 80,433.23, up 1,030 points or 1.30 per cent, while Nifty50 reached 24,465.05, up 284.25 points or 1.18 per cent.According to exchange data, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 3,036.75 crore on Friday, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) purchased shares amounting to Rs 4,159.29 crore.3. Global market stability supports reboundEarlier in the day, the US stock index futures experienced a significant surge potentially recovering some of the losses from the previous week's turbulent trading session. Investors are gearing up for crucial corporate earnings reports and the final stage leading up to the presidential election on November 5.\"The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets,\" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.Dow E-minis surged 203 points or 0.48per cent, while US S&P 500 E-minis climbed 35 points or 0.60per cent, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis advanced 160.5 points or 0.78per cent.In Asia, the markets in Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong closed higher. Meanwhile, European markets were trading in positive territory.The global oil benchmark, Brent crude, saw a significant decline of 5.84 percent, settling at $71.54 per barrel.In premarket trading, major tech giants showed strong gains ahead of their upcoming earnings reports later this week. Alphabet's stock price increased by 1.6per cent, Meta Platforms rose 1.3per cent, Microsoft was up 1per cent, Apple gained 0.7per cent, and Amazon.com added 0.9per cent.Nvidia, a prominent player in the AI-chip market, experienced a 1.3per cent increase in its stock price.The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note reached a three-month high of 4.292per cent on Monday.",

The telco also announced a road map for leadership transition from January 2026, that will see COO Shashwat Sharma take the role of CEO and MD, with incumbent Gopal Vittal, 58, becoming executive vice-chairman.Airtel said consolidated net profit in July-Sept quarter stood at Rs 3,593 crore against Rs 1,341 crore a year ago. Revenues for the company were up 12% at Rs 41,473 crore, aided by strong momentum in India and growth in Africa.Average revenue per user (ARPU), a key metric that highlights operational health of mobile companies, stood at Rs 233 for the company in the quarter, compared to Rs 203 in the comparable quarter of the previous year.The company's earnings could have been stronger, but pre-payment of govt's spectrum dues ate into the profitability. Airtel said it pre-paid Rs 8,465 crore in third quarter to DoT towards deferred liabilities pertaining to spectrum acquired in 2016. These were to be paid at an interest rate of 9.3%.\"We delivered another quarter of solid performance, with India revenue growing 8.7% sequentially. Africa maintained strong revenue growth momentum as well with 7.7% constant currency growth,\" Vittal, currently the MD of the company, said.He said Airtel's drive towards \"premiumisation\" has helped add 4.2 million smartphone customers. \"We continue to expand our Wifi coverage with fixed wireless access offerings to over 2,000 cities.

Chandrababu Naidu in August 2015, this project is anticipated to attract investments of around Rs 12,000 crore and create approximately 45,000 jobs, a much-needed opportunity for the region's economy. With these investments, Orvakal is expected to become a key industrial center, strengthening the economic landscape of the undivided Kurnool district. State industries minister T.G. Bharat welcomed this central support and announced additional plans for developing the Hyderabad-Bengaluru and Visakhapatnam-Chennai industrial corridors, which have also secured funding from the central government. These corridors are expected to improve connectivity and draw new investments to the Rayalaseema region, which has low industrial growth. He mentioned that industrial and smart cities are planned for Orvakal, and the region\u2019s designation as a \u201cred zone\u201d allows for a wide range of industries to be established. Minister Bharat added that foreign investors, especially from the UAE, have expressed interest, with talks for collaboration already underway. Local industry has already started to grow with the launch of operations at the Jayaraj Ispat steel factory. The state government is proactively addressing infrastructure needs, including water, electricity and transportation networks. Air connectivity improvement is also in the works, with new flight services planned between Kurnool and Vijayawada, which will further support the industrial sector\u2019s growth at Orvakal.",

        "text": "Voters in Japan have spoken and delivered the loud and clear message to the ruling coalition that they cannot be taken for a ride with gimmicks or the political trick of changing a discredited Prime Minister. Just as voters in India recently did not allow the ruling party to win a simple majority, their Japanese counterparts have punished the ruling coalition in an unprecedented manner as it has lost its majority, throwing the country into political instability not seen for decades. The final tally shows that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito have managed to win only 215 seats, down from 279 and well short of the 233 needed to form a government. It is the worst result for the LDP \u2013 which has ruled Japan for 65 of the past 69 years. The defeat of the LDP alliance is being attributed primarily to a corruption scandal involving money siphoned off from party fund-raising events. That apart the people were seething with rage for the failure of the government to address bread and butter issues. The blow has been so severe that the chastened-looking Ishiba admitted in a television address that it was a \u201cvery tough\u201d election for the party. Of the 46 candidates against whom the allegations of corruption were directed only 18 have been able to retain their seats.\n\nSome of them were denied party tickets and they won as independents. The result shows the depth of public distrust in the LDP as a result of the slush fund scandal. Some of the biggest names in the ruling coalition failed to win seats, including Komeito\u2019s leader Keiichi Ishii. Interestingly, such strong reaction against graft is rarely, if ever, seen among Indian voters. The Opposition party that has gained the most from the collapse in LDP support is the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), which has won far more seats than it expected \u2013 148 seats, up from 98 in the last election. The stranglehold of the ruling coalition in Japanese politics has been such that Opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda said, after the poll results, that it was a major achievement that they could reach their goal of preventing \u201cthe ruling coalition from getting a majority.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the Opposition parties\u2019 collective success in winning enough seats to form a majority, a grand coalition among them appears to be unlikely as they have diametrically opposing views on key matters from fiscal and defence policy to the use of nuclear energy. With its 191 seats, the LDP remains the single largest party and could still cobble together a government by adding a third coalition partner. At the moment Ishiba is keeping his cards close to his chest. But, he is likely to first approach the centrist Democratic Party for the People for support and then the conservative Japan Innovation Party. The two parties have won 28 and 38 seats, respectively.\n\nThough both parties previously ruled out a formal coalition with the LDP, the post-poll scenario may make them revisit their position. Of course, such a fragile government will make Ishiba vulnerable to a leadership challenge from within his own party. It is likely to come from Sanae Takaichi, the preferred choice from the ultra-conservative faction of the LDP whom Ishiba, a moderate, defeated in last month\u2019s leadership election. Ishiba appeared to have decent approval ratings after that victory and called the snap election hoping to capitalise on party support. But, his popularity came under a question mark after he made a U-turn on a number of policies that resonated with the voters \u2013 support for same-sex marriage and the right for married individuals to choose to keep different surnames \u2013 after entering office. The great message emanating from Japan to democracies around the globe is that it is the people and not politicians and their propaganda machinery that have the last word in the formation of a government.",

        "text": "Indian markets opened flat to mildly higher on Tuesday, in line with mixed Asian markets and a positive close on Wall Street overnight. Sensex opened at 80,037.20, barely moving from the previous close of 80,005.04, while Nifty opened at 24,328.85, a slight decline from Monday\u2019s close of 24,339.15. \n\nThe indices are trading in red. The Sensex slipped 462.58 points or 0.58 per cent to trade at 79,542.46 at 10.05 am, while the Nifty tumbled 155.75 points or 0.64 per cent to trade at 24,183.40.\n\nAt the open, NTPC led the gainers on the NSE, up by 2.20 per cent, followed by BEL with a gain of 1.78 per cent. Eicher Motors rose by 1.46 per cent, while engineering giant L&T added 0.67 per cent. ICICI Bank maintained its positive run, up by 0.65 per cent, driven by optimism in the banking sector. \r\n\n Also read: Stocks that will see action today: October 29, 2024\n\nOn the losing side, Bharti Airtel saw the steepest decline, down by 2.60 per cent. This was followed by M&M, which dropped by 2.57 per cent, and Sun Pharma, which lost 1.40 per cent. Other notable decliners included Britannia and Axis Bank, down by 0.99 per cent and 0.97 per cent, respectively. \r\n\nAccording to Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities, \u201cU.S. stocks closed higher on Monday as Wall Street geared up for a busy week packed with quarterly earnings from megacap technology companies and the final stretch before the Nov. 5 presidential election, while sentiment improved after energy supplies were not disrupted by weekend developments in the Middle East.\u201d \r\n\nJasani added, \u201cCrude oil futures ended sharply lower Monday, with U.S. and global benchmark crude prices logging their biggest one-day percentage decline in over two years after widely anticipated Israeli airstrikes against Iran did not hit crucial oil facilities.\u201d \r\n\nIn the Indian market, the Nifty snapped a five-day losing streak on October 28, with Ameya Ranadive, Chartered Market Technician at StoxBox, noting, \u201cNifty50 has broken its five-day losing streak, closing above 24,300. The index began the session on a subdued note but gradually climbed, reaching an intraday high of around 24,500. However, in the latter half of the day, it retraced some gains, ultimately finishing at 24,340.\u201d \r\n\nSameet Chavan, Head of Research, Technical and Derivative at Angel One, said, \u201cTechnically, prices defended Friday\u2019s low and surpassed its high, closing within the trading range established on Friday. The daily chart reveals a \u2018Spinning bottom\u2019 pattern, indicating indecision; however, the oversold momentum indicators suggest strong support around 24,100 and 24,000 as we approach monthly expiry and a festive week.\u201d \n\nOn the sectoral front, PSU banks were the standout performers, with Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd., noting, \u201cBanking stocks led the charge in yesterday\u2019s trade, with ICICI Bank, Bandhan Bank, Indian Bank, and Bank of Baroda all posting robust Q2 earnings.\u201d \r\n\nIn the pre-market session, the SGX Nifty, which tracks the Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange, was up by 23 points, indicating a positive opening for the domestic indices. \r\n\nHardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking, said, \u201cThe benchmark Sensex and Nifty indices are expected to open flat on Oct 28, following GIFT Nifty trends indicating a gain of 23 points for the broader index.\u201d \r\n\nHowever, Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research at Kotak Securities, warned, \u201cIf the index falls below 24,050/79,100, the sentiment could change, and traders may prefer to exit long positions as the index may gradually fall to 23,900 or 23,800 levels.\u201d \n\nVikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, noted, \u201cThe market is expected to open positively, driven by a rally in global markets, strong domestic corporate earnings, reduced geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, and a notable drop in oil prices, which have fallen to a one-month low of under $72 per barrel.\u201d \r\n\nThe morning market commentary from Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, suggests that the resilience of the market despite persistent FII selling is a positive sign. \u201cThe implication of this change in trend, despite the persistence of FII selling, is that the retail investors are back in buying mode,\u201d he said. \r\n\nAs investors closely watch the upcoming US elections, the quarterly earnings season, and the overall market dynamics, the Indian markets are expected to take cues from these global and domestic factors in the trading session ahead.",

        "text": "Meta is reportedly developing an artificial intelligence (AI) search engine. According to a report, the social media giant wants to compete with existing players such as Google, Microsoft's Bing, and DuckDuckGo. The company reportedly plans to use AI for the search engine, likely giving it a Perplexity-like avatar. Key details about the platform's implementation are currently missing. It is believed that the company wants to reduce the reliance on other search engines to source data for its AI chatbots. Notably, Meta also released NotebookLlama, an open-source audio-based podcast generation tool, to compete with Google's NotebookLM.\r\n\r\nMeta's AI Search Engine\r\n\r\nThe Information reported that the social media giant has started work on an in-house AI search engine. Citing people familiar with the matter, the publication claimed that Meta has set up a dedicated team to develop the search engine. This corroborates with an earlier report that the company's web crawlers were spotted in large numbers scouring the Internet. This is usually important to get relevant data to rank websites and content when a search request has been sent.\r\n\r\nAn AI-powered search engine is not a new concept. Perplexity is one of the biggest players in this space and offers its AI platform that curates information from multiple sources to present the most relevant output in a simple-to-read format. While the report did not share any details about Meta's implementation of the AI search engine, it is likely that it could also work the same way.I&B Minister Meets Meta's Chief AI Scientist to Discuss AI Opportunities\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Meta AI chatbot uses Google Search and Microsoft Bing to find web information for user queries. This could be an expensive endeavour for the company given API requests can accumulate in large volumes, and the social media giant has not monetised its AI chatbots.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say whether Meta aims to create a specific search engine domain or use the capability to reduce the reliance on Google and Microsoft for web search capability. This can only be known once the company makes an official statement regarding the same. The report did not highlight any launch timeline for the AI search engine but mentioned that a team has been working on it for the last eight months.\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

This growth is driven by the increased use of social media, OTT platforms, affordable prices, accessible data, and the expansion of the 5G network.\r\n\r\nAccording to industry experts, to achieve the goal of $500 billion local electronics manufacturing by FY30, the industry must prioritise export growth to emerge as one of the top three global exporters in this domain by 2030, led by mobile manufacturing.\r\n\r\nAfter Apple, Google is set to manufacture Pixel smartphones in India, with plans to export the devices to Europe and the US. The tech giant will soon begin commercial production through partnerships with Foxconn and Dixon Technologies' subsidiary Padget Electronics.

        "title": "How UPI Is Enabling A Cashless Economy",
        "text": "The rise of a cashless economy in India is largely due to the Universal Payments Interface (UPI), which has redefined the way people think about and manage payments. UPI is more than just a convenient way to pay - it's a dynamic system that supports everything from daily transactions to large financial exchanges, all through a single mobile app. Here's a deep dive into how UPI payment enables a cashless economy and the perks that make it a game-changer for consumers and businesses.\n\nInstant, 24/7 Transfers with No Hassle\n\nOne of UPI's most appealing features is its ability to enable round-the-clock transfers that happen almost instantly. Whether you're paying a friend back for dinner or making a purchase at a local shop, UPI payment transactions are completed in seconds, regardless of banking hours or holidays. This is incredibly valuable for a cashless economy where digital transactions must be quick and available anytime.\n\nUPI apps like Google Pay, Bajaj Finserv UPI App, PhonePe, and Paytm have leveraged this advantage by providing a smooth, user-friendly experience, removing the delays often associated with traditional bank transfers or cash withdrawals. It's as easy as opening an app, entering the amount, and approving the transaction.\n\nOne Platform for Multiple Bank Accounts\n\nUnlike traditional banking methods that limit you to a single bank's services, UPI consolidates multiple accounts across different banks into one platform. Users can seamlessly switch between bank accounts for various transactions using a single UPI app without logging in to separate banking apps.\n\nThis consolidation supports a cashless economy by simplifying money management and expanding access to banking services without extra steps. Users can now easily manage multiple accounts, and businesses benefit from faster and more versatile payment solutions.\n\nEnhanced Security Features\n\nSecurity is a top priority for any cashless economy, and UPI ensures that all transactions are safe with several built-in security layers. When using UPI payment options, users create a unique UPI PIN, which they must enter every time they complete a transaction. Moreover, sensitive information like bank account details is never shared directly with the merchant, making the process more secure than traditional card-based transactions.\n\nFurthermore, UPI apps are fortified with additional authentication steps, such as OTPs (One-Time Passwords) and smartphone biometric verification. This heightened level of security increases user confidence in digital payments, allowing more people to embrace a cashless lifestyle.\n\nSeamless Merchant Integration and UPI Offers\n\nUPI is promoting a cashless economy through its seamless merchant integration, which has transformed how businesses operate. From small street vendors to large e-commerce platforms, merchants have adopted UPI payments, making it easy for customers to make cashless payments.\n\nAdditionally, UPI apps often include exciting UPI offers, encouraging customers to opt for digital transactions. From cashback rewards to discounts on favorite shopping platforms, these offers help drive the adoption of digital payments.\n\nLower Transaction Costs\n\nFor a cashless economy to thrive, transactions must be affordable. Unlike credit card transactions that incur fees for merchants, UPI payments are either free or have minimal charges, making them much more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThis is especially beneficial for merchants who may not have the financial means to absorb high transaction costs but want to participate in the digital economy. By lowering the cost barrier, UPI empowers even the smallest vendors to accept digital payments, helping drive a wider adoption of cashless transactions across the country.\n\nRural Inclusion and Financial Accessibility\n\nOne of the most transformative impacts of UPI on the cashless economy is its role in rural inclusion. With a simple smartphone and access to a UPI app, individuals in rural areas can make and receive digital payments even without a bank branch nearby. This has helped bridge the financial gap between urban and rural regions by granting more people access to digital financial services.\n\nAs more and more people from rural areas switch to UPI payments, it will contribute to a larger, interconnected, cashless economy. This inclusion is critical in a country where a large portion of the population lives in non-urban areas, further emphasizing UPI's potential to transform India's economy.\n\nIncreased Transparency and Record-keeping\n\nWith UPI, every transaction leaves a digital footprint, making record-keeping straightforward and reducing instances of tax evasion and unreported income. Digital transactions enable both consumers and merchants to maintain accurate financial records effortlessly, increasing transparency.\n\nThis transparency not only benefits the government but also allows users to track their spending habits, manage budgets, and make more informed financial decisions. By promoting accurate record-keeping, UPI contributes to a cleaner, more organized economy where cashless transactions reduce the dependency on physical currency.\n\nUPI's Role in Shaping a Cashless Future\n\nThe Universal Payments Interface is more than just a payment method; it's a fundamental force driving India's shift to a cashless economy. From increasing financial accessibility and security to offering cost-effective and transparent transaction options, UPI has something to offer everyone. With the ongoing innovation and widespread adoption of UPI payments, India is on a clear path toward a cashless future where digital transactions become the new normal.\n\nAs UPI continues to evolve with new features and offers, it's exciting to see how it will further reshape the economic landscape. If you haven't already adopted UPI, now is the perfect time to download an all-in-one UPI app like Bajaj Finserv and experience firsthand how it can simplify and enhance your financial life.\n\nDownload Bajaj Finserv App",

        "text": "The number of individual income tax return filers, showing \u20b91 crore plus income, has surged around 41 per cent to over 2.38 lakh during the first half (April-September) of the current fiscal year, latest data by e-filing portal (https://eportal.incometax.gov.in/) showed. \n\nExperts feel the number is expected to go up further as due date for individuals having accounts to be audited is November 15.\n\nThe returns are related for Assessment Year 2024-25 (Fiscal Year 2023-24). While Tax officials said that formalisation of economy along with use of technology along with ease of compliance contributed in not just higher number of return filers. \n\nData showed that the number of crorepati filers was over 19000 during April-September period in 2020-21 which dropped a bit to over 16700 in the next fiscal (2021-22) mainly on account of the pandemic. However, in the next fiscal year (2022-23), it surged to over 1 lakh and since then, it has been on the rise. \n\n Also read: India\u2019s business activity grows at faster clip in Oct, PMI shows\n\nAccording to Amit Maheshwari, Tax Partner at AKM Global, the major reason is the strong economic growth which, in turn, leads to higher incomes for individuals. Buoyant capital markets have also led to gains for individuals. Also, advanced technology, particularly AI, is playing a significant role in improving tax administration. \n\n\u201cTax authorities are increasingly using technology to match income declared in ITRs with information from various sources like banks, financial institutions, and property registrars. This helps detecting discrepancies and encouraging higher compliance, especially among high-income earners. Overall, the surge in crorepati ITR filers is a positive sign for the country reflecting on increasing prosperity and improved tax compliance,\u201d he said.\n\nIndia\u2019s direct tax-to-GDP ratio has hit a 24-year high of 6.64 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24. Also, direct tax collections have surged by over 182 percent during the last decade, reaching more than Rs 19.60 lakh crore in FY24.\n\nSudhakar Sethuraman, Partner at Deloitte India, said Indian economy registered a growth of 8.15 per with an estimated revenue growth of 9.6 per cent approximately. \n\nConsequently, there is a natural increase in individual income levels and spending power. Besides this, the scope and requirement for tax return filing is not confined to just income levels. \n\n\u201cEven certain spendings are critical triggers for tax return filing. One could also appreciate that the enhancement is reflected in every slab of income; indicating that there is no stagnation of growth after a certain level,\u201d he said.\n\nThe number of filers and taxpayers has the potential to rise further. \n\n\u201cGiven our low tax to GDP ratio, work in still required to bring more taxpayers within the tax bracket. Very few (approximately 1.5 per cent) taxpayers contribute to the entirety of individual tax collections,\u201d said Maheswari. Sethuraman concluded that given industrial/technological developments and collaborations within and overseas, the positive trend is most likely to continue.\n\n Also read: Corporates can file ITR for FY25 till November 15",

Spain, one of the largest economies in the world, has invested $4.2 billion in India this century. We look forward to advancing negotiations on a European Union-India free trade agreement. This will help our markets grow in size and diversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpain is a world leader in clean energy. We have a lot to offer India with our experience in solar and wind power. Our expertise can help India reach its goal of 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030. We are committed to partnering with India to boost its energy security and green transition. By combining Spanish innovation with India\u2019s potential, we can make a big impact on the global economy and the environment,\u201d he added.\n\nSanchez said that Spain\u2019s advanced railway systems, subway networks and transport solutions can greatly benefit India\u2019s infrastructure projects. He expressed willingness on the part of Spanish engineering firms in terms of sharing their expertise in creating efficient and sustainable transport systems. He also expressed interest in collaborating with India in the digitisation space.\n\nCreating partnerships\n\nChandrajit Banerjee, Director General, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said, \u201cSpain is very experienced in urban infrastructure, high-speed rail networks, transport systems and smart mobility. We look forward to new partnerships with Spain to boost our infrastructure development. We\u2019ve also discussed collaboration opportunities in artificial intelligence, defence and green technologies. Both countries are committed to joint ventures and co-development in defence to enhance capabilities and strategic autonomy. In renewable energy, India is embracing cleaner fuels like wind and solar power. Spain\u2019s expertise in this area could help us in our energy transition. From the CII perspective, we want to advance our discussions, and bring sectoral and senior-level business delegations to participate in global events.\u201d\n\nR Mukundan, Vice-President - CII, and Managing Director and CEO, Tata Chemical, in his address said, \u201cWhen we work with Spanish brands, there is a transfer of knowledge, a transfer of technology, and a transfer of standards of quality, which is very essential when addressing the Indian market. And for the Spanish company, India presents a huge opportunity \u2014 we are growing at the rate of $250 billion every year, adding 10-20 million new customers annually. The value which Spanish companies need to create when addressing the Indian market also gives them the ability to access price points that they couldn\u2019t access before, allowing them to address global markets more cost-effectively.\u201d\n\nS N Subrahmanyan, Chairman and Managing Director, Larsen & Toubro, said, \u201cSpanish companies are unlike other companies we deal with internationally. They are willing to share technology, and not just overall technology, but core technology, which is important because, ultimately, if we truly want to become \u2018Aatmanirbhar,\u2019 we need to develop technology within our country. It is not enough to have broad agreements, and with Spanish companies, we often find that willingness to share.\u201d",

        "text": "Deepavali literally means \u2018the row or line of lights\u2019. These lights specify the celebration and joy. The lights also indicate the removal of the darkness. Coming on the day of pure darkness, Amavasya which is spiritually special, the Deepavali festival indicates many facets.\n\nThe associated stories with Deepavali are regionally varying and nuanced. It is said that the loka-shatru, the demon force called Naraka was eliminated by Sri Krishna and the entire world celebrated the demise. The parallel reason for the celebration is the Yudha in which Ravana got killed resulting in the coronation of Vibhishana. Sri Rama returned to Ayodhya to assume the kingship. This return is celebrated by the people of Ayodhya, and the tradition happened that on this day people celebrate it as the festival. Both the versions converge around celebrating the Deepavali day, one from Tretayuga and another from Dwaparayuga.\n\nDeepavali festival is celebrated over five days, and it is the only festival which is not Navaratri but celebrated long. It begins with the Dhana Trayodashi, two days before the Amavasya. Trayodashi is a significant day for specific worships. Next day is the Naraka Chaturdashi, the fourteenth day. We learnt the significance of this day of Naraka\u2019s elimination. \u2018Purna\u2019 day is the Amavasya, the Kaala Ratri. This day vibrates spiritually. The day that follows is \u2018Bali Padyami\u2019, associated with Raja Bali and Vamana. When Bali occupied the divine kingdom, Vamana appears and seeks the gift of three feet. Eventually his feet occupy the whole universe as he grew to become the Trivikrama. The fifth day of the festival is \u2018Yama Dwitiya\u2019 which is celebrated as the bonding day of brothers and sisters. Sisters feed brothers.\n\nDeepavali day indicates abundance. The world is of abundance but our perceptual limitations make it appear small. The outlook for the view has to be full. Rising above the limitations has to happen is the message of the festival. The small, apparently limited deepa/light spreads the \u2018light\u2019 in the entire neighbourhood. Another deeply replicable quality of the deepa/light is its ability to light another deepa/light and ensure the effort of keeping the light around multiplied. Another noteworthy feature is, by lighting another deepa/light, the original deepa/light doesn\u2019t lose anything. Its impact doesn\u2019t reduce, but more outcome happens. This is another takeaway from our Deepavali festival.\n\nDr S Ainavolu is a Mumbai-based teacher of Management and Tradition. Intent is nextgen\u2019s learning and cultural education",

        "title": "The Importance of Understanding and Monitoring Capacity Utilization in Manufacturing Industries",
        "text": "The manufacturing sector is a critical engine for economic growth, and its performance is often a reflection of overall economic health. In pursuing operational excellence, manufacturers must pay close attention to a concept known as capacity utilization. It is a measure that can significantly influence production costs, efficiency, and profitability. A robust understanding of this metric allows businesses to make informed decisions that can propel them ahead of the competition. Below, we delve into the nuances of capacity utilization, its implications, and strategies for optimization within the manufacturing landscape.\n\nThe Role of Capacity Utilization in Operational Efficiency\n\nThe role of capacity utilization in operational efficiency cannot be overstated. High levels typically reflect effective asset use, often leading to better margins and higher profitability. This suggests that the manufacturer maximizes the return on investment for machinery and human resources.\n\nHowever, operational efficiency isn\u2019t just about maximizing output; it\u2019s also about minimizing waste. This includes time wasted due to inefficiencies in the production process, excess material resulting from overproduction, and machine overexertion leading to unnecessary maintenance and downtime. Utilization metrics serve as diagnostic tools for these inefficiencies.\n\nMoreover, responding swiftly to demand fluctuations is crucial in today\u2019s market. Capacity utilization provides insights that can help manufacturers remain agile \u2013 by identifying bottlenecks that can hinder quick scale-up or scale-down in production. This flexibility is a significant component in achieving overall operational efficiency.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to find the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 of capacity utilization where the company can fulfill customer orders without significant delays, maintain quality, control costs, and be ready to capitalize on new opportunities without overextending resources. Continuous monitoring and adjustment according to market demands are key to maintaining this balance.\n\nTools and Techniques for Measuring Capacity Utilization\n\nUnderstanding the theoretical aspects of capacity utilization is one thing, but measuring it precisely necessitates specific tools and techniques. Manufacturers may use statistical models, software solutions, or both to track their production activities against their capacities.\n\nOne common method involves calculating the ratio of actual output over a specific period to potential output if the plant operated at full capacity. This simple model, however, doesn\u2019t account for variations in product mix or complexity. Advanced techniques include the use of manufacturing execution systems (MES) that provide real-time data gathering and reporting capabilities.\n\nManufacturers may also leverage Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) metrics to understand better how effectively equipment is being used. OEE considers availability, performance, and quality, providing a more nuanced picture of utilization. Furthermore, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems can integrate data across various operations to assess capacity utilization holistically.\n\nContinuous improvement methodologies, such as Lean or Six Sigma, can also help optimize capacity utilization. These frameworks emphasize the importance of ongoing evaluation and incremental improvements, which aligns well with the dynamic nature of production capacity parameters.\n\nStrategies for Optimizing Capacity Utilization in Manufacturing\n\nOptimizing capacity utilization is essential for sustaining profitability and competitive advantage. One strategy involves meticulously analyzing the demand forecast to align production schedules accordingly. Accurate demand forecasting helps prevent both overproduction and underproduction scenarios.\n\nAnother crucial strategy is the diversification of the product line. By offering a range of products that can be manufactured with the same equipment, manufacturers can better absorb shifts in demand for specific products, keeping machines running and workers productive.\n\nInvesting in flexible manufacturing systems is also a strategic move toward optimizing capacity utilization. Such systems can adapt to different production needs without significant downtime for reconfiguration. This flexibility enables smoother transitions between products and volumes, allowing the manufacturer to respond nimbly to market demand.\n\nLastly, manufacturers should not underestimate the power of regular equipment maintenance and employee training programs. These actions not only prolong the life of the machinery and enhance performance but also ensure that staff can operate at peak efficiency, therefore contributing to optimal capacity utilization.\n\nOverall, understanding and monitoring capacity utilization is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and sustaining profitability in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers can optimize capacity utilization by implementing effective strategies and leveraging advanced tools to remain agile and competitive in a dynamic market.",

        "text": "Washington: Hiring in the US private sector surged past expectations in October, significantly up from the month prior, according to data released Wednesday by payroll firm ADP. The United States saw private sector employment rise by 233,000 this month, ADP said, defying analyst expectations of a slowdown according to consensus estimates and well above a revised tally of 159,000 for September. Voters have said economic issues remain a top priority as they head to the polls next week to select a new president. Despite a resilient jobs market, surveys have shown that US households remain unconvinced that the world's biggest economy is in great shape. One problem is the weight of cumulative inflation on consumers -- even as the country has largely bounced back from economic pain during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cAs we round out the year, hiring in the US is proving to be robust and broadly resilient,\u201d said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson in a statement. She added that job growth was strong this month even as states were recovering from multiple devastating hurricanes. October's growth was the highest since July 2023, according to ADP. The figures come days before an employment report released by the government, with all eyes on the strength of the US economy as analysts anticipate the size of future central bank interest rate cuts. Federal Reserve policymakers are slated to gather next week, days after the US presidential election, and a hotter-than-expected labor market could prompt officials to opt for a less aggressive reduction. Wage growth was 4.6 percent from a year ago, ADP said, noting this furthered a \u201ctwo-year slowdown.\u201dFor those who changed jobs, pay gains cooled to 6.2 percent. Among sectors, manufacturing was the only to lose jobs, according to ADP.",

        "text": "Khammam: BRS party has successfully prevented the State government from imposing a financial burden of Rs 18,500 crore on the domestic consumers by increasing the electricity charges, said the party leaders.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to the media here on Wednesday, the party district president, MLC Tata Madhusudhan and former MLC S Venkata Veeraiah said the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission\u2019s (TGERC) has rejected a proposal of two DISCOMs to increase the fixed charge from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50 per kilowatt for the financial year 2024-25 for domestic consumers using power over 300 units due to the efforts made by the BRS.\r\n\r\nThe BRS party would fight on behalf of the people and pursue the State government to deliver six guarantees as promised by the Congress party. As the government failed to deliver its poll promises, the Congress leaders have been misleading the people by making false accusations against the BRS, the MLC said.\r\n\r\nCongress party promised a pension of Rs 4000 to the poor and one tula gold along with Kalyana Lakshmi cheques but could not deliver the promises. Similarly loan waiver was not implemented fully as half of the eligible farmers were yet to get their loans waived.\r\n\r\nPeople were dissatisfied with the Congress government and MLAs were feared to visit villages. In Khammam district there was no coordination among the three ministers as each minister was trying to gain upper hand over the others, Madhusudhan said.\r\n\r\nChief Minister A Revanth Reddy who claims to erase the history of the BRS chief K Chandrashekhar Rao should know that Chandrashekhar Rao has a fixed place in the history of Telangana and none could erase it, he noted.\r\n\r\nVenkata Veeraiah stated that paddy procurement has not started on full scale as the supply of gunny bags and coordination with mills was not done yet. In case of purchase of fine rice, farmers were being troubled by the government by imposing restrictions.\r\n\r\nIndiramma houses should be given to the poor who have already started construction of houses under the Gruha Lakshmi scheme implemented by the previous BRS government, he said.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the leaders submitted a memorandum to district Collector Muzammil Khan asking him to provide alternate house sites to 400 beneficiaries to whom pattas were given in survey number 218 of Raghunathapalem village by the previous government. The beneficiaries were likely to lose house sites as a Greenfield Highway was proposed through the village, they said.",

        "text": "The response that Tamil film actor Vijay received for his speech at the inaugural State-level conference of his party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), in Vikravandi on October 27 was mostly on expected lines. Mr. Vijay\u2019s indirect attack on the ruling DMK government in Tamil Nadu and the BJP-led Central government and his statement on power sharing have become talking points among the political parties of the State. While the DMK, a couple of its allies, and the BJP did not take his speech kindly, the AIADMK, the principal Opposition party, viewed it favourably in view of the perception that Mr. Vijay did not target it. If reactions on social media are any indication, the TVK leader\u2019s words created an impact on the people. Some admired the speech, while others criticised him for being vague on many serious issues.\n\nAs he laid down the broad contours of his party\u2019s policies and action plans in the already cluttered political landscape of Tamil Nadu, it became clear that Mr. Vijay was adopting the general line of thinking seen in his films. By and large, his films belong to the \u2018masala movie\u2019 genre. They offer nothing different either in terms of plot or narration from other movies in the same genre. In many of his films, the protagonist, played by Mr. Vijay, represents subaltern communities or identifies with them.\r\n\nThe manner in which he spoke at Vikravandi, the contents of his speech, and the way the conference was organised indicated that the actor may want to follow a similar formula in politics too: nothing radically new; and in support of social justice.\r\n\nHe did differ from other politicians in some aspects, however. He spoke simple and direct Tamil and liberally used English words and punchlines. He did not wear a crisp, white dhoti, the uniform of politicians in the State, but instead chose trousers and a shirt. The conference began with some of the State\u2019s traditional dance forms \u2014 Paraiyattam, Mayilattam, Devarattam, and Vallikummi. He also announced that he would be open not only to forming an alliance with other parties, but also giving a share in power in the event of victory in the 2026 Assembly polls.\r\n\nEven though the film star-turned-politician did not name the DMK and the BJP in his attack, the leaders of the two parties were quick to find fault with him. Alluding to Mr. Vijay\u2019s observation that the TVK was neither the \u201cA team\u201d nor the \u201cB team\u201d of any other party, the State Law Minister, S. Regupathy, labelled the latest entrant the \u201cC team\u201d of the BJP, while Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting and former State president of the BJP, L. Murugan, contended that Mr. Vijay\u2019s speech lacked clarity. To substantiate his point, he referred to the TVK leader calling Dravidam and Tamil nationalism as \u201ctwo eyes\u201d and said the two concepts were contradictory to each other.\r\n\nThe DMK\u2019s allies were not attracted by Mr. Vijay\u2019s offer of power sharing. The principal secretary of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Durai Vaiko, said it would create confusion. The leader of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, Thol Thirumavalavan, who defended the demand for a share in power not too long ago, said Mr. Vijay\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d was an attempt to pre-empt the AIADMK. The Congress\u2019s State unit chief, K. Selvaperunthagai, said his party would \u201cwait and watch\u201d even as he welcomed Mr. Vijay\u2019s position.\n\nThe AIADMK was the only major party which seemed to support Mr. Vijay. Referring to the actor\u2019s observation that certain parties took an \u201canti-fascism\u201d position but had \u201cunderground dealings\u201d with the same forces, the general secretary of the AIADMK, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, said others too were echoing what his party had been saying all along \u2014 that the DMK and the BJP shared a \u201ctacit understanding.\u201d He did not want to get drawn into any debate on the issue of power sharing and simply said, \u201cEach party has its own policy...It would not be proper for me to comment on whether his [Mr. Vijay\u2019s] stand is right or wrong.\u201d When asked whether he would agree to a proposal of power sharing where he would be Chief Minister and the TVK leader, the Deputy Chief Minister, in the event of a victory in the elections, the AIADMK leader said that his party was functioning according to the policies set by its previous leaders.\n\nWhile debates continue on how long the TVK leader will remain in the field, the reactions to his speech have made one thing clear: no one is ignoring Mr. Vijay.",

        "text": "Visakhapatnam: As Diwali approaches on October 31, police officials are grappling with a rise in illegal firecracker manufacturing units across north coastal Andhra Pradesh, with Vizianagaram district emerging as a particular hotspot. In the entire North Andhra Pradesh and Anakapalli districts, a total of 41 cases has been registered, till date.Vizianagaram Superintendent of Police (SP) Vakul Zindal, while having a conversation with Deccan Chronicle said that the police officials has registered 29 cases against illegal manufacturers this year till date, with 33 individuals accused and 123 persons bound over. He said we have seized firecrackers valued at Rs 6,74,069 and searches are being conducted against these illegal units.The SP emphasized the importance of these actions, stating, \u201cWe have identified illegal manufacturers and are binding them over so that they do not supply firecrackers to people for the ensuing Diwali festival.\u201d In 2023 , there were 18 cases registered, with 25 accused and 112 individuals bound over, resulting in the seizure of firecrackers worth Rs 2,60,487. The previous year, 2022, saw a peak with 50 illegal units identified in Vizianagaram district, distributed across Vizianagaram division (26 units), Bobbili (17 units), and Cheepurupalli (7 units).While Anakapalli is renowned for producing high-quality firecrackers that are popular in Visakhapatnam city, illegal manufacturing remains a serious concern. Anakapalli SP Tuhin Sinha confirms that 10 cases have been registered against illegal manufacturers and sellers in the area till date.The situation varies across districts. Srikakulam has reported only two illegal units, with notices served to four accused, while also granting legitimate permits to 25 vendors. Visakhapatnam city, under Police Commissioner Sankha Brata Bagchi reports only one legal unit and has authorized stall setups in zones 1 and 2.The most particular concern are the interior villages of Sabbavaram, Anakapalli mandal (rural), Devarapalli, Narsipatnam, Achutapuram, and Kasimkota mandals, where illegal manufacturing continues to flourish. Sabbavaram mandal has witnessed numerous accidents and fatalities.The human cost of these illegal operations is staggering. Sources indicate approximately 60 lives have been lost due to explosions and fires in illegal units across north coastal Andhra Pradesh in the past four years. The deadliest incident occurred in Srikakulam in 2005, claiming 14 lives when a cracker storage shed exploded.A retired fire official, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that illegal manufacturers typically source raw materials from open market shops without proper verification, or sometimes purchase from licensed holders for resale at marginal profits. \"These crackers are manufactured in makeshift sheds and thatched houses in isolated places, often employing workers at low wages with no safety oversight,\" the official explained.The crackers produced in these regions are not only used during Diwali but also find their way into other celebrations, including Ganesh festival immersion, Dasara, weddings, and political rallies, highlighting the year-round nature of this dangerous illegal trade.",

        "title": "Implications of RBI\u2019s securities buyback",
        "text": "Normally, when there is a discussion on markets and liquidity it is invariably on the surpluses or deficits in the system as well as the conduct of liquidity operations by the RBI. A surplus results in variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions and deficits in variable rate repo (VRR) auction. The idea behind this framework is to keep call rates in a corridor of 6.25-6.75 per cent, where the higher limit is supported by the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF). By doing so excess volatility in the market is eschewed. The weighted average call rate in the market also runs in general through a known corridor.\n\nRecently, the RBI carried out the second buyback of securities worth \u20b925,000 crore. The first was on October 10 and the second on October 17. This is distinct from the conventional open market operations calendar of the past where banks would anticipate the liquidity situation in advance and manage their funds accordingly. The announcement of the second buyback does send a signal that there could be more to follow. The securities which are being bought back are of the same tenor for both the auctions. What is one to make of such buybacks?\n\nThe first is that since these securities mature in 2025 or 2026, it does appear that the RBI would like to lower the quantum of short term outstanding loans of the government. This fits in with the general ethos of the government/RBI pitching for debt with longer maturities to avoid too much of bunching up of redemption in the short run.\n\nThe second is that since the overall borrowing of the government has not changed from what was targeted in the Budget, this is not a case of doing a \u2018buy and sell\u2019 transaction to manage the yield curve, as was the case with \u2018operation twist\u2019. It is unequivocally a case of lowering the debt level of the government, as it involves just buybacks of securities by the RBI. Under \u2018operation twist\u2019, securities were bought and sold by the RBI of the same quantum which did not change the quantum of debt but altered the maturity pattern of debt.\n\nThird, this buyback appears to follow from the fact that the government has substantial cash balances which work out to almost upwards of \u20b92 lakh crore on a daily basis. This is a result of a policy of \u2018just in time\u2019 when money is spent only when needed; hence the large tax collections lie with the RBI for extended periods of time until the expenses are incurred. A good way to use these balances is to lower the quantum of overall debt.\n\nFourth, such buybacks help in balancing the interest costs of the government. Some of these securities have a coupon rate of 7.59-8.20 per cent. Hence lowering this quantum of debt due to excess cash available with the government helps to moderate interest payments.\n\nFifth, while overall liquidity in the system is in surplus, there are challenges faced by banks which have been raising higher cost deposits in the form of CDs and bulk deposits to meet credit requirements. With the higher liquidity norms proposed by the RBI (LCR levels), the buyback of securities will provide support to the banking system.\n\nFurther buyback likely\n\nSixth, given that the outstanding debt on these five securities is above \u20b94 lakh crore, there can be further buybacks conducted by the RBI to both provide liquidity as well as to repay debt in advance. In the absence of such buybacks this entire amount would have to be redeemed in FY26 which would affect the net borrowings of the government. Therefore, this should be good news for the market as gross borrowings pressure would also come down. This would enable lowering of the fiscal deficit ratio for FY26. In fact, even for FY25 it is expected that the deficit will be lower than the targeted 4.9 per cent of GDP.\n\nSeventh, the buyback also helps in lowering yields on government paper in the market. By withdrawing these bonds, the supply of paper goes down which pushes up the price and hence lowers yields. Therefore, ideally the 1-year yield should move downwards as these buybacks take place. This can hence be achieved without changing the repo rate which becomes more a benchmark for banks for setting deposits and lending rates.\n\nIt is argued that while both open market operations as well as buybacks do the same thing \u2014 buying back paper of the government \u2014 the motivation is different. In the case of the former the aim is to inject liquidity while in the latter it is also to cool down bond yields.\n\nHence, buyback has become a very potent tool from the point of the view of the RBI to achieve multiple objectives. However, while buybacks do enhance liquidity, interest rates in the call market have still been driven more by what the RBI does when conducting its liquidity management policy.\n\nThe VRRR auction cut-offs which tend to converge just below the repo rate at 6.49 per cent tend to be the benchmark for all transactions. But the call market and T-Bill have moved southwards.\n\nThe writer is Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda. Views are personal\n\nWhile buybacks do enhance liquidity, interest rates in the call market have still been driven more by what the RBI does when conducting its liquidity management policy",

At 10:37 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 80,234.60, up 832 points or 1.05%. Nifty50 was at 24,411.20, up 230 points or 0.95%.Indian stock markets have broken a five-day losing streak amidst persistent foreign selling and disappointing quarterly corporate results. ICICI Bank led the gains, surpassing profit expectations for the September quarter due to strong loan demand.The Nifty 50 has fallen nearly 8% from its all-time high on September 27, weighed down by foreign outflows over the past 20 sessions, as investors shift funds to China due to Beijing's stimulus measures and relatively lower valuations.Analysts noted that weak earnings have also negatively impacted investor sentiment and contributed to the selling pressure, in addition to foreign selling.ICICI Bank, SBI, NTPC, Infosys, Bajaj Finserv, and Tata Motors were the top gainers in the Sensex pack, rising by up to 2.7%. On the other hand, L&T, ITC, Tech Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, and JSW Steel opened lower.IDFC First Bank's shares dropped 10% after reporting a 73% year-on-year decline in profit, falling to Rs 201 crore for the quarter ended September 2024. DLF shares, however, jumped over 4% after the real estate developer reported higher second-quarter profit driven by sales of newly launched houses.The Nifty PSU Bank index rose 2%, led by Bank of Baroda, SBI, and PNB. The Nifty Financial Services, IT, Media, and Metal indices also opened higher. The Nifty mid and small-cap indices opened flat in the broader markets.Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, stated, \"The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations.\"Vijayakumar added, \"The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices. The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets.\"Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking, said, \"After a positive opening, Nifty can find support at 24,150 followed by 24,050 and 23,900. On the higher side, 24,300 can be an immediate resistance, followed by 24,400 and 24,500.\"Asian shares rose Monday, as the yen dipped amid political uncertainty after Japan's ruling party lost its majority in Parliament's lower house in weekend elections. Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 1.6%, South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.1%, and the Shanghai Composite rose 0.3%.On October 25, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 3,036 crore, while domestic institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 4,159 crore.Oil prices fell more than $3 a barrel on Monday after Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran over the weekend avoided Tehran's oil and nuclear facilities and did not disrupt energy supplies, easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Brent was at $72.70 a barrel, down $3.35, or 4.4%, while WTI slipped $3.27, or 4.6%, to $68.51 a barrel.The Indian rupee opened flat at 84.08 against the US dollar in early trade.

However, pressure on the Rupee is expected to persist until FII outflows ease, fuelled in part by high valuations in Indian equities,\" Pabari noted.\n\n The USD-INR pair is anticipated to trade within a narrow range of 83.80 to 84.20, with downside support from the RBI\u2019s reserves, he added.\n\n On the domestic equity market front, Sensex advanced 209.10 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 79,611.39 points. The Nifty rose 13.55 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 24,194.35 points.\n\nForeign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Friday, as they offloaded shares worth \u20b93,036.75 crore, according to exchange data.\n\n Meanwhile, India's forex reserves dropped by $2.163 billion to $688.267 billion for the week ended October 18, the Reserve Bank said on Friday.\n\n In the previous reporting week, the overall kitty had dropped by $10.746 billion to $690.43 billion in one of the largest declines in the reserves in recent times, the RBI said on Friday.",

Angel One, a prominent equity trading platform, paid Rs. 5.75 crore to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to conclude inquiries into multiple alleged rule breaches.\n\nIn March, SEBI had initiated investigations against Angel One through adjudication and inquiry notices regarding certain regulatory matters. The notices sought Angel One's response on why penalties should not be imposed under relevant SEBI laws. After evaluating the case, SEBI's whole-time members approved receiving the recommended amount from Angel One on October 15. The firm transferred the funds on October 23 without accepting or denying the investigation's findings.\n\nThe settlement brings an end to SEBI's inquiries and allows both sides to avoid a lengthy legal process. It remains unclear what specific violations triggered the regulator's action initially. However, Angel One's swift cooperation in resolving the matter through payment suggests the aim was compliance over denial or litigation. The amount also factors in the scale and commercial impact of Angel One's operations.\n\nFor investors, the development highlights SEBI's role in enforcing transparency and oversight of capital markets.

        "title": "Economic policy of Sardar Patel",
        "text": "Er. Prabhat Kishore\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man, has been the foremost among the national heroes of India. In 1946, in view of the possibility of getting independence soon, 13 out of 15 provincial committees of the Congress proposed the name of Sardar Patel for the national president, so that he could become the first Prime Minister of independent India. But despite the proposal of an invincible majority, this could not happen due to the insistence of Gandhi in favour of Nehru and the country was deprived of a strong and practical leadership. This adversely affected the policies of the nation in various domestic and foreign matters, for which we are suffering till date.\n\nSardar's view towards the economic affairs of the country was very practical. It was full of humanity and the need of the hour. More production, equitable distribution, and fair treatment of all the means of production were the mainstays of his economic policy. He made it clear that achieving industrial dexterity and self-reliance through progressive development would be the first goal of the nation, which would increase the prosperity of the common mass and ensure a high standard of living for them. In a speech given in Kolkata on January 5, 1948, he stressed that before nationalization of industries it is necessary to first establish them properly and such people cannot be patriots who believe that workers should reduce production, but they should be given more money.\n\nSardar Patel had realistic views on the planning and economic policy of India. He had emphasized on the co-operation between the three stakeholders, the government, the industrialist and the workers, to counter the economic sickness spreading in the country. He was a staunch supporter of the abolition of control and supported the government's plan to decontrol food and clothing and provide industrial relief. He was opposed to the planning framework which went beyond the country's capacity and resources. He wanted to organize the country's economy on the basis of villages. He firmly believed that once the facilities were provided to the villagers, they would take care of themselves and then their grain production would increase much more than we expected.\n\nPatel was against instilling in the people such hope which would never be fulfilled. He was not against taking foreign loans when needed, which could be spent on production related plans and industrialization. According to Shri N. G. Ranga, in 1936, Rajaji and Sardar Patel had rehearsed that Jawaharlal's socialism would create problems for the social economy of India, so he presided over the Congress and opposed their campaign of socialism from a favorable position. As a result of which Nehru had to wait till the year 1951 i.e. Sardar's death before launching his campaign against the economy of the Indian peasantry and the enterprise of its people.\n\nIn a meeting of Chief Ministers and heads of provincial Congress Committees, Patel clarified that the plan for this country would be different from that of industrialized countries, which were either small in extent or highly developed. Machine is not the complete solution to the problem of this country. Millions of useless hands cannot get work from the machine, because the machine itself displaces man. He emphasized on the expansion of cottage industries, but at the same time called for rapid industrialization in the country to generate sufficient resources, so that the country does not face a serious crisis.\n\nSardar Patel was accused by the so-called socialists of being a friend of the capitalists. He made it clear that on the basis of Gandhiji's teachings, he behaves workers, industrialists, princes, farmers and landlords in equal measure and lovingly inspires them to do the right thing. In the current situation, he was against nationalization. He said that it is necessary to establish industry and increase production in the country before nationalisation. Socialism in England has come there rightly by following the path of industrialization. In India, socialism in true sense lies in the development of cottage industries, which can provide employment to crores of people. By making the spinning wheel more ubiquitous, the concept of Swadeshi can be developed through Khadi.\n\nPatel urged the traders not to import foreign clothes and urged the citizens not to wear it. In order to take a step towards self-reliance, he wrote a letter to the then Industries and Supplies Minister Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookherjee to manufacture the necessary equipments and weapons for the army in the country itself and his idea was supported by the eminent scientist S.S. Bhatnagar. He was of the clear opinion that the pharmaceutical manufacturing industries in India should flourish and there should be no excise duty applicable on inter-provincial trade. He stressed the importance of improving livestock and increasing agricultural production in the country.\n\nSardar Patel wanted to have a good relation between industry and labour, because the differences arising at that time could turn out to be a severe blow to India's industrial future. He insisted on adopting the policy of mediation to solve the problem prevailing between industry and labour, as he had done earlier in Ahmedabad. Although there was a labour government in England and they were far ahead in the field of industrialization, they were moving very slowly towards nationalization. This was likely to lead to industrial peace and good conditions of production. He was strongly against the strike and criticized the organizers who resorted to strikes merely to give importance to their leadership & politics. A strike stops production and less production means promoting poverty. He inspired those who wanted to break this endless cycle.\n\nPatel tried to allay the apprehensions of the industrialists regarding nationalization and assured them that since the industry is yet to be established and expanded, the question of nationalization does not arise. He appealed to the resourceful businessmen to come forward and help the government in improving the condition of the poor and said that when there are crores of people in the country who are hungry, it is a sin to eat comfortably twice a day.\n\nPatel fixed a certain amount for the salary and allowances of the ministers and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and suggested to the Prime Minister that there is no need to deploy more than two security personnel apart from a few policemen to them from the point of view of security. He refused the demand for increase in the allowance payable to the Governor of Odisha. He praised those, who gave up their luxuries to serve the country as a minister or speaker.\n\nIn the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Advisory Council of Industries, Patel told that there is a lot of foreign capital in the country, but after independence it has decreased significantly due to post-World War II inflation, which has increased the prices and taxes have become high. He advised the Finance Minister to re-evaluate the entire taxation according to the current situation in the next budget.\n\nSardar Patel insisted that a committee of experts should be constituted, consisting of industrialists, economists and representatives of the government, who should be entrusted with the task of implementing the framework and policies laid down by the government. The then Prime Minister, Nehru, who had earlier decided to create a separate ministry for social and economic affairs, changed his mind after hearing Sardar's views and agreed to set up a board or special advisory committee, which will monitor the economic situation at every step and submit its suggestions to the government for consideration.\n\nSardar Patel's advice on the economic policies of the nation was not followed after his death. India adopted a so-called socialist framework, due to which there were dire consequences and the country had to pay a heavy price. Communist Russia, which Nehru regarded as the ideal state, had to face unimaginable difficulties and eventually due to its disintegration, it had to return to a free economy in mid-Ninety.\n\nThe liberal steps taken by the Narsimha Rao government shortly before the disintegration and economic ruin of Soviet Russia confirms Patel's foregoing thought and realistic approach. Nehru's socialism had brought the country to such a place that the Congress Government at the Center had to reverse the policies and liberalize the economy, which was not thought of forty years ago.\n\n(The author is a technocrat \n\n& educationist.

This follows a complaint filed with the Prime Minister\u2019s public grievance cell over violation of the Section 106 A(C) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. \n\nKannur-based ophthalmologist and RTI activist K.V. Babu, who had filed the complaint on September 23, was informed on October 23 that Bhargava Phytolabs, the manufacturing company, had not submitted any application for the renewal of the licence. Quoting the State Drugs Controller, Rajasthan, the PMO also said that the licence stood cancelled. \n\nProprietary name \n\nDr. Babu had earlier filed a complaint on January 24 with the Drugs Controller General of India seeking action against the manufacturer under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. Section 106 A(C) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, says that no homoeopathic medicine containing a single ingredient shall bear a proprietary name on its label. The particulars shall either be printed or written in indelible ink and shall appear in a conspicuous manner on the label of the innermost container of any homoeopathic medicine and on every other covering in which the container is packed. \n\nThe Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) sought a review of the licence in June and the Union Ayush Ministry found the labelling incorrect. \u201cMy concern was that a tablet being made available with the name insulin may confuse the patients, who may switch over from insulin injection to the tablets. This could lead to uncontrolled diabetes, especially in children. I approached the PM\u2019s grievance cell as the State Drugs Controller of Rajasthan and the manufacturer refused to budge even after the CDSCO and the Union Ayush Ministry made their stand clear about the illegal labelling,\u201d Dr. Babu said. \n\nIn their reply to the authorities, the manufacturer had said in May that the drug had been \u201clicensed\u201d by the Rajasthan State Drug Licensing Authority. The Ayush Ministry, however, found that the manufacturer was labelling the product as a brand name and indicating its composition saying \u201cEach tablet of 400 mg contains Insulin 6x\u201d. Insulin 6x is a single ingredient drug in this case and writing \u2018Insulin Tablets\u2019 on the label imitating it as a proprietary name was in violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. The Ministry had also noted that the manufacturer may be directed to prominently label the product as \u201cInsulin Homoeopathic trituration tablets\u201d with appropriate potency for which it has obtained licence instead of using \u201cInsulin tablets\u201d as a proprietary name to avoid confusion and misleading information in public interest.",

        "text": "Trading in Gift Nifty indicates a flat opening on Friday and another dull day for domestic markets. Amid mixed global cues, domestic benchmarks are expected to remain range-bound while action will be on the broader markets, said analysts. Stock-specific action will continue based on Q2-FY25 performance, they added.\n\nVikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, PL Capital - Prabhudas Lilladher.\n\nConcerns regarding geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Europe have further fuelled demand for safe-haven assets. As the market navigates these challenges, investors remain cautious amid uncertain economic conditions.\u201d\n\nGift Nifty at 24,450 signals flat opening.\n\nSiddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said that Nifty has been consolidating for the last two sessions following persistent foreign outflows and dull earnings. We expect this range-bound move (Nifty hovering around the 24400-24500 zone) to continue without any major triggers, while the earning season would drive sectorial rotation.\u201d\n\nKey results to watch out for today is BEL, Chola Investment, JSW Steel, HPCL, Coal India, and BPCL, he said.\n\nPranay Aggarwal, CEO of Stoxkart - a discount broker, said: The overall market is currently in an oversold zone, which indicates Doji could be positive for the short term. However, the medium-term trend remains bearish as long as Nifty stays below the 25000 mark. A decisive move above 24500 could trigger a short-term pullback or relief rally following the recent decline. Conversely, a slide below 24300 may increase selling pressure, potentially pushing us down towards 24200 and 24100 levels as well. In summary, traders should adopt a wait-and-watch approach at current levels for any sudden market reactions.",

Arshad pointed out that despite inflation dropping to 6.9 per cent, the interest rate remains at 17.5 per cent, posing serious challenges for the sector, ARY News.He argued that an immediate decrease in interest rates is vital for economic recovery and job creation, as the high borrowing costs threaten the stability of the textile industry. Lower interest rates, he asserted, are essential for fostering economic revival and generating employment opportunities.The report further stated that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb suggested on Wednesday that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) may consider lowering the interest rate further in its upcoming Monetary Policy meeting in November.He noted that the SBP has already reduced its benchmark interest rate by 450 basis points over the last three meetings, bringing it down from a high of 22 per cent to 17.5 per cent.In an interview with Bloomberg during the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, Aurangzeb mentioned that the next meeting on November 4 could lead to another policy rate cut. He also stated that the current government is actively working to increase the share of taxes in the economy to 135 per cent.Currently, the interest rate in Pakistan stands at around 17.5 per cent, following a series of cuts by the SBP in response to economic conditions.The SBP\u2019s adjustments aimed to support economic growth while controlling inflation. Since becoming a member of the IMF in 1950, Pakistan has availed itself of 25 IMF programs, with the most recent being a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) approved in September 2024.This new USD 7 billion loan marks Pakistan\u2019s 25th IMF program since independence in 1947, the highest number of any country, according to Voice of America.",

        "text": "Vijayawada: Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu held a review meeting on energy efficiency programmes at the Secretariat, engaging with officials and representatives from relevant organisations. During the discussion, he approved the release of Rs 150 crore for managing street lights in rural and urban areas, allocating Rs 100 crore specifically for rural gram panchayats and Rs 50 crore for urban locations.Naidu emphasised the need to reduce energy consumption, directing officials to ensure that 100 per cent of street lights are equipped with LED technology. He criticised the previous government for inaction, stating that it had rendered village panchayats ineffective and failed to settle outstanding dues for street light management.To enhance monitoring and management of street lighting, the Chief Minister called for adopting technology, noting that transitioning to LED lights could save 30 to 60 per cent in electricity costs. He urged the revival of successful policies from the previous Telugu Desam government to lead the state in energy efficiency.Additionally, Naidu announced the introduction of electric induction stoves in 55,000 anganwadi centres to reduce reliance on cooking gas. Officials were instructed to coordinate with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) for this initiative.To streamline street light management, Naidu ordered the formation of a three-member committee comprising representatives from the Finance Department, Energy Department, and EESL to provide development reports.In a significant partnership, the state government signed a memorandum of understanding with EESL to supply energy-efficient appliances to 1.5 lakh homes, with plans to extend services to another 900,000 homes. The meeting included key officials, including State Energy Minister Gottipati Ravi Kumar and Municipal Minister P. Narayana, demonstrating a unified effort towards advancing energy efficiency in the state.",

The BSE index slid by over 900 points, while the Nifty fell below the 24,500 mark, marking an erratic day for Indian equities. \n\nAt 3:10 PM, Sensex plunged by 902 points, or 1.11%, to 80,249, and Nifty succumbed to a fall of 1.25%, losing 310 points at 24,471. The sharp fall at both Sensex and Nifty deprived the market of its nearly Rs 8.9 lakh crore in market capitalization, which clearly signifies how turbulent today\u2019s market has been.\n\nFactors Affecting Stock Market Today: Sensex and Nifty in Pressure Zone\n\nThis led to an increase in the stock market today mainly due to profit booking after a strong rally witnessed in the recent sessions. The analysts claimed that the share market was seen witnessing the Sensex and as well as Nifty dip today as there is huge profit-taking going on, which had been spurred by high market valuations. Market experts predict possible corrections and hence Sensex and Nifty saw their reaction to both local and global economic cues.\n\nFII selling hits the stock market today\n\nThe greatest spoiler for the downward slide in the equity market today has been sustained selling by FIIs, seeming to be making the Sensex and as well as Nifty take the downward road. \n\nFIIs have been selling at record levels, offloading Rs 88,244 crore worth of shares alone in October, putting pressure on both indices. The FII selling thus caused appears to be balanced out to a certain extent only by DIIs and not sufficiently to prevent the Sensex and the Nifty from sliding.\n\nGlobal Markets Add to the Woes of Securities Market Today\n\nAgain echoing the woes of the stock market, poor Asian market performances also reflected poorly on the Sensex and as well as Nifty. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi witnessed jarring dips that went through their due share of reverberations in Indian equities. The stock market today saw heavy selling pressure as Sensex and Nifty followed the global trends downwards.\n\nAs the volatile nature of the stock market continues to gain momentum, analysts believe that Sensex and Nifty are unlikely to recover in the short term. Corrections remain in the pipeline.\n\nAlso, see: Bengaluru police arrest Axis Bank manager in Rs 97 crore stock market fraud",

        "title": "Boost for Kashmir apples",
        "text": "Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s (J&K\u2019s) apple industry, the backbone of its agrarian economy, has shaped the region\u2019s social and economic fabric for centuries. As the largest producer of apples in India, the valley\u2019s orchards not only support thousands of livelihoods but also position the region on the global fruit market map. Apple farming is the largest employment generator in J&K, with nearly 3.5 million farmers \u2014 27 per cent of the region\u2019s population \u2014 involved in growing the fruit, whose export contributes more than 8 per cent to the region\u2019s GDP. However, behind this thriving industry lies a crisis of fluctuating market forces, geopolitical tensions, and environmental challenges.\n\nThreats and challenges\n\nKashmir\u2019s apple growers are increasingly relying on cold storage units to navigate fluctuating demand. With over 40 cold storage facilities, mostly in SIDCO Lassipora, capable of holding more than 2.5 lakh tonnes, these controlled-atmospheric units provide a crucial buffer. However, with limited cold storage in Kashmir, many apple growers are left with no choice but to sell early at low prices, or risk watching their produce go to waste.\n\nThe influx of foreign apples has driven down prices for Kashmiri apples, leaving local growers struggling against a tide of cheaper imports. The flood of Iranian, Washington, and South African apples has sharply eroded the dominance of Kashmiri apples. J&K\u2019s apple industry is hindered by the region\u2019s rugged terrain and insufficient infrastructure. The fragile transportation network, often blocked by political instability or harsh weather, further impedes the timely distribution of produce. Erratic weather patterns, particularly frequent hailstorms, devastate orchards.\n\nReviving the orchard\n\nA growing demand for organic and premium apple varieties is reshaping the market, driven by health-conscious consumers. The apple growers in Kashmir are unable to produce organically grown apples. Promoting traditional apples grown organically in Kashmir is essential to safeguard health and preserve the region\u2019s agricultural heritage and enhance sustainability. Hanabi \u2014 an innovative solution (advanced pesticide) to boost apple farming in Kashmir \u2014 must be used in the early stage of rat infestation.\n\nThe National Conference, now at the helm in J&K, must turn their promises into action, especially when it comes to the apple industry. The new government must craft a robust natural farming policy, and must enhance the quality of Kashmiri apples through better farming practices, pest management, and post-harvest handling to meet international standards.\n\nFarmers must be encouraged to diversify their crops or invest in value-added products like apple juice, cider, or dried apples to reduce dependence on fresh apple sales. The Modified High Density Plantation Scheme, set to span 5,500 hectares in J&K from March 2021 to March 2026, embodies a vision for agricultural revitalisation. This scheme could serve as a force for economic growth, empowering farmers and boosting the apple industry through increased productivity and sustainability.\n\nKashmir\u2019s apple growers face triple burden \u2014 spurious pesticides that threaten crops, an erratic climate disrupting yields, and the glaring absence of insurance coverage. This leaves them vulnerable, with little protection for their labour or livelihood. The Market Intervention Scheme for apple procurement in Jammu and Kashmir addresses the needs of perishable agricultural and horticultural commodities excluded from the Minimum Support Price. By stabilising market prices and ensuring timely procurement, this initiative can safeguard farmers\u2019 livelihoods and reduce post-harvest losses.\n\nJ&K\u2019s economy hinges on a single national highway, its vital lifeline to the rest of the country. Yet, this crucial route is often blocked, leaving the region\u2019s trade at a standstill. The highway must be operational round the year, or alternative routes must emerge.\n\nBilal teaches politics at Government Degree College, Beerwah.

        "title": "Coral craze that guided business interests",
        "text": "Working on the history of Coral Merchant Street recently, I mused on how this marine invertebrate has had an importance far exceeding gems. Though the Sephardic Jewish merchants in Madras of the 17th and 18th Centuries traded in many precious stones, it is as coral merchants that they are remembered. And interestingly, it is one of two marine animal products used in jewellery that are commemorated in area names in George Town. After all, the eastern end is still known as Muthialpet (the pearl district), while just to the rear of it, where Coral Merchant Street is, was Pagadalupet (the coral district), though that name is largely forgotten. Of course, pearl and coral make for a good combination in Indian jewellery, but the importance of coral, over and above diamonds and emeralds, is intriguing to say the least. \n\nIn demand since Roman times \n\nIt was corals from the Mediterranean that Indians hankered after, and they were in demand from Roman times. The red variety was much sought after, and Indians were willing to pay high prices. Centuries later, when the colonials came along, the demand was undiminished. In fact, it had multiplied. And the Europeans saw an opportunity. A proper network was established and Portuguese Jewish dealers in London began sending out coral in large quantities to Madras. The proceeds from the sale were invested in diamonds, which were exported from here. Eventually, they sent representatives to settle here and carry on the Indian end of the business. \n\nCompany records are full of references to coral. As I have written in The Hindu dated October 23, 2015 (A Temple and Its Builder), it was by secretly selling a consignment of coral worth 1,200 pounds that Samudra Mudali, dubash to Governor Francis Hastings, made his fortune. In Ananda Ranga Pillai\u2019s diary, Governor Dupleix keeps asking him about the quantity of coral in stock and what prices it would fetch. And, in the 1760s, the enormously corrupt and wily George, Lord Pigot, managed to convince the Company that the Governor of Madras ought to get a 2 \u00bd percent cut on proceeds of all coral sales in the region. The money he made on this was one of the bones of contention with his council, which led to a coup against him and his mysterious death. The commission on coral would last till 1801, when Edward, the Second Lord Clive, as Governor, relinquished it. Having written all the above, I am yet to fathom what was the reason for such a high demand for coral. That it was in use for jewellery is certain, and it was also probably used as a constituent in aphrodisiacs, but what else could have contributed to the craze? By the 19th Century, it was on the wane and had become yet another item on ornaments. But while it lasted, it had a good run, and many in Madras did well out of it. \n\nNew light on New Street \n\nLast week\u2019s article on New Street had M.S.R. Ravichandran writing to me. He has been living there for five decades, he says, and his ancestors have been residents there for four generations. Though they always referred to it as Pudu Theru (New Street), he says land records from 1880 carry the name Sengazhuneer Pillaiyar Koil Street and there is a temple to Ganesha at the end of the thoroughfare. That had me checking my street directory of 1932 and sure enough, that is the correct name. Why did it become New Street and when remains a mystery. \n\n(V. Sriram is a writer and historian.)",

        "title": "Opinion: Save Indigenous languages",
        "text": "By Geetartha Pathak\r\n\r\nOn October 3, the Centre approved five new classical languages: Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali. This increased the total number of recognised classical languages in India to 11, which includes Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia. Some critics said political motivations could be behind such a move.\r\n\r\nThe Shiv Sena-BJP-led government in Maharashtra formed a \u201cpersuasion\u201d committee, led by former diplomat Dnyaneshwar Muley, a few months ago to get Marathi recognised as a classical language. The demand was raised many times by MPs from Maharashtra in Parliament, and the Centre gave assurances at least three times in the last 10 years that Marathi was being considered for according classical status.\r\n\r\nOdia was declared a classical language in 2014 after much political persuasion. Interestingly, Odia, which is viewed by many as a dialect of Bengali, got recognition as a classical language ten years before Bengali was recognised as a classical language. The Assembly elections in Maharashtra is next month and the timing of recognising Marathi as a classical language indicates the political angle to it. The inclusion of Bengali and Assamese too may have some link with the nearing of Assembly elections in these two States.\r\n\r\nDropping Key Provision\r\n\r\nThe Union Cabinet\u2019s decision to accord classical language status to these five languages came after a key provision, which mandated that a language must have an original literary tradition, was dropped. The Linguistic Expert Committee discussed and understood that it was very difficult to prove or disprove (original literary tradition) as all ancient languages borrowed from each other.\r\n\r\nThe initial criteria evolved by the government to determine the declaration of a language as classical are: it should have high antiquity of its early texts, recorded history of over 1,500-2,000 years, a body of ancient literature or texts that is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers, the literary tradition should be original and not borrowed from another speech community. Another criterion is that the said language and literature should be distinct from its modern format; there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots.\r\n\r\nOnce notified, the Education Ministry provides certain benefits to promote the language, which include two major annual international awards for scholars of eminence in the said languages. Apart from this, a centre of excellence for studies in the classical language is set up, and the University Grants Commission is requested to create a certain number of Professional Chairs in central universities for the languages that get the classical tag. These measures may help to some extent but to ensure the survival and growth of such languages much more efforts are needed. Moreover, all the 11 recognised classical languages are dominating languages in their respective States. The languages of the indigenous and tribal people need more attention as many such languages are vanishing fast.\r\n\r\nEndangered Language\r\n\r\nThe UNESCO recorded that 2,469 languages are at risk of extinction. With globalisation, major languages like English are pushing the languages with few speakers to the deathbed. Migration, cultural fusion and absence of written script are some of the reasons for the disappearance of languages. One of the examples of endangered language is Irish, which is also known as Gaeilge. It is an official language of the Republic of Ireland but is endangered due to historical factors and language shifts. Half of the languages that exist today worldwide will disappear over the next century. In Latin America and the Caribbean, one in every five indigenous people has already lost their native tongue \u2014 44% now speak Spanish and 55% Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThere are 7,000 documented languages currently spoken across the world, but half of them could be endangered, according to a new study. It is predicted that 1,500 known languages may no longer be spoken by the end of this century. Researchers from The Australian National University analysed thousands of languages to identify factors that put endangered ones at risk. The findings highlight a link between higher levels of schooling and language loss, as regionally dominant languages taught in class often overshadow indigenous languages.\r\n\r\nThe link between the endangering of language and more roads or climate change may sound like an absurd likelihood, however, it is real. \u201cWe found that the more roads there are, connecting country to city, and villages to towns, the higher the risk of languages being endangered. It is as if roads are helping dominant languages \u2018steamroll\u2019 over other smaller languages,\u201d said Professor Lindell Bromham, co-author of the above-mentioned study. Climate changes oblige the communities to relocate, creating climate change refugees. The catastrophes caused 23.7 million internal displacements in 2021, most of which were due to meteorological consequences.\r\n\r\nWith the material development, indigenous people are losing their land which is often appropriated by corporations vying to get a hold of natural resources. When biodiversity disappears, they lose access to their only source of livelihood. They are then forced to migrate to other rural or urban areas. When these communities split up, their languages begin to face a slow death. The split communities are often compelled to communicate with the dominant language of their new homes and over generations, the traditional tongues become extinct.\r\n\r\nPreserving Them\r\n\r\nWith each indigenous language that disappears, thinking, culture, tradition and the knowledge it encompasses is lost. Allowing a language to disappear is like burning books or bombing museums in wartime. An important part of humanity, its history and way of understanding the world disappear forever when this happens. Many of the languages predicted to be lost in future still have many speakers. Therefore, investing in supporting these Indigenous communities to revitalise their languages may alter the trend of vanishing languages.\r\n\r\nThe Rosetta Project, a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers is working to build a digital library of human languages. The project draws attention to the accelerated loss of the world\u2019s languages and could help preserve many endangered and \u201csleeping\u201d languages for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe UNESCO International Decade of Indigenous Languages, from 2022 to 2032, aims to engage the global community with the critical issue of language loss. The initiative continues the work of the UN\u2019s 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. As part of its plan, it is creating a network of international stakeholders focused on protecting the rights of Indigenous people to revitalise and preserve their languages. Cornish, a dead language spoken in a part of England, was revived with the help of the internet. People found each other online and communities around Cornish were formed. The language has even found its way back into schools. SGaawaay K\u2019uuna, the first feature-length film made completely in Haida, a Canadian indigenous language, encouraged film production in endangered languages. In 2018, it was honoured as the best Canadian film by the Vancouver International Film Festival and Vancouver Film Critics Circle.\r\n\r\nThe government of India should pay more attention to the dwindling Indigenous languages than according recognition to a handful of mainstream languages that too with political motivation and chalk out a project in line with the UNESCO and Rosetta Project, which may save many local communities\u2019 languages from extinction and our rich diverse human heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(The author is a senior journalist from Assam)",

He paid Rs 30 at the counter, expecting the clerk to return 50 paise since the postal fee for the specified destination was Rs 29.50.When Manasha insisted that the balance be returned, he was informed that the system automatically rounded off the amount to Rs 30. He then offered to pay the exact amount through UPI, which the post office declined by citing a technical issue.Manasha mentioned in his complaint to District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that India Post's alleged practice of rounding off daily transactions could lead to significant amounts of money being siphoned off, even resulting in black money and a loss of GST revenue for the government. The post office stated that amounts involving less than 50 paise were invariably \"ignored\" and that the software had been programmed to round off any such amount to the nearest rupee.On Manasha not being allowed to pay through UPI, the post office explained that the \"Pay U\" QR digital payment mode had been malfunctioning since Nov 2023 and was discontinued in May 2024. After hearing both sides, the commission said the post office had admitted to \"overcharging\" due to a software glitch, which amounted to an unfair trade practice under Section 2(47) of Consumer Protection Act, 2019.",

        "text": "Krishna is the avatar of Lord Vishnu that happened in the Dwapara yuga. The very purpose of this avatar was to eliminate the negative forces that existed during that time. Another linked incident is the three incarnations of Jaya and Vijaya, the door guardians of Vishnu. Third of their incarnation was Shishupala and Dantavakra. Vishnu taking the form of Krishna eliminated Shishupala and Dantavakra pair.\n\n\u2018Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum\u2019 is the prayerful reminder we have for ourselves. Krishna is the chaitanya, consciousness that prevails in all. Universal consciousness when took the human form, it assumed the shape and rupa of Sri Krishna. This is the reason we find that irrespective of number of problems Krishna faced in life, he was unperturbed. He was unshaken. Krishna is the epitome of the vyavahara gyana and also para vidya.\n\nBorn to imprisoned parents and inside the prison is not a good experience for any. Then getting separated from parents, growing up in a different context, and like \u2018one among them\u2019 could be done only by Krishna. Multiple attempts on the life of Sri Krishna have no parallel. Ranging from calf to donkey to cart to storm, the danger could come in any shape and form. One has to be constantly aware of. The final call came from the suspicious Kamsa that the brothers are \u201cinvited\u201d for the yagya that happened at the capital. The only aim was to eliminate brother duo. The attempt failed, and Kamsa lost life.\n\nKrishna\u2019s attached detachment is a wonder to be observed. The large group of Gopis owned up Krishna, and he never made it appear that he doesn\u2019t belong to them. Though he is worshiped as and the shloka-pada says \u2018Rukmini Satyabhamabhyam sahitam Sri Krishnam ashraye\u2019, many had Krishna as a part of them. He appreciated it, and allowed them the ownership of him. He was with everyone, and everyone felt he was only with them.\n\nPartha could win due to the \u2018Sarathi\u2019 he had. When the guiding light of life becomes Krishna, then our journey gets natural illumination. No false steps or mis-directions happen. Every step and every act shall be filled with dharma, balancing life with all the right acts for \u2018iha\u2019 and required acts for \u2018para\u2019 shall happen. Bliss shall prevail.\n\nDr S Ainavolu is a Mumbai-based teacher of Management and Tradition. Intent is nextgen\u2019s learning and cultural education",

The tournament will begin on October 26 and will conclude on December 19. In the upcoming edition of the Quaid-e-Azam, 18 teams will take part in the competition spread out into 16 regions.Lahore and Karachi have named two teams each. Karachi Whites will be keen to defend their title. Last year, only eight teams participated in the tournament, and four years ago, only six teams featured in Quaid-e-Azam. \u201cQuaid-e-Azam Trophy is the pinnacle of domestic cricket in Pakistan as it is not just a tournament but also an event that showcases the immense talent across the country and prepares them for the challenges of international cricket. As always, we will continue to provide the best possible platform for players to excel and show their capabilities on the biggest stage in domestic cricket as they will be rubbing their shoulders with the best players of the country,\u201d Abdullah Niazi, the director of domestic operations, said in a statement. \u201cEarlier, we demonstrated a successful Champions One-Day Cup and are fully committed to strengthening our domestic structure. The successful execution of Quaid-e-Azam Trophy remains at the heart of this commitment,\u201d he added. A couple of days ago, the fate of Quaid-e-Azam was unclear. According to ESPNcricinfo, the tentative date for the tournament was October 20. ESPNcricinfo reported that the competition was postponed because the domestic cricket department was awaiting the chairman\u2019s sign-off. The Quaid-e-Azam will perfectly set Pakistan\u2019s upcoming Test series. With the final beginning on December 19, the PCB will have options to evaluate players before the first Test against South Africa on December 26. Pakistan\u2019s Test vice-captain, Saud Shakeel, suggested that the squad for the series should be prepared by using first-class competition. \u201cIf you want to prepare for SENA [series in South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia], you can do it during practice and first-class cricket. If there\u2019s first-class cricket before South Africa, we could prepare those kinds of pitches there. But we should prepare pitches and conditions series-by-series, and according to the opposition,\u201d Shakeel said in a press conference on Tuesday. (ANI)",

Mishra advises adjusting trades accordingly and cautions against adding to losing positions.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities notes that Nifty's short-term trend remains negative, and a decisive move below the 24,500-25,450 range could open the door for a further downside target of 24,000.

        "text": "Hindustan Zinc, owned by Vedanta and India\u2019s largest zinc and silver producer, has initiated a $2-2.5 billion (\u20b930,000 crore) capex plan to double its metal production to over 2 million tonnes, \u201cat least five-year period\u201d. \n\nThe company, in the coming weeks, will be engaging global contractors who would look at mine expansion and development. \n\n Mined metal will include doubling zinc capacity to 2 mt, lead and silver from 800 tonnes to 2000 tonnes.\n\n The company recently roped in a couple of international consultants - two Australian mine-planning and mine-contracting entities. It has also engaged a consultant to work on expanding zinc smelting capacity, a mix of greenfield and brownfield diversification. \n\n According to Arun Misra, CEO, Hindustan Zinc, the report they have said the mines have to be developed in a particular manner to make adequate ore for 2 million tonnes. \n\n \u201cSo for that, we are now inviting discussions with mining contractors who are global players. The mines have to be expanded. And around November-end or so, we should be able to fix the global contractor, whom we will appoint for starting the mine development,\u201d he told businessline during an interaction. Mine development apparently is the first part, following which production can take place.\n\n \u201cInvestments will be around $2 \u2013 2.5 billion or so, and it will be a through a mix of internal accruals and debt. We are working out the details and will be presenting it before the Board soon. However, these investments will be spread over a few years,\u201d Misra added. \n\n For FY25, the company has guided for a mined metal production of 1.2 mt and in H1 its production was around 0.52 mt. \n\n\u201cSo we are on course with our guidance. And sequentially mined metal capacities will be upped, say from 1.2 mt to 1.3 mt in the following year and so on,\u201d he said. \n\n The FY25 guidance also include 1.075 - 1.1 mt refined metal, and 750-775 tonnes saleable silver, with mined metal target of 1.2 mt to be achieved in FY26. \n\n During the recent analyst call, the Hindustan Zinc top brass said, expansion of capacity (mined metal) includes working-out on the logistics of how to transport the material out of the mine and then the concentrator expansion. Both these are \u201cfeasible and very easy to do\u201d. \n\n \u201cAs far as this 2 million tonne is concerned, project is feasible. There is no doubt on that. It is only the mining contractor\u2019s appointment and to see how the adequate metal in concentrate can be produced from the mine,\u201d the CEO had said.\n\n The company has however not shared how the production will be split across its existing mines. It operates six mines, all of which are located in Rajasthan. It has three smelter. Zinc smelting alone accounts of over 913,000 tonnes per annum. \n\n \u201cLet the project be done. But of course, we would love to have as much production from Agucha because that is the highest grid. And the biggest expansion that can happen with the current operations from is in Zawar mine, where (virgin) resources are available. So we will have to make a combination,\u201d Misra further said during the call. \n\n Consultant firm Systematix in a recent report said the company\u2019s growth trajectory \u201cappears to be fully priced in,\u201d and \u201cthe growth here-on is hinged on smelter capacity expansion and commissioning of the fertilizer plant in FY26\u201d.",

The local currency has been struggling to recover since October 11, when it closed at its lowest level of 84.10 against the dollar.\n\nAlso read: BRICS currency: A long-term possibility\n\nAccording to analysts, the rupee has been under pressure due to the selling rush by foreign investors in pursuit of better gains from the Chinese market.\n\nAlso, they said, the US treasury yields surging to record levels raised concerns that the Federal Reserve may slow down its rate cut move, steering investors towards safe-haven assets.\n\nAnuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, the rupee traded on a flat note amid strong US dollar and rising US treasury yields. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, rose by 0.28 per cent to 104.19.\n\nHe said the dollar strengthened amid uncertainty over US Presidential elections, while bond yields surged on the possibility of a rise in US fiscal deficit.\n\nIMF's global growth forecast of 3.2 per cent, slower than its previous projection of 3.2 per cent, also impacted investor sentiment.\n\nChoudhary further added that investors may take cues from PMI data from the US this week. \"USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of 83.90 to 84.30,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 1.17 per cent to $75.15 per barrel in futures trade.\n\nOn the domestic equity market front, Sensex declined 138.74 points, or 0.17 per cent, to settle at 80,081.98 points.

I am satisfied that we got a very good response then what we expected. It is a very big thing that we got investment proposals worth Rs 2,81,000 crores in the five Regional Industry Conclaves held in the state so far,\u201d CM Yadav said. The Chief Minister also held a meeting with investors during the Conclave themed as Vibrant Vindhya.Consultant of Jakson Group, Jiya Manjari who attended the conclave spoke to ANI and shared her experience saying that they came to explore the Rewa region. She also highlighted that they already invested Rs 800 crores in the state and were working with the state. \u201cWe came here to just explore the Rewa region. We have already invested Rs 800 crores in the state and we are working with the state, but we are exploring other nearby regional areas also where we can explore something good and better for solar, renewable, green energy,\u201d Manjari told ANI. Meanwhile, CMD of Star Agronomics Limited, Ramesh Singh said that they have planned to set up a Compressed Biogas (CBG) plant in all the 55 districts of Madhya Pradesh and it will help in creating a lot of job opportunities in the state.\u201cWe belong to star groups and presently star groups deal with automobile industries. Now, we are switching to other industries and as of now we have planned to set up CBG plants of around 10 to 20 tonne capacity in every district of Madhya Pradesh. Our CBG plant will be different from the current CBG plants. Present plants are based on Municipal waste but for the first time we will develop the plant based on napier grass. This grass can be grown. We held a meeting with the CM for the same and he asked his team to guide us and implement it,\u201d Singh told ANI. \u201cThis plant will help in creating a lot of job opportunities. One plant will provide direct employment to around 400 people and subsequently around 500 more people will also get employment indirectly who will be engaged in transportation and other arrangements. The waste material from the plant will be natural manure and it will also promote organic farming,\u201d he added. CMD of Rama Group, Naresh Goyal said that they already had a plywood industry in Vindhya region and they were planning for its expansion which will result in creation of a lot of job opportunities. Additionally it will also help in increasing the income of the farmers as raw material required will be argo wood based things. \u201cWe already have a plywood industry in the Vindhya region and we are planning for its expansion. We have a meeting with CM Mohan Yadav and if our legal formalities are resolved then we will expand the plywood industry with an investment of Rs 100 crore. It will create a lot of job opportunities and the raw material used in it is argo wood based things which are grown by the farmers and its plant gets ready in 2-3 years. As a result of which the income of the farmers will also increase,\u201d Goyal said. Additionally, MD and CEO of Dalmia Bharat Limited, Puneet Dalmia told ANI, \u201cI am very excited and inspired to see such an event which is a regional event. Usually, all the conclaves happen in big cities. Still, I think we need to have conclaves in smaller cities like Rewa for a balanced development in India as it inspires many people. I am seeing a real impact of the double-engine government and Development is happening at a very fast pace.\u201d\u201cMadhya Pradesh is a land of opportunity, it has minerals, forest, tourism opportunities, and it has manpower who are very simple people. This state is strategically located at the centre of India and it has great opportunity for growth and a huge market. We want to be a part of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s growth story and we want to contribute to India\u2019s growth,\u201d Dalmia said. He further added that they wanted to make an investment of Rs 3,000 crores to set up a cement plant which would run on 100 per cent green energy and it would be the first such plant in the world. Besides, MP Minister Prahlad Patel praised Chief Minister Mohan Yadav saying it was the result of the CM\u2019s resolve and he had never seen a better situation than this in the state before.\u201cThis is the result of the resolve of the Chief Minister. I have never seen a better situation than this in Madhya Pradesh before. Investors have great confidence in the state administration.

The panel heard at length Dr K.A. Paul Kilari Anand Paul, party in person who pointed out to the court the anguish and sorrow of those suffering \u201cunprecedented demolitions\u201d. The panel of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J. Sreenivas Rao are hearing a petition based on print, electronic, and social media reports. The petitioner pointed out that over 462 structures were pulled down by HYDRAA and that there was no respect to the rule of law in such large-scale demolitions. Even as the party in person made his plea citing global parallels, additional advocate general Imran Khan assured the court that the government was committed to the rule of law. He said that the government would strictly adhere to the procedure prescribed by the law. For a while, the court witnessed conflicting presentations on whether there were demolitions on the banks of river Musi. Since the petitioner relied highly on a recent judgment of the apex court, the panel observed that the said judgment would not apply in the instant case. Distinguishing the recent apex court judgment on large scale evictions, the panel pointed out that they did not apply to encroachments on river and water bodies. It not only recorded that the government had not filed its response to the allegations but it also held that in view of the undertaking given by the state, there was no need to pass an interim order. The panel in fact recorded its appreciation to the statement of additional advocate general reiterating the state government\u2019s commitment to the rule of law and said that no interim orders were necessary.",

        "title": "India's Ethanol Push: A Path to Energy Security",
        "text": "New Delhi: India is taking significant steps toward securing its energy future by embracing sustainable practices like ethanol blending. As the world\u2019s third-largest energy consumer, the country has traditionally depended on oil imports to meet its growing energy demands. This reliance not only poses challenges to energy security but also leads to a substantial outflow of foreign currency. However, with ethanol blending, India has a promising opportunity to reduce its dependence on imported oil while addressing environmental concerns. Ethanol, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, can be mixed with petrol, cutting down on fossil fuel consumption and reducing harmful carbon emissions that contribute to climate change and public health issues. The practice of blending ethanol with petrol began in 2001 as a pilot project. Yet, for many years, progress was slow, and ethanol production remained stagnant. Only recently, through a series of comprehensive reforms, has India been able to unlock the full potential of this initiative. These reforms are now driving substantial outcomes, not just by enhancing energy security, but also by revitalizing rural economies. Ethanol production offers a new source of income for farmers, supporting the agricultural sector and fostering economic growth in rural areas. The government\u2019s proactive approach to ethanol blending is evident in its decision to advance the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending from 2030 to 2025, demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable energy practices. During the 7th G-STIC Delhi Conference, Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, emphasized India\u2019s growing success in ethanol blending and its broader commitment to sustainable energy solutions. He highlighted that, in recognition of the progress made, the government has already begun planning for the future by exploring goals beyond the 20% ethanol blending target. This forward-looking approach indicates that India is not only focused on meeting its immediate energy needs but is also preparing for long-term sustainable energy solutions to address future demands. Ethanol is one of the primary biofuels, naturally produced through the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or through petrochemical processes like ethylene hydration. It is widely used not only as an alternative fuel source but also in various industries as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds. Ethanol also has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant, adding to its versatile uses. In the context of India\u2019s rising energy demand, driven by factors such as a growing economy, an expanding population, increasing urbanization, and evolving lifestyles, ethanol plays a critical role. As of March 2024, around 98 per cent of the fuel used in the road transportation sector comes from fossil fuels, while only two per cent is met by biofuels like ethanol. This dependency on fossil fuels presents challenges related to energy security, foreign currency outflow, and environmental impact. Ethanol, as a domestically produced biofuel, offers a strategic opportunity to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuels. When used responsibly, biofuels like ethanol are more environmentally friendly and sustainable, contributing to a cleaner energy landscape. Additionally, ethanol production and usage align with national goals like generating employment, promoting the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, supporting the Swachh Bharat Mission, and contributing to the doubling of farmers' incomes. It also fosters the creation of wealth from waste, further enhancing its importance to India\u2019s economy and energy security. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has embarked on a series of comprehensive reforms aimed at enhancing energy security, combating climate change, and boosting the rural economy. An indicative target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol was initially set for 2030 under the EBP Programme. However, in 2020, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) advanced this target to 2025, reflecting the government's commitment to accelerating ethanol usage. The progress of India\u2019s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme has been noteworthy, with the ethanol production capacity more than doubling in the last four years to reach 1,623 crore litres as of September 18, 2024. This substantial increase highlights the government's commitment to enhancing the role of ethanol in the nation\u2019s energy landscape. In the Ethanol Supply Year (ESY), which runs from November to October, the blending of ethanol with petrol stood at 38 crore litres with a blending percentage of 1.53 per cent in ESY 2013-14. Over the following years, the government implemented various initiatives that led to remarkable growth in ethanol blending. By ESY 2020-21, the blending volume surged to 302.3...",

        "text": "Shares of Hindustan Unilever tumbled 6 per cent on Thursday after 2.3 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit at \u20b92,595 crore in September 2024 quarter as against \u20b92,657 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. \n\nHUL\u2019s home care/ beauty and well-being segments grew 8.1 per cent y-o-y, while foods & refreshment or personal care decreased 2.5 per cent. Company bagged mixed responses from brokerages as they flagged concerns about volume growth, demand recovery and product portfolio across segments. \n\nNuvama Institutional Equities mentioned Hindustan Unilever has posted an overall in-line Q2 FY25 against its estimates. However, the volume growth was at 3 per cent y-o-y, below street\u2019s forecast of 4-5 per cent. \u201cA gradual rural recovery along with pricing growth coming back in H2FY25E/26E bodes well for HUL\u2019s long-term growth trajectory,\u201d it said. The brokerage has given buy rating on HUL at an increased target price of \u20b93,395 against \u20b93,375 earlier.\n\nAlso read: F5 partners with Nvidia to boost AI application performance \n\nMotilal Oswal has reiterated buy rating at a target price of \u20b93,200. \u201cDemand trends remained stable, with moderate growth in urban areas and a stable recovery in rural regions,\u201d Motilal analysts said. Diverse product basked is expected to support steady growth recovery. However, Motilal Oswal has cut EPS estimates by 2 per cent each for FY25 and FY26.\n\nHUL remains HDFC Securities\u2019 top pick within the large-cap staples pack, as the worst is behind in terms of muted volume growth, pricing corrections, and rural weakness. The brokerage has maintained buy rating at a target price of \u20b93,200.\n\nJM Financial, which has assigned buy rating at a revised target price of \u20b92,870 from \u20b92,915 earlier, emphasised the moderation in urban market has come as a negative surprise. \n\nAmit Agarwal, Senior VP \u2013 Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities, stated that the inflation in crude palm oil and tea weighed on gross margins. Against expectations, HUL\u2019s competitive actions or new formulation in tea and soaps did not translate into volume growth, while home care and beauty segments were the bright spots in an otherwise tepid quarter, he added.\n\nAnalysts of Yes Securities have maintained neutral stance on HUL stock at a target price of \u20b92,845. HUL\u2019s Q2 results were in-line with their estimates. Underlying volume growth (UVG) decline in soaps and tea was offset by high-single-digit UVG in fabric wash & household care, the report read.\n\nAnalysts of Centrum Institutional Research have retained \u2018reduce\u2019 rating on HUL at a target price of \u20b92,697. They expect gradual recovery in the discretionary spends and inherent distribution strength to drive beauty & well-being, and GSK-CH business. Though margins could remain in tight band, given inflationary cycle and high ad-spends.\n\nIce cream business\n\nThe FMCG major also announced separation of its ice cream business, which contributed 3 per cent to the company\u2019s turnover. \n\nNuvama believes that exiting ice cream business is not the best option emphasising it as a high-growth business. \n\nHUL is the second strong player in this \u201chigh investment and low-margin business\u201d.

        "title": "How to Open an FD Account with Attractive Interest Rates",
        "text": "Fixed Deposits (FDs) remain one of the most preferred investment options, especially for risk-averse individuals seeking a stable return. The guaranteed returns, relatively higher interest rates compared to a regular savings account, and flexibility in tenure make FDs a popular choice for many. However, with a wide variety of banks and financial institutions offering FD accounts, it's essential to know how to open FD account with attractive interest rates to maximise your returns.\nIn this article, we will explore the steps to open an FD account, discuss what to look for when selecting an FD, and highlight ways to secure the best FD interest rate for your investment.\nUnderstanding Fixed Deposits Before diving into how to open FD account, it's crucial to understand what a Fixed Deposit is. FDs are term deposits offered by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). You deposit a lump sum amount for a fixed tenure, and the bank offers a predetermined FD interest rate for that period. At the end of the tenure, you receive your principal along with the accrued interest.\nThe interest rate on FDs varies depending on the bank or financial institution, the tenure, and the type of FD (cumulative or non-cumulative). Some institutions may offer senior citizens and existing customers preferential interest rates.\nSteps to open FD account Opening an FD account is relatively simple and can be done through both online and offline channels. Heres a detailed guide on how to open FD account.\n1. Choose the Right Financial Institution The first and most crucial step is to choose the right bank or NBFC. Different banks offer varying FD interest rates based on the deposit amount and tenure. Its essential to compare interest rates from multiple institutions to find the most attractive offer. While banks are considered safer, NBFCs often offer higher interest rates but come with slightly higher risk. Ensure the institution is reputed and offers secure services.\n2. Determine the Investment Amount Once you've selected a financial institution, the next step is to decide how much you want to invest. The minimum deposit required for an FD account can vary between institutions, ranging from as low as \u00e2\u0082\u00b91,000 to higher amounts for special schemes. Decide your investment based on your financial goals, liquidity requirements, and the FD interest rate offered.\n3. Select the Tenure FDs come with varying tenures, ranging from seven days to ten years. You can select a short-term or long-term FD based on your financial needs. Usually, longer tenures offer better interest rates, but it's crucial to evaluate your liquidity needs before locking in your money for an extended period. If you are looking for attractive returns, opt for a tenure that offers a higher FD interest rate without compromising your financial flexibility.\n4. Choose Between Cumulative and Non-Cumulative FD When opening an FD account, you need to decide between cumulative and non-cumulative options. In a cumulative FD, interest is compounded and paid at the end of the tenure, offering a higher return. A non-cumulative FD pays interest at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually). If youre looking for regular income, a non-cumulative FD might be better, while a cumulative FD is ideal if youre focused on long-term wealth building.\n5. Apply to open FD account Once youve finalised the institution, amount, tenure, and type of FD, the next step is to apply to open FD account. This can be done online or by visiting a bank branch. If you are an existing customer of the bank, opening an FD online is straightforward and quick.\nFor offline account opening, visit the nearest branch of the bank or NBFC with the required documents, including proof of identity, proof of address, and passport-sized photographs. Complete the application form and submit the documents to the bank representative. Once your application is processed, your FD account will be opened.\n6. Monitor the FD Interest Rates Interest rates fluctuate depending on market conditions and the policies of financial institutions. To secure the best FD interest rate, keep an eye on the current rates before opening your FD account. Some institutions also offer promotional interest rates during specific periods, which can help you earn higher returns. Regular monitoring of interest rates ensures that you open your FD at the best possible time.\nSecuring Attractive FD Interest Rates When opening an FD account, your primary goal is to maximise the FD interest rate to grow your wealth effectively. Here are some strategies to secure attractive interest rates:\n1. Compare Rates Across Banks and NBFCs Interest rates on FDs vary significantly between institutions. It's essential to compare rates across different banks and NBFCs to find the best option. Some financial institutions offer higher rates for specific tenures or during promotional periods. Additionally, NBFCs generally offer better rates than banks, although they may carry slightly higher risk.\n2. Opt for Special FD Schemes Many banks offer special FD schemes with higher interest rates for specific tenures or deposit amounts. These schemes are often available for limited periods, and they can provide a substantial boost to your returns. Keep an eye out for these offers when you decide to open FD account.\n3. Look for Senior Citizen Benefits If you're a senior citizen, you can take advantage of preferential interest rates offered by most banks and NBFCs. Typically, senior citizens receive an additional 0.25% to 0.50% interest on top of the standard rates. This can significantly enhance your returns.\n4. Consider Long-Term FDs Longer-term FDs generally offer higher interest rates than short-term ones. If you can afford to lock your funds for an extended period, consider choosing a long-term FD with a higher FD interest rate. However, ensure you dont require liquidity during the tenure, as premature withdrawals may lead to penalties and lower interest earnings.\nThe Impact of FD Interest Rates on Your Returns The FD interest rate plays a crucial role in determining the returns on your investment. A higher interest rate ensures that your deposit grows faster. To understand the impact of interest rates, consider using an FD calculator. This tool helps you calculate your estimated earnings based on the deposit amount, tenure, and interest rate, allowing you to choose the best option for your needs.\nBefore opening an FD account, also take into account the frequency of interest compounding (monthly, quarterly, or annually) as it can affect your total returns. Compounding at shorter intervals leads to higher returns.\nConclusion Opening an FD account with attractive FD interest rates requires careful planning and research. Begin by comparing the interest rates offered by various banks and NBFCs, and choose a tenure and type of FD that aligns with your financial goals. Whether youre looking for long-term wealth accumulation or regular income, FDs can be a reliable investment option. Always keep an eye on promotional rates and special schemes that can help you earn higher returns.\nCheck more details at www.bajajfinserv.in/investments/fixed-deposit \nWith the right strategy and timely decisions, you can open FD account that maximises your savings and secures your financial future. By selecting a bank or NBFC that offers attractive interest rates, opting for tax-saving FDs, and monitoring market trends, you can ensure your fixed deposit yields optimal results.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: Former MP and senior BRS leader B Vinod Kumar on Monday held Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy responsible for the economic downturn in Telangana within a short span of 10 months. He accused the Congress government of neglecting the State\u2019s financial health, which witnessed significant growth under former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao.\r\n\r\nAddressing a press meet at Telangana Bhavan here, Vinod Kumar rubbished the false propaganda of the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues about the previous BRS government obtaining loans at huge interest rates. He pointed out that Telangana\u2019s loans under the BRS regime were taken at the lowest interest rates among Southern States, leading to a GSDP of Rs 16 lakh crore, or $200 billion.\r\n\r\n\"A comparison of the interest payments on budgetary borrowings of the Southern States reveals that Telangana stood at the bottom with Rs 32,920 crore in 2022-23. But it is unclear as to how the Ministers arrived at the figure Rs 72,000 crore per annum on interest payments,\" he said. He stated that the interest payments on budgetary borrowings as percentage of revenue receipts was 13.69 which was the second lowest after Karnataka among Southern States.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Revanth Reddy had not taken any significant steps to stabilize the State's financial position, with only liquor sales showing growth, while other revenues declined. He pointed out contradictions in Revanth Reddy's speeches on economic policies. He blamed Revanth Reddy for failing to attract investments, citing the impact of real estate sector issues and HYDRAA demolitions. \"Revanth Reddy speaks of turning Telangana into a trillion-dollar economy, but his governance doesn't reflect that ambition,\" Kumar said, urging the Congress government to stop \"defaming Telangana\" with poor economic policies.",

        "text": "Tirupati: Tobacco growers in Andhra Pradesh are enjoying a windfall this season, as a surge in demand has led to record-breaking prices, with some farmers earning as much as Rs 360 per kg for premium-quality tobacco. The favourable market conditions have turned the 2023-24 season into one of the most profitable years in recent memory, attracting widespread attention from growers hoping to cash in.This season, tobacco sales across the Nellore district reached 46.8 million kg, with the highest average prices ever recorded at multiple auction centers. Farmers are thrilled, and many are already preparing to expand their acreage next year despite warnings from officials about overproduction and rising land lease costs.In the Southern Light Soils (SLS) region, which comprises the auction centers Kandukur-1, Kandukur-2, DC Palli and Kaligiri, sales commenced on March 6. Auctions at DC Palli and Kaligiri closed on October 14, while the Kandukur-1 centre concluded on Monday. The auction process stretched over 140 days, longer than usual. The highest quality tobacco attracted a record price of Rs 360 per kg, a first in the SLS region. The average price at various centres for the 2023-24 season was Rs 270 per kg, a notable Rs 50 increase from the previous year's Rs 220. \u201cWe have never seen prices like this in my 20 years of farming. I was able to sell my crop for an average of Rs 270 per kg. This season has been life-changing for us,\u201d said K. Rajesh, a farmer from Kandukur-2. Another farmer, Ramana Reddy from Kandukur-1, echoed similar sentiments saying, \u201cLast year was good, but this year was exceptional. With the profits, I am able to clear my debts and invest in better seeds for next season.\u201d However, amid the excitement, the Tobacco Board has issued a word of caution to farmers about the potential risks of increasing the acreage. \"Farmers should be cautious. While this season has seen record profits, the market is unpredictable, and it is important not to assume prices will remain at these levels. Over-expansion can lead to a surplus and drive the prices down,\" a tobacco board official said.The official also warned against the illegal construction of unauthorized barns to store tobacco, emphasising the legal risks and urging farmers to follow the approved guidelines. \"It is important for farmers to focus on improving efficiency, cutting costs and maintaining quality rather than chasing more land and barns that could lead to financial strain in the future,\" he added.",

        "text": "Tuesday saw a significant downturn in the Indian stock market, with major indices including the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 experiencing notable declines. By afternoon, the BSE Sensex had fallen by 787.64 points, marking a 0.97 per cent decrease, positioning it at 80,363.63. Similarly, the Nifty 50 dipped by 262.50 points or by 1.06 per cent, bringing it to 24,518.This downturn affected a broad spectrum of stocks, particularly within the small-cap segment, signalling widespread selling pressure and a shift in investor sentiment.The majority of stocks within the BSE Sensex were observed to be in decline. Tata Steel led the downward trend with a 1.16 per cent drop, closely followed by significant losses in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors, SBI, and IndusInd Bank.Conversely, a few companies managed to buck the trend, with UltraTech Cement seeing an increase of 1.61 per cent, alongside gains in Titan, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and Power Grid Corp.Similarly, the Nifty 50 saw 28 of its 50 stocks decline, with SBI Life, HDFC Life, Shriram Finance, BEL, and Kotak Mahindra Bank experiencing the most significant drops.Market Sector VariancesDifferences were also noted across various market sectors. IT, FMCG, Financial Services, and Private Bank indices were among the few that traded higher, contrasting sharply with the Realty index, which fell by 1.15 per cent. This downturn was echoed by losses in the PSU Bank, Metal, and Auto indices. In the broader market, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 also faced declines, down by 0.29 per cent and 0.83 per cent respectively, further highlighting the days general market downturn.Impact on Individual StocksIn particular, individual stocks faced significant challenges. Amber Enterprises India saw a sharp 13 per cent drop, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Jupiter Wagons among others experienced declines exceeding 5 per cent. This overall trend suggests a cautious or negative outlook from investors, particularly towards small-cap stocks, which have previously enjoyed robust investor sentiment and strong valuations.The decrease in the valuation of small-cap stocks is a point of concern among analysts, indicating a potential overvaluation. Motilal Oswal, a domestic brokerage firm, has pointed out that the market capitalisation-to-GDP ratio for large, mid, and small caps continues to be at historical highs, with small caps surpassing midcaps. This suggests that despite the appeal of small-cap stocks as affordable alternatives to their larger counterparts, their steep valuations have become a point of contention.The sentiment shift and selling pressure, particularly in the small-cap segment, reflect a broader trend of reassessment among investors. This cautious approach is spurred by disappointments in the Q2 earnings season and a scarcity of fresh catalysts for further gains. As investors engage in profit-taking, the allure of small-cap stocks, once seen as key growth opportunities, has diminished.In wrapping up, Tuesdays market activity underscored the volatility and shifting dynamics within the Indian equity markets. While certain sectors and stocks managed to navigate the turbulence, the overall trend signalled caution, particularly towards small-cap stocks. As investors recalibrate their strategies in light of recent developments, the focus may increasingly shift towards sectors and stocks considered more stable or offering better value amidst the current market conditions.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: Former MP and senior BRS leader B Vinod Kumar on Monday held Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy responsible for the economic downturn in Telangana within a short span of 10 months. He accused the Congress government of neglecting the State\u2019s financial health, which witnessed significant growth under former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao.\r\n\r\nAddressing a press meet at Telangana Bhavan here, Vinod Kumar rubbished the false propaganda of the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues about the previous BRS government obtaining loans at huge interest rates. He pointed out that Telangana\u2019s loans under the BRS regime were taken at the lowest interest rates among Southern States, leading to a GSDP of Rs 16 lakh crore, or $200 billion.\r\n\r\n\"A comparison of the interest payments on budgetary borrowings of the Southern States reveals that Telangana stood at the bottom with Rs 32,920 crore in 2022-23. But it is unclear as to how the Ministers arrived at the figure Rs 72,000 crore per annum on interest payments,\" he said. He stated that the interest payments on budgetary borrowings as percentage of revenue receipts was 13.69 which was the second lowest after Karnataka among Southern States.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Revanth Reddy had not taken any significant steps to stabilize the State's financial position, with only liquor sales showing growth, while other revenues declined. He pointed out contradictions in Revanth Reddy's speeches on economic policies. He blamed Revanth Reddy for failing to attract investments, citing the impact of real estate sector issues and HYDRAA demolitions. \"Revanth Reddy speaks of turning Telangana into a trillion-dollar economy, but his governance doesn't reflect that ambition,\" Kumar said, urging the Congress government to stop \"defaming Telangana\" with poor economic policies.",

        "text": "Tirupati: Tobacco growers in Andhra Pradesh are enjoying a windfall this season, as a surge in demand has led to record-breaking prices, with some farmers earning as much as Rs 360 per kg for premium-quality tobacco. The favourable market conditions have turned the 2023-24 season into one of the most profitable years in recent memory, attracting widespread attention from growers hoping to cash in.This season, tobacco sales across the Nellore district reached 46.8 million kg, with the highest average prices ever recorded at multiple auction centers. Farmers are thrilled, and many are already preparing to expand their acreage next year despite warnings from officials about overproduction and rising land lease costs.In the Southern Light Soils (SLS) region, which comprises the auction centers Kandukur-1, Kandukur-2, DC Palli and Kaligiri, sales commenced on March 6. Auctions at DC Palli and Kaligiri closed on October 14, while the Kandukur-1 centre concluded on Monday. The auction process stretched over 140 days, longer than usual. The highest quality tobacco attracted a record price of Rs 360 per kg, a first in the SLS region. The average price at various centres for the 2023-24 season was Rs 270 per kg, a notable Rs 50 increase from the previous year's Rs 220. \u201cWe have never seen prices like this in my 20 years of farming. I was able to sell my crop for an average of Rs 270 per kg. This season has been life-changing for us,\u201d said K. Rajesh, a farmer from Kandukur-2. Another farmer, Ramana Reddy from Kandukur-1, echoed similar sentiments saying, \u201cLast year was good, but this year was exceptional. With the profits, I am able to clear my debts and invest in better seeds for next season.\u201d However, amid the excitement, the Tobacco Board has issued a word of caution to farmers about the potential risks of increasing the acreage. \"Farmers should be cautious. While this season has seen record profits, the market is unpredictable, and it is important not to assume prices will remain at these levels. Over-expansion can lead to a surplus and drive the prices down,\" a tobacco board official said.The official also warned against the illegal construction of unauthorized barns to store tobacco, emphasising the legal risks and urging farmers to follow the approved guidelines. \"It is important for farmers to focus on improving efficiency, cutting costs and maintaining quality rather than chasing more land and barns that could lead to financial strain in the future,\" he added.",

        "title": "Sensex Plummets 931 Points, Nifty Dips Below 24,500; Mid & Smallcap Indices Drop Over 2%",
        "text": "Tuesday saw a significant downturn in the Indian stock market, with major indices including the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 experiencing notable declines. By afternoon, the BSE Sensex had fallen by 787.64 points, marking a 0.97 per cent decrease, positioning it at 80,363.63. Similarly, the Nifty 50 dipped by 262.50 points or by 1.06 per cent, bringing it to 24,518.This downturn affected a broad spectrum of stocks, particularly within the small-cap segment, signalling widespread selling pressure and a shift in investor sentiment.The majority of stocks within the BSE Sensex were observed to be in decline. Tata Steel led the downward trend with a 1.16 per cent drop, closely followed by significant losses in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors, SBI, and IndusInd Bank.Conversely, a few companies managed to buck the trend, with UltraTech Cement seeing an increase of 1.61 per cent, alongside gains in Titan, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and Power Grid Corp.Similarly, the Nifty 50 saw 28 of its 50 stocks decline, with SBI Life, HDFC Life, Shriram Finance, BEL, and Kotak Mahindra Bank experiencing the most significant drops.Market Sector VariancesDifferences were also noted across various market sectors. IT, FMCG, Financial Services, and Private Bank indices were among the few that traded higher, contrasting sharply with the Realty index, which fell by 1.15 per cent. This downturn was echoed by losses in the PSU Bank, Metal, and Auto indices. In the broader market, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 also faced declines, down by 0.29 per cent and 0.83 per cent respectively, further highlighting the days general market downturn.Impact on Individual StocksIn particular, individual stocks faced significant challenges. Amber Enterprises India saw a sharp 13 per cent drop, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Jupiter Wagons among others experienced declines exceeding 5 per cent. This overall trend suggests a cautious or negative outlook from investors, particularly towards small-cap stocks, which have previously enjoyed robust investor sentiment and strong valuations.The decrease in the valuation of small-cap stocks is a point of concern among analysts, indicating a potential overvaluation. Motilal Oswal, a domestic brokerage firm, has pointed out that the market capitalisation-to-GDP ratio for large, mid, and small caps continues to be at historical highs, with small caps surpassing midcaps. This suggests that despite the appeal of small-cap stocks as affordable alternatives to their larger counterparts, their steep valuations have become a point of contention.The sentiment shift and selling pressure, particularly in the small-cap segment, reflect a broader trend of reassessment among investors. This cautious approach is spurred by disappointments in the Q2 earnings season and a scarcity of fresh catalysts for further gains. As investors engage in profit-taking, the allure of small-cap stocks, once seen as key growth opportunities, has diminished.In wrapping up, Tuesdays market activity underscored the volatility and shifting dynamics within the Indian equity markets. While certain sectors and stocks managed to navigate the turbulence, the overall trend signalled caution, particularly towards small-cap stocks. As investors recalibrate their strategies in light of recent developments, the focus may increasingly shift towards sectors and stocks considered more stable or offering better value amidst the current market conditions.",

        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world\u2019s leading generative AI technology.The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment.The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry\u2019s belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement.Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter.Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank\u2019s investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated.In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \u201cAI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \u201cAnd this is just the start.\u201dThe huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \u201cPeople are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\u201d said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year \u2013 adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn\u2019t exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round.Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \u201cthe most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\u201dApple Inc. didn\u2019t participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs.The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company\u2019s board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure \u2014 an unusual organization that has frustrated investors \u2014 to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company\u2019s backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company \u2014 a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI\u2019s board said it hasn\u2019t discussed specific numbers.OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported.A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees \u2014 such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also...",

        "text": "Shares of Marico hit a record high of Rs 719.80, gaining 4 per cent on the BSE in Thursday\u2019s intra-day trade in an otherwise weak market on stable volume growth in July to September quarter (Q2FY25). The stock surpassed its previous high of Rs 713.60 touched on September 27, 2024.At 02:18 pm; Marico had erased its intra-day gain and was trading 0.5 per cent higher at Rs 696.50 on the BSE. In comparison, the BSE Sensex tanked 2.1 per cent or 1,781 points at 82,485. In the last six months, the stock has outperformed the market by surging 41 per cent, as against a near 12 per cent rise in the benchmark index.Marico in its Q2 quarterly update said that consolidated revenue growth remained in high single digits, as higher realisations in the domestic business was offset by incremental currency headwinds in some overseas markets. The company expects consolidated revenue growth to move into double digits in the second half of the year and expects to deliver double-digit revenue growth in this year.The sector witnessed stable demand trends with rural outperforming urban on a year-on-year basis for the third quarter in a row. In the given context, the domestic business posted mid-single digit volume growth, exhibiting improvement on a sequential basis, Marico said.The management said the International business delivered robust low teen constant currency (CC) growth with each of the markets contributing positively. Bangladesh posted high-single digit growth, demonstrating the strong resilience of the company\u2019s business model amidst a challenging operating environment which has now largely stabilized. Vietnam also grew in high single digits, while MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and South Africa maintained their robust double digit growth trajectory.However, Marico expects gross margin to moderate on a year-on-year basis owing to partial absorption of higher input costs, as the Company prioritized expanding its consumer franchise in the current demand environment. Consequently, the company expects a moderate lag in operating profit growth vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.Among key inputs, copra prices rose ahead of internal forecasts and the recent import duty hike led to vegetable oil prices moving higher towards the end of the quarter. Crude oil derivatives, however, remained rangebound.On outlook, Marico said the company remains focused on achieving double-digit revenue growth while managing margin pressures from commodity inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.After a weak update from Dabur, Marico\u2019s update reassured investors. The numbers are largely in line with our estimates, said analysts at Nuvama Wealth Management. Value Added Hair Oils (VAHO) and Saffola Oils remain muted.The brokerage firm said Marico\u2019s consolidated revenue growth is likely to be 8 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Domestic business shall clock 5 per cent volume growth YoY. The International business shall deliver 13 per cent CC growth. Bangladesh shall post high-single digit growth amid a turbulent operating environment. Copra experienced inflation higher than expectations. Parachute shall see mid-single digit volume and double-digit revenue growth.

        "text": "Stock market crash today: In the aftermath of the bloodbath at the Dalal-street on Thursday, investors lost a total of Rs 9.7 trillion in market capitalisation on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At Tuesday's close, the total market capitalisation of companies listed on the BSE stood at around Rs 474 trillion - this was pulled down to Rs 465 trillion on Thursday. However, in intraday deals, investors losses mounted to Rs 10.56 trillion with the total market capitalisation of the BSE slipping to Rs 464 trillion. The market breath also favoured the declines as around 2,875 stocks traded losses versus advances by 985 stocks, with 109 remaining unchanged. In terms of contribution to the 30-blue chip stock index, BSE Sensex\u2019s decline, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank led the way, pulling Sensex down in its sharpest decline since August 05. The BSE Sensex plunged 1,832 points or 2.17 per cent to 82,434 level in intraday deals. Meanwhile, Nifty50 slipped to an intraday low of 566 points, down 2.19 per cent to 25,230.30 level in intraday trade. That apart, the country's volatility indicator, India VIX jumped to 11.72 per cent. Among sectors, Nifty Realty was clear loser ending the day 4.36 per cent lower and was followed by Nifty Auto slipping 2.88 per cent, Nifty Private Bank declining 2.61 per cent and Nifty Financial Services sliding 2.59 per cent. According to analysts, today\u2019s sharp decline was driven by several negative factors, including escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by Sebi and strength in the Chinese market, following the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) stimulus package. \u201cSpeculation is growing that Israel may retaliate by targeting major oil fields in Iran, which could further fuel the rise in oil prices. Additionally, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by SEBI are expected to impact trading volumes, as retail participation may decline due to the increased contract size and limits on weekly expiries,\u201d said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP, research & advisory at Master Capital Services.Analysts also concurred that the foreign money is being diverted from India to China as the country became attractive to investors following its government\u2019s stimulus package. \u201cThere has been a notable outflow of Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) money from India to China over the past few days, exerting pressure on large-cap stocks. Lastly, profit booking ahead of state elections and concerns over elevated valuations have added to the downward pressure,\u201d stated Santosh Meena, head of research, Swastika Investmart. .storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "The Airports Authority of India\u2019s Madurai Airport commenced 24-hour operations with effect from October 1, 2024. This milestone marks a significant step towards enhancing connectivity, providing a seamless travel experience and supporting the growth of regional as well as national Air traffic. This will provide flexibility to Airlines, Non-Scheduled operators, Medical flights and General Aviation for efficient planning of Aircraft operations. Airlines can also plan bases at Madurai Airport. This will also enable effective use of Airport Infrastructure and resources, read an official statement.At an event organised at Madurai Airport to formally start the 24-hour operations, M. Suresh, Chairman, AAI underscored the organisation\u2019s strategic approach towards this transformative upgrade. He also emphasised the widespread benefits of the commencement of round-the-clock operations from the Airport. The event also saw the esteemed presence of MP, Manickam Tagore, MP, S. Venkatesan, MLA, V. V. Rajan Chellappa, MLA, A.M.S.G. Ashokan and senior officials from the District Administration.At present Madurai has 248 scheduled movements in a week and is connected to cities like Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Singapore, Dubai and Colombo. Additionally, there is a demand for flight connectivity to other cities of India like Pune, Goa, Kolkata, Cochin, Bhubaneshwar, Varanasi, Guwahati, etc. With round-the-clock operations, the weekly scheduled movements in the winter season of 2024 are expected to be around 344 movements for Madurai Airport.Extending operational hours will allow more flights to land and take off, thereby improving connectivity, especially for flights of long-haul routes. This will attract more airlines and routes, making Madurai Airport a more prominent hub.Travellers will have more flexible flight options, making travel easier and more convenient. This will enhance passenger satisfaction and attract more travellers to Madurai.With more flights and passengers, local businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation services will likely see increased demand. This will lead to job creation and stimulate the local economy. Madurai has a rich cultural and religious heritage. Round-the-clock operations will make this city more accessible to tourists, especially those from different time zones, contributing to the growth of the tourism sector. 24-hour operations will also facilitate better cargo handling, allowing for more efficient logistics operations. This will attract businesses that rely on air freight, further boosting the local economy. It will also enable the locals to have better access to enhanced medical facilities.With the starting of 24-hour operations, a Night parking facility will be available at Madurai Airport as well. This will help the Airport to facilitate connections not only within India but also to international destinations. Since most international operators prefer to operate during night time from India, 24-hour operations will encourage airlines to consider international operations from Madurai Airport. It will also allow airlines to plan night parking at the Airport and plan base flights. Transitioning Madurai Airport to 24-hour operations presents a compelling opportunity to enhance Passenger service, drive economic growth, and improve overall operational efficiency. By embracing this change, the Airport can position itself as the leading airport in the country, catering to the diverse needs of passengers and contributing to the region\u2019s overall development. Implementing these extended hours will not only meet the demands of a growing travel market but also support Madurai\u2019s aspirations as a vital transportation hub in the region",

        "text": "The rupee depreciated 14 paise to settle at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as the volatile geopolitical situation triggered a surge in crude oil prices, weighed down by a steep fall of over two per cent in domestic equity markets. According to forex traders, a strong American currency and unabated outflow of foreign funds fuelled by the bullish Chinese markets also accelerated the rupee's slide. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.91 and touched a low of 83.97 against the greenback during intra-day trading. The unit ended the session at 83.96 (provisional) against the American currency, registering a steep loss of 14 paise from its previous closing level. On Tuesday, the rupee settled 3 paise lower at 83.82 against the American currency. Forex markets were closed on Wednesday on account of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. According to Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the rupee declined on weak domestic markets and a strong dollar, while a surge in crude oil prices also weighed on the domestic unit. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a slight negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"Traders may take cues from ISM services PMI, weekly unemployment claims and factory orders data from the US. Investors may watch out for a non-farm payrolls report from the US on Friday. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.23 per cent to 101.91. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.66 per cent to $75.13 in futures trade. Experts attributed the spike in crude prices to the fear of Israel's retaliatory attacks on Iran's oil installations amid escalating tension in West Asia. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex crashed 1,769.19 points, or 2.10 per cent, to settle at 82,497.10, while the Nifty tanked 546.80 points, or 2.12 per cent to close the session at 25,250.10. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Tuesday, offloading shares worth \u20b95,579.35 crore on a net basis in the cash segment, according to exchange data. FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b915,000 crore since Monday. Analysts said foreign investors rushed to sell Indian equities as Chinese stocks turned bullish after the country announced a slew of stimulus measures to revive the economy. On the domestic macroeconomic front, a monthly survey released on Tuesday showed India's manufacturing sector growth fell to an eight-month low in September amid a softer increase in factory production, sales and new export orders. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from 57.5 in August to 56.5 in September, registering the weakest pace of growth since January.",

        "title": "OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion In Funds at $157 Billion Value",
        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world's leading generative AI technology. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment. The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry's belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement. Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank's investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated. In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\" OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \"And this is just the start.\" The huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \"People are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\" said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year - adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn't exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round. Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \"the most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\" Apple Inc. didn't participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI's board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs. The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company's board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure - an unusual organization that has frustrated investors - to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company's backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company - a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI's board said it hasn't discussed specific numbers. OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported. A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees - such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also developing their own AI models. In this funding round, OpenAI discouraged investors from backing rival companies, such as Anthropic or Musk's AI startup xAI, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg earlier reported that leading venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which backed Safe Superintelligence, would not participate in the newest fundraising.

        "text": "Interest rates are expected to decline soon after remaining elevated for an extended period. After the US Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 50-basis-point (bps) cut, other central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will likely follow suit.\u201cThis is a good time to take fixed-income exposure at elevated rates before the softening starts,\u201d says Amol Joshi, founder, PlanRupee Investment Managers.Rate cuts on the horizonThe RBI has projected inflation at 4.5 per cent for financial year 2025 (FY25), close to its 4 per cent target. With the current repo rate at 6.5 per cent, experts anticipate a 50 basis point cut soon. \u201cI see a repo rate cut of 50 bps to 6 per cent,\u201d says Joydeep Sen, author and corporate trainer (debt).\u201cRBI may cut rates by 50 bps over the next six months, starting with a 25 bps cut in December,\u201d says Pankaj Mathpal, managing director, Optima Money Managers. Current rates are attractiveFixed-income instruments such as bank fixed deposits (FDs), corporate FDs, and small savings schemes (SSS) are currently offering attractive returns. For example, bank FDs of two to three years\u2019 duration are yielding 7 per cent, while the government has kept SSS rates unchanged as of September 30, 2024. \u201cIf you want to invest in FDs or the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme (SCSS), now is the right time. Investors can also consider long-term debt funds,\u201d says Mathpal.Sen notes that any reduction in bank FD rates will lag behind the RBI\u2019s actions. \u201cBank deposit rates will ease but may not align directly with RBI rate cuts, as credit demand remains strong, and banks need deposits,\u201d he explains.Which instruments look good?Several fixed-income products currently offer attractive rates. The SCSS, with an 8.2 per cent interest rate that can be locked in for five years, remains one of the most attractive. The scheme\u2019s investment limit has been enhanced to Rs 30 lakh.The Mahila Samman Certificate offers 7.5 per cent interest for two years on deposits up to Rs 2 lakh. Select corporate FDs offering around 9 per cent are worth considering. Banks are offering attractive rates for 12-15 month FDs. Investors with a longer time frame will, however, be better off investing in longer-tenured FDs.\u201cSenior citizens should capitalise on high SCSS rates and lock in investments now. For short-term needs, FDs are a good option. NBFC FDs offer slightly higher rates than bank FDs,\u201d says Mathpal. As a rule, match your investment timeframe with the product\u2019s tenure, as premature withdrawals lead to penalties.Avoid floating rate instruments With interest rates set to fall, floating-rate instruments like RBI Floating Rate Savings Bonds may not be ideal. They currently offer 8.05 per cent (35 bps higher than the 7.7 per cent offered by the National Savings Certificate). \u201cFloating-rate instruments will adjust downwards as rates drop, so they are not suitable in a declining interest-rate environment,\u201d says Joshi.Focus on goals and allocationInvest according to your horizon. \u201cYoung investors should focus more on equity, while retired senior citizens should prioritise fixed income. Mid-career investors should aim for a balanced allocation,\u201d says Sen.Fixed income allocation should also depend on investment horizon and risk appetite. \u201cInvestors with lower risk tolerance and short-term goals should focus on debt instruments,\u201d says Mathpal..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Leading artificial intelligence research company OpenAI announced this week that it has closed an enormous funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion. This massive injection of capital positions OpenAI as one of the highest valued private companies in the world. The round was led by previous investor Thrive Capital, with Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, Khosla Ventures and others also participating. This brings OpenAI's total funding to nearly $18 billion since its founding in 2015. OpenAI says the new funds will allow it to expand its AI research, build new tools, and grow its infrastructure to handle increasing demands on its systems. OpenAI has become the worldwide leader in generative AI models like ChatGPT, which has over 250 million users. The company is also known for developing powerful transformer models for natural language processing, computer vision and other domains. However, continued progress requires vast computing resources and talent \u2013 two things that do not come cheaply. OpenAI reportedly spends billions each year on research costs like training new models as well as hiring top AI scientists and engineers. Sustaining this level of spending is likely why OpenAI sought such a gargantuan funding round. The company faces intensifying competition from DeepMind, Anthropic, xAi and others working in similar areas. Microsoft has also become a close partner, building products using OpenAI technology. To maintain its advantages, OpenAI needs ample funds to recruit top people, invest in the latest hardware and pursue ambitious long-term research goals. With over $17 billion in capital raised to date, OpenAI is now in an elite class of private unicorns. How the company utilizes these massive new resources, and whether it can fulfill its lofty visions, will be exciting to watch unfold in the coming years. For now, OpenAI's dominant position in critical AI domains seems set to continue fueling innovative advances that impact technology worldwide.",

        "text": "Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, plunged in trade on Thursday, mirroring global cues on the back of increased Middle East tensions and rising crude prices. BSE Sensex closed the day, down 2.10% at 82,497.10, and Nifty50 closed the day at 25,250.10, down 2.12%.The bloodbath on Dalal Street left equity investors poorer by Rs 9.78 lakh crore. The market capitalization of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) plummeted by Rs 9,78,778.57 crore, bringing the total value down to Rs 4,65,07,685.08 crore ($ 5.54 trillion) in just one trading session. In the last few days, BSE Sensex has corrected around 4% from the near 86,000 high it hit last week. The risk of a broader regional conflict has increased following Iran's missile strike on Israel. While Iran insisted it has \"no interest in a broader war\" after the attacks, Israel has vowed to strike back. Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory firm, noted in a client note that \"Iran's decision to respond to devastating attacks from Israel against its proxy Hezbollah, including a new ground offensive, with a ballistic missile strike against Israel, raises the risk of a wider regional conflict that could draw in the US and disrupt oil markets. However, according to an ET report, market analysts suggest that the potential downsides in stock markets could be contained.Stock market outlook: Where are Sensex & Nifty headed?According to Sandeep Raina, Executive Vice President-Research, Nuvama Professional, the market correction is temporary in nature. \u201cThe changes in derivative regulations and the expiry scheduled for today has led to the corrections in the market,\u201d Raina told TOI. \u201cHowever, this is a temporary reaction and we don't expect any major corrections. The markets should stabilize and return to normal levels in the coming days,\u201d he said.Escalating tensions in the Middle East have led to a surge in oil prices, with concerns that supplies from major producers could be disrupted. For countries that heavily rely on oil imports, such as India, the increase in crude prices is a significant concern, as it can have a substantial impact on their import bill and overall economy.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, warned, \"The situation will change if Israel attacks any oil installations in Iran which will trigger a huge spike in crude. If it happens, it can turn out to be more damaging for oil importers like India. Therefore, investors should watch the emerging situation very closely.\" Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers predicts heightened volatility in Indian stock markets in the coming weeks.\u201cThe current geopolitical induced risks and ongoing US election cycle may continue to impact global markets including India in the short term. Also, we are entering the results season starting next week and that is also going to add to the moves depending on the quality of results,\u201d Solanki told TOI.\u201cHence, I see near term 2-3 weeks of heightened news based volatility in the markets. Investors may book some profits in stocks which have run up way ahead of fundamentals and could look for new ideas and add in a staggered manner,\u201d he said.Chinese dragon roars: India\u2019s biggest worryFor investors in India, the resurgence of Chinese stocks, which have underperformed in recent years, could be a more significant concern, feel analysts. The Chinese government recently announced a series of economic stimulus measures, which has led to predictions by analysts that the rebound in Chinese stocks could be sustained. As a result, there is a possibility that some funds may be redirected from India to China, as global investors have been favoring India over China in recent times.The recent stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government is being hailed as a game-changer for the nation's economy and stock markets. Victoria Mio, head of Greater China equities and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, believes that this shift in focus from debt control to growth support could be the key to restoring investor confidence and unlocking value in China's markets.\"As global investors seek stability amidst uncertainty, the Chinese government's decisive pivot from debt control to growth support could be the catalyst needed to restore confidence and unlock value in China's markets.\"The impact of this stimulus package is already being felt in the Chinese stock market, with the SSE Composite index gaining over 15% in the past week, including an impressive 8% rise on Tuesday. Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, attributes this surge to a combination of short covering and a growing belief in the effectiveness of the government's policies. He also suggests that some of the capital outflows from India may have been redirected to China to capitalize on the sharp rally.Looking ahead, Holland believes that global interest rate cuts will benefit all emerging markets. For India specifically, investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming results season to gauge the health of the economy and individual companies.",

        "text": "Amid long-standing calls by private port players to bring parity between recent winners of public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports and players with older contracts, the Centre has released draft guidelines for tariff migration, allowing concessionaires to switch to a market-based tariff regime.\u201cIn the past, tariffs were regulated due to a limited competitive landscape, but the evolving market and competitive landscape necessitates deregulation. The original objective of introducing the tariff regulations in 2005 included safeguarding the interest of users, while ensuring fair returns to the port and encouraging competition and efficiency. The long-term objective outlined in the Tariff Guidelines 2005 was competitive pricing. The market and competitive landscape in the Indian port sector have since witnessed a significant shift,\u201d the shipping ministry said in the draft guidelines.Currently, tariffs for private operators at central government ports are regulated under three separate regimes \u2014 Tariff Guidelines 2005 (superseded by Tariff Guidelines 2019), Tariff Guidelines 2008, and those of 2013.The draft guidelines will allow PPP players to fix their own scale of rates (SOR) and will require them to sign a supplementary agreement.Previously, the major port authorities were both service providers to end users and the concessioning authority. Thus, the tariff regulations played an important role in safeguarding the interests of both port users and PPP operators.According to the Centre, with the transition to the landlord port model and increased private sector participation, the utility of tariff regulations (and fixation) in this context has diminished.Several PPP operators had also raised concerns with the ministry in the past, stating they were at a disadvantage compared to fully private ports, as there was no parity in tariff fixation, making PPP projects less desirable.While the new regulations allow pricing freedom, they will not hinder government revenues earned from these PPP projects, as there will be no change in royalty.\u201cAs an additional measure, the royalty as revenue share of the major port should/would not go below what it would have got under the regime when the tariff was fixed/determined as per the Tariff Guidelines. This would be done by converting the revenue share to royalty based on the annual revenue requirement of the project as determined earlier,\u201d the draft guidelines said.The government has invited stakeholders to send their inputs by 25 October..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Shopping malls can avail GST Input Tax Credit on construction expenses, says SC",
        "text": "In a boost to commercial real estate and infrastructure projects, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that if the building is constructed for supplying services such as renting or leasing out, it can be regarded as a plant and input tax credit (ITC) under GST will be eligible. However, it rejected constitutional validity challenge to blocked credit provisions in the GST law. \u201cIf the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, the building could be held to be a plant,\u201d a division bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol said. ITC norms With this the apex court upheld Odisha High Court\u2019s ruling in the matter of Safari Retreats. The issue here revolved around section 17(5) of the CGST Act. This particular section prohibits ITC for works contract services when supplied for construction of an immovable property. However, this will exclude plant and machinery. The big question concerned what will be included in the definition of \u2018plant and machinery\u2019? The High Court had held that if the assessee is required to pay GST on the rental income from the mall, it is entitled to ITC on the GST paid on the construction of the mall. Aggrieved by this, the Tax Department moved the Apex Court. After going through all the submissions, the top Court while saying the shopping mall is a \u2018plant\u2019, held that functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant. Expert terms this ruling as a boon for the industry. \u201cThe outcome of the ruling that \u2018functionality test\u2019 should be applied on buildings to determine whether the same qualify as plant is very positive for the industry. With this ruling, by applying the functionality test, if one is able to prove the nexus/ role a particular product with the business of a taxpayer, credit should ideally be admissible\u201d said Harpreet Singh, Partner at Deloitte. \u201cThe eligibility of input tax credit (ITC) will be determined based on the functionality and essentiality tests,\u201d explained Abhishek A. Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who represented multiple petitioners in the case before the Supreme Court. \u201cIn essence, the Court has effectively read down the provisions of Section 17(5)(c) and (d) of the GST Act. ITC can only be denied in situations where the nature of the taxpayer\u2019s business and the claimed credits fail to satisfy these two critical tests. Post this ruling, there will be no requirement to amend the law. According to Rohit Jain, Deputy Managing Partner at Economic Laws Practice, the top Court has upheld the existing provisions and interpreted that building for leasing qualifies as a \u201cplant\u201d and no restriction of ITC is applicable. \u201cThere is no need to make any changes in the law,\u201d he said. Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co felt by reiterating this broader principle in the context of GST, the Supreme Court has given a lot of hope to taxpayers across the country, especially those whose input costs include substantial construction expenses. \u201cCompanies in the commercial real estate as well as infrastructure sectors will do well to review their input credit positions in the light of this judgment,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "SC permits input tax credits on construction expenses for leased buildings",
        "text": "In a development that may encourage increased investment in commercial real estate, the Supreme Court granted the industry relief on Thursday by permitting the application of input tax credits (ITC) on construction expenses for commercial buildings meant for leasing.\"If the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, which are covered by clauses (2) and (5) of Schedule II of the CGST Act, the building could be held to be a plant,\" said Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol.This ruling is anticipated to ease the financial strain of rent on tenants occupying commercial spaces. Real estate companies stand to gain, as buildings can now be categorised as plant and machinery. Additionally, this advantage is not limited to commercial real estate; various industries will also be able to claim ITC on rentals for commercial properties. The ruling suggests that the ITC benefit will be available retroactively.\u201cThis is an important decision that could have wide ramifications for industries, particularly hotels, infrastructure, and logistics, including warehousing. While the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of restrictions relating to input credit on construction-related procurements, it has been held that whether a building constitutes 'plant or machinery' needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis,\u201d said Pratik Jain, Partner, PwC India.\u201cIt means that where it falls under this category, credit would be allowed. It will be interesting to see if the government considers amending the GST laws after this decision,\u201d added Jain.Experts believe that although the constitutional challenge was dismissed, the acceptance of the taxpayer\u2019s submission under Section 17(5)(d) is a positive outcome, potentially lowering the financial burden on developers and fostering greater investment in commercial real estate.\u201cThe real estate industry should carefully evaluate the implications of this ruling on ITC eligibility for outward supplies related to rental income. Given the Supreme Court's decision, it would be prudent for the GST Council to issue clarifications allowing real estate players to claim ITC on rental income,\u201d said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY India.Tax experts also pointed out that the question now arises whether this ruling would also apply to factory buildings, jetties, storage tanks, etc.\u201cThe applicability will depend on the specifics of each case. In the Safari Retreats case, the petitioner retained the property and leased it out rather than using it for personal purposes. In contrast, factory buildings, storage tanks, etc. are typically used by the registered person for their own operations. Therefore, once the detailed ruling is available, it will be crucial to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether ITC related to factory buildings, storage tanks, etc., will be allowed. If ITC is permitted, it will be important to understand the circumstances under which it can be claimed,\u201d said Agarwal.Tax experts also believe that GST laws generally do not allow the benefit of input credit/set-off of GST costs incurred on the input side for the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, with very few exceptions. This often results in additional GST costs for service providers whose primary input-side investment is in immoveable property, such as malls/commercial real estate players, port or airport service providers, and LNG terminal operators.Background of the caseIn the case of Safari Retreats, a mall owner approached the Orissa High Court, arguing that when a mall is being built for providing commercial rental services for the shop spaces therein, there should be no restriction on availing input credit/set-off for the GST cost incurred on the said construction. The Orissa High Court upheld this argument, and the GST authorities subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court. Several similar matters eventually reached the Supreme Court, leading to the formation of a large batch of matters on this legal point. Some of these newer matters also challenged the constitutional validity of such a restriction on input GST credit. Today, the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment\u2014while it has rejected the constitutional validity of the restriction, it upheld the conclusions of the Orissa High Court and, among other things, held that input credit will be allowed if the construction activity is for \u2018plant\u2019 or \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201cThis is a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court. While determining whether a mall, hotel, jetty, breakwater, or warehouse qualifies as \u2018plant or machinery\u2019 will remain a factual question (potentially leading to a second round of litigation), the greatest positive is that the Court has categorically held that there is no blanket restriction against input credit/set-off of the GST cost incurred on the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, especially when the said structure itself is integral to providing the output services in question,\u201d said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Signs of financial sector froth",
        "text": "The Indian equity market is on a high: again. On August 1, Nifty 50, the benchmark index for the Indian equity market, hit the \u201825000\u2019 mark. The jump from 24000 to 25000 took just 24 trading sessions. By September 24, it soared past \u201826000\u2019. This unbridled bull run has, in fact, characterised the Indian equity markets since the March 2020. However, now the bullish frenzy has regulators concerned. On March 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch, underlined the \u2018stretched valuations\u2019 of small and mid-cap stocks, iterating there are \u201cpockets of froth\u201d in the market. On July 22, she shared her concerns about speculative trading in F&O segment and losses made by retail traders in this segment. Latest reports suggest, SEBI is all set to tighten regulation to curb retail frenzy in equity options. Are the concerns of the regulator regarding a \u2018froth\u2019 in the market valid? Chart 1 shows the six global markets: Nifty 50, India (NSEI), Dow Jones, United States (DJI), German Index (GDAXI), Bovespa Index, Brazil (BVSP), and SSE Composite Index, China (000001.SS) from 2015 to 2024. For every market, we can see a sharp rally post the pandemic, an uncertain correction in 2022 and a sharper rally from late 2022 onwards. However, for both DJI and Nifty 50 (top two panels), the bullish spree in the last two years is extraordinarily strong. The market capitalisation (mcap) as percentage of GDP (Buffet indicator) suggests the Indian markets are overvalued. The Buffet indicator for India increased substantially from 2019 to 2022, a pattern which matches the US\u2019 (Table 1). India\u2019s mcap-to-GDP ratio reached a 15-year high of 140.2 per cent in May 2024. Values of the Buffet indicator above 100 is, by itself, an indicator of overvaluation but with values skirting 150 per cent, the financial sector has, it seems, decided to grow on its own. The concerns of the regulator about \u2018froth\u2019 in the market are evidently not unfounded. What is leading to the continued bullish frenzy? For one, the retail market participants have entered the stock markets in a big way post Covid, especially in India. Moreover, there are concerns that credit growth in the real sector could be finding a route to the equity market. Table 2 presents the growth in the US and Indian equity markets during different monetary policy phases of the US Federal Reserve, broadly matched by central banks of major markets. Expansionary phase The sharp rally in both the markets post Covid coincides with the expansionary phase. From May 2022, Federal Reserve increased interest rates responding to inflationary pressures, leading to some correction: for both DJI and Nifty 50, we see markets returns fall during contractionary phase. However, with the rate hike paused from September 2023, the markets rallied sharply again. With the Fed\u2019s decision to slash interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, we are looking at another expansionary phase, which may stretch valuations on the upside. How will the financialisation impact the real economy? The symptoms of overvaluation bring forth concerns about financialisation: proliferation of financial assets and financial market growth unrelated to the real sector growth. First, financialisation makes companies more concerned about \u2018share-holder value creation\u2019 than real capital accumulation. Financialisation can lead to \u2018distribute and disinvest\u2019 rather than \u2018retain and reinvest\u2019 for firms, which will jeopardize the real capital accumulation and employment generation. Speculative surge Second, the retail participation in the F&O segment and growth in intra-day trading shows the inclination to use the equity market for speculative gains rather than for long-term investment. This can be detrimental to retail participants\u2019 long-term saving behaviour, and adversely impact saving rates in the economy. Furthermore, if the participation in the stock market is leveraged, a market crash can lead to substantial erosion of wealth for retail investors. The Union Budget in 2024, increased short-term capital gains tax (STCG) and introduced a flat long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) across asset classes, discouraging short-term churning of portfolios. But have the market participants, especially the younger retail traders, taken the cue? Going ahead, regulatory measures should not only discourage leveraged trading, but also create awareness on appropriate risk management strategies for intra-day trading and the pitfalls of shorter-term churning for long term financial goals. \u2018Nudges\u2019 may be more effective than overt paternalism in guiding younger retail participants.

        "text": "Swift, the global financial messaging provider, announced on Thursday that it will begin trialing transactions involving digital currencies and assets on its secure network starting in 2025. This marks a notable step toward the gradual integration of digital assets into the broader financial system.Headquartered in Belgium, Swift is a member-owned cooperative that connects over 11,500 banks, securities organisations, and corporations across more than 200 countries, enabling the secure exchange of standardised financial messages. Although Swift does not hold or manage funds, its network allows financial institutions to communicate, facilitating global and local financial transactions. This initiative aims to demonstrate how Swift can support the movement of diverse types of value \u2014 whether digital or traditional \u2014 across over four billion accounts in 200 countries and territories.Bridging digital and traditional currenciesThe pilot programme will involve central and commercial banks, exploring how Swift\u2019s existing infrastructure can facilitate transactions of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets alongside traditional money. Initial use cases will include payments, foreign exchange (FX), securities, and trade-related transactions. A particular focus will be on enabling Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) and Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) transactions across different digital ledgers.In the release, Tom Zschach, Swift\u2019s chief innovation officer, emphasised the need for digital assets and currencies to coexist with traditional money. \u201cWith Swift\u2019s vast global reach, we are uniquely positioned to bridge both emerging and established forms of value,\u201d Zschach stated. \u201cAs new forms of value emerge, our intention is to continue offering our community the ability to seamlessly make and track transactions of all kinds of assets.\u201dRole of CBDCs in tokenised assetsTokenisation, the process of converting traditional assets such as bonds into digital units or blockchain-based tokens, has been explored by banks and asset managers for several years. The hope is that tokenised assets will make trading more efficient, reducing costs and removing intermediaries. Despite these ambitions, tokenisation has yet to gain significant traction in mainstream markets. The tokenised asset market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, the company said.CBDCs, digital versions of a country\u2019s official fiat currency, are also being trialled worldwide. According to recent data, around 90 per cent of the world\u2019s central banks are currently experimenting with CBDCs. These digital currencies aim to support the trading of tokenised assets and are a response to technological advances that have led to the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.SWIFT, a key player in the global financial system, has been actively involved in trials of both CBDCs and tokenised assets. In March, it announced plans to launch a platform that would connect developing CBDCs to the traditional financial system, ensuring a seamless transition between digital and traditional forms of money..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Indian stock markets staged a strong recovery on Friday afternoon, reversing early losses to trade significantly higher. The benchmark Sensex surged 729.46 points or 0.88 per cent to 83,226.56 at 12.31 PM, while the Nifty climbed 191.80 points or 0.76 per cent to 25,441.90. This upward momentum comes after a weak start, with markets opening lower for the fifth consecutive session due to geopolitical tensions and foreign institutional investor (FII) selling. The Sensex had opened at 82,244.25, down from its previous close of 82,497.10. The market breadth remained positive, with 2,284 stocks advancing against 1,529 declines on the BSE. 174 stocks hit 52-week highs, while 50 touched 52-week lows. 292 stocks reached the upper circuit limit, and 222 hit the lower circuit. Also read: Indices slump over 2% as West Asia crisis deepens, FPIs retreat Top gainers on the NSE at 12:30 PM included Infosys (3.03 per cent), Tech Mahindra (2.61 per cent), Tata Motors (2.39 per cent), Sun Pharma (2.03 per cent), and Titan (2.03 per cent). On the flip side, Cipla (-1.42 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (-1.33 per cent), Shriram Finance (-1.13 per cent), BPCL (-1.10 per cent), and Apollo Hospitals (-0.86 per cent) were the top losers. Sectoral indices also showed strength, with the Nifty Bank up 453.30 points or 0.87 per cent at 52,298.50, and Nifty Financial Services gaining 135.35 points or 0.57 per cent to 24,016.90. The Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap Select indices rose 0.31 per cent and 0.26 per cent respectively. The market\u2019s reversal comes despite ongoing concerns about the Iran-Israel conflict and its potential impact on crude oil prices, which could affect inflation and India\u2019s fiscal deficit. Earlier in the day, experts had pointed to global factors, including FII withdrawals to cheaper markets like Hong Kong, as reasons for the initial weakness. Investors are now closely watching US job data and further geopolitical developments for cues on market direction. The sharp intraday turnaround suggests a possible change in sentiment, although it remains to be seen if this momentum will sustain until market close at 3.30 PM. As trading continues, market participants will be keenly observing whether key support levels can be maintained and if the recovery can offset the losses from previous sessions.",

        "text": "Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, the latest entrant in the Gemini family of artificial intelligence (AI) models, is now generally available for production use. On Thursday, Google announced the general availability of the model, highlighting that it was a smaller and faster version of the Gemini 1.5 Flash which was introduced at Google I/O. Due to being fast, it has a low latency inference and more efficient output generation. More importantly, the tech giant stated that the Flash-8B AI model is the \u201clowest cost per intelligence of any Gemini model\u201d. Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B Now Generally Available In a developer blog post, the Mountain View-based tech giant detailed the new AI model. The Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B was distilled from the Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model, which was focused on faster processing and more efficient output generation. The company now claims that Google DeepMind developed this even smaller and faster version of the AI model in the last few months. Despite being a smaller model, the tech giant claims that it \u201cnearly matches\u201d the performance of the 1.5 Flash model across multiple benchmarks. Some of these include chat, transcription, and long context language translation.You Might Soon Be Able to Share Images Directly With Google's Gemini App One major benefit of the AI model is its price effectiveness. Google said that the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B will offer the lowest token pricing in the Gemini family. Developers will have to pay $0.15 (roughly Rs. 12.5) per one million output tokens, $0.0375 (roughly Rs. 3) per one million input tokens, and $0.01 (roughly Rs. 0.8) per one million tokens on cached prompts. Additionally, Google is doubling the rate limits of the 1.5 Flash-8B AI model. Now, developers can send up to 4,000 requests per minute (RPM) while using this model. Explaining the decision, the tech giant stated that the model is suited for simple, high-volume tasks. Developers who wish to try out the model can do so via Google AI Studio and the Gemini API free of charge. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "The rupee traded on a flat note and settled at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday as surging crude oil prices amid volatile geopolitics weighed on the local unit, while the Reserve Bank intervened to prevent the domestic currency from touching its lowest level. Forex traders said a weak American currency against major Asian rivals as well as the RBI's move to sell dollars supported the local unit. However, it was weighed down by weak domestic equity markets and unabated outflow of foreign funds. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.96 and moved between a narrow range of 83.93 and 83.97 against the greenback. The unit failed to recover from its deep plunge witnessed in previous sessions, and ended flat at 83.96 (provisional) against the dollar. On Thursday, the rupee slid 14 paise to settle at 83.96 against the American currency. The unit had touched its all-time low of 84.09 on August 5. Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said the rupee traded nearly flat amid reports of the Reserve Bank of India selling dollars in the short-term offshore markets, which prevented the Indian currency from hitting a new record low. However, weak domestic markets, a strong dollar and a surge in crude oil prices weighed on the rupee. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"FII outflows and elevated crude oil prices may further pressurise the rupee. Traders may take cues from non-farm payrolls report from the US. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.11 per cent to 101.87. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.12 per cent to $78.49 in futures trade. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex extended its sharp loss from the previous session and crashed another 808.65 points, or 0.98 per cent, to settle at 81,688.45. The Nifty also tanked 200.25 points, or 0.79 per cent to close the session at 25,049.85. Both the indices had tumbled over 2 per cent on Thursday. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Thursday, offloading shares worth \u20b915,243.27 crore on a net basis in the cash segment, according to exchange data. FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b930,000 crore since Monday as they turned bullish towards the Chinese market, betting on various economic stimulus measures announced by the country. Meanwhile, a monthly survey released on Friday showed India's services sector activity fell to a 10-month low in September as new business, international sales and output growth moderated. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services Business Activity Index fell from 60.9 in August to 57.7 in September, indicating that the output registered an increase, but at the slowest rate since November 2023.",

        "text": "By delivering a political speech at the inaugural ceremony of Dasara, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and chief guest litterateur Dr. Hampa Nagarajaiah have desecrated the holy shrine and ruined the sanctity of Nada Habba: MLC A.H. Vishwanath Mysuru: MLC A.H. Vishwanath has strongly criticised the political speeches made during the inauguration of Dasara-2024 atop Chamundi Hill yesterday, asserting that the event lost its sanctity due to the political undertones. Speaking to reporters at Jaladarshini Guest House here this morning, he stated that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah exploited the traditional Dasara inauguration to advance his political agenda. \u201cCM Siddaramaiah, who once spoke lightly of the Gods, has now sought the blessings of Goddess Chamundeshwari, the presiding deity of Mysuru,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dasara inauguration yesterday devolved into a political platform, with CM Siddaramaiah, MLA G.T. Devegowda (GTD), and even the inaugurator, Dr. Hampana, delivering speeches laden with political tones. It was more of a political event than a devotional one,\u201d Vishwanath lamented. He noted that the speakers, focused on their political agendas, overlooked the rich history of Nada Habba Dasara. \u201cDasara has shifted from being a public celebration to a political affair,\u201d he stated, adding that politicians have brought Dasara to a new low. Is GTD a MUDA beneficiary? Regarding MLA G.T. Devegowda\u2019s (GTD) praise for Siddaramaiah, he described it as mere flattery and theatrics. \u201cOne must wonder whether GTD is a beneficiary of the MUDA scam,\u201d he remarked, implying that the MLA\u2019s unnecessary adulation of the CM raises suspicions about his own connections to several MUDA sites. \u201cGTD turned the entire inauguration into a farce, and there is no excuse for this. The function became hypocritical, with everyone patting themselves on the back. It is truly unfortunate that nobody took the time to speak about Goddess Chamundeshwari, the erstwhile Mysuru Maharajas, or the glory of Dasara,\u201d he regretted. He further noted that Union Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has appointed a Non-Vokkaliga leader (C.B. Sureshbabu of the Kuruba community) as the Legislative Party leader of the JD(S), fearing that appointing a Vokkaliga leader might be detrimental to the party in the future. Vishwanath pointed out that no one from the Opposition has explicitly declared intentions to topple the State government, asserting that the Government is propagating this false narrative to protect itself amid the MUDA scam and divert public attention from it. Netas sullied Mysuru\u2019s reputation The MLC questioned whether Siddaramaiah had overlooked the verdict delivered by Justice M. Nagaprasanna, emphasising that the CM\u2019s wife wrote an emotional letter expressing her intention to return the 14 sites just hours after the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s intervention. He maintained that returning the sites does not erase the wrongdoing, arguing that the offence remains even if it is acknowledged. Vishwanath expressed scepticism about GTD\u2019s sudden vocal support for the CM, noting that the MLA has remained silent on the issue until now and allegedly possesses multiple MUDA sites himself. \u201cPoliticians are responsible for tarnishing Mysuru\u2019s reputation. There must be an investigation into all MUDA site allocations, and previous MUDA Commissioners should face imprisonment for their misconduct,\u201d he declared. MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority He further questioned the current MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority to cancel the Khata of the returned sites while the case is still under judicial review. \u201cSiddaramaiah should first read the 197-page verdict from the High Court. A thorough investigation into the entire MUDA scam is necessary. The current MUDA Commissioner must also be held accountable for hastily cancelling the Khata of the returned sites without properly examining the process,\u201d he stated, challenging the Commissioner\u2019s powers to unilaterally annul the Khata. Vishwanath argued that Siddaramaiah\u2019s remarks seem to suggest he operates above the law, accusing him of undermining the rule of law. He added that the Lokayukta case against Siddaramaiah cannot be withdrawn unilaterally, even after the CM\u2019s wife returned the 14 sites.",

        "text": "IndiGo is using artificial intelligence (AI) powered risk management platform to get real-time alerts about potential security risks and disruptions at airports in its global network, the airline said today. While airlines have been relying on AI for preventive maintenance or improving passenger experience, integrating a risk management platform will help IndiGo adjust its flight schedules proactively and minimise disruptions during emergencies. New tools for the new world This is especially crucial as aviation continues to be affected by global conflicts such as those in West Asia and Ukraine. Airlines have been forced to reroute or cancel flights due to these ongoing conflicts. Flight routes are selected taking into various factors such as enroute wind conditions, temperature, weather, geopolitical factors and navigation charges collected by countries. \u201cThis new technology empowers us to proactively identify potential risks by providing real-time intelligence, allowing us to make well-informed decisions that prioritise the well-being of everyone onboard. By integrating this intelligence into our operations, we can adjust flight plans proactively, minimize disruptions for our passengers, and ensure the highest level of safety across our expanding network,\u201d said Capt Ashim Mittra, IndiGo\u2019s Senior Vice President (operations). The advanced technology platform utilises artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyse vast amounts of data from various sources, including open-source intelligence (OSINT) and official aviation bodies like European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Meanwhile the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has called upon governments to protect civil aviation during conflict. \u201cDo no harm to civilian aircraft, airports or air navigation services. This is non-negotiable and must be respected, even at the height of hostility,\u201d IATA\u2019s director general Willie Walsh said in a statement on Friday.",

        "text": "Private sector banks offloaded loans worth Rs 21,000 crore through securitisation deals in the second quarter ended September 2024 (Q2 FY25) to generate funds amid intense competition for deposits. This will also help to improve the credit-deposit (C/D) ratio, according to the ratings agency ICRA. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had earlier expressed concern over the high C/D ratio for some lenders and sought a review of business models.Abhishek Dafria, group head, structured finance, ICRA, said the securitisation market\u2014pass-through certificates (PTCs) plus assignment\u2014witnessed an extraordinary quarter in Q2 FY25, with volumes touching Rs 60,000 crore. About 35 per cent of the volumes originated from private sector banks, which have dived into the securitisation market to improve their credit-deposit ratio given the relatively slower pace of deposit accretion, he added.The country\u2019s largest private lender, HDFC Bank, securitised new car loans worth Rs 9,063 crore through a PTC transaction where mutual funds were key investors. India Ratings has assigned an \"AAA\" rating to this asset-backed securities transaction.\"Regular issuances by large institutions will provide a fillip to the securitisation market, boost investor confidence\u2014including that of foreign portfolio investors\u2014while proactive regulatory guardrails will ensure financial market stability,\u201d said Jatin Nanaware, senior director, India Ratings.Besides banks, ICRA said non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) would also continue to raise funding through securitisation as they diversify their borrowing liabilities and improve their asset-liability management (ALM). The sustenance of volume growth in the coming quarters, however, remains to be seen, given the appetite for large-size transactions, as seen in Q2, may be limited. The securitisation volumes may reach Rs 2.1 trillion in the current financial year (FY25), Dafria of ICRA said.HDFC Bank securitised Rs 19,200 crore of loans as a strategic initiative to lower its high credit to deposit ratio (CD ratio)..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Increase in thermal stress and humidity due to climate change have turned out to be major factors contributing to infertility in dairy cows, posing a serious challenge to livestock farmers. Reportedly, more than 40% of cows slaughtered in Kerala are infertile and in order to address the issue the Animal Husbandry department will establish Regional Livestock Fertility Management Centres (RLFMC) across the State. A first of its kind initiative in Kerala, the project implemented through the Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) will provide multiple treatment options including IVF (in vitro fertilisation) to the farmers. \u201cA large percentage of infertility cases can be corrected. The RLMFC will take cases referred by department veterinarians and normally cows that fail to get pregnant after three sessions of Artificial Insemination (AI) will be considered,\u201d says R. Rajeev, managing director, KLDB. State-of-the-art facilities Each centre will have a mobile unit with state-of-the-art facilities for embryo transfer process, providing doorstep service to the farmers. It will be led by a team of experts, who will assess the cow\u2019s living conditions, feed, health and case history. While treatment for nutritional and hormonal problems will start immediately, some issues will require an extended period to be addressed. In the meantime, the RLFMC team will use software to collect and examine the data of each case and give instructions to the farmers. While infertility causes considerable losses for farmers, it also impacts Kerala\u2019s goal of attaining self-sufficiency in milk production. \u201cThe expense for producing an embryo and transferring it will come to around \u20b96,000. We mainly target heifers as chances of hormonal imbalance are higher in cows. Heifers are ideal carriers for embryo transfer,\u201d says Mr. Rajeev. The centres also offer the provision to opt for quality embryos if the cows are not superior breed. \u201cThe ovum can be taken from any other cow or the farmer can also opt for quality embryos produced by us. The mobile lab will assess fertility issues in cows and also carry out embryo transfers,\u201d he adds. A joint initiative of the State and the Centre, the RLFMCs will come up at Chithara in Kollam and Thalayolaparambu in Kottayam in the initial phase. Minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development J. Chinchurani will inaugurate State\u2019s first RLFMC in Kollam on Saturday.",

        "title": "254,000 jobs added in September as US economic growth holds steady: Report",
        "text": "The US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far surpassing expectations and alleviating concerns about a faltering job market, as per the US Department of Labor. The report has also beaten Wall Street's expectations of a substantial interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the New York Post.Unemployment rate dropsThe unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%, down from 4.2% the previous month, while hourly earnings rose by 4% year-on-year. Consensus estimates had predicted a gain of 150,000 jobs, a modest increase from the 142,000 reported for August. The unemployment rate had previously shown slight fluctuations, falling from an unexpected rise to 4.3% in July.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that further interest rate cuts are likely, but he emphasised a gradual approach designed to support a healthy economy. At the Fed's last meeting on September 18, officials reduced the rate to 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, and projected two additional quarter-point cuts in November and December.\u201cIf the economy performs as expected, that would mean two more cuts this year,\u201d Powell said.Private sector growthData from ADP showed that private sector companies added 143,000 jobs in September, surpassing analysts' estimates of 125,000 and marking a rebound from August's figure of 99,000. This increase ended a streak of five consecutive months of job declines.Despite these positive signs, there are indications of a weakening job market. The Labour Department reported that the quits rate, a crucial measure of worker confidence, fell to 1.9% in August, the lowest since June 2020. The hiring rate also declined to 3.3%, down from 3.4% in July, the weakest rate since August 2013, excluding the pandemic.Low layoffsPayroll growth across most sectors suggests fewer layoffs, although hiring has slowed due to reduced demand following the Federal Reserve's rate hikes of 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% last month, following a 0.5% rise in August, while year-on-year wages rose by 4.0%, up from 3.9% in August. This strong wage growth makes it unlikely that the US central bank will implement another half-percentage-point rate cut at its meeting on November 6-7.ChallengesThe labour market continues to add jobs at a steady pace, allowing Americans to maintain confidence and spending, which supports the economy. However, the hiring rate has slowed significantly, with an average of 116,000 jobs added monthly from June through August, marking the weakest three-month stretch since mid-2020.However, the economy has remained resilient, growing at a 3% annual pace from April to June, boosted by consumer spending and business investments. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta indicates a growth rate of 2.5% for the July-September quarter.Economic concerns weigh heavily on voters as the presidential election on November 5 approaches. While many Americans appreciate the job market's resilience, high prices continue to frustrate them, remaining approximately 19% above levels recorded in February 2021 when inflation began surging.",
        "summary": "The US economy experienced significant job growth last month, adding 254,000 jobs and reducing the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Despite a slowdown in the hiring rate and worker confidence, wage growth remains strong, making further substantial rate cuts from the Federal Reserve unlikely.",

        "text": "Gold has always been a haven both for investors and borrowers. Even in recent times, gold loans are becoming increasingly popular for those seeking quick financial assistance. They allow borrowers to leverage their gold jewellery to secure funds without the need for extensive complicated documentation or a perfect credit score. Moreover, gold loan interest rates are generally lower than unsecured loans, making them a cost-effective borrowing option. Understanding the various benefits of a gold loan is essential, if an individual is planning on availing one. This can significantly improve one's overall borrowing experience. Bajaj Finance Gold Loan All about the gold loan A gold loan is a secured loan where individuals can pledge their 18-22 karat gold jewellery as collateral to obtain funds. This type of loan offers numerous benefits, including: Quick processing Gold loans are typically processed much faster than traditional loans, with many lenders offering instant approvals. This rapid turnaround can be a lifesaver for those facing unexpected expenses. Higher loan amounts Borrowers can receive loans based on the value of the gold pledged, often up to 75% of its market value. This flexibility allows individuals to secure the exact amount they need without overcommitting. No need for perfect credit score Since gold acts as collateral, lenders are more lenient regarding the borrowers credit history. This makes gold loans an attractive option for those who may struggle to secure other types of financing due to a lower CIBIL score. Reasons to choose Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan There are multiple lenders in the market that one can choose from. However, here are some reasons that make Bajaj Finance a preferable choice for many borrowers: Quick loan processing Bajaj Finance processes gold loans quickly, allowing borrowers to get the funds they need without delays. This is particularly helpful when funding immediate expenses, such as medical bills or urgent repairs. Minimal documentation Borrowers can secure a substantial loan amount by submitting their basic KYC documents like Aadhaar card, Voter ID, driving licence, passport, letter from NPR or NREGA job card. High loan amount One can get a loan starting from \u00e2\u0082\u00b95,000 to \u00e2\u0082\u00b92 crore, depending on the value of the gold pledged, gold loan interest rate, and the borrowers liquidity requirements. This makes it possible for individuals to meet their financial needs, whether big or small. Convenient repayment options With multiple repayment plans, borrowers can choose a schedule that suits their financial situation, making it easier to manage repayments. This flexibility ensures that borrowers can stay on top of their finances without feeling overwhelmed. Zero part-prepayment fee Bajaj Finance does not levy any part-prepayment fees, allowing borrowers to save on unnecessary administrative costs when they clear their loans early. This feature is especially beneficial for those who might receive windfalls or bonuses and wish to reduce their debt. Complimentary insurance on gold assets When opting for a loan with Bajaj Finance, pledging gold is insured for free, providing added peace of mind. This safeguard ensures that borrowers do not have to worry about the security of their valuable assets while they are being used as collateral.

        "title": "Insurance Query: Evaluating business-owners\u2019 financial stability",
        "text": "I am 42 years old. I run my own business. I wish to buy life insurance, but I don\u2019t get salary slips, which is an important document to buy a policy. How can I get covered? Congratulations on taking the important step of considering life insurance. It is an essential tool to secure the future of your dependents and safeguard your business interests. Insurance providers understand that entrepreneurs and business-owners like yourself have different financial structures and offer various alternative ways to evaluate your financial stability. There are several options available to you: Bank statements: Your bank statements can offer a clear picture of your financial health and stability. As a business-owner, your transactional history and cash flow from your primary bank account (reasonably reflecting your business and savings) will serve as proof of income. By examining your regular deposits and business-related transactions, we can get a comprehensive understanding of your financial standing. A 12-month record of your bank statements is typically sufficient to demonstrate your financial viability. Using account aggregators, your bank statements can be verified digitally with your consent, with your mobile number and an OTP. Income tax returns (ITR): Another excellent option is your ITR. They reflect your declared income over time and are particularly useful for self-employed individuals or business owners whose income may fluctuate. Your ITR provides consistency, helping us determine an accurate picture of your earning capacity. This is a reliable document for underwriting purposes, giving us the confidence to offer you a suitable insurance policy. Vahan portal: If you own a vehicle, we can retrieve information from the Vahan Dashboard, a government database of registered vehicles. These data help us assess your assets and overall financial position. While vehicle ownership may not directly indicate your full financial strength, it adds another dimension to your profile, further enriching the financial underwriting process. Credit history: Your credit history \u2014 whether through credit card transactions, personal loans, or business loans \u2014 can be accessed via credit bureaus based on your PAN. This allows us to assess your financial behaviour, creditworthiness, and ability to manage financial obligations. A strong credit score is a key indicator of financial health and can significantly strengthen your life insurance application. GST details: As a business-owner, your goods and services tax (GST) filings can be another surrogate for salary slips. GST returns provide insight into your business\u2019 turnover and profitability, helping us assess your financial standing and stability. If your business is registered under GST, sharing your filings can help us tailor your insurance coverage based on your business performance. Other ways In rare cases, when the above financial surrogates may not fully establish your eligibility, there are still ways to secure a policy. Insurers are often open to considering other financial assets you may own, such as property, investments or business assets, that can demonstrate your financial strength. Flexibility is key, and we believe that every customer deserves a thorough and fair evaluation. Points to note You can present any asset you own \u2014 property, mutual funds, fixed deposits, or business assets. All of these contribute to demonstrating your financial health for the purposes of underwriting. Always provide clear, accurate and up-to-date financial documents. This ensures a smooth, hassle-free process with no delays in securing your life insurance policy. Since every individual\u2019s financial situation is unique, especially for business-owners like yourself, insurance companies now offer policies designed specifically for entrepreneurs and other self-employed individuals.

        "title": "RBI survey indicates slowdown in manufacturing",
        "text": "The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) latest quarterly industrial outlook survey of 1,300 manufacturing companies reveals that manufacturing companies are witnessing a slowing growth in the first and second quarter of 2024-25. This is also mirrored in manufacturing PMI which is tapering downwards.\n\nAccording to RBI survey data, the net response (difference in the percentage of companies reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism) regarding production output has decreased from 27.9 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 22.9 per cent in Q2 2024-25. The number was 34.4 in the fourth quarter of FY24. This implies that more manufacturers witnessed slowdown in production this fiscal. One concern is that the companies polled indicated a steep fall in growth expectation of production output in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal.\n\nThe RBI survey report states that the pressure from raw material costs, financing expenses, and salary payments has eased. As a result, expectations of growth in selling prices and profit margins have also softened. \u201cManufacturers polled for better expectations on production, order books, employment, capacity utilisation and overall business situation during Q4:2024-25 and Q1:2025-26. Input cost pressures are likely to continue for manufacturers, who expect to retain pricing power and increase in selling prices on the back of robust demand conditions,\u201d the survey report reads.\n\nGeopolitical strife\n\nRamendra Verma, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat says, \u201cThiscan be attributed to a chain reaction of geo-political situation, which has resulted in supply chain disruptions leading to high inputs costs (for e.g. \u2013 energy and semiconductors). This is also leading to weakening of demand.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, net responses for order book growth dropped 25.6 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 19.5 per cent in Q2 2024-25, while net responses for pending orders increased from 5.9 per cent to 8 per cent in the same period. Similarly, net responses for capacity utilisation fell from 18.7 per cent to 15.1 per cent.\n\nVerma outlined several factors contributing to the low net responses for order books, such as declining consumer confidence and reduced spending, which have led to fewer new orders. Additionally, global economic uncertainties have made businesses reluctant to place large orders. \u201cMany manufacturers are operating below capacity due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions,\u201d Verma explained, adding that this under-utilisation is also linked to more cautious inventory management practices.\n\nSujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, pointed out that the slower growth in related indicators aligns with the decline in industrial production. In Q1 FY25, capacity utilisation dropped after surpassing 75 per cent in the final quarter of the previous fiscal. \u201cOne of the reasons for lower utilisation was elections which usually disrupts activity along with heatwaves especially in the north. This was also highlighted in the PMI survey which indicated some of the factories remained shut due to excessive heat,\u201d Hajra added. \n\nThe monthly Purchasing Managers Index for India\u2019s manufacturing sector has also shown a downward trend. It was reported at 58.8 in April 2024, remained relatively stable at 58.3 in June, but declined slightly to 57.5 in August 2024, and further dropped to 56.5 in September 2024.\n\nThe global market research firm Nomura\u2019s report indicates a similar weakening outlook. \u201cEven as the pace of government spending picks up in coming months and base effects become more favourable, we expect growth momentum to remain soft, due to fading urban pent-up demand, tight monetary policy, a moderation in credit growth, negative real rural wage growth, sluggish private capex and soft external demand,\u201d the Nomura report says.",

Parvathi, along with other irregularities related to 50:50 site allocations, alternative sites and compensatory sites. Social activist Snehamayi Krishna has complained to the ED that irregularities worth Rs. 4,000 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore has happened in MUDA.\n\nThe team, accompanied by armed personnel, travelled from Bengaluru\u2019s Shantinagar Office and arrived at MUDA gate around 10.45 am. More than 20 armed personnel from Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have provided security to the ED sleuths. The Mysuru City Police are providing additional security.\n\nAfter their arrival, an ED representative informed the Police officers on duty at MUDA gate that they were from ED in Bengaluru. Upon hearing the update, MUDA Commissioner A.N. Raghunandan promptly arrived at the gate to welcome the ED officers. Subsequently, the sleuths proceeded directly to the MUDA Commissioner\u2019s chamber on second floor, where they began discussions in the antechamber around 11.30 am.\n\nAn Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Siddaramaiah, Parvathi and others, revolving around allegations of illegal money transfers linked to the land allotments.\n\nRaid at Kengeri home\n\nSources informed Star of Mysore that the ED team also conducted a raid at the residence of J. Devaraju in Kengeri, Bengaluru. Devaraju was the individual who sold the 3.16-acre land at Kesare to B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy, Parvathi\u2019s brother. Mallikarjunaswamy later gifted the land to Parvathi, in exchange for which she received 14 sites in the Vijayanagar Third and Fourth Stages under a 50:50 ratio.\n\nAfter a brief discussion in the antechamber of the Commissioner\u2019s Office, the ED sleuths proceeded to MUDA Chairman\u2019s Office. Chairman K. Marigowda has already resigned from his post. The officers then moved to the meeting room adjacent to Chairman\u2019s Office, where they held discussions with senior officials.\n\nWill cooperate: MUDA Secretary\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the MUDA Office around 12.15 pm, MUDA Secretary Prasanna Kumar stated that the ED has officially commenced its investigation. \u201cWe will cooperate with the sleuths and provide whatever information they request. All documents will be made available, and there will be no public work for two days,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked how much longer the ED sleuths intend to remain in Mysuru, the MUDA Secretary replied that, for now, they would stay for two days. \u201cDepending on their progress, their stay might be extended. Ultimately, it is for them to decide, and I have no role to play in that matter,\u201d he added.\n\nSeeking documents\n\nBefore arriving in Mysuru, the ED had instructed MUDA to submit all the crucial documents related to the case, which forms the basis of the FIR (11/2024) registered by the Lokayukta against Siddaramaiah, his wife Parvathi, his brother-in-law B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy and landowner J. Devaraju.\n\nLokayukta Police have already launched a detailed investigation, examining alleged offences spanning from 1968 to 2023. Teams are tracing records dating as far back as 1935, when Ninga, father of Devaraju, originally owned the disputed land in Kesare\u2019s survey numbers 462 and 464.",

        "title": "Why this small-cap real estate and EPC company is a worthy buy",
        "text": "Both the construction and infrastructure industries have taken off strongly in the post-Covid period. Residential real estate and commercial construction have been on overdrive over the past three-four years. Infrastructure projects such as ports have been in the limelight for a while now and continue to see considerable traction.\n\nAs a play on these segments, Man Infraconstruction (Man Infra) has been a key beneficiary of the offtake in the real estate and construction businesses.\n\nThe company focuses on residential construction and infrastructure projects (ports). It takes an EPC (engineering, procurement and contracting/construction) approach in its infrastructure business as well as select real estate projects. \n\nIn the residential construction segment, Man Infra takes the joint development agreement (JDA), joint venture (JV), development manager (DM) and society redevelopment approaches, which ensure that the upfront investments are minimal and margins are healthy. It is focused on the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in its residential towers projects.\n\nAt \u20b9190, the stock trades at 23 times its per share earnings for FY24 and 19 times its likely per share earnings for FY25. This is among the lowest valuation multiples commanded by any real estate or construction company with mid-sized operations. The BSE Realty trades at a PE of nearly 65 times, while most frontline and mid-sized real estate players trade at price-earnings multiples of 30-70 times. \n\nA track record of strong execution of projects, expertise in residential, commercial properties, as well as ports, multiple revenue streams via a low-risk, asset-light business model and a net-debt-free balance sheet are positives for Man Infra. The company has both private and public sector clients.\n\nThe stock has corrected about 20 per cent from its recent high and presents a reasonably attractive opportunity. Investors with a two-three-year perspective can buy the shares of the company at the current price. \n\nBetween FY22 and FY24, the company\u2019s revenues grew at a compounded annual rate of 43.5 per cent to \u20b91,263.5 crore in FY24, while net profits rose at nearly 111 per cent annually to \u20b9300.4 crore. It enjoys an EBITDA margin of 25.8 per cent in FY24, which is among the best in the industry.\n\nDiversified operating model\n\nMan Infra has been in the construction business for nearly 60 years now. It has specialised capabilities in the ports business. It has helped in the development of eight major ports in India including those of Navi Mumbai, Chennai, Gujarat Pipavav, Mundra and Kochi. It has also been an EPC contractor for leading infrastructure companies and real estate developers. \n\nIn the last several years, Man Infra has been able to up its game in the residential space. Projects such as Atmosphere O2, Mulund West (47 storeys \u2013 two towers), Aaradhya Highpark, Nr. Dahisar (30 storeys \u2013 six towers) and Aaradhya EastWind, Vikhroli (34 storeys) were executed in three-and-a-half to four years.\n\nIn the last 10 years, the company has become a reasonably-established player in the MMR, with a presence in the central, eastern, western suburbs and recently in South Mumbai as well.\n\nIn all, 17 projects totalling 2.4 million sq ft have been delivered, mostly six months to one year ahead of schedule. Around 90 per cent of its inventory reportedly is sold before even the occupancy certificate is received.\n\nMan Infra receives DM fee for handling and marketing a real estate project. It receives EPC margin for in-house construction and engineering capabilities. The company receives interest margin on funds infused into projects. \n\nIn the EPC business, it receives regular EPC margin from the government and private clients. When it professionally manages a site, material and labour of a real estate project, it receives a PMC (project management consultancy) margin. \n\nRevenues from projects executed under the DM model are not reflected in consolidated sales figures, but only the DM fee (12-14 per cent of total project revenues) gets added to the sales and PBT.\n\nFor projects executed under the JV model, sales are not reflected in the consolidated revenue figure, but the company\u2019s share of profits gets added to the bottom line.\n\nThus, in the DM model, all costs and revenues are booked in the landlord\u2019s financials, while in the JV model, all costs and revenues are booked in the SPV, even as Man Infra receives a share of profit based on the extent of its stake in the venture.\n\nThis asset-light approach is set to continue for the company. Given the focus on DM and JV-based revenue generation, the top-line growth may not be as robust as in the past few years, though profitability is set to receive a considerable boost given that minimal to no upfront capital commitment is required.\n\nFuture potential and healthy financials\n\nMan Infra has cash and cash equivalents of \u20b9487 crore as of June 2024. Its debt was only \u20b933 crore as of June 2024, down from \u20b9332 crore in September 2022. Very few real estate and construction players enjoy a net-debt-free balance sheet as well as healthy operating margins.\n\nThe company has 6.1 million sq ft of carpet area waiting for execution over the next several years. Man Infra\u2019s real estate business itself has a visibility of \u20b915,000 crore over the next five-six years, with margins expected to be north of 20 per cent consistently.",

        "text": "As the agriculture minister chairs the annual conference on Rabi crops on Saturday, where strategies will be chalked out with States for a bumper harvest, one important issue to grab attention may be the shortage of Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), the key fertiliser used in wheat, mustard and gram, all three major winter crops. \n\nLatest data show that sales of DAP fell to 7.76 lakh tonnes (lt) last month, which is 51 per cent lower from 15.7 lt year-ago. Monthly sales of DAP in September were reported at 11.15 lt in 2022, 5.96 lt in 2021, 7.65 lt in 2020 and 6.33 lt in 2019.\n\n\u201cFarmers normally buy DAP in September-October to prepare the field for the sowing. With a favourable monsoon and its delayed withdrawal as well as good moisture has created the demand for fertilisers as farmers expect a good harvest of winter crops,\u201d said agriculture scientist A K Singh. \n\nAlso read: India decides to ease rice export curbs further\n\nWith the reports of farmers\u2019 protest over alleged shortages of DAP coming particularly from Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, there is something amiss as far as availability is concerned, Singh added.\n\n\u201cWheat crop this year is very crucial and the government should not take any chance and ensure ample and timely availability,\u201d Singh suggested and added that there should be study on shrivelled crop of wheat, which has been continuing for last few years and the government has been relaxing procurement norms in one state or the other.\n\nAccording to the crop weather watch report, the total fertiliser sale during Kharif season 2024 (April-September) was 319.97 lt which included 189.12 lt of urea, 46.12 lt of DAP, 9.27 lt of MOP and 75.46 lt of complex (a mixture of N, P , K nutrients). The total demand for the season was estimated at 321.44 lt \u2013 177.12 lt of urea, 59.87 lt of DAP, 10.26 lt of MOP and 74.19 lt of complex.\n\nSingh said that it is unusual to see the fall in sales of DAP as against its projected demand whereas there is no such difference noticed in other fertilisers when sales data are compared with demand.\n\nOfficial data show that sales of urea were up 3.1 per cent at 30.89 lt in September 2024 from 29.97 lt year-ago, but those of MOP were down 4.7 per cent at 2.25 lt from 2.36 lt and complex dropped by 11.6 per cent at 16.6 lt from 18.77 lt.\n\nThe Centre will discuss (on October 19) with state officials about the plan and strategies about the on-going Rabi sowing season that started from October 1, to ensure that the winter-grown foodgrains production target of 164 million tonnes (mt) including 115 mt of wheat, 13.65 mt of gram and 13.8 mt of mustard, officials said.\n\nAlso read: Rice exports a tad lower in H1, but trade sees shipments gaining pace in year ahead as govt eases curbs",

        "text": "If there is any \u201csurakhsha kavach\u201d Bollywood star Salman Khan trusts his life with \u2014 it is his Firoza bracelet. Even as security for Salman is at an all-time high following threats from gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, the actor has immense faith in his bracelet, which, he feels, has kept him safe so far. The bracelet, passed on to him by his father Salim Khan, has been integral to Salman\u2019s life for several decades. You will never spot Salman without the bracelet. So how does the Firoza bracelet secure Salman Khan? In a recently resurfaced Reddit video, Salman elucidates the protective mechanism of the \u201cFiroza\u201d stone in his bracelet. He says, \u201cThis stone is called Firoza. Apparently, there are only two living stones, they say. One is a Greek, and one is a Firoza. This is the turquoise. What happens with this is if there\u2019s any negativity coming onto you, first this takes it. It gets veins in it and then it cracks. This is my seventh stone.\u201d Healing properties Turquoise, a mesmerising gemstone, is recognised not only for its vibrant blue-green hue but also for its rich history and believed metaphysical properties. The benefits of wearing turquoise are manifold, spanning from health and emotional well-being to spiritual growth,\u201d says Dr Priya Kaul, a spiritual life coach and healer. \u201cIt is supposed to calm and reduce anxiety and tension. Its calming effect can help people handle anger and stress, promoting stability, she says adding, \u201cThis gemstone promotes self-expression and communication, which may help emotional upheaval sufferers.\u201d Firoza, the living stone Turquoise, also popularly known as \u201cFiroza\u201d, is a powerful gem that brings in good luck, blessings of higher powers, and spiritual protection to people who tend to get into conflicts very often. \u201cIt\u2019s a stone that activates your good luck and ability to get through situations. Turquoise is associated with the planet Jupiter, which activates the luck side of divine protection,\u201d says Neelam Naseeb, CEO of MBM Crystals and the Ursoulcompass community. People who tend to be overly emotional at times can wear this crystal to balance their emotions. Neelam says, \u201cAstrologically and spiritually, anyone can wear this crystal to enhance good luck and protection.\u201d She suggests that individuals seeking balance and making decisions based on divine guidance, rather than emotions, should wear this more frequently. Enhanced Communication: Dr Priya refers to turquoise as the \u201cstone of communication.\u201d \u201cIt encourages open dialogue, making it a perfect companion for those in professions that require clear expressions\u2014like teaching, counselling, or public speaking.\u201d Spiritual Growth: \u201cMany practitioners of meditation and yoga wear turquoise to enhance their spiritual journey, as it helps to release outdated belief systems and foster a deeper connection to one\u2019s higher self,\u201d says Priya. Physical Well-Being: People believe that turquoise supports the respiratory system, alleviates ailments like asthma, and promotes overall physical well-being. \u201cIts detoxifying properties may also improve metabolic processes and enhance immunity. People often wear turquoise as a talisman for overall health and protection against illness.\u201d Protection and Safety: Many ancient cultures, including Native Americans, wore it as a safeguard against negative energies, psychic attacks, and physical threats. \u201cFor those who travel frequently or live in uncertain circumstances, wearing turquoise can impart a sense of safety and security.\u201d Promoting Creativity: The vibrant colours of turquoise stimulate creativity and inspire self-expression. Artists, musicians, and writers often wear this gemstone to tap into their creative energies.

        "title": "Your Guide to Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates in India",
        "text": "Purchasing a car is not just a significant milestone; it\u2019s often a major financial commitment that can impact your budget for years to come. One of the most crucial aspects of financing your vehicle is securing the best car loan interest rates. Whether you\u2019re considering a sleek new model or a reliable used car, understanding how to get favorable loan terms can save you substantial money over time. This guide provides essential tips and insights to help you secure the best deal on your car loan and streamline your new car loan approval process.\n\nWhy Car Loan Interest Rates Matter\n\nCar loan interest rates play a vital role in determining how much you will ultimately pay for your vehicle. A lower interest rate means reduced monthly payments and lower total interest paid over the loan term. On the other hand, a higher interest rate can inflate the overall cost of your vehicle, leading to financial strain.\n\nFor example, consider a \u20b910,00,000 car loan with a five-year term. If you secure a loan with an 8% interest rate, your monthly payment will be approximately \u20b920,000. However, if your interest rate is 12%, your monthly payment jumps to around \u20b922,000. Over five years, that\u2019s a difference of nearly \u20b91,20,000! Clearly, understanding how to obtain the best car loan interest rates is essential for making a sound financial decision.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nSeveral factors influence the car loan interest rates you may qualify for, including:\n\n1. Credit Score\n\nYour credit score is one of the most significant determinants of your car loan interest rates. Lenders assess your creditworthiness based on this score; a higher credit score generally results in a lower interest rate. For example, individuals with a score above 700 typically enjoy more favorable loan terms than those with lower scores.\n\nBefore applying for a car loan, it\u2019s wise to check your credit score. If you find areas for improvement, such as outstanding debts or errors on your credit report, take steps to rectify these issues. Paying off debts and ensuring timely payments can help boost your score, making you more attractive to lenders.\n\n2. Loan Term\n\nThe length of your loan, or the term, can also impact your interest rate. Generally, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates, while longer-term loans may carry higher rates but result in lower monthly payments. It\u2019s crucial to strike a balance that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nWhile a longer loan term might seem appealing due to lower monthly payments, keep in mind that you could end up paying significantly more in interest over the life of the loan. Consider your budget and long-term financial objectives when choosing a loan term.\n\n3. Loan Amount and Down Payment\n\nThe amount you borrow, and your down payment can influence the interest rate offered. A larger down payment reduces the loan amount, which can lead to a lower interest rate. Additionally, a significant down payment shows lenders that you are financially responsible, potentially improving your loan terms.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the car\u2019s purchase price. For example, if you\u2019re purchasing a car for \u20b915,00,000, a down payment of \u20b93,00,000 can significantly improve your chances of securing a better rate.\n\n4. Market Conditions\n\nCurrent market conditions can also affect car loan interest rates. Economic factors, such as inflation and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policies, can influence lending rates across the board. Keeping an eye on market trends can help you time your loan application for better rates.\n\nTips for Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nTo maximize your chances of obtaining the best car loan interest rates, follow these actionable tips:\n\n1. Improve Your Credit Score\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a higher credit score can lead to lower interest rates. Take proactive steps to improve your credit before applying for a loan:\n\n\u2022 Pay bills on time: Late payments can negatively impact your score.\n\n\u2022 Reduce outstanding debts: Aim to lower credit card balances and pay off loans.\n\n\u2022 Check your credit report: Correct any errors that may be affecting your score.\n\n2. Shop Around\n\nNot all lenders offer the same car loan interest rates. To find the best deal, compare rates from various sources, including banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Make sure to take into account the loan terms, fees, and other charges that may apply.\n\nUse online comparison tools to simplify this process. A little research can go a long way in helping you secure a better interest rate.\n\n3. Consider Pre-Approval\n\nGetting pre-approved for a car loan can significantly enhance your bargaining power when shopping for a vehicle. Pre-approval provides you with a clear idea of how much you can borrow and what interest rates you might qualify for. This not only streamlines the buying process but also strengthens your position when negotiating with dealerships.\n\nAdditionally, a pre-approved loan can help you avoid high dealer financing rates, ensuring that you stick to your budget.\n\n4. Negotiate Your Rate\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to negotiate with lenders. If you receive a better rate from another lender, use it as leverage in your discussions. Many lenders are willing to match or even beat competing offers to secure your business.\n\nBe prepared to discuss your credit history and financial situation during negotiations. Demonstrating that you\u2019ve done your research can bolster your position.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Additional Fees\n\nWhen considering a car loan, pay attention to any additional fees that may affect your overall costs. These can include:\n\nProcessing fees\n\nPrepayment penalties\n\nLate payment fees\n\nUnderstanding these charges can help you make a more informed decision about your loan.\n\n6. Stay Informed About Market Trends\n\nKeeping an eye on market conditions can help you identify the best time to apply for a loan. Interest rates can fluctuate based on economic factors, so being informed can guide your decision-making process.\n\nNavigating the world of car loan interest rates doesn\u2019t have to be daunting. By understanding the factors that influence your rate and taking proactive measures, you can significantly reduce your vehicle's overall cost. Start by checking your credit score, comparing lenders, considering your loan term, and confidently negotiating your rate. With these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to drive off in your new car with a loan that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nReady to kick off your journey? Begin by reviewing your credit score and exploring various lenders to uncover the best car loan interest rates available. Your dream car is within reach\u2014ensure you\u2019re financing it wisely!",

DJI denied these claims and suspended business operations in both Russia and Ukraine in April 2022 to reassess compliance requirements.DJI was also previously blacklisted by the US department of the treasury in 2021 for allegedly supporting the surveillance of the Uyghur minority in China's Xinjiang region.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 19 (KNN) India\u2019s merchandise exports grew marginally by 1 per cent in the first half (H1) of FY25, rising to USD 213.22 billion from USD 211.08 billion in the same period last year, despite a challenging global environment.\n\nTraditional export drivers, such as petroleum products and gems and jewellery, saw significant declines due to slow growth in developed markets. However, robust performances in pharmaceuticals, electronics, and engineering goods provided some relief.\n\nEngineering goods, which account for around 25 per cent of India\u2019s export basket, grew 5.27 per cent annually to USD 56.24 billion, according to the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. \n\nElectronics exports surged by 19.74 per cent to USD 15.64 billion, and shipments of drugs and pharmaceuticals expanded by 7.99 per cent to USD 14.43 billion. Additionally, organic and inorganic chemical exports grew by 4.57 per cent to USD 14.11 billion.\n\n\"India has made a mark with its engineering products and chemical exports,\" said Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal. \"Though merchandise exports have faced global challenges, India is outperforming the global average.\"\n\nTraditionally strong export sectors have struggled amid global slowdowns. Exports of petroleum products dropped by 12.48 per cent to USD 36.54 billion, while gems and jewellery exports fell 10.89 per cent to USD 13.92 billion. \n\nA slowdown in developed economies, along with higher crude prices and disruptions in global supply chains, compounded these challenges.\n\nIndia\u2019s trade dynamics have been shaped by several international factors, including the Russia-Ukraine war, which has kept energy prices elevated, and tensions between the US and China, which have disrupted supply chains. \n\nAdditional pressures arose from Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, causing higher freight rates, and the EU\u2019s new carbon tax and forest regulations.\n\nWhile the WTO projects a gradual recovery in global trade, predicting 2.6 per cent volume growth in 2024 and 3.3 per cent in 2025, geopolitical risks remain.\n\nIndia\u2019s top export markets during H1 included the US, the UAE, the Netherlands, the UK, and China. Despite modest export growth, the country\u2019s trade deficit widened by over 24 per cent to USD 54.83 billion during April-September, compared to USD 44.18 billion in the same period last year. However, September saw the deficit narrow to a five-month low.\n\n\u201cThe external sector needs close monitoring, with real-time interventions when necessary,\u201d said Manoranjan Sharma, chief economist at Infomerics Ratings.\n\nIndia\u2019s evolving trade scenario underscores the importance of diversification and resilience to navigate global uncertainties. The focus on engineering, electronics, and pharmaceuticals could drive export growth as global trade recovers.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

        "text": "The dollar index continued its rise for the third consecutive week. The rise to 104 almost happened last week in line with our expectation. The index touched a high of 103.87, and has come down from there to close the week at 103.49. \n\nDollar outlook\n\nThe overall bullish view is intact. The dollar index (103.49) has some resistance at 104 which can be tested this week. We expect this resistance to hold on its first test.\n\n A corrective fall from around 104 to 103-102.70 is a possibility. A fresh leg of up-move thereafter will have the potential to breach 104. That in turn will open the doors for the dollar index to see a fresh rise to 105-105.50 in the coming weeks. \n\nFinds support\n\nThe US 10Yr Treasury yield (4.08 per cent) is getting support around 4 per cent. The yield fell in the first half of the week and made a low of 3.99 per cent. But from there it rose back well in the second half recovering all the loss.\n\nImmediate resistance is at 4.12 per cent. A break above it can take the US 10Yr Treasury yield up to 4.17 and 4.21 per cent this week. The price action thereafter will need a close watch to see if the rise is extending beyond 4.21 per cent or not.\n\nThe outlook will turn negative only if the yield declines below 4 per cent. Only then the chances of a fall to 3.85-3.8 per cent will come into the picture again.\n\nMore downside\n\nThe euro (EURUSD: 1.0867) continues to fall. It touched a low of 1.0811 and has bounced back from there. The broader trend is down. Resistances are at 1.0885 and then 1.0920-1.0930 which can cap the upside if more rise is seen from current levels.\n\nThe outlook is bearish to break 1.08 in the coming days. Such a break can take the euro down to 1.0750 in the short term.\n\nThe level of 1.0750 is a strong support which can halt the current fall. A bounce from there can trigger a corrective rise to 1.09-1.0950 going forward.\n\nThe Indian rupee (USDINR: 84.07) was broadly stable all through last week. The domestic currency was stuck in a narrow 10-paise range of 83.98-84.08 through the week. The break above 84 seen on Wednesday failed to get a strong follow-through rise. There are chances for the rupee to remain stuck between 84 and 84.10 for some more time.\n\nHowever, the bias is negative. We expect the rupee to break 84.10 eventually and decline towards 84.40 going forward. \n\nRupee has to get a sustained rise above 84 in order to see a recovery towards 83.85-83.80.\n\nOn the charts, the medium-term picture is negative for the rupee. It is likely to remain below 83.50 going forward. Once the break below 84.10 happens, it will open the doors for the rupee to weaken towards 84.80-85 over the medium-term.",

        "text": "The Nobel prize in economics for 2024, or more correctly Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded earlier this week has triggered off debates not as much about economics but about colonialism and its institutions. Economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were awarded for their significant work on how a nation\u2019s institutions shape its economic development. Among the most cited in economics, their work not only draws a connection between the two but parses societal institutions into \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cextractive\u201d, and theorises that inclusive institutions have a positive long-term impact on economic prosperity while extractive institutions stifle a country\u2019s economic development. They claim inclusive institutions are the ones that promote democracy, limit corruption, enforce justice and property rights; the extractive show a high concentration of power, corruption, and limited political freedom.\n\nThe claim that certain institutions are a pre-condition for economic development has drawn criticism from within the discipline because inclusive institutions in many high-income western economies came about after their development. Equally important is how countries like China, to take an example, enjoy staggering economic prosperity despite \u201cextractive\u201d institutions. The economists have ignored the impact of colonialism \u2014 and its extractive institutions in colonies \u2014 on economic development. This should interest India where the flavour of the season is to throw off the colonial yoke and symbols. Its institutions, a colonial legacy, still function on the discredited trickle-down theory; there has been a staggering rise in its billionaires count even as household savings have fallen sharply with people spending more on basic necessities. If anything, this year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics draws attention to why it is critical for India to de-colonise its economic structure that was, and continues to be, based on the extractive principle.",

        "text": "State-run lender UCO Bank on Saturday reported around 50 per cent year-on-year growth in its net profit to \u20b9602.74 crore for the second quarter this fiscal, backed by over 45 per cent y-o-y rise in its operating profit and around 44 per cent y-o-y fall in provisions during the period.\n\nThe Kolkata-based bank had registered \u20b9401.67 crore net profit for the second quarter last fiscal. The lender posted \u20b9550.96 crore net profit in the first quarter of the current financial year. \n\nIts operating profit for the second quarter of FY25 grew \u20b945.80 crore to \u20b91431.60 crore from \u20b9 981.88 crore for the corresponding period of FY24, the bank said in a stock exchange filing. \n\nNet Interest Income (NII) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 stood at \u20b92300.34 crore, registering a growth of around 20 per cent on a y-o-y basis as against \u20b91916.55 crore for the same period a year ago. Domestic Net Interest Margin (NIM) rose 25 basis points y-o-y to 3.30 per cent. During the period non-interest income grew 53.48 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9993.07 crore. \n\nTalking to the media, UCO Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Office Ashwani Kumar said the increase in net interest income and non-interest income were the two main factors for the growth in net profit. \u201cOur provision coverage ratio slightly came down and NIM improved,\u201d Kumar said. Provision Coverage Ratio stood at 95.92 per cent as on September 30, 2024.\n\nTotal provision during the quarter fell 44.07 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9492.84 crore compared with \u20b9342.09 crore for the same period last fiscal. Fresh slippages stood at \u20b9864 crore during Q2FY25 compared with \u20b9578 crore in Q2FY24. \u201cSlippage was slightly elevated in this quarter due to one corporate account which turned into an NPA, having an exposure of around \u20b9245 crore,\u201d the MD said. \n\nTotal Recovery and upgradation\n\nTotal recovery and upgradation during the period stood at \u20b91017 crore as against \u20b9656 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal. \n\nUCO Bank has so far recovered around 90 per cent of the \u201cerroneous credits\u201d which certain account holders of the bank had received via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) last year. \u201cActions are on to recover the rest of the money. Our endeavour is to recover maximum during this fiscal,\u201d Kumar said. Notably, certain accounts holders of the Kolkata-based bank in November last year had received a total of around Rs 820 crore \u201cerroneous credits\u201d via IMPS.\n\nThe lender\u2019s asset quality improved during Q2FY25. Gross NPA ratio fell 96 bps year-on-year to 3.18 per cent, whereas net NPA ratio fell 38 bps y-o-y to 0.73 per cent during the period. \n\nThe bank is planning to tap capital markets for raising of equity capital upto \u20b9 1500-2000 crore by way of QIP in one or more tranches. \u201cWe may go for it in the third quarter, subject to market conditions,\u201d Kumar said. \n\nThe bank\u2019s overall loan growth target for this fiscal is 12-14 per cent y-o-y. It expects that home and car loans to grow 18 per cent and 30 per cent y-o-y, respectively, during this festive season.\n\nIn the second quarter the lender witnessed an 18 per cent y-o-y growth in gross advances, while deposits growth stood at 10.57 per cent y-o-y.",

        "text": "India sustained a robust economic growth rate of 8.2 per cent in FY 2023-24, up from 7.0 per cent the previous year, expanding its economy to an estimated $3.5 trillion. \n\nWith the ongoing structural reforms, the country aims to achieve a $5 trillion economy by 2027. Among the key industries fueling this growth, the Indian government has prioritised the agrochemical sector, recognising it as one of the \u201c12 industries with the greatest potential for India to achieve global leadership.\u201d\n\nThe agrochemical sector has experienced significant progress, with projections estimating its value will reach $8.22 billion by 2024 and grow to $13.08 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 4 per cent. \n\nHowever, FY2023-24 brought its share of challenges, including fluctuating markets, rising raw material costs, and unpredictable monsoons. \n\nAlso read: What is it in the Digital Farm Mission?\n\nResilient industry\n\nThe industry has remained resilient, supported by government initiatives like \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cAtmanirbhar Abhiyan,\u201d strategic investments, and a focus on innovation. Increased collaboration in research and development, alongside the growing focus on manufacturing is expected to further drive the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nInternational magazine Agropages released the rankings of the top 20 Indian agrochemical companies based on their FY 2023-24 performance. The revenue threshold for inclusion in the top 20 list increased to \u20b91,226 crore, up from \u20b91,151 crore in the previous year, reflecting robust growth among the Indian agrochemical companies. \n\nAmong the top 20 companies, 11 surpassed the \u20b92,000 crore sales mark, while nine companies reported revenues between \u20b91,000 crore and \u20b92,000 crore. \n\nNotably, 10 companies posted year-on-year growth, with PI Industries and Safex Chemicals achieving double-digit increases, nearing or exceeding 20 per cent. \n\nOn the other hand, 10 companies faced declines in sales, with Sharda Cropchem and Meghmani Group experiencing the steepest drops.\n\nFocus on R&D pays off\n\nOne of the standout performers in the Agropages rankings was Best Agrolife Ltd (BAL), which climbed from 16th place last year to 13th in FY 23-24. \n\nThe company reported a consolidated revenue of \u20b91,873.3 crores for the fiscal year, showcasing its growth and increasing market presence. Interestingly, the company\u2019s growth relied on building its brand business. Its branded business grew by 85 per cent in FY \u201824, while having shifted its focus from B2B to B2C. \n\nThe company\u2019s focus on R&D and patented products seems to have yielded a strong product presence in the expanding customer base. Considering the Indian brand business, the company has positioned itself among the top 5 Indian agrochemical brands.\n\nAlso read: DAP sales in September drops by 50% to less than 8 lakh tonnes \n\nDespite India being the world\u2019s second-largest agrochemical exporter with $5.5 Billion in exports, China leads with $12 Billion.\n\nAs the Indian agrochemical industry continues to evolve, companies focused on innovation are poised to play a vital role in shaping the sector\u2019s future. With the support of government initiatives and a focus on newer chemistries and the manufacturing of off-patent molecules, the Indian agrochemical sector is well-positioned to increase its global market share.\n\nThe author is Chief Financial Officer at The CFO Centre India",

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 20 (IANS) The outlook for the market for next week will be guided by the major domestic and global economic data such as India Nikkei S&P Global manufacturing and services PMI data, India RBI MPC meeting minutes, US initial jobless claims, FII activities and quarterly results, according to the experts.\n\nBetween October 21 and 25, the results for the September quarter of the financial year 2024-25 will be released by companies like Bajaj Housing Finance, UltraTech Cement, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Green Energy, Bajaj Finance, Godrej Property, TVS Motors and JSW Steel.\n\nThe Indian stock market extended its losing streak for the third consecutive week with nifty 50 toppling to its weakest level since August before settling the week at 24,854, down nearly 0.50 per cent or 110 points from the previous week, while Sensex declined around 0.20 per cent or 156 points to end the week at 81,224.\n\nThe weakness in Indian indices was triggered by disappointing quarterly earnings by major companies and underwhelming India\u2019s inflation figures which again fuelled the expectation of delay in early rate cut by RBI (Reserve Bank of India). The consumer price inflation in India rose to 5.49 per cent in September from 3.65 per cent in the previous month, well above market estimates of 5 per cent. It was the highest inflation rate since the start of the year, overshooting the RBI\u2019s target of 4 per cent after dropping below the threshold in the first two months of the September quarter.\n\nHowever, a significant fall in crude oil prices helped the market to recover from lower levels.\n\nOn the domestic front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to offload shares, selling Rs 21,823 crore in the cash segment, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) kept their buying momentum with purchases totalling Rs16,384 crore in the same segment.\n\nPalka Arora Chopra, Director of Master Capital Services said, \u201cNifty 50 ended its three-week losing streak by closing in the green. The key resistance now stands at 25,000, and a breakout above this could lead to a move toward 25,300. On the downside, support is at 24,500, and a breach below this may see the index drop to 24,200.\u201d\n\nPravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart said, \u201cBank Nifty, on the other hand, is showing relative strength, with resistance at 52,400 and 53,000. The immediate demand zone lies between 51,700 and 51,500. It needs to cross the 20-DMA Of 52,300 to confirm a bullish reversal. Above 20-DMA, the next target will be the 53,300 level.\u201d",

        "text": "The USD 200 billion Chinese food delivery industry, once a thriving sector that expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic, is now facing a downturn, according to a report by CNN.Having more than doubled in size over three years, this industry \u2013 the world\u2019s largest by revenue and volume of orders \u2013 had provided a steady income for casual workers. However, the workers are now struggling to make ends meet.China\u2019s economic slowdown, prompted by a property crisis and weak consumer spending, has hit delivery workers hard, decreasing their incomes and job stability.On Friday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed a moderation in third-quarter growth and said that weakened consumer spending and the ongoing property market crisis continue to weigh heavily on the economy.Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.6 per cent in the three-month period from July to September, compared with a year ago. That was just slightly higher than the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, who had predicted an expansion of 4.5 per cent, CNN reported.According to a professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, delivery workers will persistently face pressure as long as delivery platforms prioritise cost-cutting measures. \u201cThey are working long hours, really being squeezed,\u201d said Jenny Chan, associate sociology professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong. \u201c[And] they will continue to face pressure as [delivery platforms] have to keep the cost low,\u201d she said.Chan further noted that the economic downturn has led to a shift towards budget-friendly meals, resulting in decreased earnings for delivery workers, who must then work extended hours to maintain their earnings.Apart from the given problems, the workers are constantly under immense pressure to meet tight deadlines, even if it means cutting corners on the road \u2013 by speeding or running red lights \u2013 causing hazards that endanger both themselves and other road users, CNN reported.Delivery workers have been witnessing their paychecks shrink dramatically, increasing their financial struggles.Last year, they made 6,803 yuan (USD 956) a month, according to a report from the China New Employment Research Center. That\u2019s almost 1,000 yuan (USD 140) a month less than they were making five years ago, despite many reporting working longer hours, according to CNN.A 1,000 yuan difference may seem negligible in US dollars, but it\u2019s substantial in China, where the national average monthly wage stood at just 1,838 yuan (USD 258) last year, according to the NBS figures.",

        "title": "Shift from agriculture to manufacturing must for India\u2019s growth: Amitabh Kant",
        "text": "Kasauli, Oct 20 (IANS) India\u2019s G20 Sherpa and former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant contends that in order for India to grow at high rates of nine to ten per cent and become a developed economy by 2047, the country\u2019s GDP has to grow by nine times and per capita income by eight times, with manufacturing and urbanisation playing a key role in the process.\n\nHe also hailed India\u2019s chairmanship of the G20 and batted for lateral entry into the government service.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturing has to grow by 16 times. It has to fire on all cylinders. We have to become a manufacturing nation,\u201d Kant told IANS at the Kasauli Literary Festival.\n\nHe also stressed that the country must urbanise in a scientific, sustainable manner, enhance agriculture productivity, and remain a services nation.\n\n\u201cFor all this to happen, you have to provide well-paid jobs to the people and every transition that takes place to manufacturing means that people must move from agriculture to manufacturing and towards urbanisation. The dependence of population in India on agriculture is 46.5 per cent,\u201d Kant added.\n\nHe pointed out that agriculture gives us 16.5 per cent of the GDP, adding that nowhere in the world does this happen.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you need to take the population away from agriculture and put them into manufacturing on better-paid quality jobs. There also needs to be stress on disinvestment, cutting red tape, and ease of doing business which has been this government\u2019s agenda,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nAbout the time when India held the presidency of G20 from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, Kant recollects that the country was able to bring consensus on all key issues confronting the world.\n\nSome of the key issues were a specific action plan for sustainable development goals which had been impacted due to Covid, the issue of strong, sustainable, balanced growth in the global economy, the issue of Green Development Pact, technological transformation and the use of digital public infrastructure and more importantly, the issue of women-led development.\n\n\u201cThese were all critical issues. But to my mind, our biggest achievement during G20 was the fact that it spoke the voice of the Global South, and under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, was able to make the African Union an integral member of G20. So, in a way, we succeeded in making it from G20 to G21 which has made G20 a far more inclusive body in the world. Now, it covers almost 90 per cent of the global population and covers a very vast, almost 80 per cent of the global GDP. So, this has been India\u2019s biggest achievement,\u201d Kant said.\n\nStressing that it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wish to hold G20 meetings in most states and UTs, and not just at one or two places, the former bureaucrat said: \u201cWe took it to every nook and corner of the country. And every state was an active participant. This required clockwork precision. It was a very federal G20. Every state brought their one district and a product forward.\u201d\n\nAdding that the country has succeeded hugely when it comes to ease of doing business, Kant claims what India has achieved in last eight years what it could not achieve in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe have scrapped over 1,600 laws. And moved up 79 positions in the World Bank ease of doing business. India has now become an easy and simple nation,\u201d he said.\n\nKant feels that the next lot of reforms have to happen by the states which have to make procedures simple.\n\n\u201cThis is very critical. India has done a lot of work in terms of insolvency, bankruptcy code, real estate regulation act, and goods and services tax. We have opened up, reduced the corporate tax, and opened up the economy for the private sector in a much bigger way while the FDI has also grown,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked why small traders are not very happy with the introduction of GST, Kant said that there will be some unhappy people when you bring in major reforms of paperless digital tax, as you are cutting out human intervention completely.\n\n\u201cGST rates in some areas are high but that is an issue where states and Central government have to sit down and sort out,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout India\u2019s focus right now, the former NITI Aayog CEO said first and foremost, the country needs to drive manufacturing in a big way and increase exports in order to become an exporting nation.\n\n\u201cWe must urbanise and must improve learning and health outcomes and nutritional standards which is very important. The social indicators to improve are very critical. Health, education, nutrition, all these are very critical over a long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nConsidering that NITI Ayog during his reign had several lateral entries, India\u2019s G20 Sherpa said that he has always been in favour of lateral entrants considering they bring in a lot of fresh thinking.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to find ways of, introducing new talents into government to constantly push for innovation and transformation within government,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that there was no disconnect between major schemes and their implementation on the ground, Kant cited a few examples.\n\n\u201cWe have made 40 million houses and provided pipe water connection to 253 million Indians. Around 130 million toilets and 88,000 kilometres of road have been made. Now this is the kind of infrastructure which no other country has been able to make in seven years. What disconnection are you talking about?\u201d",

During the previous year, the soyameal shiipments stood at 18.36 lakh tonnes. \n\nThe increase in shipments is despite the fact that Indian soyameal had been expensive in the world market by around $100-150 per tonne.\n\nIran was the largest buyer with volumes of around 4.15 lakh tonnes followed by Bangladesh at 3.02 lakh tonnes. Nepal was the third largest buyer with volumes of 1.92 lakh tonnes and Germany at 1.06 lakh tonnes and Afghanistan at 85,181 tonnes. \n\nAlso read: Iran turns saviour for pricey Indian soyameal exports\n\n\u201cIn view of demand from Iran, Bangladesh and Nepal export of soybean meal during this oil year was higher than last year by 15.90 per cent, resulting in better crushing and production of soybean meal\u201d said D N Pathak, Executive Director, The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA).\n\nSoyabean meal production increased during the year to 94.69 lakh tonnes, up from previous year\u2019s 91.79 lakh tonnes as per the latest estimates revealed by SOPA. Soyameal imports reduced during the year marginally to 0.25 lakh tonnes, down from same period last year\u2019s 0.27 lakh tonnes. \n\nDomestic consumption by the feed sector was a tad lower at 66 lakh tonnes during oil year 2023-24, down from previous year\u2019s 67 lakh tonnes, while the off-take from food sector was flat at 8 lakh tonnes. \n\nAlso read: India\u2019s oilmeal exports down by 8.5% in H1 of current fiscal \n\nFor the current oil year 2024-25, SOPA expects the production of soyabean to increase by around 6 per cent to over 125.8 lakh tonnes on higher yields, over previous year\u2019s 118.74 lakh tonnes. This is mainly on account of higher yields on account of favourable weather conditions. The yields are estimated to be higher this year at 1063 kg per hectare as against 1002 kg per ha in the previous year, as per the survey carried out by SOPA recently in the key producing states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 21 (KNN) India's automobile exports have shown significant growth in the first half of the current fiscal year, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).\n\nThe overall exports increased by 14 percent year-on-year, reaching 25,28,248 units compared to 22,11,457 units in the same period last year.\n\nSIAM President Shailesh Chandra attributed this growth to the recovery of key markets in Latin America and Africa, which had previously experienced slowdowns due to various economic factors.\n\nThese regions, which had faced challenges stemming from currency devaluations, have now rebounded, contributing to the resurgence in vehicle exports.\n\nThe passenger vehicle segment demonstrated strong performance, with exports rising by 12 percent to 3,76,679 units. Maruti Suzuki, India's largest carmaker, led this category with shipments of 1,47,063 units, marking a 12 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nHyundai Motor India, however, experienced a slight decline of 1 percent in its exports, shipping 84,900 units.\n\nTwo-wheeler exports showed impressive growth, increasing by 16 percent to reach 19,59,145 units. Within this category, scooter shipments rose by 19 percent to 3,14,533 units, while motorcycle exports grew by 16 percent to 16,41,804 units.\n\nThe commercial vehicle sector also posted positive results, with exports rising by 12 percent to 35,731 units. However, three-wheeler shipments saw a marginal decline of 1 percent, totalling 1,53,199 units.\n\nThis growth in exports marks a turnaround from the previous fiscal year, which saw a 5.5 percent decline due to monetary crises in various overseas markets.\n\nThe current upward trend suggests a recovering global market for Indian automobiles, with key segments showing resilience and growth despite ongoing economic challenges in some regions.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",
