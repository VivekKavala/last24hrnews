                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>What is Chronic Cough?

In cases of coughing that occurs for several days or less than a week, it is usually caused by the flu.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, if the cough does not improve, there is a possibility that it is caused by something serious.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

A cough that persists for eight weeks or more for adults, or four weeks for children, is defined as a chronic cough.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Coughing itself is a positive reflex of the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> When coughing, the body expels mucus and foreign material from the airways that can irritate the lungs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, this condition makes the sufferer feel very uncomfortable.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Generally, chronic cough causes sleep disturbances and interferes with work performance, and also social life.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chronic Cough Symptoms

Symptoms and signs that indicate chronic cough are as follows:

A runny nose and a stuffy feeling;
Sore throat that causes coughing to clear the throat;
There is an indication of liquid water running down the back of the throat, or postnasal drip;
A hoarse voice;
Shortness of breath;
An upset stomach or sour taste in the mouth;
Weight loss;
Fever and may cause chills;
Sweating at night;
Difficulty swallowing or coughing when swallowing;
Easily tired; and
In severe cases, sufferers may experience coughing up blood.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Causes of Chronic Cough

A variety of medical conditions can cause a chronic cough that lasts for weeks.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Indications of a chronic cough are also usually caused by more than one cause.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The following are causes of chronic cough which usually occur due to one or a combination of various causes:

1.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Postnasal Drip

It occurs when someone has sinus or nasal inflammation which produces extra mucus, which can drip down the back of the throat and cause a cough reflex or is known as chronic respiratory syndrome.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Asthma occurs due to the narrowing and swelling of the airways.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This triggers excessive mucus production.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chronic cough caused by asthma usually occurs in certain seasons when infections attack the respiratory tract.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In addition, exposure to cold air, chemicals, or certain fragrances can also trigger asthma.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

3.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) / Gastric Acid Disease

This condition commonly occurs when stomach acid flows up into the tube connecting the stomach and throat.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This condition causes irritation with symptoms of pain in the pit of the stomach or a burning sensation in the chest.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This ongoing irritation can lead to chronic cough.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

4.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Chronic Bronchitis

If inflammation of the pulmonary tract (Bronchi) occurs over a long period of time, a chronic cough can occur accompanied by phlegm.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Generally, people who suffer from bronchitis are passive smokers, active smokers, or people who have quit smoking.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, there are several other factors that rarely cause chronic cough, such as:

Bronchiectasis (damage to the bronchi and airways).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Cystic fibrosis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Lung cancer.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Sarcoidosis (a collection of inflammatory cells in various parts of the body, most commonly the lungs).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chronic Cough Risk Factors

This condition can be triggered by several things, including:

The toxins contained in cigarettes are the main risk factor for causing chronic cough.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This is because the toxins contained in cigarette smoke can damage the hairs that filter dirt along the respiratory tract, making it easy to cause irritation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

2.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Allergies

Allergens or factors that cause someone’s allergies to recur can be a risk factor for the emergence of chronic cough symptoms in allergy sufferers.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Allergies that appear can be caused by cat fur, dust and air pollution, cold air, certain foods or drinks, or by smelling certain fragrances.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If the cough gets worse, it could be caused by an allergy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

3.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Environment

Environments that create high-risk factors are such as workplaces that contain irritants so that sufferers inhale the air which causes coughing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In addition, the risk can also increase in areas with high air pollution, such as cooking using coal.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

4.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Lung Disease

People who suffer from asthma, bronchiectasis (enlarged airways), and lung infections are at higher risk of developing a chronic cough.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

5.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Female Gender

The risk of this condition is higher for women because women have a more sensitive cough reflex.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chronic Cough Diagnosis

To establish a diagnosis, the doctor will ask about your medical history and perform a physical exam.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Usually, doctors will provide therapy according to clinical symptoms first.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If the response to therapy is not good, several tests will be carried out, such as:

X-ray Imaging Examination

A routine chest X-ray may not be able to diagnose common causes of cough such as postnasal drip, acid reflux or asthma.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

With X-rays, the picture of lung cancer, pneumonia, and other lung diseases that can cause chronic cough can be clearer.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

A sinus x-ray may be performed if there is suspicion of a sinus infection.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan

Through a CT scan, the image provided will be clearer and more detailed when compared to using X-rays.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Lung Function Test

Lung function testing is relatively simple to use to diagnose asthma.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This test is used to measure how much air the lungs can hold and how fast the patient can exhale.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chronic Cough Complications

Chronic cough can not only disrupt daily routines but can also affect the sufferer’s quality of life.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The most significant impact is difficulty sleeping or insomnia because coughing will prevent sufferers from sleeping soundly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Then, the sufferer will feel very tired because they can’t sleep.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Coughing continuously can also cause muscle pain and broken ribs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Some other complications that can also occur due to chronic coughing include:

 Acid Reflux

The use of this drug is to reduce the production of acid in the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Types of acid reflux drugs are as follows:

H2 receptor blockers;
Proton pump inhibitors; and

The types of drugs that can be used to treat asthma are inhaled steroids and bronchodilators which are obtained from a doctor’s prescription.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chronic Bronchitis

Medications for this disease are usually bronchodilators and inhaled steroids which are used as a treatment for chronic bronchitis and others.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Antibiotics

The doctor will prescribe antibiotics if the cause of chronic cough is a bacterial infection.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Allergic reactions can occur as a side effect of antibiotics.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This treatment process can be done at home by warming drinkable fluids, inhaling warm water, and maintaining air humidity.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
