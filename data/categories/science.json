        "title": "Newly Discovered Amphipod Species in Japan Features Panda-Like Colouring",
        "text": "Researchers in Japan have officially recognised a new amphipod species, Melita panda, which features black-and-white coloring resembling a panda. Discovered in Japan's coastal waters, the species has now been classified through detailed morphological and genetic research by Hiroshima University's team, as published in ZooKeys. The identification of Melita panda underlines the need for continued taxonomic studies to support biodiversity conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nNew Discovery in Coastal Biodiversity\r\n\r\nOriginally found in Wakayama Prefecture during the 1990s, Melita panda was re-evaluated as part of a broader study on amphipods, a group of small, shrimp-like crustaceans found worldwide. Professor Ko Tomikawa and colleagues from Hiroshima University note that many marine species in Japan remain unclassified, hindering conservation efforts. Their study highlighted that species diversity in Japan's coastal areas requires continued investigation to understand the full spectrum of local biodiversity.\r\n\r\nIdentifying Melita panda: Genetic and Morphological Analysis\r\n\r\nUsing DNA sequencing and morphological analysis, researchers identified Melita panda's distinct black-and-white pattern along with unique physical traits. These include forward-positioned gnathopods (claws) and distinct bristle-like setae, which distinguish it from its closest relatives, Melita nagatai and Melita koreana. These amphipods together form a monophyletic group, meaning they share a common evolutionary ancestor, Melita hoshinoi.Spacex Launches 23 More Starlink Satellites to Boost Broadband Network\r\n\r\nImplications for Conservation and Future Study\r\n\r\nThe recognition of Melita panda emphasises the importance of taxonomy in conservation. Professor Tomikawa noted that the discovery could increase interest in studying coastal species and contribute to more informed conservation planning. He suggests that further taxonomic studies in uncharted marine regions may yield additional species, potentially enhancing our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and supporting conservation initiatives across Japan's coastlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "Mysuru: With a week left for this year\u2019s Dasara, the festive fever has already gripped the youth of Mysuru who gathered in large numbers for the inauguration of \u2018Yuva Sambhrama \u2013 2024\u2019 at the Open Air Theatre in Manasagangothri here last evening. The event, which provides students from across the State to showcase their talent, is held every year prior to the commencement of the Dasara festival. The presence of Kannada actors Srimurali and Rukmini Vasanth added more glitter to the inaugural event. While Srimurali was addressing the gathering, youth demanded him to sing for which the actor obliged with the song \u2018Hudugir Kannu Loaded Gannu\u2026\u2019 from his movie \u2018Rathavara\u2019 which set the tone for the celebrations. Srimurali, who said that \u2018Our Nada Habba is Our Pride,\u2019 added that it was only in Mysuru that a grandeur Dasara could be witnessed and no other place in the country. Later, the actor, promoting his upcoming movie \u2018Bhageera,\u2019 urged the youth to watch the film in theatres. Earlier, inaugurating the event, District Minister Dr. H.C. Mahadevappa said that among the 470 colleges which had applied to take part in the Yuva Sambhrama, 150 colleges were selected and another 120 colleges out of those not selected would be given an opportunity to showcase their talent by extending the event by a day. Tribute to \u2018Appu\u2019 Yesterday\u2019s inaugural event also witnessed the organisers paying tributes to late actor Puneeth Rajkumar, fondly called \u2018Appu.\u2019 Dr. Madhusudan and troupe rendered the song \u2018Bombe Heluthaithe\u2026\u2019 from the Kannada movie \u2018Rajakumara\u2019 joined the audience who also sang along by waving their mobile phones turning on the torch. A delayed inauguration The students and audience present at the Open Air Theatre, who had arrived much earlier to scheduled time of inauguration (5 pm as per the banners at the venue; 6 pm as per the invitation) waited for more than two hours for the guests to arrive. Finally, the event was inaugurated at 8.20 pm which caused a great inconvenience to the students who had to wait for long wearing their costumes. On day-1, Holenarasipur Govt. FGC for Women, Hassan presented a dance programme portraying the folk and desi culture; Hunsur\u2019s Sri Mahaveer College of Education showcased Dasara heritage through dance. It was followed by performances of 18 other colleges. MLC C.N. Manjegowda, Karnataka Exhibition Authority Chairman Ayub Khan, Karnataka State Guarantee Schemes Implementation Authority Vice-Chairperson Dr. Pushpa Amarnath, DC G. Lakshmikanth Reddy, ZP CEO K.M. Gayathri, SP N. Vishnuvardhana & DCP M. Muthuraj were present. \u2018Yuva Sambhrama\u2019 programmes will be held from 6 pm onwards till Sept. 30.",

        "title": "Scientists Reveal It Wasn't Just One Asteroid That Wiped Out Dinosaurs",
        "text": "The massive asteroid that ended the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was not an isolated event, new research has revealed. The study, published in Nature, detailed scans of an underwater crater off the coast of Guinea. It revealed that another large asteroid struck Earth around the same time, potentially contributing to the cataclysmic conditions that led to the dinosaurs' extinction. Scientists recently mapped the Nadir crater, spanning over 8 km in diameter, and revealed that it was created by an asteroid measuring 400 metres wide. This asteroid struck the planet at nearly 72,000 kmph between 65 million and 67 million years ago. While it was smaller than the asteroid linked to the mass extinction, it was still powerful enough to leave a significant mark on Earth. \u201cThe new images paint a picture of the catastrophic event,\u201d said Dr Uisdean Nicholson, a marine geologist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He discovered the Nadir crater in 2022, but the impact details were unclear until now. Using advanced 3D seismic imaging, researchers managed to explore the crater's rim and the geological features lying 300 metres beneath the ocean floor. Dr Nicholson called it \u201cexquisite,\u201d saying, \u201cThere are around 20 confirmed marine craters worldwide, and none of them has been captured in anything close to this level of detail.\u201d The findings suggest the impact triggered intense tremors that liquefied sediments beneath the sea bed, resulting in faults and landslides that left traces of damage visible for thousands of square miles beyond the crater's edge. Furthermore, the collision unleashed a massive tsunami, estimated to have exceeded 800 metres in height, which would have surged across the Atlantic Ocean. Although the exact timing of this asteroid's impact remains uncertain, its discovery raises intriguing possibilities about a cluster of impacts occurring at the end of the Cretaceous period \u2013 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs created a much larger crater \u2013 160 km wide \u2013 at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Dr Nicholson said the \u201cclosest humans have come to seeing something like this is the 1908 Tunguska event\u201d, when a 50-metre asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded in the skies above Siberia. He pointed out that the new 3D seismic data across the Nadir crater provides an unrivalled opportunity to test impact crater hypotheses and develop new models of crater formation in marine environments.",

A variety of colourful and attractive rangolis were drawn, enlivening the festive mood as women, not just from Mysuru, but also from other districts as well, thronged the venue to showcase their talent and creativity. Many attractive designs of rangolis were drawn on the forecourt of the palace. People also visited the palace to watch the colourful rangolis. The event was inaugurated by MLA T.S. Srivatsa. Speaking on the occasion, the MLA said rangoli symbolised our culture and tradition. More than 100 women participated in the competition to showcase their talents oblivious about the prizes. Their participation is appreciating, he added. The MLA recalled how women in villages draw rangolis, and the preparations they make before the rangolis are drawn in front of their houses. Rangoli is an art and a tradition that has continued since ages, with women in the cities also practicing the tradition, drawing attractive rangolis daily in front of their house. Rangolis in the design of elephant carrying Ambari, Mahisha rangoli, and many other impressive rangolis had been drawn in the competition. Women whose rangoli designs were judged the best will get prizes which will be presented on October 8. Three prizes and three consolation prizes will be presented.",
