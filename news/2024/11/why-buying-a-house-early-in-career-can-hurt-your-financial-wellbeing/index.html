                                </h1>

                                
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Perhaps, the single-largest outlay for most of us is directed towards buying a house – mostly an apartment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

And post-Covid, there has been a propensity among many of the young in the workforce towards buying their own ‘spacious’ houses early on in their careers.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Recent studies by real estate research firms and home loan providers indicate that the average age of home loan customers has fallen from 40-45 years a decade ago to the early 30s and often to the mid- or late-20s.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

From a traditional societal viewpoint, we are often asked to ‘settle down’ quickly and one of the gauges for doing so is owning a house.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

But from a financial wellness viewpoint, is it a good idea to buy a house with a loan within a few years of starting your working life? 

From a financial and even practical standpoints, buying a house in the early years of your career may not be a sound decision.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

EMIs create cash crunch

With back-to-office becoming the norm, typically, most of us would like to buy a house as close to our office as possible, so that the commute time is reduced.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

But the catch here is that the apartments that are, say, 30 minutes or less away from your workplace are likely to cost more.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Even modest-sized apartments that are relatively nearer to office spaces and IT parks in the top 10 cities in India are likely to cost a lot – usually north of ₹1 crore.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Let’s assume that you somehow zero in on a property – new or second-hand – that costs ₹1 crore (including all taxes and registration charges) and is ready for occupation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Delay in handover from builders is another problem, which we ignore for our discussion.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Now, banks offer 80-90 per cent of the property’s price as loan, which translates to ₹80-90 lakh in this case.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

To be eligible for the loan amount in the range mentioned above, your net monthly salary must at least be ₹1.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>2-1.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>25 lakh.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Let’s further assume that you have done well in your career thus far and earn that kind of money.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If you avail a loan of ₹85 lakh (85 per cent of the property cost) at 9 per cent for 20 years, the EMI will work out to ₹76477.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Further, you would need to have ₹15 lakh for down-payment and other registration charges.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

You would you have to save up by being extremely prudent in the early years of your career.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

The EMI in the above case works out to more than 60 per cent of your monthly salary, whereas financial planners recommend 30-40 per cent as the ideal allocation for all loan commitments put together.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

If you service any other personal or education loan, your surplus further diminishes significantly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Thus, you will have to run a tight ship with respect to your finances in the initial stages of your career, with very little leeway for indulgences.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Renting and investing

Instead of loading yourself with EMIs, you could consider living on rent.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Consider our case mentioned earlier.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

You could get a house on rent for ₹25,000.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Or, if the area near your office is expensive on the rent front, you could opt for a property available for a rent of ₹50,000 by sharing it with another person – paying ₹25,000 each.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Compared to an EMI in excess of ₹76,000, your outgo would only be ₹25000.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Now, if ₹50,000 is deployed in even conservative avenues such as balanced advantage funds over a period of 10 years, and the returns are 10 per cent a year, you would have ₹1 crore at the end of 10 years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Besides, over the 10-year period, your salary would have grown substantially, thus increasing your loan eligibility amount.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Sure, there is chance that property prices would have risen, too, over the period.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

But then, you would be in a position to buy a house worth even ₹3 crore at that time!

Non-financial factors

Apart from money and investing angles that we discussed earlier, there are other non-financial factors that would necessitate delaying your house purchase decision to your mid-30s – about 10-12 years into your career.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

First, in the initial stages of your working life, you may move jobs periodically or even frequently.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> You could be experimenting with your career to decide what suits you best.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In such a situation, you could be moving across cities or even go abroad for employment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> So, locking yourself with a property investment and EMI commitments drag you back from moving around freely.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Besides, maintaining the property from another city or ensuring that the tenant takes good care of your house is a challenge.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Second, when you marry and have kids or if you plan to have your parents with you, the space requirements of an apartment would rise substantially.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> You would end up looking for a larger apartment, while probably having to sell your old property to afford the new one.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Third, you cannot take sabbaticals or higher education breaks easily, as paying the EMI without a salary would be challenging.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

When should you buy?

From a financial standpoint, you must have at least 40-50 per cent of the property price as financial investments with you, so that your outgo in loan servicing is kept low.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

This would happen only in the middle stages of your career – at 35-40 years of age.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If you have a working spouse, your joint income would be large and EMIs would not be more than 25 per cent of the household income.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

By 35-40, you would have figured out your career path and settled in your workplace.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Also, there is good chance that you would have decided the best city to settle down for the rest of your life.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>.</p>
