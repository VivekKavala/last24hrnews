                                </h1>

                                
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>What is Hives or Urticaria?

Hives or urticaria is a skin reaction that causes red or white welts to appear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These welts are also accompanied by itching.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Initially, these welts appear on only one part of the body, but over time they eventually spread.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> One common cause is an allergy, but the size and shape of the welts can vary.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

When someone has hives, it is possible that they will also have angioedema.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Angioedema is a swelling of the deeper layers of the skin.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This swelling usually occurs in the eyes, lips, and genitals.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In some cases, these skin problems can also occur or be part of the symptoms of anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that occurs suddenly and can cause death.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This condition is considered an emergency because some of the symptoms are extreme.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Here are some other symptoms of anaphylaxis:

Swelling of the eyelids, lips, hands and feet.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Shortness of breath caused by narrowing of the airways.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Stomach ache and vomiting.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Symptoms of Hives or Urticaria

When someone is attacked by urticaria, the rash that appears on the skin will feel itchy, even sore, or stinging.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The rash can appear anywhere on the body’s skin, such as on the stomach, back, buttocks, chest, arms, and legs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

These symptoms can last from hours to days.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Urticaria that occurs for less than six weeks is called acute or short-term hives.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, there are also cases of urticaria that last more than six weeks or recur over several months or even years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This condition, called long-term (chronic) hives, is a rare condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Chronic hives can be interpreted as a sign of another disease that is being suffered.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For example, due to thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes or lupus.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In most cases, this disease often occurs in children and women aged 30 to 60 years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In addition, people who have allergies are also at higher risk of experiencing it.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Causes of Hives or Urticaria

The appearance of welts on the skin is triggered by high levels of histamine released into the skin.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The body stores histamine in cells.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> When the immune system recognizes a threat, it releases histamine and other chemicals.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This chemical complex can protect you from serious illnesses caused by infections or insect bites.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But sometimes, your immune system releases histamine when there is no real threat.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This happens when people have an allergic reaction.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Well, histamine is what can cause blood vessels to widen so that blood flow increases.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The large amount of blood flowing beneath the surface of the skin makes the skin look red.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This excess fluid also causes swelling of the skin and itching.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Here are some things that can cause hives:

There is contact with triggers or causes of allergies, for example, latex and animal fur.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The most common foods that cause urticaria are nuts, chocolate, seafood, eggs, wheat, and milk.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Almost all drugs can cause urticaria.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Addictive substances or additives in food such as sweeteners, preservatives, flavor enhancers, colorings, thickeners, etc.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Infections, such as hepatitis and glandular fever.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Insect bites.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Environmental factors, such as exposure to hot or cold weather conditions, exposure to certain waters, or even sunlight.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Risk Factors for Hives or Urticaria

Hives are divided into two, namely acute and chronic.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, for chronic hives, the exact cause is unknown.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, there are several risk factors that can trigger urticaria or worsen existing symptoms.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

For example, consuming alcoholic or caffeinated drinks, high-stress levels, and hot air temperatures.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Well, here are various triggering factors that you may need to be aware of:

 Food allergies

Food allergies are one of the common causes of hives.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Certain foods such as nuts, eggs, milk, seafood, and legumes can trigger allergic reactions that cause urticaria to appear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Drug allergies

The use of certain medications, such as antibiotics (eg penicillin), aspirin, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and other medications, can cause allergic reactions and urticaria in some people.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Extreme temperatures

Exposure to extreme temperatures, such as high heat or extreme cold, can cause this condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Pollen allergies and environmental allergens

Exposure to pollen, dust, animal dander, insects, and certain chemicals can also cause urticaria in people who are allergic to these allergens.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Insect bites

Some insect bites such as mosquitoes, bees, or ants can cause allergic reactions and the appearance of urticaria in the area affected by the bite.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Stress and anxiety

Emotional stress or anxiety can affect the immune system and trigger the appearance of this skin problem.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Contact with certain materials

Direct contact with chemicals, such as latex, detergents, or other substances, can also cause this condition in some people.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Previous history of urticaria and allergies

People who have had this condition before have a higher risk of having it again.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Those with a history of allergies or a family history of allergies are also more susceptible.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Diagnosis of Hives or Urticaria

The way to diagnose urticaria, in the initial stage the doctor conducts a medical interview regarding complaints and medical history experienced, including recent foods or activities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

After that, the doctor will perform a physical examination on those who have hives.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In some cases, doctors also perform supporting examinations such as:

Allergy tests, either skin or blood tests.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Blood tests, to rule out other diseases or infections.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Skin biopsy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In this examination, the dermatologist will remove a small amount of affected skin so that it can be examined under a microscope.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, this examination is generally carried out in cases that occur repeatedly, not for the first time.</p>

Hives Complications

Untreated urticaria can cause complications and disrupt the sufferer’s daily activities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Complications can include angioedema and anaphylaxis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Angioedema is a swelling of the skin on the eyelids, lips, hands, feet, and around the genital area.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Angioedema itself is caused by a buildup of body fluids.</p>

Hives Treatment

In fact, most cases of urticaria do not require special treatment, because the symptoms that appear usually disappear within a matter of days or hours.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, if it feels very disturbing, the doctor will provide treatment according to needs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Here are the treatments for hives that doctors can provide:

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For milder cases, your dermatologist may prescribe corticosteroids to apply to your skin to relieve itching.</p>

Prevention of Hives or Urticaria

Hives generally occur due to allergic reactions, therefore, for those of you who suffer from certain allergies, try to avoid things that can trigger them so they don’t appear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Here are some ways to prevent it:

Food.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Avoid foods that you know can trigger urticaria symptoms, such as eggs, nuts, and seafood.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Temperature.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If you experience itching when exposed to cold, do not swim in cold water and avoid exposure to cold air by wearing warm clothing and a scarf around your nose and mouth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Sun exposure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wear protective clothing and apply sunscreen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Medications.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you suspect a particular medication is causing your itching.</p>

A stye or hordeolum is a pimple-like bump or boil that grows on the edge of the eyelid.</p>
                                
                                <p class="m-b-5 small-txt">

The cause of a sty is generally a bacterial infection and usually only appears on one eyelid.</p>
