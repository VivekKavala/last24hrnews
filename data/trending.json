        "title": "\u201cRestoring trust with China will take time\u201d: Army Chief on India-China border patrolling agreement",
        "text": "Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday emphasised the need to rebuild trust between India and China following the recent border patrolling agreement.Speaking at an event titled \u201cDecade of Transformation: Indian Army in Stride with the Future\u201d at the United Service Institution, Gen. Dwivedi made his first statement after the announcement of the India-China border patrolling agreement.Gen Dwivedi stressed that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo. \u201cWe are working to rebuild trust, and restoring that trust will take time,\u201d he added, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations.He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions. \u201cThis normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that as well,\u201d he added.Referring to the buffer zones created along the LAC, Gen Dwivedi underscored that trust between the two countries will be rebuilt through mutual understanding. \u201cWe are trying to restore the trust. How will the trust be restored? It will get restored once we can see each other and convince each other. And we need to reassure each other that we are not creeping into buffer zones that are created,\u201d he said.He also mentioned that ongoing patrolling activities provide a chance for both sides to reassure one another. \u201cPatrolling gives you that kind of advantage, and as trust is rebuilt, other stages will also follow through,\u201d he noted.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced on Monday that an agreement has been reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border area.The announcement came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Kazan, Russia, for the 16th BRICS summit scheduled from October 22 to October 24. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media, stating, \u201cThis agreement is the outcome of extensive discussions over the past several weeks with Chinese interlocutors at both diplomatic and military levels.\u201d He noted that military commanders have been involved in negotiations aimed at addressing the tensions that have persisted since 2020. Misri explained that the agreement signifies a path toward disengagement and a potential resolution of the issues that arose during the significant confrontations in 2020.Misri recalled the clashes between the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China and the Indian Army, particularly highlighting the violent encounters in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. He added that this agreement marks a critical step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations seek to manage their border disputes and prevent further military confrontations.Misri said,\u201d On several areas along the Line of Actual Control, we held discussions with Chinese interlocutors both at the diplomatic as well as military levels through meetings with military commanders at various levels. These discussions had in the past resulted in the resolution of standoffs at various locations. There are some locations and areas where stand-offs had not been resolved.\u201d\u201cNow, as a result of the discussions over the last several weeks, an agreement has been reached on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas. This is leading to disengagement and eventually a resolution of the issues that arose in these areas in 2020,\u201d he added.This agreement marks a crucial step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations work to manage their border disputes and avoid further military confrontations.In early May 2020, troops from China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and the Indian Army clashed at locations along the LAC, the disputed boundary between China and India. The situation escalated on June 15-16, 2020, resulting in casualties on both sides",

According to the sources, Kalyan Banerjee wanted to speak out of turn. He had already spoken thrice and wanted to get a chance again during the presentation. But BJP MP Abhijit Gangopadhyay objected. This ensued a heated exchange between them, where sources said both used abusive language.Meanwhile, Kalyan Banerjee picked up a glass water bottle, hit it on the table and hurt himself. After this, he threw the broken bottle towards the chairman. Due to the incident, the meeting adjourned for some time. Soon after, Banerjee was taken for medical aid, wherein he received four stitches in his hand.In today\u2019s meeting, the committee is hearing views and suggestions from representatives of Justice in Reality and Panchasakha Prachar, both based in Cuttack, Odisha.A delegation of five MPs from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is also presenting their perspectives on the bill.The committee met on Monday, inviting officials from the Ministry of Minority Affairs to provide oral evidence regarding the bill. This meeting is part of a larger national initiative to address long-standing issues related to the management of waqf properties.On Monday, discussions during the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) meeting became heated as opposition members questioned the consultative process behind the legislation.They accused the government of introducing the bill for political reasons, alleging it targeted the Muslim community. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi presented a nearly one-hour critique of the bill, raising concerns about its implications. Trinamool Congress leader Kalyan Banerjee even asked whether Waqf, which exists in the name of Allah, is legally recognized by the state. Despite the tensions, BJP members defended the bill, arguing that it is necessary for reforming Waqf property management and ensuring transparency. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to bring significant reforms, including digitization of records, stricter audits, increased transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied waqf properties",

        "text": "New Delhi: Multiple Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) schools nationwide received hoax bomb threats late on Monday night, sources said. The schools affected by the hoax threats include two in Delhi--one in Rohini and another in Dwarka--as well as one in Hyderabad. Sources indicate that the threats were communicated through email to the management of these institutions. Authorities are investigating the incident, with the matter being reviewed by higher officials from various organizations, including the CRPF, Intelligence Bureau, and Delhi Police. The threat email specified a potential bomb blast in the classrooms of these schools at 11 am on Tuesday. However, the threat has since been determined to be a hoax. The hoax threat was received a day after the blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi's Rohini on Sunday for which a pro-Khalistani group claimed responsibility that sent shockwaves through the national capital. Delhi Police reached out to social media platforms and the messaging app Telegram, requesting details about the channel where the post was made, and the matter is being investigated. The Sunday blast in the Prashant Vihar school was so powerful that it tore through the wall of the school. No injuries were reported in the incident however some of the nearby buildings and vehicles were damaged. Such hoax bomb threats on domestic and international flights have been received for several days. So far this week, more than 90 flights have received bomb threats and most of them have turned out to be hoaxes. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) Director General Zulfiqar Hasan on Monday met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan and apprised him about the recent hoax bomb threats in domestic and international flights. In the nearly half-an-hour meeting with the Home Ministry, both the DGs informed the Home Secretary about a series of recent hoax calls threatening domestic and international flights that has created panic situations on many occasions forcing the officials in the Indian aviation sector, intelligence wing, and other departments to go through rigorous security check process. Sources said that the officials discussed the potential implications for aviation security and measures being taken to address the situation, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and coordination among security agencies.",
