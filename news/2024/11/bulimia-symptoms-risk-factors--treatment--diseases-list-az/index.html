                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>What is Bulimia?

Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder in which the sufferer has the urge to consume large amounts of food at one time.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> During these eating episodes, the sufferer has no control over stopping it.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

After consuming the food, the sufferer will feel ashamed and will want to do anything to expel the food they have consumed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Sufferers can force themselves to vomit, consume laxatives, and go on extreme diets.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This eating disorder is actually categorized as a mental disorder.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The triggers can vary, from body image issues to depression.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition is more likely to be experienced by women than men.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Research estimates that around 8 out of 100 women suffer from this disorder.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Most women are between the ages of 16 and 40.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Symptoms of Bulimia

Bulimia symptoms can vary from person to person.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, the main indication is excessive eating, even though the sufferer does not feel hungry.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This can be triggered by emotional issues, such as experiencing stress or depression.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> After overeating, sufferers then feel guilty, regretful, and self-loathing so they do everything they can to get rid of their food.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

They may force themselves to vomit or use laxatives to induce a bowel movement.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

People with bulimia will usually experience this cycle more than twice a week for at least three months.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Causes of Bulimia

It is not known for certain why someone might experience this eating disorder.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, several things are thought to play a role in the development of this condition, namely:

 Psychological factors

The majority of sufferers have low self-esteem, feelings of helplessness, excessive perfectionism, and social anxiety.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Mood disorders such as depression are also contributing factors.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Social and cultural pressures

Social and cultural pressures that promote a perfect, thin body image may influence the development of bulimia nervosa.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Mass media, advertising, and unrealistic social norms about physical appearance can contribute to the development of these eating disorders.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Genetic factors

Several studies have shown a genetic factor in the development of this condition.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Individuals who have family members with a history of eating disorders or other mental disorders may be at higher risk for developing bulimia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Environment

Traumatic experiences or severe stress in an individual’s life, such as sexual or physical abuse, may contribute to the development of this eating disorder.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Environmental factors such as strict dieting or pressure to lose weight also play a role in its development.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

 Extreme diet habits

Some individuals may begin with a restrictive or extreme diet in an attempt to lose weight, but then end up with binge eating and purging behavior.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Bulimia Risk Factors

There are several factors that trigger bulimia nervosa.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These factors include:

Psychological problems, such as low self-esteem, depression, stress, anorexia nervosa, wanting to always appear perfect (perfectionism), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Age, these symptoms more often affect adolescents to adults.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Hereditary factors, if one of the immediate family members suffers from bulimia, then the person is at higher risk of experiencing the same disorder.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Female.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> According to research, this symptom condition is more often experienced by women than men.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Social demands, for example teenagers who feel they have to lose weight because they are influenced by their friends.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Professional demands, for example models who must be slim or athletes who must strictly maintain their weight.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Diagnosis of Bulimia

Most bulimia sufferers are reluctant to talk about their condition because they are ashamed and hate themselves for their behavior.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, this disorder needs to be treated immediately because it can be life-threatening.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Before diagnosing bulimia, the doctor will ask the sufferer and their family about any symptoms that appear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

After that, the doctor continues with a physical examination by checking the condition of teeth that are damaged or eroded due to exposure to acid in vomit.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The doctor will also check your eyes to see if there are any broken blood vessels in the eye.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The reason is, that vomiting too often can cause the blood vessels in the eyes to tense up and be at risk of rupturing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

People with bulimia also often have small sores and calluses on the tops of their finger joints.</p>

Complications of Bulimia

If left untreated, bulimia can trigger serious complications and even be fatal.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Frequent vomiting can damage teeth (due to stomach acid) and trigger swelling of the salivary glands.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

These complications can trigger dehydration, difficulty getting pregnant due to irregular menstrual cycles, dry skin and hair, brittle nails, kidney failure, and heart failure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, uncontrolled use of laxatives can cause damage to the digestive organs and disrupt the balance of the body’s natural compound levels.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This imbalance has the potential to trigger fatigue, weakness, irregular heartbeat, and seizures.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Bulimia Treatment

The goal of bulimia treatment is to eliminate deviant behaviors, such as excessive food consumption and vomiting.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, there is a suspicion that Bulimia Eating Disorder Cannot Be Cured, Is That True?

In fact, this condition is very treatable.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Doctors will usually work with psychiatrists and nutritionists to help people with bulimia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Treatment involves medication combined with therapy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There are two types of therapy that doctors may recommend: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Through CBT, people with bulimia learn to recognize bulimia triggers, such as negative thoughts and behaviors, and then learn to replace them with positive, healthy thoughts.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Meanwhile, interpersonal therapy will help to detect problems in relating to other people, as well as improving the ability to communicate and solve problems.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

To reduce symptoms, doctors sometimes combine the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs with therapy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Bulimia Prevention

There is no surefire way to prevent bulimia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, making healthy lifestyle changes and seeking treatment as soon as possible can prevent bulimia from getting worse.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
