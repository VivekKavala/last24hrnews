They told Emirates Al-Youm that the team’s failure to benefit greatly from the clubs’ participation in Asian championships is due to several reasons, the most prominent of which is that the way the player performs with his club differs from the method followed by the coach of the Portuguese national team, Paulo Bento, and that there are clubs that rely on… Its participation in the Asian Championships includes a large number of foreign players at the expense of local players who sit on the bench, which leads to the team not benefiting from this continental participation in the desired manner, in addition to the fact that most of the players who participate with their teams in the Asian Championships did not make a difference with the team.</p>

Last Friday, the team launched an internal preparation camp on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi in preparation for the match between the Kyrgyzstan and Qatar teams on the 14th and 19th of this month, respectively, in the fifth and sixth rounds for Group A in the third round of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup finals.</p>

The national team currently occupies third place in the group standings with only four points, lagging behind the Qatari national team on goal difference, while the Iranian national team leads the group with 10 points, the Uzbek national team is second with the same score, the Kyrgyz national team comes fifth with three points, and the North Korean national team is in last place with two points.</p>

Technical gains

The technical expert at the International Federation of Association Football, Abdullah Hassan, said that the technical benefit for the national team from the clubs’ participation in continental championships exists, but it is incomplete for several reasons, including that most teams depend in Asian participation on players from outside the national team, and some of the players from these clubs They are either tired or injured when they join the national team, which sometimes prompts the national team coach to exclude them or replace them with players who are technically inferior to them.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

He said: “From a technical standpoint, any player’s participation with his team at the continental level has technical benefits and gains, as it adds new experiences to the player, but does the national team benefit from this participation?”

Benefit to the player only

The coach of the Dibba Al-Hisn team, Hassan Al-Abdouli, confirmed that the benefit from the participation of continental clubs goes to the player who maintains his technical and physical levels, and does not go to the national team.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He added: “The way these players play with their teams is different from the way the national team plays, and some of these players also Sometimes they play with the national team in positions different from those they are accustomed to with their teams.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Hassan Al-Abdouli stressed the importance of standing with the national team and supporting it strongly in this important stage in the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, and added: “The national team is currently in a stage in which the players are supposed to have adapted to the style of play adopted by the coach, Paulo Bento, and we expect them to shine in the matches.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” “The next one.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

The clubs did not help the national team

In turn, the director of the first football team at Al-Jazira Al-Hamra Club, Adel Al-Amiri, said that the clubs’ participation in the AFC Champions League is supposed to develop the player’s level and work to better prepare him when he joins the national team, stressing at the same time that the clubs have not It helps the national teams due to the presence of a large number of foreign players in their ranks, in addition to the issue of naturalization, and this matter does not serve the interests of the “white team.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

He pointed out that the players the national team coach is currently using are those available to him, although some of these players do not have enough opportunity to play with their teams due to the clubs’ reliance on foreign players.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Al-Amiri explained: “When local clubs participate as Asians, they are The regulations participate with the largest possible number of foreign players, so that there are nine foreign players on the field out of 11, and there are other clubs that benefited from the naturalization decision, and therefore the return to the national team from this participation is very modest.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Al-Amiri continued: “In my estimation, if the best coach in the world were brought in to carry out the process of selecting players from the league, he would be confused because the current mechanism for the game does not serve the national team, while the system related to the game is supposed to work for the benefit of the national teams.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Al-Amiri called on the clubs to put the national team’s interest at their top priority, and to give the international player in their ranks the opportunity to play mainly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The Football Association said in a press statement yesterday that the technical staff of the national team excluded the player, Ali Saleh, from the national team’s camp currently held in Saadiyat in Abu Dhabi, after medical tests confirmed his injury and his need for treatment and rest.</p>
