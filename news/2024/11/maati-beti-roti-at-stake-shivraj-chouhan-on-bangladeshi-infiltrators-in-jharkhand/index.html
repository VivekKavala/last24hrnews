                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, both of whom invoked “illegal immigration” from Bangladesh at their poll rallies in the state, Chouhan said these “infiltrators” were the vote bank of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha coalition.</p>

“What did it mean when Congress leader Ghulam Ahmed Mir said if the Congress forms the government, it will give gas cylinders to infiltrators at Rs 450?

— ANI UP/Uttarakhand (@ANINewsUP) November 15, 2024

Chouhan, who is also the BJP’s election incharge for Jharkhand, alleged that the Congress high command is yet to condemn the statement of its state incharge Mir that if voted to power, the party will provide domestic LPG cylinders to all citizens, including “infiltrators”.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
He paid homage to tribal martyr Birsa Munda on his 150th birth anniversary, as well as other tribal icons such as Sidhu-Kanhu, Poto Ho and Phulo Jhano.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “These tribal leaders had made the supreme sacrifice to save jal, jungle, jameen (water, forest and land).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But now, that land of tribal martyrs is in danger because of illegal infiltrators who were grabbing land and playing with the honour of tribal women,” he said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The BJP leader said adivasis became minorities in several villages in the Santhal Pargana region, including that of martyrs Sidho and Kanhu in Dumka’s Bhognadih.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “It is a now or never situation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> So, it is not an ordinary election, not to elect a new government, but an election for Mati, Beti and Roti which are at stake due to illegal infiltration,” he said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
He said at the age of 15, Birsa Munda had sought the blessings of his mother to fight the forces engaged in grabbing tribal land, plights and atrocities committed on the community.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Born in 1875 in present-day Jharkhand, Munda had challenged British rule and is credited with mobilising tribals against the empire.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He died in British custody at the age of 25 years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Referring to Mir’s promise to give LPG cylinders at Rs 450 to even “infiltrators”, Chouhan stressed that it indicated the ruling coalition’s admission about the presence of infiltrators in the state and they were being patronised by the Congress and JMM.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
“They have been blaming BJP for playing divisive politics but the fact was admitted by none other than Congress’ in charge of Jharkhand,” he said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
He said he regretted that Mir’s statement — made on Thursday (November 14) — was not yet condemned or denied by Congress leaders such as Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and its president Mallikarjun Kharge.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> No action was taken against infiltrators though the Special Branch had issued a circular cautioning the police about their activities, he alleged.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The Union minister alleged that leaders of the ruling coalition help the infiltrators from Bangladesh get government documents such as Aadhaar and voter cards as they use the foreigners as their vote bank, he claimed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
“Are they not traitors? Is patronising and providing facilities to infiltrators a Congress agenda? Do they have rights to our mineral reserves? Did the Congress and JMM strike a deal with infiltrators to grab tribal land and play with the honour of tribal women?” he asked, adding that they should make their stand clear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
He expressed concerns over the “fast-changing” demography and “depleting” tribal population as part of the BJP’s major poll plank infiltration in Santhal Pargana region.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He alleged that the population of adivasis in Santhal Pargana has dwindled to 28 per cent as per government record from 44 per cent, while the situation was nothing different in Pakur and Sahibganj districts, where infiltrators became majority in dozens of villages.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
“If we do not stand by adivasis and moolvasis (non-tribal natives) today, the situation will turn grave.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The situation is like ‘Abhi nahin, toh kabhi nahin’ (It is now or never),” he said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Dozens of villages in Santhal Pargana is now known as “jamai tola” as the infiltrators marry tribal women, encourage them to contest panchayat polls and grab panchayat bodies once these women win, he said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “We will enact a law and take back Adivasi land grabbed by the infiltrators,” he said.</p>
