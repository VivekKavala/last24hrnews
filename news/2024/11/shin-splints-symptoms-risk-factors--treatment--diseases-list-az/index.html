                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Shin splints refer to pain along the shinbone (tibia), the large bone at the front of the lower leg.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition is common in runners, dancers, and military personnel.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In the medical world, shin splints are known as medial tibial stress syndrome.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This often occurs in athletes who are increasing their training.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Increased exercise activity can overwork muscles, tendons, and bone tissue, triggering pain.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Symptoms of Dry Bone Splints

When experiencing this condition, the most noticeable symptom is pain along the shin bone located in the lower leg.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The pain will be most felt on the inside and generally makes the leg look swollen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The severity of the pain can vary.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Some people feel pain while doing activities, some before activities, and some after activities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Even in certain cases, pain is not felt when doing activities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In addition to these, other symptoms of shin splints may include:

There is pain in both shins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The pain will get worse when climbing stairs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Having mild swelling around the tibia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
There is pain in the shin.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Initially, this pain can disappear after stopping exercise, but it will reappear until it causes a fracture due to pressure on the leg.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
The lower leg is slightly swollen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The severity level occurs when the sufferer is unable to carry out any activity due to the pain they feel.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Causes of Dry Bone Splints

The cause of shin splints is often related to repetitive activities that put stress on the shinbone and the connective tissue that attaches the muscle to the bone.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This pressure can trigger inflammation of the connective tissue lining the tibia (periostitis).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Overpronation of the foot and ankle can also be a cause of shin splints.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition occurs when the foot continues to move down and towards the center of the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This change in position accommodates more of the foot’s arch when stepping onto the surface.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The focus becomes heavier on the inside of the foot (medial) than the outer edge of the foot (lateral).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This abnormal movement causes the muscles to tire more quickly and can put additional stress on the shins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Risk Factors for Shin Splints

There are several risk factors that make someone susceptible to experiencing this condition, namely:

Having a foot surface that is flat or curves too much inward.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Have strong calf muscles.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Having tight connective tissue from the calf muscles to the heel bone (Achilles tendon).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Have weak ankles.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Excess body weight.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Wearing inappropriate sports shoes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Following military training.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Exercising on an uneven surface.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Doing sudden sports movements.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Shin Splint Diagnosis

In general, this condition is diagnosed by an orthopedic specialist.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Here’s the process:

Check medical history

The doctor will ask about your complete medical history.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

They will ask about what symptoms you are experiencing and how long you have had them.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The doctor will also ask about your physical activities, as well as any history of previous injuries or foot problems.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Physical examination

Next, the doctor will need to perform a physical examination of the feet and shins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This stage includes checking the painful area, measuring the pressure on the shin, and checking posture.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This examination can help the doctor determine if there are signs of inflammation or injury.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Imaging tests

In some cases, your doctor may refer you for imaging tests such as an X-ray or MRI.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This examination can help detect structural changes in the bone or surrounding soft tissue.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Additional tests

The doctor may perform additional tests such as blood tests to check for levels of inflammation or other medical disorders that may be causing shin pain.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Diagnosis banding

Your doctor may also perform a differential diagnosis, which is comparing your symptoms with symptoms of other conditions that may be similar.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

For example, such as stress fractures, shin splint syndrome, muscle inflammation, or symptoms of bone cancer.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This helps in identifying the cause of these conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Shin Splint Complications

Shin splints are a condition that can worsen over time.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If not treated immediately, this condition can cause the following conditions:

Pain that becomes increasingly intense until numbness occurs
Imbalance while walking
Changes in the skin of the feet such as calluses, blisters, and open wounds
Affects quality of life

A complication you need to be aware of due to shin splints is a tibial stress fracture or a broken tibial bone.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Shin Splint Treatment

In general, shin splints can be relieved with rest and simple care.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Simple treatments that you can do include:

Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to the affected area for 15 minutes every few hours until symptoms subside.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Take medications such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxen sodium to relieve pain.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Gently stretch the Achilles tendon muscle.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Avoid heavy activities or sports that can put pressure on the shins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This rest should be done for at least two weeks.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> You can replace sports during rest by doing yoga or swimming.</p>

Once the pain has subsided, you can return to exercise, but increase it gradually to prevent a relapse.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

If the pain persists, it is best to stop the activity and see a doctor or physical therapist for better treatment.</p>

Prevention of Dry Bone Splints

There are several things you need to pay attention to before exercising to avoid getting shin splints, such as:

Movement analysis

Before doing a particular sport, analyze the movement pattern first.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

In this way, you can prevent shin splints from occurring due to mistakes or inaccuracies when performing certain sports movements.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Avoid overdoing it

Too much running or activities done for too long at too high an intensity can put a strain on the shins.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Excessive physical activity, especially if not accompanied by adequate rest and good care, can cause increased pressure on the shins and lead to injury.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Choose the right shoes

Wear the right shoes when exercising.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For example, if you are a runner, replace your shoes every 560-800 kilometers.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Sports shoes that are specifically designed for a particular type of activity are often equipped with support and stability systems appropriate for that activity.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Consider arch support

Arch supports can help prevent pain from this condition, especially if you have flat arches.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Arch supports help distribute body weight more evenly and reduce excess pressure on the shins when walking or running.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Consider shock-absorbing soles

Wearing these insoles can reduce the risk of shin splints and prevent recurrence.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This helps reduce excess stress on the shins and foot joints, which can occur when walking or running on hard or uneven surfaces.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Intermittent exercise

Alternately replacing exercise with one that puts less stress on the shins, such as swimming, walking, or cycling, may help prevent shin splints.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

However, always start new activities slowly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Increase the time and intensity gradually.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Add strength training

Exercises to strengthen and stabilize the feet, ankles, hips, and core can help prepare the feet for high-impact sports.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>.</p>

A stye or hordeolum is a pimple-like bump or boil that grows on the edge of the eyelid.</p>
                                
                                <p class="m-b-5 small-txt">

The cause of a sty is generally a bacterial infection and usually only appears on one eyelid.</p>
