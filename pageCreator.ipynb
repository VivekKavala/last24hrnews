The incident at Bandra only reflects how incapable the current Railways Minister is. The BJP has made Ashwini Vaishnav ji a Prabhari for BJP Maharashtra for elections, but every week there are some incidents and accidents that occur with the railways. It is such a shame that our country has been forced under such incapable ministers,\" he said. The opposition leaders use the term “reel minister” to criticize the Railways Minister over the derailments and train accidents. Responding to the attacks, the minister defended his work in the Lok Sabha this August, saying, “We’re not just people who make reels; we’re people who work hard.”With the Maharashtra Assembly election less than a month away, the BJP has appointed Vaishnaw, a former bureaucrat, to lead the party\\'s campaign.Taking a jibe at the Railway Minister, Sharad Pawar-led NCP leader Clyde Crasto said, \"The stampede at Bandra Terminus is very disturbing... This shows the failure of the Railways Ministry, Ashwini Vaishnaw. Lack of enough trains during the festive season and also a failure of the local administration have led to this mishap.\" The stampede incident at the Bandra terminal, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), was caused by the festive rush ahead of Diwali. Western Railway\\'s Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO), Vineet Abhishek, said that the incident took place when two passengers tried to board the Bandra-Gorakpur Antyodaya Express. \"Around 2:30 am, the train was brought to the platform from the yard. As the train was about to arrive at the platform, two passengers tried to board the train. They both suffered injuries. Following this, the railway authorities immediately got the ambulance and shifted the injured passengers to Bhabha Hospital,\" he said.

With this, India\\'s proud run of 18 consecutive series wins at home since losing to England in 2012-13 ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the two matches, the senior players underperformed. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli struggled with the bat, while the formidable spin duo of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja also failed to make a significant impact.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yeah. Why shouldn\\'t it (the onus of the series loss) be the senior players?

So, knowing them personally, and I do know each one of them personally. They will say that they didn\\'t have the best series. The question then becomes what do they need to do to get better and it is a very very current question to ask,\" he detailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew head coach Gautam Gambhir has also come in the line of fire after India erred tactically and experienced repeated batting collapses in the two Tests but Manjrekar backed the former opener. \"I will still maintain that the coach has the minimal influence on a team, lesser than your 11th weakest player.

The incident at Bandra only reflects how incapable the current Railways Minister is. The BJP has made Ashwini Vaishnav ji a Prabhari for BJP Maharashtra for elections, but every week there are some incidents and accidents that occur with the railways. It is such a shame that our country has been forced under such incapable ministers,\" he said. The opposition leaders use the term “reel minister” to criticize the Railways Minister over the derailments and train accidents. Responding to the attacks, the minister defended his work in the Lok Sabha this August, saying, “We’re not just people who make reels; we’re people who work hard.”With the Maharashtra Assembly election less than a month away, the BJP has appointed Vaishnaw, a former bureaucrat, to lead the party\\'s campaign.Taking a jibe at the Railway Minister, Sharad Pawar-led NCP leader Clyde Crasto said, \"The stampede at Bandra Terminus is very disturbing... This shows the failure of the Railways Ministry, Ashwini Vaishnaw. Lack of enough trains during the festive season and also a failure of the local administration have led to this mishap.\" The stampede incident at the Bandra terminal, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), was caused by the festive rush ahead of Diwali. Western Railway\\'s Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO), Vineet Abhishek, said that the incident took place when two passengers tried to board the Bandra-Gorakpur Antyodaya Express. \"Around 2:30 am, the train was brought to the platform from the yard. As the train was about to arrive at the platform, two passengers tried to board the train. They both suffered injuries. Following this, the railway authorities immediately got the ambulance and shifted the injured passengers to Bhabha Hospital,\" he said.

People asked me to address this in Mann Ki Baat, as everyone needs to understand. The first step involves collecting your personal information. Step two is creating an atmosphere of fear, instilling so much anxiety that you can’t think clearly. Step three is applying time pressure… Victims of digital arrest come from all backgrounds and ages. Many have lost substantial sums of their hard-earned money. If you ever receive such a call, don’t be afraid. Be aware that no investigative agency conducts such interrogations over the phone or video call. The three steps to digital security are: stop, think, and act. If possible, take a screenshot or record the call. No government agency issues threats over the phone or demands money,” PM Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat address.He further stated that investigative agencies are working in partnership with state governments to combat the scam being carried out in the name of digital arrest.“There is no legal system called digital arrest; it’s purely fraud, deceit, a criminal enterprise by those who are enemies of society.

The question then becomes what do they need to do to get better and it is a very very current question to ask,\" he detailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew head coach Gautam Gambhir has also come in the line of fire after India erred tactically and experienced repeated batting collapses in the two Tests but Manjrekar backed the former opener. \"I will still maintain that the coach has the minimal influence on a team, lesser than your 11th weakest player.

The division bench, led by Chief Justice Manmohan, while seeking the response of all respondents, including Union ministries of information and broadcasting and electronics and information technology, tagged the matter with ongoing PIL and recently moved against ticket scalping, which is listed for hearing on February 18, 2025.The plea, prompted by recent concerts featuring Coldplay, Diljit Dosanjh, etc.The petition stated that the resellers have also acted in violation of the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, as the resellers do not carry out any verification of the tickets being sold on their platform, nor they require any undertaking from the sellers, as is also evident from their terms and conditions. Thus, an individual with no ticket can also advertise via Resellers and secure unjust and unlawful benefits. Moreover, the resellers have no effective grievance redressal mechanism in place which may protect the interests of the purchasers if the seller fails to abide by its contractual obligations. Moreover, in the absence of a ticket or non-delivery of a legal ticket, it is the resellers who are to gain, as they further charge 25 euros per issue from the seller as ‘administrative fees’ for resolution of any issue raised by the purchaser. Such fees are independent of any successful resolution, and no compensation is provided to the buyer.It is further stated that Section 112 of BNS was also introduced with a similar aim to curb the practice of black-marketing and unauthorised dealing of tickets. The legislature intended to safeguard the public interest by outlawing any transactions for the sale of tickets that were without the express authority of the authorised ticketing platform or organiser. Prior to BNS, the state legislatures had prohibited such black-marketing activities via state legislation, as it deprived the state of a substantial amount of tax revenue and also resulted in the innocent public being cheated by the criminal elements. Thus, Section 112 of Bharatiya Nagarik Sanhita, 2023 [‘BNS’] aimed to protect the public by curbing the said acts of black-marketing with a severe punishment of imprisonment extending up to 7 years and imposition of fine. On October 9, the Delhi High Court sought the response of all respondents authorities against the practice of “ticket scalping,” which involves reselling event tickets at inflated prices.The plea filed in the Delhi High Court challenges the illegal practice of ticket scalping, where event tickets are resold at inflated prices for profit, harming the general public.The petition also claims that scalping contributes to a black market for counterfeit tickets, further victimising consumers. Additionally, it argued that these transactions, often unregulated, evade the official tax system, resulting in lost government revenue. This situation fosters a shadow economy that deprives the state of funds that could support public services and infrastructure.The petitioner called for a comprehensive legal framework, effective enforcement, and technological solutions to mitigate the negative impacts of ticket scalping. The goal is to promote fair ticketing practices, ensure consumer protection, and integrate revenue from ticket sales into the formal economy', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-norms-to-regulate-re-sale-of-concert-tickets-banning-of-illegal-sites/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-norms-to-regulate-re-sale-of-concert-tickets-banning-of-illegal-sites.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-24 07:53:34', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.191}, {'id': 260898206, 'title': 'BJP’s Wayanad LS candidate Navya Haridas files nomination', 'text': 'BJP candidate from Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, Navya Haridas on Thursday filed her nomination papers.

The Road Transport and Highways Ministry, led by Nitin Gadkari, has been carrying out many important projects to improve comfort and ease for national travellers. This expressway will have additional benefits in addition to cutting down on travel time. In the nine districts listed above, this will facilitate transportation and result in the development of industrial centres. The expressway plan identifies specific locations for industry expansion, hence fostering regional growth. According to reports, this expressway will link to the Kanpur-Lucknow Expressway in the south and the Ghaziabad-Hapur Highway (NH-9) in the north. This project was originally supposed to be built from Hapur to Kanpur. A 60-kilometer connector road will now be built to link the Meerut expressway with Hapur. Better connectivity services for Hapur and Meerut will begin as a result. Reports state that the initial building of the 380-kilometer greenfield expressway will only include four lanes. In the future, this could be extended to six lanes. This expressway is the potential for future connections to Noida's Jewar Airport, also referred to as Noida International Airport. This will make it easy to connect Kanpur to Delhi or Ghaziabad. This Ghaziabad-Kanpur expressway is expected to be finished by 2026, as per reports. The expressway's completion would make it easy to travel from Delhi-NCR to Kanpur and other UP cities, which will drastically alter the state's industrial and transportation landscape.\", 'summary': 'The 380 km long Greenfield Expressway is being constructed from Ghaziabad to Kanpur', 'url': 'https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-ghaziabad-to-kanpur-in-5-hours-380-km-expressway-to-connect-9-up-districts-will-be-completed-by-3115212', 'image': 'https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/10/27/2659600-image-2024-10-27t150143.929.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-27 09:29:00', 'author': 'Sonali Sharma', 'authors': ['Sonali Sharma'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.155}, {'id': 261258538, 'title': \"'Atmosphere of fear...': PM Modi warns against 'digital arrest' scam, suggests ways to deal with 'fraudsters'\", 'text': 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday spoke about the cyber crime of “digital arrests”, noting that it has hit all sections of society and urging people to adopt the mantra of “stop, think and take action” when faced with such a scam.

Step three is applying time pressure… Victims of digital arrest come from all backgrounds and ages. Many have lost substantial sums of their hard-earned money. If you ever receive such a call, don’t be afraid. Be aware that no investigative agency conducts such interrogations over the phone or video call. The three steps to digital security are: stop, think, and act. If possible, take a screenshot or record the call. No government agency issues threats over the phone or demands money,” PM Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat address.He further stated that investigative agencies are working in partnership with state governments to combat the scam being carried out in the name of digital arrest.“There is no legal system called digital arrest; it’s purely fraud, deceit, a criminal enterprise by those who are enemies of society. Various investigative agencies, in collaboration with state governments, are actively working to address this scam.

The video dates back to December 2019 and shows a Saudi Arabian blogger Mohammed Saud expressing support for Netanyahu, wishing him luck to win the Likud Party’s leadership elections back then.Did Europe Release a Poster Labelling Israeli PM Netanyahu ‘Terrorist’? No!How did we find out the truth?: We used InVID, a video verification on extension tool on Google Chrome, and divided the video into multiple keyframes.We ran a reverse image search on Google, which led us to the same video on Lebanese news outlet Al Mayadeen’s verified YouTube channel.The video was uploaded in December 2019 and its description identified the person on the phone as one Mohammed Saud.We also came across an article carrying a screenshot of the viral video on Moroccan news website HowiyaPress, which mentioned that Saud was a blogger from Saudi Arabia who had contacted Netanyahu days after the latter’s political party’s elections for a party leader took place.It also carried a link to a now-deleted X post shared by Saud on his account.We looked for the post on Wayback Machine, an internet archiving platform, and found that Saud had shared it with a caption appreciating Netanyahu.Conclusion: An old video of a Saudi blogger and Netanyahu speaking on a video call is being shared with the false claim that it shows a sheikh supporting Netanyahu’s actions.Did Xi Jinping & Angela Merkel Refuse To Shake Hands With PM Modi?

This victory was significant for the ROC’s morale, marking one of their last successes before retreating to Taiwan.The battle is frequently referenced in discussions about current cross-strait relations, underscoring its lasting impact on Taiwan’s defence strategies and geopolitical tensions, reported Taipei Times.During the final stages of China’s Civil War, the Kinmen battle represented one of the few victories for Chiang Kai-shek’s forces.This visit marked Lai’s second trip to Kinmen since he took office in May. It followed the Taiwan Defence Command’s inaugural night-time live-fire drills aimed at preparing the military for potential PLA invasions under the cover of darkness.The exercises took place in the Wude area of southern Penghu County and were designed to simulate responses to a surprise night-time assault by the PLA.The drills included media attendance and involved comprehensive aerial, naval, and land simulations conducted in darkness. Land exercises utilised CM-21 armoured vehicles and M60A3 tanks, operated by soldiers equipped with night-vision gear.Live ammunition was discharged along local beaches in preparation for a potential land assault. To address a simulated aerial invasion using drones, the army deployed flares to illuminate the night sky, allowing them to fire 120mm mortars upwards, Taipei Times reported.The army stated that the naval simulations considered the possibility of the PLA Navy infiltrating Taiwan’s waters disguised as fishermen, prompting the firing of ammunition from land to sea. Before the drills commenced, the Coast Guard Administration alerted local fishermen and boaters about the upcoming live-fire exercise near Wude.Overall, the drills took place at 18 locations, with over 32,000 rounds of various types of ammunition discharged, showcasing Taiwan’s commitment to its national defence.', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/no-external-force-can-change-taiwans-future-president-william-lai-pledges-to-uphold-self-governing-status/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/no-external-force-can-change-taiwans-future-president-william-lai-pledges-to-uphold-self-governing-status.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-27 10:34:13', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.434}, {'id': 261261480, 'title': '“We have to be brave”: Akash Mishra on the need for a distinct philosophy in Indian Football', 'text': 'Mumbai City FC’s young defender Akash Mishra recently opened up about his vision for the future of Indian football, his journey so far, and the role he hopes to play. For Mishra, the Indian national team’s development hinges on a unified style of play.“I’m very young to comment on this, but from the experience I have, I’d say we have to be brave. Indian football needs its own philosophy, a style that defines how we play, and we must follow that step by step. Currently, players spend most of the year with their clubs, training in different setups, and then come to the national team with various formations. It takes time to build a combination, but with our new coach’s philosophy and more consistency in camps, we can establish a solid style of play for Indian football,” Mishra said to ANI.Reflecting on some of his standout moments, Mishra’s pride in representing India is evident.“My debut for the Indian national team against Oman, where we drew 1-1 in a friendly in the UAE, remains the best game of my life. For any player, representing the national team is a dream come true, it’s the biggest achievement you can have,” he said.His time with Mumbai City FC has also provided unforgettable experiences.“There have been many games, but facing Al Hilal was on a different level. Few Indian players get that opportunity, and to compete against Asia’s best is incredible. Playing at Navi Mumbai and in Saudi were both special,” Mishra emphasized.Mishra’s personal and professional goals are deeply tied to his national aspirations.“I have dreams for the national team too. With a new coach, we know we have areas to improve, our FIFA ranking, our game style, everything. There’s a lot of work ahead of us, but we have to improve in all aspects,” he added.When he joined Mumbai City FC, Mishra knew he was stepping into a winning team.“They’re a champion team, they always aim for the shield or the cup each season. Football is a team game, so trophies matter. That’s why I’m here, to fight for trophies,” he noted.Mishra credits his development to the level of professionalism at Mumbai City FC, which is part of the City Football Group.“There’s so much happening behind the scenes that people don’t see, but we experience it, and it makes us better footballers and people. With this level of professionalism, a player’s development becomes consistent, and consistency over 10-15 years is what truly counts. We have to take care of our bodies, and in terms of professionalism, Mumbai City FC is one of the best in India,”On the team’s slow start to the season, Mishra remains optimistic.“If you look at our standard, you’ll see we trust our football. We train hard and believe in our approach. The first three games weren’t great, but then we won, and hopefully, we’ll keep building from there. We have new faces in the squad, so some adjustment time was necessary.”Mumbai City FC’s next match against Odisha FC also brings a familiar face on the sidelines with former coach Sergio Lobera. Mishra acknowledges the challenge but remains focused.“Every game brings different challenges. Sergio has proven himself in India, but we trust our system and our coach. We have to prepare well and stick to our game without taking unnecessary pressure,” Mishra remarked.Among the teams he enjoys playing against, Mishra particularly looks forward to matches against Kolkata clubs like Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, and Mohammedan, as well as Kerala Blasters.“The away fans create an incredible atmosphere, and it’s an exciting challenge for any player to perform in those settings but if I had to pick a favourite, it would be Bengaluru FC. There’s always extra motivation when we play them.”Mishra also shared his admiration for Anwar Ali as a role model.“When I was in Germany, he was playing for the national team in the U17 World Cup, and I really admire him. What he does is extraordinary, and there’s a lot to learn from him. If I had to choose one player from India, it would be him,” said Mishra.', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/we-have-to-be-brave-akash-mishra-on-the-need-for-a-distinct-philosophy-in-indian-football/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/we-have-to-be-brave-akash-mishra-on-the-need-for-a-distinct-philosophy-in-indian-football.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-27 10:33:27', 'author': 'TNM NewsDesk', 'authors': ['TNM NewsDesk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.645}, {'id': 261261474, 'title': 'Delhi Police finds mobile network jammer in Delhi’s Palika Bazaar', 'text': 'Ahead of Diwali, Delhi Police confiscated a mobile network jammer from Palika Bazaar in the national capital on Sunday, officials said.Delhi Police reported that a suspicious electronic device was found in a shop during verification at Palika Bazaar.“This suspicious electronic device functions as a mobile network jammer,” police official stated.Police confirmed that legal action would be pursued against the shopkeeper following verification of the device.“The verification of this device is ongoing.

No surprises there, since the RBI’s restrictions targeted features that were most attractive to potential investors — tenure-linked assured minimum returns and liquidity options — apart from mandating T+1 settlement cycle.\\n\\nA P2P platform’s role is limited to facilitating transactions between lenders and borrowers without participating directly in the lending or borrowing process.\\n\\nWhile opinions differ on the industry’s ability to comply with the new norms, businessline takes a look at the past, present and likely future of P2P lending in India.\\n\\nInformal lending\\n\\nTalk of regulating P2P lending first emerged in 2016, to curb informal moneylending. Citing the global pickup in P2P lending and newer entrants in India, the RBI floated a discussion paper on whether regulation was needed or not.\\n\\nThe arguments against included inadvertently lending credibility to P2P lending, with the stamp of regulation; stifling growth; and the absence of any immediate systemic risk from the nascent sector.\\n\\nThose calling for regulation argued that P2P lending cannot be overlooked owing to the growing potential of online trading; P2P lending caters to underserved borrowers and, if regulated, it can facilitate cheaper loans for such borrowers more effectively; if left unregulated, the sector may be riddled with unhealthy practices.\\n\\nAfter the feedback from stakeholders, the RBI in 2017 issued master directions on P2P lending in India, specifying the scope of activities for the lenders, eligibility criteria, and transparency and pricing disclosure requirement, among other norms.\\n\\nWhat went wrong?\\n\\nAccording to an RBI official, who requested anonymity, P2P exchanges began acting like a bank, drawing the ire of the regulator. They pocketed the spread between the borrowing rate and the interest that a lender charged on the platform.\\n\\n“They were brought on board to curb moneylending, but started acting more like a bank than an exchange. Features like instant withdrawals, fixed withdrawals made investors feel there is no credit risk to the instrument,” the official says. The RBI’s restrictions soon followed. \\n\\nThe regulator declared that P2P exchanges cannot utilise the funds of one lender to replace those of another, effectively killing the secondary market. It also stressed that P2P players must disclose their fees at the time of lending.\\n\\nThe RBI also disallowed the practice of matching and mapping participants within a closed user group, whether through an outsourcing agency or otherwise.\\n\\nWhat lies ahead?\\n\\nThere are divergent views on the likely future of P2P lending in India. A large P2P exchange has stopped onboarding new customers since August 16, leading to 30-35 per cent loss in AUM, an official said.\\n\\n“RBI officials are visiting our offices to assess whether we are in compliance with the new norms. If some of the secondary market features are not revived, the industry may see a sharp fall in volumes. Large players like us are thinking of giving up the licence,” a company official said.\\n\\nBut not all are pessimistic.\\n\\nBhavin Patel, founder and CEO, LenDenClub, argues that in any regulated business some players will push the boundaries till the industry reaches product-market fit.\\n\\n“Before the guidelines were announced, many young entrepreneurs, including technocrats, participated in this segment. In the US and Europe market, too, young players pushed the boundaries until regulators stepped in,” he says, adding this was common in Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, too.\\n\\nWhile customers looked for products with liquidity, re-investment, automated selection of borrowers, and secondary market of loans, among other features, the RBI is wary of premature loan exits. \\n\\n“We were never into liquidity on our platform. We also immediately halted the secondary market product we had with one partner,” Patel says.\\n\\n“Auto-lending was discontinued, as it needed flow change, but this did not affect customers,” he says.\\n\\nNeha Juneja, CEO, IndiaP2P, says the exchange enables finance for women running small businesses, avoiding usurious moneylenders.\\n\\n“We made adjustments to technology and staff training, and relaunched a few weeks ago,” she says.\\n\\n“I think the RBI wants the industry to take a different direction.

Governance and compliance lapses are rising in tandem with the growth in gold-loan assets. This issue came to the fore again recently, after the Reserve Bank of India issued a directive highlighting the irregularities in loan sourcing, appraisal, valuation, auction, end-use monitoring, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio monitoring, and application of risk weights.\\n\\nSpecifically, the banking regulator cautioned banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) against the practice of rolling over loans at the end of the term, evergreening, non-categorisation of gold loans as non-performing assets (NPAs), multiple gold loans under the same PAN, lower realisation from gold auctions, and closure of loan accounts soon after sanction.\\n\\nThe RBI also highlighted serious lapses such as gold valuation in the absence of customers, credit appraisal and valuation by fintech firms or business correspondents (BC), gold-keeping in the BC’s custody, delayed transportation of gold to bank branches, outsourcing ‘know your customer’ (KYC) compliance service to fintech partners, and poor verification of end-use of funds.\\n\\nUnorganised players\\n\\nConsidering the popularity of gold loans and its deep impact at the grassroots level, regulating the segment is top priority for the RBI. However, this proves challenging, given the dominance of unorganised players at nearly 63 per cent, according to the PwC report. They provide quick loans with little or nil documentation but at exorbitant interest rate. Customers also risk losing valuable collateral. The silver lining is that specialised gold-loan companies and banks are gaining ground.\\n\\nNotably, the bigger presence of commercial banks promises to make the gold loan market more transparent, regulated and accountable. Public sector banks offer gold jewellery-backed farm loans at lower interest rates. A recent RBI report shows that gold loans from banks are increasing at 41 per cent year-on-year, as of August this year. \\n\\nOverall, organised sector gold loans have registered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25 per cent between FY20 and FY24, says an ICRA report. Banks dominated this segment with a higher CAGR of 26 per cent since agri loans were included. Banks also have the advantage of low-cost funds. Gold loans offer a means for diversification and risk mitigation through a secured portfolio. This would help strengthen customer base too, says the PwC report.\\n\\nNBFCs grew their gold loan business at 18 per cent during the period. They have an edge over banks as they employ innovative ways, including digital and AI tools, to boost business. Moreover, banks appear unable to explore the gold-loan market to the full extent as it doesn’t fall in their core business area.\\n\\nFintech challenge\\n\\nWith the emergence of new technology partners such as fintechs, systemic risks are on the rise. The RBI’s observations are aimed at making intermediaries — third-party service providers and technology partners — more reliable. It is a stern message for lenders to ensure compliance when partnering with fintech companies and outsourcing core business operations, or risk disastrous outcomes.\\n\\nThe RBI appears a bit wary about the role of fintechs. Though fintechs are contributing significantly to financial inclusion, digitalisation, ‘ease of doing business’, and streamlining of loan processing, some do stray from their prescribed roles. The onus is on the lenders and NBFCs to ensure their tech partners follow regulatory guidelines, corporate governance practices, and ethical standards. In fact, regulating fintechs is priority for RBI, as was apparent from the alacrity with which it appointed the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) as the first Self-Regulatory Organisation for Fintech (SRO-FT) in August this year. More SROs may be in the offing as fintech regulation requires cutting-edge technologies and close coordination with other regulators.\\n\\nThe RBI’s scrutiny and three-month window to address procedural lapses and accounting follies offer gold-loan entities an opportunity to create robust internal mechanisms to avert a systemic collapse.\\n\\n(The writer is ED and CEO, Indel Money)', 'summary': 'Governance, compliance in focus as RBI cautions lenders against lapses', 'url': 'https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/current-account/gold-loans-test-by-fire/article68802840.ece', 'image': 'https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/e5lpw/article68802841.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/gold%20loan.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-27 10:21:06', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.24}, {'id': 261253380, 'title': \"Taiwan says China holds 'combat' patrol after latest US arms sales\", 'text': 'TAIPEI: China deployed fighter jets and drones as part of a \"joint combat readiness patrol\" around Taiwan on Sunday, Taipei said, hours after Beijing slammed the latest round of US arms sales to the island.

The apprenticeship was intended to provide Mistry with insights and hands-on experience on how to run the group before he formally took over the position, PTI reported.The book reveals that when Mistry was chosen to succeed Tata in 2011, Tata had two observations. First, he wanted Mistry to \"severe all relations\" with his family\\'s company, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, to create a \"legal and tenable\" separation. Second, he wanted Mistry to undergo a year of \"parallel running\" with Tata to gain insights and experience in running the Tata Group.However, by the end of the year, Tata began to have doubts about Mistry\\'s suitability. According to the book, Tata was surprised by some of Mistry\\'s \"sharp interventions\" and wondered if Mistry\\'s ethos could potentially conflict with that of the Tatas. Tata later lamented that he did not have the opportunity to fully assess Mistry before his appointment.Mistry\\'s removal in October 2016 was a painful and difficult decision for Tata, according to the book.
