        "text": "Philadelphia: Former President Donald Trump is becoming increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge and is out for unchecked power, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Friday in an unprecedented attack on her Republican rival ahead of next week's election.\r\n\r\nIn a rally in Las Vegas, Harris, the Democratic leader of Indian heritage said Trump is all about \"hate\" and more division and that he would bring an \"enemies list\" to the White House while she would carry a \"to-do list\" of priorities. Singer Jennifer Lopez joined the Democratic leader at the rally.\r\n\r\n\"We all know who Donald Trump is. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. He is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and he is out for unchecked power,\" Harris said at the rally.\r\n\r\nWith just four days left for the November 5 vote, the race between Trump and Harris remained very tight in the key battleground States. \"If he (Trump) is re-elected, Donald Trump will walk into the office with an enemies list. If I am elected, I will walk in with a 'to-do list' on behalf of you,\" Harris said.\r\n\r\n\"And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of your living. That will be my focus every single day as the President,\" she added. Harris said she would put the country ahead of her party and be a President for all Americans.\r\n\r\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, I do not believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I want to give them a seat at the table. That's what real leadership look like,\" she said. \"I pledge to always put country above party, and self and to be a president for all Americans,\" she added.\r\n\r\nHarris said, if elected to the White House, she would make housing more affordable by building more houses. \"We will cut taxes for small business, we will lower health care costs.\" \"I see the promise of America in everyone here,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic leader also attacked Trump for his comment that he would protect women whether they \"like it or not\". The comments showed that Trump \"does not understand women's rights to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,\" she said.",

        "text": "New Delhi: The Indian Army began patrolling at Demchok on Friday, days after Indian and Chinese troops completed disengagement at the two friction points in eastern Ladakh, Army sources said.Patrolling at Depsang is expected to resume shortly, they said. Indian and Chinese troops have completed disengagement at two friction points at Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh and patrolling is set to commence soon at these points, Army sources had said on Wednesday. The following day, Indian and Chinese troops exchanged sweets at several border points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the occasion of Diwali. The traditional practice was observed a day after both the countries completed troop disengagement at the two friction points, bringing a fresh thaw in Sino-Indian ties. Patrolling has begun at Demchok, an Army source said. Sources had earlier said that the areas and patrolling status were expected to be moved back to pre-April 2020 level. The verification process after disengagement was in progress and patrolling modalities were to be decided between ground commanders, the sources had said on Wednesday. \u201cTalks will continue at the local commander level,\u201d they had added. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on October 21 said in Delhi that an agreement was finalised between India and China following negotiations over the past several weeks and that it would lead to a resolution of the issues that arose in 2020. The agreement was firmed up on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff. The move marks a significant development in the pursuit of reduced tension along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades. The ties between the two Asian giants had nosedived following the clash.",

Hundreds of Hindus were killed in July-August in Bangladesh when a students' agitation turned into massive protests leading to then prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee the country on August 5.\"It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border, but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength,\" he said.\"We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi,\" Trump said.\"Kamala Harris will destroy your small businesses with more regulations and higher taxes.

We will do it again, bigger and better than ever before and we will Make America Great Again,\" he said.\"Also, Happy Diwali to All.
