If given the chance, history shows they’d be the first to tear it apart.” He added, “Justice HR Khanna’s story is a reminder that the DNA of the Congress party is rooted in tyranny, not democracy.”“Today let’s also remember Justice H R Khanna’s legacy – a legacy of courage against Congress’s authoritarianism.

The story of the elder Justice Khanna continues to resonate as activists and citizens booked under draconian laws struggle for bail.\\n\\nChief Justice Khanna, in his decision to grant former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal interim bail, had termed personal liberty a sacrosanct right upon finding that the latter had been incarcerated for over 90 days in the liquor policy case.\\n\\nJustice Khanna (as he was then) had also asked a larger Bench to decide bail conditions that could be applied in cases similar to Kejriwal’s, when a sitting Chief Minister, in an unprecedented move by the Central agencies, was arrested and remanded on money-laundering charges.\\n\\nAnother notable judgment of Justice Khanna, who had sat in over 450 Benches in the apex court, was his verdict giving the thumbs-up to EVMs while declining to revive paper ballots.\\n\\nJustice Khanna, in that judgment, had favoured maintaining balance and criticised the tendency to blindly trust institutions and systems, saying such an attitude would only breed “unwarranted scepticism and impede progress”.\\n\\nRecently Justice Khanna made a point while hearing petitions challenging the inclusion of ‘secularism’ and ‘socialism’ in the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment. He had observed that secularism was always a part of the Constitution and an ingredient of its basic structure.\\n\\nIn the past five years as Supreme Court judge, Justice Khanna’s experience on the Bench was varied.

It would be seen if he would replace Justice Hima Kohli, who retired recently, with another woman judge. The Collegium would have to fill the vacancy left by Justice DY Chandrachud too. Two more judges, Justices Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar, will be retiring in January 2025.\\n\\nIt is to be seen if Chief Justice Khanna would constitute Constitution Benches to hear seminal issues like the government’s use of the Money Bill route to pass contentious amendments in laws like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in Parliament.\\n\\nAnother reference, triggered from the Sabarimala temple entry for women case, on the question of whether certain essential religious practices of various religious faiths should be constitutionally protected has been pending for a long. The case requires an answer on the contours of judicial review in ecumenical issues. The case was referred to a nine-judge Bench in 2018.\\n\\nAs Chief Justice and master of roster, Chief Justice Khanna would have to allocate cases, including sensitive ones dealing with urgent pleas for bail, to individual Benches of the court. The allocation of cases and choice of Benches have seen consistent criticism through the tenures of past Chief Justices.\\n\\nChief Justice Khanna’s legal practice began in the hard-boiled atmosphere of the district courts of the national capital in 1983 after he read law at Delhi University.

The controversial remark was given on Sunday during a rally held at Ramanagara when Khan attacked union minister HD Kumaraswamy and his relations with the party.\\n\\nSpeaking at a rally, speaking about the Channapatna assembly bypoll and the changing political allegiances of C.P. Yogeeshwara, the local Congress candidate, Khan said that Yogeeshwara who contested as an independent, had no other option but to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The minister went on to mention Kumaraswamy in offending terms, calling him “Kaaliya Kumaraswamy,” saying he was “more dangerous than the BJP”.\\n\\nKhan’s comments invited immediate criticism as he believed Yogeeshwara did not wish to join Kumaraswamy’s Janata Dal-Secular (JD(S)) as the latter former Chief Minister adorned himself. Now, Yogeeshwara returned to Congress which was his home. The rally was part of the bypoll campaign for Channapatna, where Nikhil Kumaraswamy, the son of HD Kumaraswamy, would face Yogeeshwara in a direct contest as the latter represented the NDA candidate to contest JD(S) candidate.\\n\\nJD(S) And BJP React To The Statement\\n\\nNo one expected that this statement will go without response, as the Janata Dal-Secular (JD(S)) immediately rebuked the comment attributed with racial overtones. The party, through X, which is the former Twitter, issued a statement blaming Khan for having a wrong attitude towards people of darker skin colors. JD(S) officials have now asked him to apologize publicly and directed action against him forthwith.\\n\\nThe party countered that most of the top leaders in the Congress party also had darker complexions, including Mallikarjun Kharge, H.C. Mahadevappa, and Satish Jarakiholi. JD(S) went on to say that such comments should never be part of the political debate and sought Khan’s ouster from the Congress party and from the state cabinet.\\n\\nThe nation vehemently condemns the disgraceful and racially charged remarks by Zameer Ahmed against HD Kumaraswamy. This kind of hateful language marks a new low in political discourse and has no place in a civilized society. We demand accountability from leaders who choose… https://t.co/teH4kZbzmN\\n— Janata Dal Secular (@JanataDal_S) November 11, 2024\\n\\nIt was the comment that drew attention from the BJP top leaders, many of whom condemned the ex-minister for taking sides with Kumaraswamy. It reminded one of another similar event in May when Indian Overseas Congress chief Sam Pitroda made commotion over remarks on racial characteristics of Indians from different communities. Union Minister Kiren Rijiju writes in support for Kumaraswamy, calling the Khan statement “a racist remark,” drawing parallels with Pitroda’s earlier statements about South Indians, North East Indians, and North Indians.\\n\\nBJP’s further reaction to the controversy fueled even more controversy, and several BJP members openly disapproved the statement from Khan. BJP leaders Kiren Rijiju also told media that such remarks have no place in Indian politics and were capable of dividing the nation and damaging national unity.\\n\\nCongress Leader Demands Action\\n\\nTo this controversy, senior Congress leader Priyank Kharge, who is the son of Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, appealed to all politicians and citizens to mind their words so as not to refer to people based on their color. He said such acts are contradictory to the inclusive nature for which the party stands for.

Justice Jamadar on Monday made the interim order permanent. Goyal, aged 75, is suffering from cancer and had sought bail to undergo treatment. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had opposed his plea and said he could be admitted to a hospital of his choice and take treatment while in custody. In May, the HC granted interim bail to Goyal for a period of two months which was later extended by four weeks and then again for two months.

Gambhir, who is serving as the head coach for India’s upcoming tour to Australia, answered questions about the team and its preparations but came under scrutiny for the lack of depth and clarity in his responses. Manjrekar expressed concerns over Gambhir’s demeanor and suggested that his role should be confined to behind-the-scenes duties, with others like Rohit Sharma and Ajit Agarkar better suited for fronting the media.\\n\\nManjrekar’s Feedback on Gambhir’s Performance\\n\\nManjrekar, who has been an active broadcaster, commented on Gambhir’s recent press conference, calling it “bland” and lacking the sharpness that fans might have expected from the former cricketer. In his post on X (formerly Twitter), Manjrekar said, “Just watched Gambhir in the press conference. Maybe wise for BCCI to keep him away from such duties, let him work behind the scenes. He does not have the right demeanor nor the words when interacting with them. Rohit & Agarkar much better guys to front up for the media.”\\n\\nGambhir’s responses during the press interaction appeared rushed and lacked the depth that the media and fans are accustomed to from senior players and officials. His answers to questions about players like KL Rahul and Shubman Gill were brief and did not generate much enthusiasm.\\n\\nGambhir’s Press Conference: More Misses Than Hits\\n\\nGambhir’s media appearances have raised eyebrows due to their brevity and lack of engagement. The coach’s recent press conference lasted just 20 minutes, with answers that seemed hurried and often unsatisfactory. For instance, when asked about the availability of Rohit Sharma for the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, Gambhir offered little clarity, stating that there was still no confirmation regarding the captain’s availability. He suggested that if Rohit is unavailable, either Abhimanyu Easwaran or KL Rahul would partner with Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top of the order, with Jasprit Bumrah stepping in as captain.\\n\\nOn the topic of the struggling duo, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Gambhir defended them, saying they are still “hungry for more achievements” despite their recent slump in form.\\n\\nGambhir Addresses Fallout Rumors\\n\\nAnother key topic during the press conference was the rumored fallout between Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma. Gambhir promptly dismissed the speculation, stating, “Rohit and I go along very well.” He added that the criticism of his leadership following India’s disappointing series against New Zealand was unfounded, referring to it as just another baseless rumor.\\n\\nGambhir’s Media Approach vs. Rohit and Agarkar\\n\\nWhile Gambhir has been in the spotlight for his coaching role, he has yet to demonstrate the same level of media engagement and leadership as figures like Rohit Sharma and Ajit Agarkar. Both have previously handled media briefings with confidence and clarity, especially when announcing key decisions, such as the squad for the 2023 Asia Cup.\\n\\nManjrekar’s suggestion that Gambhir should focus on his coaching duties within the team’s dressing room rather than fronting the media comes as part of an ongoing conversation about the evolving role of coaches and support staff in modern cricket. As the team prepares for the high-profile Test series in Australia, the spotlight remains on how Gambhir manages the squad off the field, with many questioning whether his media presence aligns with his leadership style.\\n\\nWhile Gambhir continues to serve as India’s head coach, his interactions with the media may need to be reassessed, especially if his responses continue to lack the depth and clarity expected from a key figure in Indian cricket. For now, it seems that the BCCI may choose to rely on Rohit Sharma and Ajit Agarkar to represent the team in front of the media, allowing Gambhir to focus on his coaching responsibilities behind closed doors.', 'summary': \"Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has called on the BCCI to reconsider Gautam Gambhir's role in media briefings after a recent press conference.\\n\\n\\nThe post Sanjay Manjrekar Urges BCCI To Keep Gambhir Away From The Media appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/sports/sanjay-manjrekar-urges-bcci-to-keep-gambhir-away-from-the-media/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gautham-Gambhir.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 11:37:43', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.206}]}, {'news': [{'id': 263972552, 'title': 'Vivek Ramaswamy Backs Trump’s Mass Deportation Plans, Calls US Legal Immigration System ‘Broke’', 'text': 'Washington: Vivek Ramaswamy, top Indian-American aid to President-elect Donald Trump , expressed his support for the mass deportation plan of illegal immigrants and said that the legal immigration system in the country is \"broken\".He said that those who broke the law while entering the United States have no right to stay here and they need to go.\"Do we have a broken legal immigration system?

Meanwhile, CBI is also conducting a parallel probe against Ghosh in the matter of the ghastly rape and murder of a lady junior doctor of R.G. Kar in August this year. In the financial irregularities case, the main charges against Ghosh are manipulation in the tendering process of R.G. Kar to award contracts or work-ordered to contractors of his confidence, getting the infrastructure-related work of the hospital done by private agencies against hefty commissions bypassing the state Public Works Department, smuggling of bio-medical wastes from the hospital and selling of organs of unidentified bodies coming to the hospital morgue for autopsy. Besides Ghosh, four others including his confidant Ashish Pandey are currently in judicial custody in connection with the financial irregularities case.

Regardless of our age, what we do, and where we are, we cannot deny the importance of staying physically active and striving toward a state of optimal health. The proclivity towards fitness however should be developed early. This is why sports must complement academics so that the former takes care of physical development while the latter offers mental and intellectual replenishment. Together they make a learner balanced, well-rounded, and more capable of handling the challenges that life may throw.\\nBy integrating sports with regular, conventional curricula, a school can introduce a plethora of multifaceted skills to learners. By participating in sports, young learners can understand the importance of discipline, the criticalities of teamwork, and the importance of working in collaboration to achieve specific goals. It is through sports that they imbibe the essence of leadership where they have specific and tangible goals to aspire to and specific results to obtain. Time management is another invaluable skill that is learned through sports where learners develop and enhance their productivity within a stipulated time frame. Needless to say, all these qualities are extremely pertinent for the personal and professional success of individuals.\\nThe combination of sports and academics is also very fruitful for the achievement of not just physical but mental health. Challenges faced by young people today are myriad and mental health problems have become a far too common malaise. Resilience is a skill that is non-negotiable today and indulging in sports allows young people to tap into their inner reservoir of strength, allowing them to resurface with renewed vigor after a setback.\\nSchools are where young learners spend the most part of their formative years. It is in schools that they should get the opportunity to explore the innumerable benefits of dabbling in sports. In addition to this, the schools also have the responsibility to nurture innate sports talent that could potentially bring laurels and glory to the nation.\\nIndian athletes and sportspersons have brought great plaudits to the nation and over the decades, sports infrastructure has grown exponentially. It is imperative to offer a variety of sports to students so that they can make organic choices about what resonates most with them.

Azad’s visionary efforts shaped India’s educational landscape, with milestones such as the establishment of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). While education in India has evolved over the decades, one area that remains underserved is financial literacy—a skill critical for navigating today’s complex world.\\n\\nThe Financial Literacy Crisis in India\\n\\nDespite the increasing importance of financial knowledge, a SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) study reveals that only 27% of Indians are financially literate. Basic financial skills—such as budgeting, saving, managing debt, and investing—are essential for ensuring long-term stability and success. Yet, many young adults enter the workforce without a solid understanding of how to manage their finances, which can lead to poor financial decisions, debt, and missed opportunities.\\n\\nIn an age of rising living costs, job uncertainties, and consumer-driven pressures, it is more critical than ever for students to gain the knowledge and tools to handle money wisely. By introducing financial education in schools and colleges, we can equip future generations to make informed financial decisions, secure their futures, and contribute to the country’s economic growth.\\n\\nWhy Financial Education Should Be Part of School Curricula\\n\\nSchools and colleges play a pivotal role in shaping students’ futures, not just academically but also financially. Incorporating financial education into the curriculum can empower students to take charge of their finances from an early age. Financial literacy helps young people:\\n\\nBuild good saving habits\\nPlan and budget effectively\\nInvest wisely for future growth\\nUnderstand the importance of managing debt responsibly\\n\\nAjay Lakhotia, Founder & CEO of StockGro, advocates for integrating experiential learning in schools and colleges. Modules on investments, compounding interest, and risk management—facilitated by industry experts—would provide hands-on experience and practical knowledge that students can apply in real life.\\n\\n“While existing curricula prepare students to earn a living, expanding it to include financial management and investment strategies will equip them to navigate real-world financial challenges,” Lakhotia explains.\\n\\nThe Growing Need for Financial Literacy\\n\\nThe world is becoming increasingly complex, with new financial products, digital payment systems, and investment opportunities emerging daily. Without a foundational understanding of how these systems work, students may struggle to manage their money effectively, especially as they transition to adulthood.\\n\\nFinancial education not only promotes personal security but also strengthens the economy by creating more informed, responsible citizens. As India becomes a global economic powerhouse, equipping students with financial knowledge will be key to fostering a generation that is financially resilient and capable of contributing to the nation’s growth.\\n\\nOne inspiring example of promoting financial literacy comes from Vidhi Miglani, a Class 12 student from DPS Kaithal, Haryana. She created DhanSarthi, a digital platform dedicated to educating women about personal finance. Vidhi’s initiative aims to empower women by making them financially literate, helping them make smarter financial choices and achieve financial independence.\\n\\nOn a different note, National Education Day also brings attention to the powerful legacy of Justice Hans Raj Khanna, whose courage and dissent during the Emergency period in India inspired generations. Born in 1912, Justice Khanna’s dissenting judgment in the landmark ADM Jabalpur case (1976) upheld the rights to personal liberty during a time when many others chose to comply with government pressures.\\n\\nJustice Khanna’s principled stand cost him the position of Chief Justice of India in 1977, despite being next in line. His sacrifice, however, cemented his place as a symbol of integrity and courage, inspiring his nephew, Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna. This story of defiance and honor serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for one’s principles, a lesson that should be imparted to students as part of their holistic education.\\n\\nAs India celebrates National Education Day, it is crucial to recognize that financial literacy should be a priority in schools and colleges. With financial challenges becoming more prevalent in today’s society, giving students the tools to understand and manage money is vital for their personal growth and the prosperity of the nation. By embedding financial education in the curriculum, we can ensure that future generations are not just academically proficient but also financially empowered to lead successful and secure lives.', 'summary': \"India celebrates National Education Day on November 11 to honor the birth anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the country's first education minister.\\n\\n\\nThe post National Education Day: Why Financial Education is Critical For Students appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/education-and-jobs/national-education-day-why-financial-education-is-critical-for-students/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NATIONAL-EDUCATION-DAY.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 10:43:46', 'author': 'Kanika Sharma', 'authors': ['Kanika Sharma'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.511}]}, {'news': [{'id': 263970686, 'title': 'US Shooting: 1 Killed, 16 Injured During Homecoming Celebration at Tuskegee University in Alabama', 'text': 'Atlanta: A shooting early Sunday that marred homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama left one person dead and left 16 others injured, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said.

It set up a site online for people to upload video.Tuskegee University announced that classes Monday have been cancelled. Grief counselors will be available to help students in the university\\'s chapel.The parents of the victim were notified, and several of the injured were being treated at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery, the university said in a statement.An autopsy on the 18-year-old was planned at the state\\'s forensic center in Montgomery, Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley told The Associated Press on Sunday.Tuskegee city\\'s police chief, Patrick Mardis, said the injured included a female student who was shot in the stomach and a male student who was shot in the arm.City police were responding to an unrelated double shooting off campus when officers got the call about the university shooting at the West Commons on-campus apartments, Mardis said.“Some idiots started shooting,” Mardis told the news site Al.com. “You couldn\\'t get the emergency vehicles in there, there were so many people there.” A person who answered the phone at the office of Tuskegee\\'s police chief said no other information was available.“Special Agents are still in the process of gathering and examining information relative to the sequence of events which ultimately led to the shooting,” the state law enforcement agency said in a statement.In his 37 years as coroner, Bentley said he couldn\\'t recall any shootings during the school\\'s past homecoming celebrations. The mood around the small town of around 9,000 people was somber, he said.The shooting left everyone in the university community shaken, said Amare\\' Hardee, a senior from Tallahassee, Florida, who is president of the student government association.“This senseless act of violence has touched each of us, whether directly or indirectly,” he said at the school\\'s homecoming convocation Sunday morning.A pastor who leads the Tuskegee National Alumni Association told those at Sunday\\'s convocation service that the shooting is a reminder of the fragility of life.“It is in moments like these that we need to be reminded not to stand on our own understanding because in a moment like this, I don\\'t have understanding,” said the Rev. James Quincy III.“I can only rely on my faith, and my prayer for our entire family, this community, as we close out this marvelous family reunion that we shared this week,\" Quincy said, \"and most importantly because of that faith walk and that trust in God, that we have resilience, resilience in the time of trouble.” Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama — the school\\'s opponent for Tuskegee\\'s homecoming football game on Saturday — released a statement expressing sympathy.“Today, our hearts are with the Tuskegee family as they face the tragic aftermath of the recent shooting on campus,” the college said. “We extend our deepest condolences to those impacted and pray for healing and justice. Miles College stands with you in this difficult time.” Sunday\\'s shooting comes just over a year after four people were injured in a shooting at a Tuskegee University student housing complex. In that shooting, two visitors to the campus were shot and two students were hurt while trying to leave the scene of what campus officials described as an “unauthorized party” in September 2023, the Montgomery Advertiser reported.About 3,000 students are enrolled at the university about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Alabama\\'s capital city of Montgomery.The university was the first historically Black college to be designated as a Registered National Landmark in 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Site in 1974, according to the school\\'s website.Norma Clayton, chairwoman of the board of the trustees, said at the Sunday morning service that “we will get through this together because in tough times, tough people band together and they survive.\" (Except the headline, this story is not edited by Republic and is published from a syndicated feed)', 'summary': 'US Shooting: 1 Killed, 16 Injured During Homecoming Celebration at Tuskegee University in Alabama', 'url': 'https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-shooting-1-killed-16-injured-during-homecoming-celebration-at-tuskegee-university-in-alabama', 'image': 'https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/tuskegee-university-shooting-1731288281493-9_16.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 01:24:50', 'author': 'Associated Press Television News', 'authors': ['Associated Press Television News'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.571}, {'id': 263981812, 'title': 'US: 1 killed, 16 injured in Alabama campus shooting', 'text': 'Houston, Nov 11 (IANS) At least one person was killed and 16 others, including students, injured in a shooting on the campus of Tuskegee University in the southern US state of Alabama, authorities said.\\n\\nAccording to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency’s State Bureau of Investigation, an 18-year-old died at the scene, while twelve of the injured sustained gunshot wounds, Xinhua news agency reported.\\n\\nAccording to a statement from the university, the fatal victim was not a student at the university. “Several others including Tuskegee University students were injured and are receiving treatment at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery.”\\n\\nTuskegee celebrated its 100th homecoming on Saturday when a football game between Tuskegee and Alabama’s Miles College, were winding down, officials said.\\n\\nAccording to an ABC News report, authorities suspect multiple shooters were involved. “There’s going to be two shooters at this time, maybe more,” one officer said in a radio call, according to transmissions provided by Broadcastify.

A leading US media publication reported late Sunday that Trump had dialled Putin from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in what was his first call to the Russian leader following the decisive electoral victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. The report mentioned that Trump had urged Putin to avoid any escalation in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It also added that, during the conversation, Trump expressed an interest in fostering further discussions with Moscow to de-escalate tensions and resolve the war that began in February 2022. The report detailed that Trump highlighted the significance of the substantial US military presence in Europe, suggesting that he intends to bring American influence to bear on the resolution of the Ukraine conflict. It is to be recalled that the Republican leader had made \"ending the war\" a key promise during his election campaign.

He further said, “We are investigating the matter and have also called a team of doctors and a bomb squad team from Raipur.”The forest official conveyed that the forest department received information about the scattered blood in the elephant roaming zone and upon thorough investigation, it was found that an elephant calf was injured in the suspected potash bomb explosion. He added that potash bomb is used by poachers for hunting pigs and leopards but it is a subject of investigation whether they were being used for elephants or not. He also informed that a reward of Rs 10,000 has been set for the poachers. Varun Jain said, “We are also investigating about poachers. We have set a reward of Rs 10,000 for giving information about the poachers. Potash bombs are used by poachers to hunt of animals such as pigs and leopards. We are investigating whether they used the bomb for elephants or other animals. We will investigate more about the injury through drone cameras and then further medical procedures will be taken.

Cancelled orders will now be made available to customers in the vicinity, who can purchase them at a significantly reduced price.

Restaurant partners will continue to receive compensation for the original cancelled order, plus a portion of the amount paid by the new customer if the order is claimed. Most restaurants have opted in for this feature, and can opt out of it easily whenever they want, directly from their control panels. According to Zomato, 99.9 per cent of its restaurant partners want to be a part of this initiative. Delivery partners will also be compensated fully for the entire trip, from the initial pickup to the final drop-off at the new customer's location. This feature could potentially boost the app's usage and user retention, as people are likely to be scouring through the app, waiting for a cancelled order to pop up. Zomato's new feature is being scaled for a larger rollout across all cities. The company reported an average of 498,000 active delivery partners monthly in the last quarter, underscoring the scale of its delivery network and the potential reach of this initiative.

As Chief Justice, he will head the Supreme Court, presiding over cases of national importance, and will be responsible for overseeing judicial reforms and ensuring the rule of law in India.\\n\\nProfile of Justice Sanjiv Khanna\\n\\nJustice Sanjiv Khanna has been serving as a judge of the Supreme Court since January 18, 2019. His judicial career is distinguished by a range of significant roles, including his recent position as the chairman of the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee from June 17, 2023, to December 25, 2023.

The story of the elder Justice Khanna continues to resonate as activists and citizens booked under draconian laws struggle for bail.\\n\\nChief Justice Khanna, in his decision to grant former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal interim bail, had termed personal liberty a sacrosanct right upon finding that the latter had been incarcerated for over 90 days in the liquor policy case.\\n\\nJustice Khanna (as he was then) had also asked a larger Bench to decide bail conditions that could be applied in cases similar to Kejriwal’s, when a sitting Chief Minister, in an unprecedented move by the Central agencies, was arrested and remanded on money-laundering charges.\\n\\nAnother notable judgment of Justice Khanna, who had sat in over 450 Benches in the apex court, was his verdict giving the thumbs-up to EVMs while declining to revive paper ballots.\\n\\nJustice Khanna, in that judgment, had favoured maintaining balance and criticised the tendency to blindly trust institutions and systems, saying such an attitude would only breed “unwarranted scepticism and impede progress”.\\n\\nRecently Justice Khanna made a point while hearing petitions challenging the inclusion of ‘secularism’ and ‘socialism’ in the Preamble through the 42nd Amendment. He had observed that secularism was always a part of the Constitution and an ingredient of its basic structure.\\n\\nIn the past five years as Supreme Court judge, Justice Khanna’s experience on the Bench was varied. He was part of the Bench headed by Chief Justice Gogoi which heard on April 20, 2019, sexual harassment allegations levelled by a former Supreme Court staffer against the Chief Justice. His court refused to intervene in a case against the elevation of Madras High Court judge, Justice Lekshmana Chandra Victoria Gowri.\\n\\nChief Justice Khanna, who has a six-month tenure, would face challenges like high pendency in the top court, the increasing use of technology to guide its day-to-day functioning and timely judicial appointments.\\n\\nThe Khanna Collegium would have two immediate vacancies to fill in the Supreme Court. It would be seen if he would replace Justice Hima Kohli, who retired recently, with another woman judge. The Collegium would have to fill the vacancy left by Justice DY Chandrachud too. Two more judges, Justices Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar, will be retiring in January 2025.\\n\\nIt is to be seen if Chief Justice Khanna would constitute Constitution Benches to hear seminal issues like the government’s use of the Money Bill route to pass contentious amendments in laws like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in Parliament.\\n\\nAnother reference, triggered from the Sabarimala temple entry for women case, on the question of whether certain essential religious practices of various religious faiths should be constitutionally protected has been pending for a long. The case requires an answer on the contours of judicial review in ecumenical issues. The case was referred to a nine-judge Bench in 2018.\\n\\nAs Chief Justice and master of roster, Chief Justice Khanna would have to allocate cases, including sensitive ones dealing with urgent pleas for bail, to individual Benches of the court. The allocation of cases and choice of Benches have seen consistent criticism through the tenures of past Chief Justices.\\n\\nChief Justice Khanna’s legal practice began in the hard-boiled atmosphere of the district courts of the national capital in 1983 after he read law at Delhi University. He has handled cases across various fields, including constitutional, direct taxation, arbitration, commercial, company, land and environmental laws in the Delhi High Court.\\n\\nAs a lawyer, he was a senior standing Counsel for the Income Tax Department and the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

Yogeshwar did not go to JD(S) because kalia (the black man) Kumaraswamy is worse than BJP. After going with BJP, Mr Kumaraswamy is planning to buy Muslim votes. Instead, Muslims will pool money and buy your (Mr. Kumaraswamy’s) family.” \\n\\nPlaying a purported audio clip in which a man says he would not seek votes from Muslims, the Housing Minister asked the crowd, “Who is saying this? The kala (black) Kumaraswamy.”\\n\\nMr. Khan’s cabinet colleague Raheem Khan, former Bengaluru MP D.K. Suresh and Mr. Yogeshwar were by his side when he was addressing the rally at Channapatna. \\n\\nIn the past too, Mr. Khan has made remarks on the colour and appearance of Mr. Kumaraswamy.\\n\\nUnion Minister Kiren Rijju took to social media platform ‘X’ to condemn Mr. Khan’s statement. “I strongly deplore Congress Minister Zameer Ahmed calling Union Minister and former Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Kumaraswamy as ‘kalia Kumaraswamy’. This is a racist remark, same as Rahul Gandhi’s advisor calling South Indian looks as African, North East as Chinese and North Indians as Arabs.” \\n\\nBJP veteran B.S. Yediyurappa also expressed dissatisfaction with the remark.\\n\\nThe JD(S) reminded Mr. Khan that the family of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda had ensured his political growth. “The arrogance of money and power will not stay too long. Your comment on skin colour shows your dirty mindset,” the JD(S) posted on social media. \\n\\nListing out Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Cabinet ministers H.C. Mahadevappa, Satish Jharkiholi, Priyank Kharge, Raheem Khan, K.J. George and K.H. Muniyappa, the JD(S) asked: “What skin colour do they all have?

The controversial remark was given on Sunday during a rally held at Ramanagara when Khan attacked union minister HD Kumaraswamy and his relations with the party.\\n\\nSpeaking at a rally, speaking about the Channapatna assembly bypoll and the changing political allegiances of C.P. Yogeeshwara, the local Congress candidate, Khan said that Yogeeshwara who contested as an independent, had no other option but to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The minister went on to mention Kumaraswamy in offending terms, calling him “Kaaliya Kumaraswamy,” saying he was “more dangerous than the BJP”.\\n\\nKhan’s comments invited immediate criticism as he believed Yogeeshwara did not wish to join Kumaraswamy’s Janata Dal-Secular (JD(S)) as the latter former Chief Minister adorned himself. Now, Yogeeshwara returned to Congress which was his home. The rally was part of the bypoll campaign for Channapatna, where Nikhil Kumaraswamy, the son of HD Kumaraswamy, would face Yogeeshwara in a direct contest as the latter represented the NDA candidate to contest JD(S) candidate.\\n\\nJD(S) And BJP React To The Statement\\n\\nNo one expected that this statement will go without response, as the Janata Dal-Secular (JD(S)) immediately rebuked the comment attributed with racial overtones. The party, through X, which is the former Twitter, issued a statement blaming Khan for having a wrong attitude towards people of darker skin colors. JD(S) officials have now asked him to apologize publicly and directed action against him forthwith.\\n\\nThe party countered that most of the top leaders in the Congress party also had darker complexions, including Mallikarjun Kharge, H.C. Mahadevappa, and Satish Jarakiholi. JD(S) went on to say that such comments should never be part of the political debate and sought Khan’s ouster from the Congress party and from the state cabinet.\\n\\nThe nation vehemently condemns the disgraceful and racially charged remarks by Zameer Ahmed against HD Kumaraswamy. This kind of hateful language marks a new low in political discourse and has no place in a civilized society. We demand accountability from leaders who choose… https://t.co/teH4kZbzmN\\n— Janata Dal Secular (@JanataDal_S) November 11, 2024\\n\\nIt was the comment that drew attention from the BJP top leaders, many of whom condemned the ex-minister for taking sides with Kumaraswamy. It reminded one of another similar event in May when Indian Overseas Congress chief Sam Pitroda made commotion over remarks on racial characteristics of Indians from different communities. Union Minister Kiren Rijiju writes in support for Kumaraswamy, calling the Khan statement “a racist remark,” drawing parallels with Pitroda’s earlier statements about South Indians, North East Indians, and North Indians.\\n\\nBJP’s further reaction to the controversy fueled even more controversy, and several BJP members openly disapproved the statement from Khan. BJP leaders Kiren Rijiju also told media that such remarks have no place in Indian politics and were capable of dividing the nation and damaging national unity.\\n\\nCongress Leader Demands Action\\n\\nTo this controversy, senior Congress leader Priyank Kharge, who is the son of Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, appealed to all politicians and citizens to mind their words so as not to refer to people based on their color. He said such acts are contradictory to the inclusive nature for which the party stands for.

You have always taken my words as your own responsibility and worked wholeheartedly to fulfil them. Recently, I had made an appeal, “Ek Ped Maa ke Naam.” Under this campaign, the Swaminarayan community has planted more than 1,00,000 trees,” he said.Shree Swaminarayan Mandir in Vadtal has been influencing the social and spiritual life of people for many decades.The temple in Vadtal, also known as Vadtal Swaminarayan.

He (Sharad Pawar) will not like Supriya Sule’s defeat at this age. So you did correct. We accepted it,” says Ajit Pawar during his poll rallies.\\n\\nHe however, tells the voters that they would have to vote for him now to increase the pace of Baramati’s development as it would be possible with the Mahayuti government in Maharashtra and the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.\\n\\n“Baramatikars are in two minds. I request them that as they have cast their votes for Supriya Sule in the Lok Sabha, now it’s time to vote for me in the Assembly elections. I have carried out a maximum number of projects in Baramati during my political career. During that time many people had started working with me. Keep aside disputes and differences among villages for a moment and vote for me,” said Ajit Pawar during his interaction with Baramatikars on Monday.\\n\\nHe also made similar appeals during his recent village-level meetings in Baramati constituency.\\n\\n“You voted for Supriya Sule in the Lok Sabha elections to make Sharad Pawar happy. Now support me by casting your votes to make me happy,” said Ajit Pawar.\\n\\nHe claimed that the Mahayuti comprising BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP will win more than 175 seats in the 288-member state Assembly.\\n\\n“The Mahayuti leaders and cadres belonging to the respective allies are working hard for victory. Moreover, Mahayuti leaders are holding rallies across Maharashtra,” he said.\\n\\nAjit Pawar, who during his budget launched a slew of welfare and development schemes worth Rs 1 lakh crore, slammed the Opposition for allegedly setting a fake narrative in the Lok Sabha polls that hit the Mahayuti but claimed that it won’t work during the Assembly elections as the Mahayuti government’s schemes have received an overwhelming response from the people of the state.\\n\\nHe took a dig at the Opposition saying, “The Opposition criticised our schemes and now all over schemes appear in their manifesto. They were asking us where we will get the money for these schemes, now they should answer from where will the Maha Vikas Aghadi get the money.”\\n\\n“The Maha Vikas Aghadi is misleading the people. They will not come to power, so they are trying to get people’s votes by making whatever announcements they want,” he said.\\n\\nCommenting on the present state of onion and sugarcane farmers, Ajit Pawar said, “Earlier onion farmers did not get good prices due to the export ban. This impacted us in the Lok Sabha elections. I requested the Centre and today onion farmers are getting good prices.

Gambhir, who is serving as the head coach for India’s upcoming tour to Australia, answered questions about the team and its preparations but came under scrutiny for the lack of depth and clarity in his responses. Manjrekar expressed concerns over Gambhir’s demeanor and suggested that his role should be confined to behind-the-scenes duties, with others like Rohit Sharma and Ajit Agarkar better suited for fronting the media.\\n\\nManjrekar’s Feedback on Gambhir’s Performance\\n\\nManjrekar, who has been an active broadcaster, commented on Gambhir’s recent press conference, calling it “bland” and lacking the sharpness that fans might have expected from the former cricketer. In his post on X (formerly Twitter), Manjrekar said, “Just watched Gambhir in the press conference. Maybe wise for BCCI to keep him away from such duties, let him work behind the scenes. He does not have the right demeanor nor the words when interacting with them. Rohit & Agarkar much better guys to front up for the media.”\\n\\nGambhir’s responses during the press interaction appeared rushed and lacked the depth that the media and fans are accustomed to from senior players and officials. His answers to questions about players like KL Rahul and Shubman Gill were brief and did not generate much enthusiasm.\\n\\nGambhir’s Press Conference: More Misses Than Hits\\n\\nGambhir’s media appearances have raised eyebrows due to their brevity and lack of engagement. The coach’s recent press conference lasted just 20 minutes, with answers that seemed hurried and often unsatisfactory. For instance, when asked about the availability of Rohit Sharma for the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, Gambhir offered little clarity, stating that there was still no confirmation regarding the captain’s availability. He suggested that if Rohit is unavailable, either Abhimanyu Easwaran or KL Rahul would partner with Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top of the order, with Jasprit Bumrah stepping in as captain.\\n\\nOn the topic of the struggling duo, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Gambhir defended them, saying they are still “hungry for more achievements” despite their recent slump in form.\\n\\nGambhir Addresses Fallout Rumors\\n\\nAnother key topic during the press conference was the rumored fallout between Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma. Gambhir promptly dismissed the speculation, stating, “Rohit and I go along very well.” He added that the criticism of his leadership following India’s disappointing series against New Zealand was unfounded, referring to it as just another baseless rumor.\\n\\nGambhir’s Media Approach vs. Rohit and Agarkar\\n\\nWhile Gambhir has been in the spotlight for his coaching role, he has yet to demonstrate the same level of media engagement and leadership as figures like Rohit Sharma and Ajit Agarkar. Both have previously handled media briefings with confidence and clarity, especially when announcing key decisions, such as the squad for the 2023 Asia Cup.\\n\\nManjrekar’s suggestion that Gambhir should focus on his coaching duties within the team’s dressing room rather than fronting the media comes as part of an ongoing conversation about the evolving role of coaches and support staff in modern cricket. As the team prepares for the high-profile Test series in Australia, the spotlight remains on how Gambhir manages the squad off the field, with many questioning whether his media presence aligns with his leadership style.\\n\\nWhile Gambhir continues to serve as India’s head coach, his interactions with the media may need to be reassessed, especially if his responses continue to lack the depth and clarity expected from a key figure in Indian cricket. For now, it seems that the BCCI may choose to rely on Rohit Sharma and Ajit Agarkar to represent the team in front of the media, allowing Gambhir to focus on his coaching responsibilities behind closed doors.', 'summary': \"Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has called on the BCCI to reconsider Gautam Gambhir's role in media briefings after a recent press conference.\\n\\n\\nThe post Sanjay Manjrekar Urges BCCI To Keep Gambhir Away From The Media appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/sports/sanjay-manjrekar-urges-bcci-to-keep-gambhir-away-from-the-media/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gautham-Gambhir.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 11:37:43', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.206}, {'id': 263972552, 'title': 'Vivek Ramaswamy Backs Trump’s Mass Deportation Plans, Calls US Legal Immigration System ‘Broke’', 'text': 'Washington: Vivek Ramaswamy, top Indian-American aid to President-elect Donald Trump , expressed his support for the mass deportation plan of illegal immigrants and said that the legal immigration system in the country is \"broken\".He said that those who broke the law while entering the United States have no right to stay here and they need to go.\"Do we have a broken legal immigration system?

He only wants to cooperate with Ishiba’s party on policy — not as part of a coalition — since he wants to use his leverage to increase his party’s standing ahead of the next election.Tamaki was recently stung by a magazine article exposing an extramarital affair, which he admitted to on Monday, adding to political uncertainty.Ishiba’s government is preparing for his trip later this month to Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits, as well as a possible meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his way home.\", 'summary': 'Japan&#39;s Parliament Reelects Struggling Leader Ishiba as Prime Minister', 'url': 'https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/japan-s-parliament-reelects-struggling-leader-ishiba-as-prime-minister', 'image': 'https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/japan-s-parliament-reelects-struggling-leader-ishiba-as-prime-minister-1731315744300-9_16.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 09:02:42', 'author': 'Associated Press Television News', 'authors': ['Associated Press Television News'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.294}, {'id': 264040010, 'title': 'Japan’s Parliament reelects struggling\\xa0 leader Ishiba as prime minister', 'text': 'TOKYO, Nov 11:\\n\\nJapan’s Parliament reelected Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday after his governing coalition suffered the worst election loss in more than a decade, forcing the struggling leader to form his second Cabinet in just over a month since taking office.\\n\\n Ishiba’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost their majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-house parliament, in the Oct 27 election due to continued voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party and its lukewarm response.\\n\\nA special parliamentary session convened Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election.

Meanwhile, CBI is also conducting a parallel probe against Ghosh in the matter of the ghastly rape and murder of a lady junior doctor of R.G. Kar in August this year. In the financial irregularities case, the main charges against Ghosh are manipulation in the tendering process of R.G. Kar to award contracts or work-ordered to contractors of his confidence, getting the infrastructure-related work of the hospital done by private agencies against hefty commissions bypassing the state Public Works Department, smuggling of bio-medical wastes from the hospital and selling of organs of unidentified bodies coming to the hospital morgue for autopsy. Besides Ghosh, four others including his confidant Ashish Pandey are currently in judicial custody in connection with the financial irregularities case.

Regardless of our age, what we do, and where we are, we cannot deny the importance of staying physically active and striving toward a state of optimal health. The proclivity towards fitness however should be developed early. This is why sports must complement academics so that the former takes care of physical development while the latter offers mental and intellectual replenishment. Together they make a learner balanced, well-rounded, and more capable of handling the challenges that life may throw.\\nBy integrating sports with regular, conventional curricula, a school can introduce a plethora of multifaceted skills to learners. By participating in sports, young learners can understand the importance of discipline, the criticalities of teamwork, and the importance of working in collaboration to achieve specific goals. It is through sports that they imbibe the essence of leadership where they have specific and tangible goals to aspire to and specific results to obtain. Time management is another invaluable skill that is learned through sports where learners develop and enhance their productivity within a stipulated time frame. Needless to say, all these qualities are extremely pertinent for the personal and professional success of individuals.\\nThe combination of sports and academics is also very fruitful for the achievement of not just physical but mental health. Challenges faced by young people today are myriad and mental health problems have become a far too common malaise. Resilience is a skill that is non-negotiable today and indulging in sports allows young people to tap into their inner reservoir of strength, allowing them to resurface with renewed vigor after a setback.\\nSchools are where young learners spend the most part of their formative years. It is in schools that they should get the opportunity to explore the innumerable benefits of dabbling in sports. In addition to this, the schools also have the responsibility to nurture innate sports talent that could potentially bring laurels and glory to the nation.\\nIndian athletes and sportspersons have brought great plaudits to the nation and over the decades, sports infrastructure has grown exponentially.

Azad’s visionary efforts shaped India’s educational landscape, with milestones such as the establishment of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). While education in India has evolved over the decades, one area that remains underserved is financial literacy—a skill critical for navigating today’s complex world.\\n\\nThe Financial Literacy Crisis in India\\n\\nDespite the increasing importance of financial knowledge, a SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) study reveals that only 27% of Indians are financially literate. Basic financial skills—such as budgeting, saving, managing debt, and investing—are essential for ensuring long-term stability and success. Yet, many young adults enter the workforce without a solid understanding of how to manage their finances, which can lead to poor financial decisions, debt, and missed opportunities.\\n\\nIn an age of rising living costs, job uncertainties, and consumer-driven pressures, it is more critical than ever for students to gain the knowledge and tools to handle money wisely. By introducing financial education in schools and colleges, we can equip future generations to make informed financial decisions, secure their futures, and contribute to the country’s economic growth.\\n\\nWhy Financial Education Should Be Part of School Curricula\\n\\nSchools and colleges play a pivotal role in shaping students’ futures, not just academically but also financially. Incorporating financial education into the curriculum can empower students to take charge of their finances from an early age. Financial literacy helps young people:\\n\\nBuild good saving habits\\nPlan and budget effectively\\nInvest wisely for future growth\\nUnderstand the importance of managing debt responsibly\\n\\nAjay Lakhotia, Founder & CEO of StockGro, advocates for integrating experiential learning in schools and colleges. Modules on investments, compounding interest, and risk management—facilitated by industry experts—would provide hands-on experience and practical knowledge that students can apply in real life.\\n\\n“While existing curricula prepare students to earn a living, expanding it to include financial management and investment strategies will equip them to navigate real-world financial challenges,” Lakhotia explains.\\n\\nThe Growing Need for Financial Literacy\\n\\nThe world is becoming increasingly complex, with new financial products, digital payment systems, and investment opportunities emerging daily. Without a foundational understanding of how these systems work, students may struggle to manage their money effectively, especially as they transition to adulthood.\\n\\nFinancial education not only promotes personal security but also strengthens the economy by creating more informed, responsible citizens. As India becomes a global economic powerhouse, equipping students with financial knowledge will be key to fostering a generation that is financially resilient and capable of contributing to the nation’s growth.\\n\\nOne inspiring example of promoting financial literacy comes from Vidhi Miglani, a Class 12 student from DPS Kaithal, Haryana. She created DhanSarthi, a digital platform dedicated to educating women about personal finance. Vidhi’s initiative aims to empower women by making them financially literate, helping them make smarter financial choices and achieve financial independence.\\n\\nOn a different note, National Education Day also brings attention to the powerful legacy of Justice Hans Raj Khanna, whose courage and dissent during the Emergency period in India inspired generations. Born in 1912, Justice Khanna’s dissenting judgment in the landmark ADM Jabalpur case (1976) upheld the rights to personal liberty during a time when many others chose to comply with government pressures.\\n\\nJustice Khanna’s principled stand cost him the position of Chief Justice of India in 1977, despite being next in line. His sacrifice, however, cemented his place as a symbol of integrity and courage, inspiring his nephew, Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna. This story of defiance and honor serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for one’s principles, a lesson that should be imparted to students as part of their holistic education.\\n\\nAs India celebrates National Education Day, it is crucial to recognize that financial literacy should be a priority in schools and colleges. With financial challenges becoming more prevalent in today’s society, giving students the tools to understand and manage money is vital for their personal growth and the prosperity of the nation. By embedding financial education in the curriculum, we can ensure that future generations are not just academically proficient but also financially empowered to lead successful and secure lives.', 'summary': \"India celebrates National Education Day on November 11 to honor the birth anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the country's first education minister.\\n\\n\\nThe post National Education Day: Why Financial Education is Critical For Students appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/education-and-jobs/national-education-day-why-financial-education-is-critical-for-students/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NATIONAL-EDUCATION-DAY.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 10:43:46', 'author': 'Kanika Sharma', 'authors': ['Kanika Sharma'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.511}, {'id': 263970686, 'title': 'US Shooting: 1 Killed, 16 Injured During Homecoming Celebration at Tuskegee University in Alabama', 'text': 'Atlanta: A shooting early Sunday that marred homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama left one person dead and left 16 others injured, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said.

Grief counselors will be available to help students in the university\\'s chapel.The parents of the victim were notified, and several of the injured were being treated at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery, the university said in a statement.An autopsy on the 18-year-old was planned at the state\\'s forensic center in Montgomery, Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley told The Associated Press on Sunday.Tuskegee city\\'s police chief, Patrick Mardis, said the injured included a female student who was shot in the stomach and a male student who was shot in the arm.City police were responding to an unrelated double shooting off campus when officers got the call about the university shooting at the West Commons on-campus apartments, Mardis said.“Some idiots started shooting,” Mardis told the news site Al.com. “You couldn\\'t get the emergency vehicles in there, there were so many people there.” A person who answered the phone at the office of Tuskegee\\'s police chief said no other information was available.“Special Agents are still in the process of gathering and examining information relative to the sequence of events which ultimately led to the shooting,” the state law enforcement agency said in a statement.In his 37 years as coroner, Bentley said he couldn\\'t recall any shootings during the school\\'s past homecoming celebrations. The mood around the small town of around 9,000 people was somber, he said.The shooting left everyone in the university community shaken, said Amare\\' Hardee, a senior from Tallahassee, Florida, who is president of the student government association.“This senseless act of violence has touched each of us, whether directly or indirectly,” he said at the school\\'s homecoming convocation Sunday morning.A pastor who leads the Tuskegee National Alumni Association told those at Sunday\\'s convocation service that the shooting is a reminder of the fragility of life.“It is in moments like these that we need to be reminded not to stand on our own understanding because in a moment like this, I don\\'t have understanding,” said the Rev. James Quincy III.“I can only rely on my faith, and my prayer for our entire family, this community, as we close out this marvelous family reunion that we shared this week,\" Quincy said, \"and most importantly because of that faith walk and that trust in God, that we have resilience, resilience in the time of trouble.” Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama — the school\\'s opponent for Tuskegee\\'s homecoming football game on Saturday — released a statement expressing sympathy.“Today, our hearts are with the Tuskegee family as they face the tragic aftermath of the recent shooting on campus,” the college said. “We extend our deepest condolences to those impacted and pray for healing and justice. Miles College stands with you in this difficult time.” Sunday\\'s shooting comes just over a year after four people were injured in a shooting at a Tuskegee University student housing complex. In that shooting, two visitors to the campus were shot and two students were hurt while trying to leave the scene of what campus officials described as an “unauthorized party” in September 2023, the Montgomery Advertiser reported.About 3,000 students are enrolled at the university about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Alabama\\'s capital city of Montgomery.The university was the first historically Black college to be designated as a Registered National Landmark in 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Site in 1974, according to the school\\'s website.Norma Clayton, chairwoman of the board of the trustees, said at the Sunday morning service that “we will get through this together because in tough times, tough people band together and they survive.\" (Except the headline, this story is not edited by Republic and is published from a syndicated feed)', 'summary': 'US Shooting: 1 Killed, 16 Injured During Homecoming Celebration at Tuskegee University in Alabama', 'url': 'https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-shooting-1-killed-16-injured-during-homecoming-celebration-at-tuskegee-university-in-alabama', 'image': 'https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/tuskegee-university-shooting-1731288281493-9_16.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 01:24:50', 'author': 'Associated Press Television News', 'authors': ['Associated Press Television News'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.571}, {'id': 263981812, 'title': 'US: 1 killed, 16 injured in Alabama campus shooting', 'text': 'Houston, Nov 11 (IANS) At least one person was killed and 16 others, including students, injured in a shooting on the campus of Tuskegee University in the southern US state of Alabama, authorities said.\\n\\nAccording to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency’s State Bureau of Investigation, an 18-year-old died at the scene, while twelve of the injured sustained gunshot wounds, Xinhua news agency reported.\\n\\nAccording to a statement from the university, the fatal victim was not a student at the university. “Several others including Tuskegee University students were injured and are receiving treatment at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery.”\\n\\nTuskegee celebrated its 100th homecoming on Saturday when a football game between Tuskegee and Alabama’s Miles College, were winding down, officials said.\\n\\nAccording to an ABC News report, authorities suspect multiple shooters were involved. “There’s going to be two shooters at this time, maybe more,” one officer said in a radio call, according to transmissions provided by Broadcastify.

A leading US media publication reported late Sunday that Trump had dialled Putin from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in what was his first call to the Russian leader following the decisive electoral victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. The report mentioned that Trump had urged Putin to avoid any escalation in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It also added that, during the conversation, Trump expressed an interest in fostering further discussions with Moscow to de-escalate tensions and resolve the war that began in February 2022. The report detailed that Trump highlighted the significance of the substantial US military presence in Europe, suggesting that he intends to bring American influence to bear on the resolution of the Ukraine conflict. It is to be recalled that the Republican leader had made \"ending the war\" a key promise during his election campaign.

He further said, “We are investigating the matter and have also called a team of doctors and a bomb squad team from Raipur.”The forest official conveyed that the forest department received information about the scattered blood in the elephant roaming zone and upon thorough investigation, it was found that an elephant calf was injured in the suspected potash bomb explosion. He added that potash bomb is used by poachers for hunting pigs and leopards but it is a subject of investigation whether they were being used for elephants or not. He also informed that a reward of Rs 10,000 has been set for the poachers. Varun Jain said, “We are also investigating about poachers. We have set a reward of Rs 10,000 for giving information about the poachers. Potash bombs are used by poachers to hunt of animals such as pigs and leopards. We are investigating whether they used the bomb for elephants or other animals. We will investigate more about the injury through drone cameras and then further medical procedures will be taken.

This much-needed feature was announced by CEO Deepinder Goyal on Sunday.

In connection with the “Food Rescue” model, restaurant partners will not only receive the full compensation for the cancelled order but also get revenue-sharing from the purchase of the new customer. Restaurants can also exit the program if they so wish.\\n\\nTo ensure just the treatment of delivery partners, Zomato will fully compensate them for the entire trip- picking orders from their original customers till dropping them to new customers.

Cancelled orders will now be made available to customers in the vicinity, who can purchase them at a significantly reduced price.

Restaurant partners will continue to receive compensation for the original cancelled order, plus a portion of the amount paid by the new customer if the order is claimed. Most restaurants have opted in for this feature, and can opt out of it easily whenever they want, directly from their control panels. According to Zomato, 99.9 per cent of its restaurant partners want to be a part of this initiative. Delivery partners will also be compensated fully for the entire trip, from the initial pickup to the final drop-off at the new customer's location. This feature could potentially boost the app's usage and user retention, as people are likely to be scouring through the app, waiting for a cancelled order to pop up. Zomato's new feature is being scaled for a larger rollout across all cities. The company reported an average of 498,000 active delivery partners monthly in the last quarter, underscoring the scale of its delivery network and the potential reach of this initiative. In a related development, Deepinder Goyal offered a job to a Bengaluru-based Product Manager after his suggestions for Zomato's Food Rescue.

Regardless of our age, what we do, and where we are, we cannot deny the importance of staying physically active and striving toward a state of optimal health. The proclivity towards fitness however should be developed early. This is why sports must complement academics so that the former takes care of physical development while the latter offers mental and intellectual replenishment. Together they make a learner balanced, well-rounded, and more capable of handling the challenges that life may throw.\\nBy integrating sports with regular, conventional curricula, a school can introduce a plethora of multifaceted skills to learners. By participating in sports, young learners can understand the importance of discipline, the criticalities of teamwork, and the importance of working in collaboration to achieve specific goals. It is through sports that they imbibe the essence of leadership where they have specific and tangible goals to aspire to and specific results to obtain. Time management is another invaluable skill that is learned through sports where learners develop and enhance their productivity within a stipulated time frame. Needless to say, all these qualities are extremely pertinent for the personal and professional success of individuals.\\nThe combination of sports and academics is also very fruitful for the achievement of not just physical but mental health. Challenges faced by young people today are myriad and mental health problems have become a far too common malaise. Resilience is a skill that is non-negotiable today and indulging in sports allows young people to tap into their inner reservoir of strength, allowing them to resurface with renewed vigor after a setback.\\nSchools are where young learners spend the most part of their formative years. It is in schools that they should get the opportunity to explore the innumerable benefits of dabbling in sports. In addition to this, the schools also have the responsibility to nurture innate sports talent that could potentially bring laurels and glory to the nation.\\nIndian athletes and sportspersons have brought great plaudits to the nation and over the decades, sports infrastructure has grown exponentially. It is imperative to offer a variety of sports to students so that they can make organic choices about what resonates most with them. The inclusion of sports in educational philosophy enriches the holistic, well-rounded development of individuals and empowers them to be capable and confident.\\n— Authored by Abhishek Mohan Gupta, Founder and President of the Board of Management at Shrewsbury International School India.', 'summary': 'Sports must complement academics so that the former takes care of physical development while the latter offers mental and intellectual replenishment', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/education-career/national-education-day-need-for-sports-to-be-given-importance-in-academic-curriculum-9116037.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/09/school-holidays-2024-09-6adf0841f35220007f47757e9a3e6a3a-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 07:16:11', 'author': 'News18,Sukanya Nandy', 'authors': ['News18', 'Sukanya Nandy'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.378}, {'id': 263995148, 'title': 'Beware!

One example cited is users who search “Are Bengal Cats legal in Australia?”—allegedly had their personal information exposed online after clicking on a top search result link.“Victims are often enticed into clicking on malicious adware or links disguised as legitimate marketing, or in this case a legitimate Google search,” the firm explained in a post. \\nIn addition, the alert stated that hackers appear to target users who include the word “Australia” in their searches, indicating that citizens of the country are more vulnerable to these cyberattacks.\\nSOPHOS noted that customers’ bank account information and personal information are taken by a program called Gootloader when they click on the search result that comes at the top and appears to be authentic. Moreover, this application has the capacity to lock the user out of their computer.\\nThe cybersecurity firm asserted that although the word “Bengal cats” may seem rather specialised, users don’t need to enter any malicious information to be vulnerable to these attacks and have their private data taken and shared online.\\nThese days, cybercriminals use programs to snoop on clean and innocent Google searches employing a technique known as “SEO poisoning.” The Daily Mail has described this practice as an “insidious technique in which criminals manipulate search engine results to push websites they control to the top of the page.” SOPHOS advised anyone who may have been a victim of SEO poisoning to change their password as soon as possible and enhance their security systems.\\nReportedly, Hackers steal people’s data and even take over their devices by using malware, which is software created expressly to damage computers, networks and gadgets.

That was a big one. A much younger composition of the Republican primary base came together on basic principles that really weren’t as beholden to older Republican orthodoxies, but principles like free speech, anti-censorship, meritocracy, and staying out of World War III.

While his family of four lives on the ground floor, he runs his unit on the upper floor. \"Most business units in Dharavi function like this with homes on the ground floor and business on the first storey. If we are getting 350 square feet homes in the redeveloped projects, how will our units operate in them? They are shifting us to buildings and that is good. We don\\'t oppose that. But at least clarify where and how we will we get spaces to run our businesses?\" Khade asked. The Adani Group is redeveloping Dharavi — these five words are driving the Opposition\\'s campaigns for the Assembly elections in Maharashtra.While Asia\\'s largest slum cluster is being developed by one of India\\'s biggest business tycoons, several perspectives, claims, and allegations are driving the local and state-level politics.Uddhav Thackeray, Former chief minister and Shiv Sena (UBT) chief even went on to say that of the Opposition\\'s Maha Vikas Aghadi government comes to power, it will take the redevelopment away from the Adani Group.But beyond all the politicking, divide and uncertainty looms large in Dharavi, as micro businessmen fear unemployment for scores of their employees if their businesses get uprooted.In the first part of this two part-report we showed you how Dharavikars are divided on the matter of redevelopment due to two key issues - survey and eligibility.All those with residential proofs before 1 January 2000 will be rehabilitated in Dharavi. Those who have moved after that will be rehabilitated elsewhere in the city. Why the cut off date? What are the options for \\'ineligible\\' residents? Watch the first part of the report for that on The Quint\\'s Youtube.A hub of lakhs and lakhs of business of Dharavi which provide employment to millions living within Dharavi and outside of it. From food, bags, shoes, school uniforms, leather, everything imaginable under the sun is manufactured in Dharavi.So, where do businesses like these, which generate employment and feed families largely in the unorganised sectors, find a place in the grand redevelopment project?\"What is their plan? Where will they give us spaces to run our businesses? Where will we live? We don\\'t have the capacity to live separately and rent another place to work. We cannot afford that rent. Even if we look for a small room, the rent is not below Rs 15-16,000,\" Khade said.Units like Khade\\'s have been registered with the authorities for years. They have their bills, they have their address proofs, everything is in place. The key demands of business units is space for space to run their businesses inside Dharavi as they were. This aspect of the project is something they are seeking clarity on from the authorities and the DRP, while saying that they are not opposed to the project in any way.\"If they have two floors they must get two floors. If they have three floors, they must get three. Give us as much space as we have, we don\\'t even want more. But we want it in Dharavi,\" said Imran Khan whose family has been running a leather processing unit out of Dharavi for five decades.Like residential clusters, several business units in Dharavi, too, have opposed the survey being conducted by the DRP. But there are also those who are in favour of the survey.\"Till the survey happens, we will not know what\\'s there. The government is saying let us do the survey, then we will know where an industrial zone is to be made, how to make it.

Out of the 600 acres in Dharavi, only around 300 acres would be available for the redevelopment project with the rest already being used up for Dharavi Koliwada, the Mahim Nature Park, a power substation, and an upcoming BMC sewage water treatment plant, according to The Indian Express. The land in Dharavi as well as other land pockets being acquired will not just be used for creating residences and business units but are expected to be smaller townships that include, roads, open spaces, hospitals, and schools among other things. In September, Pallavi Paranjape, the deputy director of the redevelopment project said that a master plan based on the survey will be finalised soon. However, several bodies like the Dharavi Bachao Aandolan, a group led by several local stakeholders as well as Shetkari Kamgar Paksh has been at the forefront of demanding that all residents must be rehabilitated in Dharavi itself. Mumbai Congress chief, former Dharavi MLA, and now Lok Sabha MP Varsha Gaikwad has also backed these demands. \"If the date for the eligibility criteria is extended, all residents will get homes in Dharavi which is possible. If that happens, all will be eligible for in-situ rehabilitation and get their rightful homes in Dharavi itself,\" Samya Korde of the Shetkari Kamgar Paksh said.Aam Aadmi Party leader Sandip Katke, meanwhile, said that the DRP should first reveal their master plan.\"They are putting these numbers. This structure, the owner is not aware where he is getting a house or a shop in lieu of this. If you want to only conduct a survey, you will only put the numbers, not ask for papers. They are also asking for papers, which means they will start the eligibility procedure,\" Katke said.But beyond all the politics, divide and uncertainty remain two key sentiments when it comes to Dharavi\\'s redevelopment.\"Tell us that this is where your workspace will be and this is where you will live. We will wash your feet and drink that water,\" Khades said.Yunus, on the other hand, said that blocking the survey is no solution.\"No matter whose government it is, development has to happen.

The scope of the problem is broad, involving various forms of exploitation and abuse, including the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), online grooming, and live-streaming abuse. In 2022, the National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) received more than 31 million reports of suspected child sexual abuse material (CSAM). During the same year, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) identified and addressed nearly 40,000 webpages containing CSAM. Research published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence revealed that approximately 30 percent of children who were groomed online also reported experiencing physical sexual abuse, highlighting a troubling connection between online grooming and actual abuse. Europol\\'s 2021 report documented a 500 percent increase in the detection of live-streaming abuse over the previous five years, indicating a sharp rise in this type of exploitation. In India too, according to NHRC, CSAM has increased by 250 to 300 percent on social media in India. There were 204056 cases reported in the year 2022, 163633 in the year 2021, and 17390 in the year 2020 of child sexual abuse material on social media in India. India does not have any concrete law to control CSAM. However, the European Commission has proposed a law that establishes guidelines for preventing and combating online child sexual abuse. Specifically, it entails requirements for service providers to identify and detect known child sexual abuse materials and advocates for the establishment of a European Centre dedicated to preventing and combating child sexual abuse. The proposal mandates that messaging apps must scan all images and links to detect and report child abuse material and groom conversations between potential offenders and minors. CBI Raids 56 Locations in 20 States Against Child Sexual AbuseThis means that when users upload pictures and links through these apps, they will be scanned, and users will be notified of this practice in the terms and conditions. Users who do not comply with these requirements will be prevented from sending pictures and links. Even highly secure apps that use end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Messenger, would need to implement these measures. The draft proposal, however, excludes \"accounts used by the State for national security purposes.\"However, the most contested aspect of the proposal is the obligation on tech companies to deploy client-side scanning (CSS) technology to scan the messages of users, including end-to-end encrypted communications on platforms such as Meta’s WhatsApp, when a risk is identified. With the introduction of laws like the Information Technology Act 2000 and the recent Digital Personal Data Protection Act, India has been increasingly focusing on digital regulation. India’s current laws do not fully address the nuances of mandatory content scanning and privacy trade-offs. Harmonising these laws with new regulations similar to the EU\\'s could be complex. Therefore, India too can look forward to adopting this law. Let’s first see what the law is and what are the issues in it. The obligations as provided under the proposed regulation apply to four types of service providers. Firstly, on the hosting services providers that store information on behalf of users, often for the purpose of making such information accessible to third parties, including social media platforms such as Twitter, or Instagram. Secondly, on the Interpersonal Communications Services providers that facilitate the direct exchange of information between designated individuals, comprising email services and instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Thirdly, on the Software Application Stores which provide platforms for downloading software applications and lastly, on the Internet Access Services providers that offer access to the internet. Under this law, an obligation is mandated to providers of hosting services to remove specific depictions of sexualised violence or block access to such depictions if removal is unfeasible due to the distribution of such content by non-cooperative hosting services located in non-cooperative third countries. This obligation to actively seek out potentially incriminating content may be mandated by a detection order.A detection order may pertain to content that is already identified and catalogued as depicting sexualised violence, any new depictions of sexualised violence or any content involving the solicitation of minors for sexual purposes. The said order also applies in cases of interpersonal communications meaning thereby that the authorities can oblige providers of communications services such as WhatsApp or Signal to monitor their users’ private communication. Further, the proposed Chat Control legislation mandates that digital messaging services implement a content moderation system for uploading content. All content including photos, videos, and links must be subjected to scanning prior to transmission to the recipient. Such scans will involve comparing the content against a government database of known Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) through the use of AI-powered algorithms to identify potential matches. If found suspicious, it will be flagged for further examination by human moderators. During this review process, the message shall be withheld and remain undelivered to the intended recipient until it has been determined to be safe. Prajwal Revanna Suspended by JD(S) Over Alleged Sexual Abuse: What\\'s the Case?The major effect of the regulation revolves around the infringement of the fundamental right to expression because of indiscriminate mass surveillance. This effect arises irrespective of whether service providers monitor the content of private communications through a backdoor in encryption technology or by scanning the content on the user’s device prior to encryption. Interpersonal communication services such as WhatsApp provides end-to-end encryption which implies that the communication between the originator and the addressee of the message is secure from any access by a third party. The proposed regulation suggests scrutinisation of the content even before they are encrypted or sent. The orders infringe upon the confidentiality of communications, which is safeguarded by the fundamental right to privacy. Thus, the integrity of the communication is severely hampered, compelling the users to restrict themselves while exercising their freedom of communication. The regulation further stipulates the implementation of age verification by the service providers as stated above. This simply means that the said obligation applies to all the email and messaging services that enable communication between adults and minors. This clause severely restricts the fundamental right to communication of the minor. The “user consent” policy of the regulation asking for the user’s prior consent for scanning the message even before it is actually sent also appears farce. Because, once the user refuses to give consent, he/she will be blocked from sending or receiving photos, videos, and links on the platform. As a result, the users are left with a Hobson\\'s choice. Another shortcoming of the proposed legislation is that the same technology that is being used to track down CSAM, can be used to censor content that relates to political dissent or any personal views against the government. In conclusion, the rising tide of online child sexual abuse material (CSAM) presents an urgent challenge that demands innovative and effective solutions. Although India does not have a law to prevent the CSAM, India does have a law (POSCO Act) that prohibits watching and storing child pornography (also clarified in Just Rights for Children Alliance & Another v S. Harish & Others (2024)). In fact, the Supreme Court asked the Parliament to replace the word child pornography with child sexual exploitative and abuse material in the POCSO Act. Moreover, it directed all the courts and judicial authorities to use this word. The European Union\\'s proposed Chat Control Law offers a potential model for addressing these issues by mandating content scanning and reporting mechanisms across various digital platforms. However, this approach raises significant concerns regarding privacy, freedom of expression, and the potential for misuse of surveillance technologies.(Ravi Singh Chhikara is a practicing advocate at the Delhi High Court.

Where is it?\" Carlo Marenda, a part-time truffle hunter, calls out to Gigi and Buk, seven month-and 13-year-old crosses between the Spinone Italiano and Lagotto Romagnolo breeds, prized for their keen sense of smell.Autumn leaves crunch under the weight of boots sinking into muddy soil. Below a picturesque hillside vineyard, not far from Alba, trails wind along the Rio della Fava, crossing damp ground ideal for growing truffles.Sought after by gourmets and starred chefs around the globe, the white truffle of Alba, the most prestigious in the world, is an underground fungus growing in symbiosis with certain hardwood trees by attaching itself to their roots.Its intense and refined scent, a mixture of hay, garlic and honey, allows hunting dogs to detect it, even if the truffle is sometimes buried up to a metre deep.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Introduced to truffle hunting at the age of five by a family friend, Carlo Marenda, 42, founded the \"Save the Truffle\" association in 2015, alongside Edmondo Bonelli, a researcher in natural sciences.It was an octogenarian \"trifulau\" loner, Giuseppe Giamesio, known as \"Notu\" and the last descendant of a family with a century-old truffle tradition, who revealed his secrets to him and bequeathed his dogs just before his death in 2014.The master\\'s message was a testament: \"If we want to prevent the disappearance of the truffle, we must protect the forests, stop polluting the waterways and plant new \\'truffle\\' trees\".Ten years later, thanks to donations and the support of some winegrowers, the association has planted more than 700 such trees in the hilly Langhe area, including poplars, oaks and lindens.Notu\\'s legacy\"Notu passed on to me his passion for truffle hunting and tree preservation,\" said Marenda, emerging from his metallic grey Fiat Panda 4X4, the preferred car of truffle hunters.In the last three decades, the areas dedicated to white truffles in Italy have dropped by 30 per cent, gradually giving way to more profitable vineyards, but also hazelnut groves.The Langhe hills provide a large quantity of hazelnuts to the chocolate giant Ferrero, which was founded in 1946 in Alba, a small prosperous town of 30,000 inhabitants.But the main threat to the white truffle, whose harvest was classified as an intangible heritage of humanity by UNESCO in 2021, is climate change.Global warming, drought, deforestation and sudden temperature changes are all factors weakening the natural habitat of this fungus.To survive, the truffle needs cold and humidity. At the beginning of November, however, the temperature was at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit).\"With the prolongation of summer weather, production is definitely falling\", he lamented.Soaring pricesThe harvest, running from October to the end of January, is getting shorter. And with the delayed cold and snow to arrive, \"the aroma of the truffles is not yet 100 per cent and they don\\'t keep as long\", Marenda said.Abundant rain, as seen in recent weeks, can also be harmful, he said.\"If there is too little water, the truffle does not grow. If there is too much, it rots.\"Alerted by Buk, Marenda crouched down to the ground to delicately scratch the earth with a narrow spade, extracting a truffle, albeit rather modest in size.On whether the white truffle is on the brink of extinction, experts say it isn\\'t too late.\"Not yet. But if we don\\'t act, it could become so,\" said Mario Aprile, president of the Piedmont truffle hunters\\' association.\"The white truffle cannot be cultivated, unlike the black one. Without trees, there are no truffles. We plant them to rebuild biodiversity,\" Aprile said.Faced with limited supply and booming demand, the white truffle is trading at a high price, reaching 4,500 euros per kilo this year at the International Alba White Truffle Fair, which ends December 8.Two \"twin\" white truffles, bound to the same root and dug up by Aprile, were the stars of the annual world charity auction for white truffles in Alba Sunday.Weighing a total of 905 grams (2 lbs), the fungi were sold for 140,000 euros ($150,000) to a Hong Kong finance tycoon.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)', 'summary': \"Deep in a thick forest in Italy's northwestern Piedmont region, the hunt is on for the white Alba truffle, with excited dogs zigzagging and digging into the wet earth.\", 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/white-truffles-italys-gold-menaced-by-climate-change-6994450', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/lbsdfr9o_white-truffle-alba_625x300_11_November_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 12:36:45', 'author': 'Agence France-Presse', 'authors': ['Agence France-Presse'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.464}, {'id': 264076104, 'title': 'BJP-Congress In Tit-For-Tat Complaint To Election Commission', 'text': 'The BJP has written to the Election Commission, seeking a First Information Report against Congress\\'s Rahul Gandhi and party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, over what they have called \\'lies\" against the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevk Sangh.

So promising did start off, still missing those crucial chances and letting the leads slip away. On the back of four games without a win and only two in the last 12 of league matches, it has all gone upside down since October with a European loss, a win and a League Cup victory over Championship side Preston, and as such, they lie 9 points off the top of the table.\\n\\nThe Problem with “Almost”\\n\\nThe current trend under Arteta doesn’t give much comfort to Arsenal fans. It‘s far from the worst football they have had to endure, but it‘s not nearly good enough to challenge title status. “Almost good enough” is not the mark of champions, but it does speak of a manager who, after five years in charge, runs the risk of being labeled overrated or simply underprepared.\\n\\nAnd yet, it is in this cutthroat landscape of managing in the contemporary age, where expectations often outstrip the realistic, that Arteta is entering already that phase where his tenure could be compromised. Win enough just to keep those supporters’ hopes high, but still so far from actually winning anything worthwhile, and he may eventually himself be shown the door. If he leaves his standing will likely be clear, at least in the light of joining another one of the top European leagues.\\n\\nArteta‘s Time and Arsenal Expectation\\n\\nThis had long enough both in years and in dollars to produce some results. While the Arsenal splurge compares with a few outlets, Chelsea, Manchester United are amongst them, little has shown the way of reward. Arsenal are yet to improve its trophy cupboard seriously beyond an occasional FA Cup. So, all that is left to do is wonder what the club is up to under Arteta.\\n\\nUnder Arteta, many can consider the results as not too bad but unremarkable. Football clubs are not meant to be constructed for stability’s sake but to win. And unless the definition of success is updated, Arteta’s reign will most probably be viewed more like a season of “almostes” rather than real feats.\\n\\nIs Another Year of Stagnation Acceptable?\\n\\nFootball has changed. The business side of the game now plays a huge role in decisions that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. In excess of ten billion pounds spent on players that have brought so little return on this particular club’s business plan may not be enough success. Expect many fans – who were promised a return to the top, but are now left clutching at “almosts” instead of delivering the reward they have been waiting for.\\n\\nThere is an impression that Arteta’s time is running out. A Cup win will give the respite, but such significant investment in Arsenal makes it difficult to be blind to the realization that just winning “the cup” will never be enough in the long run-the bar has been set by a much higher imposition.\\n\\nIs It Time to Change?\\n\\nThere is frustration, not because of a lack of effort but because Arteta failed to bring Arsenal to the next level. Of course, there is a definite and perceptible growth in aspects during Arteta’s tenure, but something does not change: this Arsenal side, which spent huge money and still seems inadequate. Up to now, they are intended for another season without winning much with serious challenges of getting something loftier. Football is cruel. In football, close, but not quite spells the kiss of death for managers. A few more near-misses and Arsenal will probably have to begin again. Arteta might have changed the club in certain aspects, but the hard fact is that he failed to deliver the ultimate prize – titles.\\n\\nThe “Good Enough” Trap \\n\\nAlmost €750m spent, moments of brilliance unapologetic but inconsistent under Arteta. All things considered, there can be little disputations that the club is closer now than when Arteta arrived, but all this progress comes with an air guarantee that they are going to win anything meaningful as the season ticks on. The wait for Gunners goes on, and with that comes mounting pressure on Arteta. But if the side persists in flirting with success, it is only a matter of time before the question arises: just how much longer can Arsenal afford to wait for “almost”? In football, at least at this level, waiting for near-perfection is a luxury that few clubs can afford. If Arteta does not deliver soon, the board may have no choice but to pull the trigger and seek a new direction, however painful that might be. The era of “almost” ends soon, and with it, a tenure at the helm for Arteta. \\n\\nRead More : 6 Problems Pep Guardiola Must Solve At Man City During The Break', 'summary': \"It\\xa0is\\xa0characteristic\\xa0of\\xa0many\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0current\\xa0season\\xa0that\\xa0Arsenal's\\xa0performance\\xa0against Chelsea showed that\\xa0the club\\xa0is\\xa0stuck\\xa0under Mikel Arteta.\\n\\n\\nThe post Mikel Arteta&#8217;s Arsenal: Close, But Not Quite There appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/sports/mikel-artetas-arsenal-close-but-not-quite-there/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mikel-Arteta.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 13:25:48', 'author': 'anirudh,Choosing Elise Stefanik', 'authors': ['anirudh', 'Choosing Elise Stefanik'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'sports', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.712}, {'id': 264074592, 'title': \"Shah Rukh Khan Holds Pregnant Gauri Khan Close In Throwback Photo From Before Aryan Khan's Birth\", 'text': \"Gauri Khan’s photo from when she was pregnant with Aryan Khan in 1997 has resurfaced on social media and has caught everyone’s attention.

Officials reported that CRPF personnel engaged in a fierce firefight, ultimately neutralizing eleven attackers. “These are very challenging times,” said DGP Rajiv Singh. “But we have been trying to tackle [the issues] with the best possible strength, with cooperation from security agencies and the community.”\\n\\nCRPF Casualties and Civilian Disappearances Amid Heavy Gunfire\\n\\nDuring the clash, two CRPF personnel were wounded, with one officer currently in critical condition, according to authorities. The security forces’ swift response played a crucial role in containing the violence, but questions linger over the fate of five civilians who remain missing. Local authorities are unsure if the missing individuals were taken by militants or if they sought refuge in nearby areas.\\n\\nFollowing the incident, the bodies of the slain militants were transported to Borobekra police station, where investigations are underway to identify the attackers and trace the missing civilians. Security forces are on high alert, assessing the attack’s extent and ensuring that any civilians affected by the assault receive necessary support.\\n\\nEarly Morning Attacks Heighten Tensions in Jiribam\\n\\nThe violence began earlier in the day when militants ignited tensions by torching shops in Borobekra, a location that has been a flashpoint for conflict since violence first broke out in June. The militants reportedly launched their assault around 2:30 pm, initially targeting the Borobekra police station before proceeding to the nearby Jakurador Karong area, where they engaged in further acts of arson. According to local reports, a fierce exchange of gunfire ensued, intensifying the already volatile situation.\\n\\nBorobekra has been marked by frequent attacks on security forces and public property, with the police station’s relief camp often targeted by militants. This sub-division has witnessed multiple gunfights and arson incidents, making it one of Manipur’s most unstable areas.\\n\\nTensions on the Rise Following Recent Incidents of Violence\\n\\nThis latest clash adds to the mounting unrest in the area, following the death of a 31-year-old woman in Zairon Hmar village last week. Local officials attribute her death to armed miscreants, which has further strained the already fragile atmosphere in the region.\\n\\nRajiv Singh, Director General of Police (DGP) in Manipur, recently addressed these challenges at the 133rd Manipur Police Raising Day, stressing the efforts being made to restore stability. He highlighted the decline in violent incidents over the past year, noting ongoing efforts by security agencies to curb outbreaks of arson and gunfire. “These are very challenging times,” he reiterated, emphasizing the importance of community cooperation in stabilizing the region.\\n\\nGovernment Initiates Dialogue Among Ethnic Groups\\n\\nIn an effort to address long-standing ethnic tensions, representatives from the Kuki, Meitei, and Naga communities held their first direct talks on October 15, facilitated by India’s Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi. The dialogue included MLAs and ministers from all three communities, marking a step toward fostering unity and reducing hostilities among Manipur’s diverse groups.\\n\\nIn a joint statement, the leaders appealed for peace, underscoring their commitment to bridging divides. This diplomatic initiative comes amid ongoing ethnic tensions that date back to May 3 of the previous year, when a rally by the All Tribals Students Union (ATSU) opposing Scheduled Tribe status for the Meitei community sparked widespread clashes across the northeastern state.\\n\\nThe central government has expressed hope that this dialogue will pave the way for sustainable peace and reconciliation among Manipur’s ethnic groups.', 'summary': 'A gunfight between suspected militants and personnel from the CRPF in Manipur’s Jiribam district resulted in the death of eleven militant\\n\\n\\nThe post Manipur: Intense Gunfight in Jiribam District Leaves Eleven Militants Dead appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/manipur-intense-gunfight-in-jiribam-district-leaves-eleven-militants-dead/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/modi.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 13:11:41', 'author': 'Choosing Elise Stefanik,Srishti Mukherjee', 'authors': ['Choosing Elise Stefanik', 'Srishti Mukherjee'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.004}, {'id': 264074784, 'title': 'PM Modi Stresses National Unity For India’s Development By 2047', 'text': 'Citizens and national integrity will be the secrets for achieving a developed India by 2047 while the nation marks the 200th anniversary of Shri Swaminarayan Temple Vadtal,Gujarat, though citizens were cautioned that certain elements were playing nefarious games by dividing society on grounds of caste, religions, and language.\\n\\nCaution About Divisive Forces\\n\\nModi has warned at a video conference address, that vested interests were working to fragment the nation on various social and cultural fronts. He asked people to recognize the dangers threatened by these forces and to act collectively to preserve social harmony and national unity.\\n\\nAccording to Modi, “It is necessary to maintain unity among citizens and integration of the nation in order to make India a developed country by 2047. Some forces are trying to divide the fabric of our society on the basis of caste, faith, language, social status, gender, and rural-urban divide. We have to understand the seriousness of such efforts by those who try to weaken our motherland, understand that danger they create, and continue on a combined track to foil those attempts,” he added.\\n\\nRole of saints and sages in national unity\\n\\nThe Prime Minister explained that history also assumed important aspects where, at different times, beings such as saints and sages guided humankind towards a greater purpose. \\n\\nHe praised their contribution to human society but added that discovery of life‘s very purpose matters the most.\\n“Every person‘s life has a purpose that defines it. When we discover our life‘s purpose, it changes everything. Saints and sages have, in every age, helped humanity realize its purpose. This has been a tremendous contribution of saints and sages to our society,” Modi remarked.\\n\\nReviving India‘s Spirit under Spiritual Leadership\\n\\nHe further appreciated the rich tradition of India whereby the country is blessed with spiritual leaders periodically when national crises arise, citing Lord Swaminarayan in particular. According to him, it was particularly opportune for India’s self-respect and identity to be re-ignited at a time when national confidence was on a low, as during the colonial period.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister stated that great thinkers such as Lord Swaminarayan, who provided the spiritual energy during that time, in fact also provided national pride during the period of colonial subjugation.\\n\\nCelebrating Vadtal Dham’s cultural heritage Modi also mentioned the Vadtal Dham in his speech. It was established by Lord Swaminarayan two hundred years ago, and according to Modi, it depicts India‘s spiritual legacy and cultural stream. This milestone was of such significance that to commemorate it, the government announced the release of a special ₹200 silver coin and a postal stamp commemorating the ancient importance of the temple.\\n\\nSwaminarayan Community’s Contributions Modi spoke at some length on the active participation of members of the Swaminarayan community in many government programs, specially work in environmental conservation. He urged the community to carry on supporting great events like Prayagraj Kumbh Mela to be promoted on the international level. Anticipating the Kumbh Mela, the Prime Minister has extended an invitation to the Swaminarayan community to help facilitate appreciation for global audiences of the profound spiritual significance of the event, thereby strengthening India’s cultural and spiritual outreach.\\n\\nRead More : Uddhav Thackeray Claims Election Authorities Inspected His Bags Ahead Of Maharashtra Rally', 'summary': 'Citizens and national integrity will be the secrets for achieving a developed India by 2047 while the nation marks the 200th anniversary of Shri Swaminarayan Temple Vadtal,Gujarat.\\n\\n\\nThe post PM Modi Stresses National Unity For India&#8217;s Development By 2047 appeared first on NewsX World.', 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/pm-modi-stresses-national-unity-for-indias-development-by-2047/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/modi.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-11 13:04:52', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.596}, {'id': 264074780, 'title': 'Did Trump Snub Nikki Haley By Choosing Elise Stefanik As UN Ambassador?', 'text': 'Donald Trump has selected GOP Representative Elise Stefanik as his nominee for the US envoy to the United Nations.\\n\\nThe decision to choose Stefanik follows Trump’s statement that he would not be inviting Nikki Haley back to the role.

Most of the people really listen when he speaks about his infidelity and the fragile journey of the couple that made them forgive each other after a considerable period of separation.\\n\\nBig Confession of cheating “Yes, I did cheat on her.”\\n\\nAmit confessed he made a big mistake—he cheated on his wife. “Yes, I did cheat on her,” Amit revealed in the interview. “I let my impulses take over at a time when our relationship was already struggling.” This was shocking for many because of Amit’s public face as a popular actor for television serials. He added that Ruby did not know of his infidelities for years. However, the minute she knew, it crushed her. “It killed her,” Amit declared severely.\\n\\n“For a woman who has sacrificed everything—her family, her life—to be with you, the betrayal goes deep. Once the trust is broken, you can’t bring it back together again. At times, the hurt becomes unhealable.\\n\\nTandon shares about his marriage struggles\\n\\nAmit and Ruby Tandon married in 2007. But as time went on, it continued to go downhill. Amit was the face of ‘Indian Idol’ who emerged into popularity initially with that show and had then turned up on television as a regular popular face.\\n\\n“I’m a hot-headed Aries, and she is a hot-headed Scorpion,” Amit shared. “When we fought, there was no one to intervene and calm us down. Our fights became more intense, and without anyone to guide us, the cracks in our relationship became deeper.”\\n\\nEven as they fought over everything, the couple tried to make it work. Amit remembers how, while they were fighting over one thing or another, they mutually agreed to have a child as if a child was supposed to bring them closer. This was not the case, he confessed, when their marriage would go down the drain and the child would make no difference to the issues within their union.\\n\\nHe also shared that while infidelity is a terrible mistake, it can sometimes become a part of one’s learning curve. He also made it evident that one should not expect a child to mend a broken relationship; many couples fall for this misconception. He is also huge on self-improvement, and he always found his space growing in the relationship. The story of redemption, resilience, and second chances for Amit and Ruby defines them.\\n\\nOpens Up About His Remarriage\\n\\n“We both moved on in our own ways,” Amit said while sharing details about his ‘almost’ divorce. “I was already in another relationship, and we were leading our lives quite apart.” Still, their separation did not ease Amit’s mind, and he felt that something in him and Ruby was just not complete.\\n\\nAfter years of individual growth and reflection, in 2023, Amit and Ruby decided to give their marriage another chance. Reunited, it was more than just an emotional reunification; they renewed their wedding vows. “When we came back together, it was different,” Amit said with a grateful tone. “We’d both changed as people. There was a higher power at play, and I think this was the plan all along.”\\n\\nThey reconnected in 2023, after all the struggles and they believed in giving second chances. Amit further said, “It is all God’s grace that we came back entirely new to life and to each other. We renewed our vows last year; it was a new start for both of us.”\\n\\nWhile Amit has been the face in the spotlight, his better half, Ruby Tandon, is also a well-known cosmetologist. Ruby has made a strong career for herself, with big-client celebrities including Kajol Devgn, Pankhury Awasthy, Gautam Rode, and Mouni Roy.\\n\\nALSO READ: Shaktimaan Returns!

Priced at $0.19, with a market capitalisation of more than $28 billion as of 6 November 2024, DOGE is witnessing a bullish sentiment, raising eyebrows as the asset trades in the mid-range zone. DOGE has been quiet for most of the year but this trend is beginning to change, and investors are hoping for profit opportunities in the coin during the next bull cycle, whenever that comes.DOGE forecast for 2025In DOGE’s technical setup, a pattern implying a bullish reversal, commonly called the rounding bottom, can now be observed. Many traders regard this chart formation as an indicator that a downtrend will end and that an uptrend is possible as investors return with confidence. Such a bullish outlook raises the question: can Dogecoin break its all-time high resistance, set at $1, which has been tested in other bullish run periods?It is widely believed that once DOGE crosses this level, it will pave the way for a strong increase. According to analyst forecasts , 2025 is expected to attract a wide range of opinions for Dogecoin. This is due to the trajectory showing a tendency towards the maximum price of $0.274 per token.Minimum price: Bearish sentiment has not completely wiped out hope for DOGE, with a prediction standing around $0.130.Maximum price: Based on our research, a reasonable maximum price projection for DOGE in 2025 can be set at $0.274 if progress continues.Average trading price: Analyst expectations suggest the average price of Dogecoin to be around $0.307, which is promising for long-term holders who may want to invest elsewhere in the cryptocurrency market.Although Dogecoin’s loyal community is still considered one of its greatest strengths, most of its value is based on hype and speculation rather than practical utility. While such predictions regarding DOGE’s price appear optimistic, it is clear that aspirations like these will require consistent backing to be realised, especially if Dogecoin aims to reach the same levels it had previously reached.Rexas Finance (RXS): The emerging force in the crypto spaceThe hype around Dogecoin is starting to die down as another competitor, Rexas Finance (RXS), aims to tokenise real assets. With a sizeable amount raised in the last months of its presale—over $5.9 million in total—Rexas Finance is bound to rise in popularity. Currently priced at less than $0.07, the token seems promising.115182706The Rexas Finance ecosystem is designed with the following key elements:Rexas Token Builder: This feature allows users to tokenise tangible assets and position them on the blockchain. It permits fractional ownership of assets, enabling investment access to a wider pool of investors.Rexas Estate: Rexas seamlessly integrates real estate investment into the platform, allowing users access to the property market through tokenised units.Rexas DeFi: As part of the RXS ecosystem, this feature provides users with tools for yield optimisation, staking, and other decentralised finance options to increase returns.Presale and tokenomics: RXS is built in a way such that 42.5% of its tokens will go on presale, which is beneficial for early adopters and investors.$1M giveaway: To encourage more engagement with the ecosystem, Rexas Finance has implemented a giveaway to appreciate users and generate interest. This strategy aligns with its focus on community, fostering a base of willing and able users.Why Rexas Finance (RXS) will be better than DogecoinWhile Dogecoin benefits from growth driven by market trends and online buzz, Rexas Finance is gaining ground with its competent fundamentals and a comprehensive approach to blockchain asset management. Unlike DOGE, which rides on social media excitement, RXS has useful applications that appeal to both cryptocurrency and traditional investors. This gives Rexas a more secure foundation and access to a larger market. Rexas Finance’s emphasis on the tokenisation of real estate and other real-world assets provides tangible value for investors— a feature that is often missing in meme coins like DOGE. Furthermore, the continuous development of the Rexas platform and its focus on DeFi demonstrate its ability to attract a broader range of investors, especially those seeking utility and long-term value.Conclusion: RXS is a sound choiceRexas Finance offers solid, realistic value that is less likely to be affected by whims and trends. Rather than competing with the likes of Dogecoin for momentary attention and price spikes, RXS is positioned for long-term strategic holders. With real-world applications, a distinctive asset tokenisation model, and a community-focused presale strategy, Rexas Finance is arguably in a position to not only outperform DOGE, but also revolutionise asset management in the cryptocurrency industryFor more information about Rexas Finance (RXS), visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdfTwitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinanceTelegram: https://t.me/rexasfinanceEmail: Support@rexas.comDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

It will be the last time that the flight code 'UK' will be dotting the firmament and from Tuesday onwards, Vistara flights will have the new code 'AI2XXX'. Interestingly, when the airline commenced operations on January 9, 2015, it was the other way around as the maiden flight operated from Delhi to Mumbai. An official on Monday said Vistara's last flights on domestic and international routes are scheduled to be UK 986 and UK 115, respectively. UK 986 is to depart at around 2250 hours from Mumbai to Delhi and UK 115 is to leave Delhi for Singapore at about 2345 hours. 115139141 Thank you for being part of this unforgettable journey and showering us with your #VistaraLove. We will forever cherish these memories. Please follow @airindia for all the latest updates, Vistara said in a post on X. A joint venture between Tata Group and Singapore, Vistara will be merged with Air India, following which Singapore Airlines will have a 25.1 per cent stake in the enlarged entity. The merger will also mark the second major consolidation wave in the country's fast-growing civil aviation space after 2006-2007. Post Vistara merger -- also Tata Group's second significant airlines integration after AIX Connect was combined with Air India Express in October -- there will be only Air India as a full service Indian carrier. In 2006-07, Indian Airlines merged with Air India and Air Sahara merged with Jet Airways. During the same period, Air Deccan was amalgamated with Kingfisher Airlines. With a fleet of 70 planes, Vistara operates around 350 flights daily and various initiatives to integrate the systems, people and other elements of the two full service airlines have been progressing since the announcement of the merger in November 2022. Fleet & Flights The enlarged Air India will have a fleet of 208 planes operating on 103 domestic and 71 international routes. It will be flying to 49 domestic and 42 international destinations, according to an official. More aircraft, including wide-body ones, will be joining the fleet in the coming months.115086520 Singapore Airlines (SIA) on Friday said the merger will strengthen SIA's multi-hub strategy, allowing it to continue participating directly in India's large and fast-growing aviation market. In-flight Experience Last month, Vistara Chairman Bhaskar Bhat said the integrated entity will share the best practices of the two airlines and the livery of Vistara will stay for some time. Amid concerns in certain quarters on whether Vistara passengers will continue to get the same services as now since Air India, which is in the transformation phase, has been facing various service issues, it has been repeatedly emphasised that Vistara in-flight experience is not going away post-merger. In a message sent to Vistara customers last month, Air India CEO and MD Campbell Wilson said they can continue to enjoy the same world-class fleet, exceptional service, and familiar faces under the new code 'AI2XXX'. With the merger on the horizon and the changes that come with it, we wanted to assure you that your Vistara in-flight experience is not going away. You can continue to enjoy the same world-class fleet, exceptional service, and familiar faces under the new code AI2XXX, he had said. Maharaja Loss-making Air India, under the government ownership, was also known for its iconic 'Maharaja' emblem. Tata Group took back the ownership of the full service airline in January 2022. Post the merger, the vintage 'Maharaja' will be retained through the frequent flyer programme of the integrated entity. The existing members of Club Vistara will be seamlessly transferred to Air India's Flying Returns program. With this merger, Flying Returns will also evolve into an all-new avatar 'Maharaja Club', Air India said last month. Investments SIA will make an additional investment of Rs 3,194.5 crore in Air India post-Vistara merger. The airline, on Friday, said its consideration for the merger comprises the 49 per cent interest in Vistara and Rs 20,585 million (Rs 2,058.5 crore) in cash in exchange for a 25.1 per cent equity interest in the enlarged Air India. SIA's additional capital injection is expected to be Rs 31,945 million (equivalent to SGD 498 million), based on Tata's funding to Air India to date. This will occur after the completion of the merger and within November 2024 through subscription to new Air India shares. Future capital injections will be considered based on Air India's requirements and available funding options, it said. Issues While most of the elements related to the merger have been addressed in the last nearly two years, there are still some issues that remain. A section of Air India pilots is unhappy that there are different retirement age limits. At Air India, which was owned by the government since the 1950s and came into the Tata fold in 2022, the retirement age for pilots and other staff is 58 years, whereas at Vistara, which started flying in 2015, it is 60 years. Also, there are some concerns related to the seniority of pilots at Air India post-merger.\", 'summary': \"Vistara will operate its last flights on Monday night.

The Tata Group-owned airline that merged AIX Connect with itself on October 1 has rationalised its network and currently has an operational fleet of 90 planes, including over 30 aircraft with dual-class seats. Amid supply chain woes impacting fresh aircraft deliveries, the airline has, so far, inducted 35 white-tail Boeing 737-8 planes. Their count will rise to 50 in the coming months. Many of these white-tail aircraft have varying numbers of business-class seats. Generally, white-tail planes are those that were originally manufactured for a particular airline and later taken by another airline. The senior airline official said it will start reconfiguration of the aircraft having business class from April onwards. The carrier wants to offer only economy class seats, the official added. Currently, the carrier offers economy and business class seats. It has a fleet of around 90 aircraft -- Boeing 737 NGs, 737-8s and A320 family planes -- and the total count is expected to cross 110 by the end of this fiscal.

The integration is part of Tata Group consolidating its airline business. On Friday, Air India Express Managing Director Aloke Singh said the airline will focus on Tier 2 and 3 cities and towns as they are the growth engines, and the largest chunk of the market is metro to non-metro. On the regional short-haul international network, it will be primarily from Tier 2, 3 cities to points in the Gulf, Middle East, South East Asia and going forward, South Asia.

While speaking at the South Asian Telecommunication Regulators Council hosted by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), Scindia said the non-terrestrial networks will ignite the advent of new applications and advance the resolve of the government towards United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The advent of non-terrestrial networks, in addition to the GEO satellites, the medium earth orbit, and the low earth orbit satellites, has now given a new inflection point to telecommunication technology. I believe that presents a huge opportunity to be able to connect the hitherto unconnected population across the length and breadth of our country, Scindia said. The government has decided to allocate spectrum to satellite communication companies without auction, which will majorly benefit companies like Elon Musk-owned Starlink. Bharti Group-backed OneWeb and Jio Satcom have received permits for satcom services but their parent firms have opposed allocation of spectrum without auction for mobility services. Despite resistance from telecom operators, Scindia has maintained the allocation will be done through administrative methodology as per the Telecommunications Act 2023 and allocation price and other related norms will be suggested by Trai. These remarks have been lauded by Musk. I see the evolution of NTN with great optimism. I believe that it will unlock new vistas in communication technologies, igniting innovative applications across diverse sectors and advancing our collective journey and resolve towards the United Nations's sustainable development goals, Scindia said. The minister cited a multi-fold increase in data consumption and said that it is the government's resolve to grow the data centre capacity in India from about 977 megawatt at present to close to 2.3 gigawatts over the next couple of years. He also said India has become an aggregate wireless data usage country of close to 39 per cent of the world's data capacity, which also opens up new vistas of opportunity for the country. It is our resolve that from our capacity today of close to about 977 MW, we will grow to close to 2.3 gigawatts of data centre capacity over the next couple of years, Scindia said. India has advanced tremendously and telecommunication and digital technology should be the custodian of sustainable economic development, he noted. Today, in India, almost 10 per cent of our economy evolves from our digital economy, up three times from three and a half per cent a decade ago. The fact that our digital economy is advancing at a pace of 2.8 times of our GDP means that by the year 2026-27, the digital economy will imply 20 per cent the size of India's local economy, the minister said. He noted that 99 per cent of districts in India have been covered by 5G and the government is committed to providing 4G connectivity in the 36,000 villages that still need to be connected no later than June of 2025. We will have 100 per cent 4G saturation in India by that date, Scindia added.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) also referred to the earlier court order, urging an appropriate decision on the film’s release.A bomb strapped to a motorcycle, allegedly belonging to former BJP MP Pragya Thakur, went off at Bhiku Chowk in Malegaon, killing half a dozen people and injuring many more in 2008.

This health-driven mindset promotes a disciplined eating habit, proven to be beneficial for battling chronic conditions.This might reduce the fun, cultural pertinence of consuming your daily meals given your bandwidth of consumption becomes limited. It\\'s a given food enthusiasts would completely disagree with the notion that food is only to cater to your survival needs. Moreover, what proves useful is to be considerate towards your tastebuds, and the need to meet your daily requisite for proteins, carbs, and essential vitamins, and minerals. this approach may diminish the joy and cultural significance of food, potentially leading to a strained relationship with eating, reducing variety, and even causing nutrient deficiencies if food choices become overly restrictive.

Exposure to polluted air has serious health impacts. It can aggravate respiratory issues, trigger asthma, increase the risk of lung infections, and even contribute to heart disease and strokes over time. Children, the elderly, and those with existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Fortunately, there are ways to protect ourselves. In this article, we discuss in detail how air pollution affects your health and how can you protect yourself from it.\\n\\nAir pollution affects health in multiple ways, as inhaling polluted air can lead to both immediate and long-term health issues. Short-term exposure to pollutants like particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide can cause respiratory irritation, coughing, shortness of breath, and worsen asthma and allergies. Long-term exposure increases the risk of chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and even developmental issues in children. Pollutants like fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can penetrate deeply into the lungs, entering the bloodstream and affecting organs throughout the body.\\n\\nTo protect yourself from air pollution, consider the following tips:\\n\\n1. Monitor air quality regularly\\n\\nKeeping track of the local air quality index (AQI) is essential. Most weather apps and websites provide AQI updates, which indicate pollution levels. On days when the AQI is high, it's best to limit outdoor activities, especially strenuous exercise that can cause deeper breathing and higher intake of pollutants.\\n\\n2. Use air purifiers indoors\\n\\nIndoor air quality can also suffer from pollutants, especially in urban areas or homes close to busy streets. An air purifier with a HEPA filter can remove particulate matter and allergens, creating a cleaner breathing environment. It's particularly helpful in rooms where you spend a lot of time, like bedrooms or home offices.\\n\\n3. Wear a protective mask outdoors\\n\\nWhen pollution levels are high, wearing a mask, particularly an N95 or N99 respirator, can filter out fine particles from the air. These masks are designed to protect against small pollutants. Using a mask while commuting or during outdoor activities in high-pollution areas can greatly reduce exposure to harmful air particles.\\n\\n4. Improve indoor air ventilation wisely\\n\\nWhile it's beneficial to ventilate indoor spaces, it's important to do so strategically. Open windows and doors when outdoor air quality is better, typically early in the morning or late at night. Using exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom can help remove indoor pollutants generated by cooking, cleaning, and other household activities.\\n\\n5. Stay hydrated and follow an antioxidant-rich diet\\n\\nStaying hydrated supports your body in flushing out toxins. Additionally, a diet rich in antioxidants, found in fruits and vegetables like berries, spinach, and nuts, helps combat oxidative stress caused by pollutants. Nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids are particularly helpful in protecting cells from pollution-induced damage.\\n\\n6. Incorporate indoor plants\\n\\nCertain indoor plants can help improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen. Plants like snake plants, peace lilies, and spider plants are known for their air-purifying properties and can contribute to a healthier indoor environment.\\n\\nBy following these tips, you can reduce the health risks associated with air pollution and create a safer environment for yourself and your loved ones.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

Stay calm and avoid guilt: Manage feelings of guilt or shame. Stressing about overeating can worsen physical discomfort and lead to unhealthy patterns later. Remember, only action can make a difference.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Gentle physical activity and light movement: Engage in light activity like walking. Moderate exercise can aid digestion and reduce the feeling of fullness.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Avoid intense workouts: High-intensity workouts after overeating can cause discomfort. Opt for gentle stretches or yoga to encourage relaxation and digestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Eat lightly for the next Meals and focus on nutrient-dense food: Choose lighter meals that are low in calories but rich in nutrients, like fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. Avoid heavy, greasy, sugary and processed foods.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Probiotics: Incorporate probiotics through supplements or probiotic-rich foods (like yoghurt, kefir, or fermented foods) to help restore gut flora and improve digestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Apple cider vinegar: Consuming apple cider vinegar may improve digestion and reduce bloating. Mix 1-2 tablespoons in water and sip slowly, ideally before a meal or 30 minutes after overeating.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Rest for recovery: Ensure ample sleep, as it is crucial for digestion and overall health.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Reflect on what Led to overeating: Mindfulness can help you develop better habits. Try journaling or practising mindful meditation.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Gratitude practices: Express gratitude for the food, acknowledging its role in nurturing your body, to help build a healthier relationship with food.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Take a light walk after overeating: Walk lightly and wait to eat again until you feel true physical hunger cues, signalling that your body is ready for nourishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his caption, Luke Coutinho writes, “Small wins everyday …. guilt and anger won't solve any problem only action will ….

Chakaravarthy\\'s persistence and hard work have paid off, as he now sees the results in his performances for the Indian team.Tristan Stubbs and Gerald Coetzee brought South Africa home with a three-wicket win to level the series at 1-1 in the second T20I against India at Gqeberha on Sunday.St George\\'s Park witnessed an absolute low-scoring humdinger, where South Africa needed its power hitters to see off the 125-run chase, a straightforward task which they ended up making a complicated journey.On a night when the likes of David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen failed to deliver, the young budding talents rose to the challenge restore parity in the series.South Africa openers Ryan Rickelton and Reeza Hendricks went all guns blazing in the powerplay before the low-scoring contest turned out to be a topsy-turvy affair.Within the blink of an eye, the hosts were 22/0 in 2.4 overs, a complete contrast to the start that India had. The visitors needed a breakthrough and Arshdeep Singh drew the first blood.A slower ball, the ace in the hole hidden in the pacer\\'s sleeve was enough to make Rickelton commit to his shot early and hole it straight to Rinku Singh.Varun Chakaravarthy ended skipper Aiden Markram\\'s painful crusade by cleaning him up for 3(8) in the final over of the powerplay.The runs started to dry up and Chakaravarthy was keen to make the most of the opening. He slipped in a googly past the gap between Reeza\\'s (23) pad and gap to get his second of the night.The magic continued from the mystery spinner with Marco Jansen (7), Heinrich Klaasen (2) and David Miller (0) perishing to Chakaravarthy\\'s stroke of genius. He finished with mouth-watering figures of 5/17.The game slowly slipped out of South Africa\\'s grasp after Ravi Bishnoi castled Andile Simelane which left the hosts tottering at 88/7.South African camp fell to silence as they slowly processed the idea of going 2-0 down in the series. With four overs left and still 37 runs away from victory, Coetzee and Stubbs took it upon themselves to see off the chase.The fireworks eclipsed Chakaravarthy\\'s masterclass which was the talking point of the game till now. Coetzee set the tone by smoking the ball for a 103m six, marking the beginning of a boundary gala in Gqeberha.The crowd stood on their feet with the duo going after everything that came their way. When composure and precision were required, Avesh Khan lacked all of it and spilt 12 runs in the 18th over.With the equation down to 13 needed in two overs, the game was well away from India. Stubbs showed his reach by opening his arms against Arshdeep to wrap up the game quickly.Stubbs started the over with two fours and ended it in a similar fashion to finish the game in style with an over to spare.Stubbs ended the match unbeaten with 47(41) while Coetzee ended the game with a quick-fire 19(9)*.Earlier in the match, after South Africa won the toss and put India to field first, the current T20 World Cup champions were off to a poor start.Pace duo of Marco Jansen and Gerald Coetzee quickly got rid of swashbuckling openers Sanju Samson (0) and Abhishek Sharma (5). After making centuries in the previous two of his T20Is, Sanju experienced the lowest of the lows.India was 5/2 in 1.5 overs. Skipper Suryakumar Yadav could not also stay for long, continuing his hot and cold year in T20Is. He was trapped leg-before-wicket by pacer Andile Simelane for just four runs in nine balls. India was 15/3 in four overs.Left-handers Tilak Varma and Axar Patel steered India through the remainder of the powerplay without any loss of wicket, ending the sixth over at 34/3, with Tilak (13*) and Axar (10*) unbeaten.However, their partnership was cut short at just 30 runs. Tilak drove an outside-off tossed delivery by skipper Aiden Markram, which landed into the hands of David Miller at covers, removing the youngster for 20 in 20 balls, with a four and six. India was 45/4 in eight overs.With the help of a four by Axar on a Keshav Maharaj delivery through the covers, India reached the 50-run mark in 8.5 overs.Axar and Hardik Pandya were just forming another partnership, when an unfortunate run-out ended Axar\\'s stay at the crease for 21-ball 27, with four boundaries. India was 70/5 in 11.5 overs.After 15 overs, India was 86/5, with Hardik (13*) and Rinku Singh (9*) unbeaten.Rinku\\'s stay at the crease was also shortlived as he could make just nine runs in 11 balls, giving Nqabayomzi Peter his first wicket. Gerald Coetzee took a fine catch as Rinku attempted a slog sweep. India was 87/6 in 15.2 overs.India reached the 100-run mark in 16.5 overs.Hardik released some pressure in the 18th over, hitting Jansen for two fours and a six, taking the score to 115/6. However, the next over by Coetzee could give India only three runs as Pandya struggled to play him and missed two low full tosses.India\\'s innings ended on 124/6, with Hardik (39* in 44 balls, with four boundaries and a six) and Arshdeep Singh (7* in six balls, with a six).Coetzee and Jansen created problems for India, delivering quality spells of 1/25 each in their four overs.
