        "text": "Conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar, who is imprisoned over allegations of extorting \u20b9200 crore from an industrialist, recently sent a handwritten letter congratulating Donald Trump on his US Presidential election victory. Sukesh, who asserts he is in a relationship with Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez, also expressed plans to dedicate a $135 million (\u20b91130 crore) investment in a Los Angeles studio to his \u201clady love.\u201d\nAddressing Trump as \u201cbig bro,\u201d Sukesh warmly congratulates him on his win against Kamala Harris in the election. He writes, \u201cI remember during our last meet, a decade ago, you had given me an advice, \u2018Accept the World the way it is or see it the way you want it to be\u2019. Those words ring loud in my ears once again today, love you Bro for always motivating me and not judging me during our meets.\u201d\nSukesh\u2019s letter also mentions that his companies, LS Holdings and LS Gaming LLC, plan to expand their investments in the United States, with a projected increase of $500 million (\u20b94200 crore) over the next two years.\nNotably, Sukesh refers to Jacqueline Fernandez in the letter, claiming their relationship as he elaborates on his grand gesture inspired by advice he recalls from Trump. \u201cI remember your other advice to me, \u2018Treat your women always with dignity and make her always feel special\u2019. On that note, LS Holdings is buying stakes of 135 million USD in a large studio producing shows and movies in Los Angeles. I have finalized this buy for my lady love Jacqueline, just like the advice you gave me, to \u2018make your women feel special\u2019,\u201d he writes.\nSukesh was originally arrested in 2015 in connection with a multi-crore fraud case and has been held in Mandoli Jail. During the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s (ED) ongoing investigation into his alleged crimes, Jacqueline Fernandez\u2019s name surfaced due to her connection with him. Sukesh claims they are romantically involved, with leaked photos suggesting they were close. Jacqueline, however, states she was deceived by Sukesh into believing he was a legitimate businessman and now feels threatened by his intimidation tactics.",

        "text": "South actress Kasthuri Shankar, known for her performances in films like Indian and Annamayya, has sparked public outrage after making offensive remarks regarding the Telugu community. Recently, speaking at a public event in Tamil Nadu, she stated that Telugu people were descendants of the courtesans who had served kings in ancient times, which has sparked anger in the community. Due to her remarks, several legal cases have been lodged against the actress in Chennai and Madurai, stating that the actress has allegedly hurt the sentiments of the Telugu community. The authorities took immediate action against the complaints and legal notices were sent to the actress. However, when local police reached her house, they found it locked and several reports suggest that Kasthuri is currently missing. Furthermore, her phone has been turned off, leaving her location unknown.\nAccording to a report, the Egmore police in Chennai filed a complaint against the GodFather actress under four provisions of the Bharat Nagrik Suraksha Samhita.\nFollowing her statement, the actress faced a massive backlash on social media. Taking to X, Kasthuri shared her official statement which read, \u201cI never intended to insult or disrespect my Telugu extended relatives. I apologise for any unintentional ill feelings.\u201d\n\nMy statement. Jai Hind. pic.twitter.com/KSz0BRxz6D\n\u2014 Kasturi (@KasthuriShankar) November 5, 2024\n\nAlso while talking to a media channel, she defended her words, claiming that the protest \u201cexposed\u201d the DMK\u2019s (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) \u201chypocrisy and double standards.\u201d She clarified that her remarks were targeting a specific historical group, not the entire Telugu community in Tamil Nadu. Kasthuri added that her remarks were directed at subset workers who, she believed, accompanied Telugu kings to Tamil Nadu decades ago.\nFurthermore, she expressed her affection for the Telugu people, describing them as family and accused the ruling DMK party of propagating false information about her among the citizens.\nMeanwhile, on the film front, Kasthuri has worked in several big-budgeted South films including Kamal Haasan\u2019s Indian, Parampara, Habba, Velvet Nagaram, GodFather, Vadacurry, Krishna, Annamayya, Sneham and others.",

Fortunately, the loco pilot was managed to stop the train in time. No one was injured in the incident.\nAccording to NDTV, some people helped the driver pull out his car from the tracks, following which he quickly reversed it for about 20-30 metres to get it on the road and fled. In the process, the driver hit and injured three people.\nFollowing this, the police chased and arrested the driver. The police has also seized the car.\nNotably, this is not the first time when a person risked his life to shoot a reel on railway tracks. Several people in the past have been killed or sustained serious injuries after being hit by a train while recording videos for social media.",

        "text": "Actor Ali Fazal is on a roll! Not only has the actor carved a niche for himself in Bollywood, but he has also been a part of several Hollywood projects such as \u2018Kandahar\u2019, alongside Gerard Butler, \u2018Death on the Nile\u2019 with Gal Gadot, among others. The actor continues making huge waves in Hollywood, and is all set to share screen space with the iconic \u2018Fleabag\u2019 actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the upcoming film Rule Breakers. The project, produced by Angel Studios, marks yet another milestone in Fazal\u2019s burgeoning international career.\nRule Breakers, directed by two-time Oscar winner Bill Guttentag, explores themes of resilience and defiance in Afghanistan. Known for his previous work in \u2018Victoria & Abdul\u2019, and the acclaimed series \u2018Furious 7\u2019, Fazal\u2019s collaboration with Waller-Bridge is highly anticipated by fans and industry insiders alike. The film will release in March 2025.\nSpeaking about Rule Breakers, Ali Fazal said, \u201cI am thrilled to be a part of Rule Breakers and to share the screen with such a talented actress as Phoebe Waller-Bridge. This project resonates with me deeply, and I believe it\u2019s crucial to tell stories that highlight the strength and resilience of individuals in challenging circumstances. I look forward to bringing this narrative to life and reaching audiences globally.\u201d\nOn working with Pheobe, Ali said, \u201cI am so thrilled to be able to support a film that we think every parent should take their daughter to watch in the theatres. And the story being so inspiring, it was no surprise that Phoebe Waller also stepped in. Of course, she is a powerhouse of talent so her addition am sure has lifted the film to greater heights. We play key roles at different stages in Roya Mehboob\u2019s life and journey along with the Afghani robotics team for girls\u201d.\nFazal\u2019s journey from Bollywood to Hollywood has been nothing short of remarkable, and this collaboration with Phoebe Waller-Bridge will only further solidifies his presence in Hollywood!

        "text": "Elon Musk-owned X, earlier known as Twitter, has an AI chatbot called Grok that is available with the X Premium plan. But the platform could soon offer it for more users, even those who don\u2019t pay for X. \nThat\u2019s right, Grok AI chatbot is being tested with free users in select regions, and this has been mentioned in multiple reports quoting different X users this week. Many users have seen the feature work for them on their free X account, who get some basic tools of the AI chatbot working for their free account on the platform. \nNeed Of The Hour\nMusk is really gearing up for the AI battle with OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, and he needs Grok AI to mature and grow at a faster clip, which could easily happen with free users able to access the AI chatbot. The report from TechCrunch also mentions that a user on X named Swak has made a post explaining the conditions that are being put for the free Grok AI access. \nThe platform requires the free users to have been using the app for a minimum of 7 days and link their phone number to the account. The free aspect of Grok AI shows its true colours, as mentioned by the X users, who claim they can ask 10 questions to the Grok 2 AI model, while the same is limited to 20 questions for the Grok 2 mini model. You can also seek three image analysis requests per day. \nThe Grok 2 model is fairly new in terms of its adoption, and X is clearly looking to push its reach and training methods faster. X users in India are yet to get this benefit, but it is likely that more people would be eager to try it out in its free avatar. \nIn other X news, Elon Musk doesn\u2019t like people blocking him on his social platform X, which is why billions of the users will now have a different meaning when they block someone. any account that you have blocked will be able to see your posts. The post says, \u201cIf your posts are set to public, accounts you have blocked will be able to view them, but they will not be able to engage.\u201d\nThankfully, these accounts still cannot interact with these users but even then X is clearly changing the dynamics of blocking an account and most users have shared their concerns for these new rules.",
