                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Under Sudhanshu sir’s guidance, the sport is growing ten folds.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A lot of credit goes to him for the kind of work he is doing for Kho Kho.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The best example of this is the World Cup happening in India.</p>

The franchise-based model in any sport has been gathering a lot of attention.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> UKKL is one such tournament which has gathered the limelight and according to Shri Tyagi, it has been helpful in providing the players financial support.</p>
