"My wife was woken up by the armed men who asked her where I was and when she said she didn't know, they demanded money from her.</p>

Since then, Aruna's family has lived in Rwanda, but he has continued to work in the DRC, often in hiding and on the run but never giving up the cause.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The redwood is felled by loggers primarily to smuggle to China, while the charcoal is sold both in domestic and international markets.</p>

Surviving in the Dangerous Forests

According to Global Witness 2023 report Missing Voices, 74 environmental defenders have been killed in the DRC in the past decade—mostly in the Congo Basin—a hotspot of illegal mining and illegal logging.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

DRC also features in the World Peace Index as the 6th most dangerous country in the world.</p>

Arms for Arms: Case of Myanmar

Sunita Kwangta Moomoo is a Karen—an indigenous community from the Kayin state of Myanmar—a country under military rule and also in the middle of a civil war.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

But the Karen community, which has been demanding a separate homeland for Karen people, has been in an armed conflict that precedes the military coup and fall of democracy in February 2021.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The fights have, however, intensified manifold since various pro-democracy groups started an armed resistance against the army all across the country, including Loikaw, the heartland of Kayin State, where the Karen National Liberation Army is leading the fight.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Moomoo, who now lives in neighboring country Thailand, has family members who are still in Myanmar.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

"The situation is tough.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Every now and then, we have air strikes by the military directed at the villages.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The only way to escape these airstrikes is to hide in a mountain cave.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Sometimes the military also conducts raids in villages, and they always follow a "scorched earth" policy, so they burn down everything—homes, animals, vegetation—along their way.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>"

This has not just destroyed human lives but also the culture of the Karens since their belief system, including social and religious rituals, is integrally tied to land and forests.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> "When we sow crops, when we harvest, when we celebrate a birth, we perform rituals on the land that we own or live on.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Now, those are gone.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The concept of environmental defense, obviously, doesn't exist anymore either since survival has become the only goal of the Karens.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And in the desperate struggle for survival, even civilians have armed themselves.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> "Everyone is a soldier now," says Moomoo.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

"Environmental defenders arming themselves is bound to happen if the state is not able to protect themselves and Myanmar is a classic example of that," says Joan Carling, Executive Director of Indigenous Peoples Rights International, a Philippines-based global organization that works to safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Philippines is yet another country that has gained notoriety for killing environmental defenders, especially in the indigenous territories.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The statistics from the Missing Voices report show that of the 196 defenders reportedly killed or forcibly disappeared globally in 2023, 17 were in the Philippines, the highest toll in Asia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> More environmental defenders have been killed in the country than anywhere else in the region over the past 11 years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Carling, who has been attending COP16, reveals that the indigenous people's body has been demanding the formation of a new, official forum within the UNCBD to ensure safety and inclusion of indigenous peoples as the implementation of GBF begins worldwide.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The new platform—a permanent subsidiary body—will specifically focus on Article 8J of the KMGBF that commits to, among others, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>.</p>

"We need to recognize indigenous environmental defenders as the key actors in biodiversity conservation in this COP," Carling says.</p>

Targeted by the Drug Cartels

Colombia, the host of COP16, holds a dubious record of witnessing the greatest number of murders of environmental defenders.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The country was in an armed conflict with ultra-communist rebels led by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for five decades until it signed a peace agreement with the government in 2016.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> During the period, nearly half a million Colombians were killed and forcibly disappeared, of which 200,000 were civilians.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Today Colombia is no longer in an armed conflict yet it continues to witness murders of environmental defenders.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

On October 28, in a plenary session focused on Target 22 of the GBF, it was revealed that 240 people had been killed between 2016 and 2024 in Colombia for opposing destruction of forests and nature.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Drug cartel runners were responsible for the majority of murders.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

On 29 October, at a side event, speakers from different UN agencies and the government of Colombia drew attention to the dire need for international collaboration to curb drug trafficking.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This, they said, could only be done if the peace treaty is implemented well and in time and concrete steps were taken in collaboration with international communities to destroy the supply chain of drugs originating from Colombia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

According to Jose Manuel Peria, head of green business at the Ministry of the Environment, Colombia, the government has been proposing new strategies to ensure the rights of farmers and those on the frontline of environmental conservation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These include restructuring the government system and building new channels for generating resources for the communities, especially with an environmental focus.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

"There is no longer just talk of agricultural production, but sustainable agriculture.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> We are now building this narrative in the ministries and portfolios involved in all these (implementation of the peace accord) processes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And indeed, biodiversity and the sustainable management of life are at the very center of this process," Peria asserts.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

But Mary Creagh Raine, the Nature Minister for the United Kingdom, who also spoke at the event, said that while the action at the local and national level was crucial, it was also equally important to crack down on the international markets of Colombian drugs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The UK, said Creagh Raine, was one such market for the drug cartel and if the cartel and the violence they unleash on local environmental defenders were to stop, Colombia and the UK would have to work closely to ensure that the smuggling route and the markets are also closed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

"There is still so much to do to ensure that crimes against the environment and people are prosecuted and punished with the severity they deserve," said Craigh Raine.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> "The transnational nature of drug trafficking is modern, agile and highly sophisticated.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If we really want to be effective, we must do more together to demonstrate the same multinational consistency and coordination, Creagh Raine said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

No End of Conflict, No Peace with Nature

The Biodiversity COP started with the overarching goal of "Making Peace with Nature," but can this be ever achieved given the current scale of war and armed conflict across global regions and their high impact on biodiversity?

Answering this question, Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, told IPS that achieving peace with nature is only possible if there is a political solution to the ongoing wars and conflicts.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

"To make peace with nature, we must first make peace with ourselves.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> That is why we have been asking for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, release of the hostages and the massive humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> That is why we are asking for peace in Lebanon—a peace that respects Lebanese sovereignty, Lebanese territorial integrity and paves the way for a political solution.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> That is why we are asking for peace in Sudan—the enormous stress that exists.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> To make peace with nature, we must first make peace with ourselves because wars are won at the most devastating impacts of biodiversity, climate and pollution," said Guterres.</p>
