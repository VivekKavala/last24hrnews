        "text": "Billionaire Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga, publicly switched his political allegiance from the Democratic Party to Donald Trump on Sunday, citing growing concerns about antisemitism and tensions in the Middle East. A longtime Democrat, Pincus shared his decision on social media, revealing his change of heart just days before the 2024 election.\n\nReasons Behind the Support Switch\n\nIn his post, Pincus expressed deep concerns over the escalating antisemitism in the U.S., which he described as \u201creaching levels not seen since pre-WWII.\u201d He also emphasized the importance of Israel, calling it \u201cAmerica\u2019s most loyal ally and the only democracy in the Middle East,\u201d and lamented that Israel could no longer trust the U.S. in its fight against Iran.\n\nPincus referenced Trump\u2019s stance on ending the war with Gaza quickly, saying, \u201cIsrael is fighting Iran on 7 fronts and yet it can no longer trust the US.\u201d The billionaire added that he believes Israel and America will be stronger under Trump\u2019s leadership, contrasting his views with the current administration\u2019s policies.\n\nFree Speech and Media Concerns\n\nPincus also shared his frustration over what he perceives as attacks on freedom of speech, noting that \u201cthere seems to be a war against freedom of speech.\u201d He expressed relief that mainstream media (MSM) was no longer trusted, but warned that censorship on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) could move America closer to authoritarian states like Russia and China.\n\nPrevious Support for Biden\n\nBefore switching his support to Trump, Pincus had been an active donor to President Biden\u2019s re-election campaign. In December 2023, he donated the maximum allowed amount of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund and contributed over $165,000 to the Democratic National Committee. However, Pincus now believes that America and Israel would be better served under a Trump presidency.\n\nPincus Joins Other Silicon Valley Billionaires Supporting Trump\n\nPincus\u2019s decision to support Trump aligns him with other Silicon Valley billionaires who have also shifted their backing. Notably, Elon Musk has publicly declared himself a \u201cDark MAGA\u201d supporter and attended Trump rallies. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who previously donated $1 million to Democrats, also backs Trump this election cycle. Additionally, the Winklevoss twins have donated $1 million each to Trump\u2019s campaign in Bitcoin.\n\nPincus, who lives in California, acknowledged that his vote might not make a difference in his state, which is heavily Democratic, but emphasized that he felt it was important to publicly state his position.",

Born and raised in Phoenix, in a Mexican-American family, he has traveled from one end of Maricopa to the other to raise awareness about the importance of voting.\n\nOn his tour of the town of Mesa, bordering Phoenix, on Monday, Abarca approached the home of a 24-year-old man to ask him if he had already cast his ballot in advance or if he had all the necessary documents to vote in person on Tuesday.\n\nThe immigration issue in the state is what worries her the most: \u201cMany immigrants receive free care while my niece, who resides here legally, cannot receive medical care, and that is not fair,\u201d she told Media.\n\nOn the issue of abortion, another point of inflection that divides Democrats and Republicans, she is more ambiguous: \u201cI am not in favor of it, but everyone should decide what they believe,\u201d she adds. In Arizona, abortion is permitted up to 15 weeks into pregnancy.\n\nDemocratic voters, between fear and hope\n\nThe day stretches for up to 12 hours, from dawn to dusk, as the key date for going to the polls approaches and although they go to up to 70 houses a day, most homes either do not open or claim to have voted by mail.\n\nMeanwhile, an aura of fear and excitement in equal parts spreads among the volunteers as they carry out their work come rain, shine, or under the blazing sun.\n\nThis is the case of Rachely P\u00e9rez, a young volunteer who goes door-to-door, frightened by issues such as the possible victory of Trump, who has threatened a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants if he is re-elected.\n\nOthers, like Fiona Damacio, on the other hand, are showing their enthusiasm for being able to participate for the first time in such a tight election and are not giving up: she is hopeful and believes that her vote \u201cmay reflect a change\u201d not only in Arizona but in the United States.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling on Tuesday, held that states do not have constitutional authority to seize all privately-owned resources for redistribution in the name of the \"common good.\"A nine-judge bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud clarified on Tuesday that states may claim private property only in specific instances. A constitutional bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Rishikesh Roy, Justice BV Nagarathna, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia, Justice JB Pardiwala, Justice Manoj Misra, Justice Rajesh Bindal, Justice Satish Chandra Sharma, and Justice Augustine George Masih delivered the judgement.This majority ruling, authored by the CJI and supported by six other judges, overturned Justice Krishna Iyer's prior stance that all privately-owned resources could be acquired by the state under Article 39(b) of the Constitution for distribution in service of the \"common good.\"The decision addressed whether private properties qualify as \"material resources of the community\" under Article 39(b), which would allow state authorities to acquire them for redistribution. The verdict rejected several previous socialist-inspired judgments that endorsed the state\u2019s ability to take over private property broadly for common good purposes. Justice BV Nagarathna partially disagreed with the majority opinion, while Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia fully dissented.The judgment references the Minerva Mills case (1980), which deemed unconstitutional two provisions of the 42nd Amendment, prohibiting judicial review of constitutional amendments and prioritizing Directive Principles of State Policy over individual fundamental rights. Article 31C supports laws created under Articles 39(b) and (c) that empower the state to acquire community resources, including private property, for redistribution to benefit the public.The court examined 16 petitions, including a 1992 plea from the Mumbai-based Property Owners' Association (POA), opposing Chapter VIII-A of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) Act. This 1986 provision allows state acquisition of cessed buildings and the land they occupy if 70 per cent of residents request it for restoration, reflecting Article 39(b)\u2019s objective of redistributing resources to advance the common good.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Nov 5, 2024",

He spent nearly two decades of my 26 years in politics by my side.\u201d\n\n Amidst the solemn tributes, Abdullah\u2019s voice was filled with emotions as he recounted their journey together.\n\n \u201cI became the President of the National Conference, and Devender was my media advisor. When I became Chief Minister in 2009, he once again stepped into the role of advisor.

        "title": "Harris or Trump will inherit a mixed legacy in 2024 US election",
        "text": "Americans head to the polls on Tuesday in a mood of discontent and division, with opinion polls showing nearly two-thirds of voters believe the country has been heading in the wrong direction under President Joe Biden. While the United States economy is the envy of the industrialized world, emerging from COVID shutdowns with strong job growth and wage increases, many Americans complain those gains were gobbled up by high grocery and housing prices. Biden's promise of a return to a more humane immigration regime than under Republican former President Donald Trump soon collided with the reality of a spike in illegal border crossings. The Supreme Court upended the legal landscape around abortion rights by overturning Roe v. Wade, inflaming one of the most divisive issues in American politics. And despite Biden's pledge that America would serve as a stabilizing force in the world, overseas conflicts have overshadowed his presidency. Whoever triumphs in the election - Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris - will inherit the legacy of a Biden administration that made good on some promises, saw others swept off-course by events, and others still only partially fulfilled. Here's how Biden fared on the defining issues of his presidency. IMMIGRATION Biden, a Democrat, started his presidency by reversing many of Trump's restrictive immigration policies. He haltedconstruction of Trump's border wall; rescinded bans targeting people from certain majority-Muslim countries and other nations; and wound down the remain in Mexico program, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as they pursued their U.S. cases. But months into his presidency, illegal crossings spiked, particularly among unaccompanied children from Central America, overwhelming U.S. border processing centers and fueling Republican criticism. Illegal crossings reached record levels in 2022 and 2023 as more migrants arrived from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and countries outside the hemisphere. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, in 2022 beganbusing arriving migrants north to Democratic cities including New York City and Chicago, which struggled to house them. In January, Biden backed a bipartisan bill that aimed to tighten border security. After the bill was defeated in the U.S. Senate amid Trump's opposition, Biden in June bannedasylum for most migrants crossing the border illegally. The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped dramatically, undercutting Trump's false claims that Harris and Democrats support an open border. Despite the political pressures surrounding migration, Biden created new legal pathways for hundreds of thousands of migrants and oversaw the restoration of the U.S. refugee program, which admitted more than 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the most in 30 years. ABORTION The biggest upheaval on abortion access in decades occurred during Biden's presidency - but because of a decision by the Supreme Court. In June 2022, the conservative majority formed by Trump's judicial appointments to the court eliminated the nearly 50-year-old federal right to abortion under Roe v. Wade. The decision ushered in a period in which individual states set their own laws on abortion access. More than a dozen states banned abortion in all or most cases. Biden condemned the Supreme Court ruling, and his administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, laid out guidelines to ensure access to emergency abortion care under federal law and defended the use of the abortion pill before the Supreme Court. The administration also pushed for expanded access to reproductive health services like contraception through the Affordable Care Act. The administration won its biggest victory in June when the Supreme Court rejected a case brought by anti-abortion advocates seeking to roll back the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, one of two medications used in the abortion pill regimen. But the court dismissed on procedural grounds the administration's case arguing that Idaho's severe abortion ban conflicted with a federal law requiring medical providers to offer stabilizing emergency care, including abortions. In October, the court declined to hear a similar administration case about Texas' strict abortion ban. While devoutly Catholic Biden was openly uncomfortable about abortion from early in his political career, mitigating the impacts of the dissolution of Roe v. Wade has become a pillar of his presidency. Democrats more broadly made abortion rights central to their platform in the 2022 midterm elections. In March, Harris became the first sitting vice president or president to visit an abortion clinic. ECONOMY Joe Biden may go down in history as overseeing the best economy that everyone hated. Since 2021, as the country emerged from a global pandemic that briefly created historic job losses and brought the economy to a near-standstill, employers have added nearly 16.5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has averaged just 4.2%, including the longest run at 4% or below since the 1960s. Gross domestic product growth has averaged 3.2% per quarter, well above what most economists view as the U.S. economy's long-term potential. Incomes and wages have grown above trend. Collective U.S. household net worth has climbed to a record $163.8 trillion, thanks to a booming stock market and rising home values. But survey after survey over most of Biden's term has shown little of that registering with average Americans. Why? Because all of that occurred against the backdrop of the worst inflation breakout in a generation. As the economy reopened, a mix of tangled supply chains, worker shortages and hot consumer demand, supported by roughly $5 trillion of government stimulus from Biden's and Trump's administrations, sent prices climbing - fast. By the summer of 2022, the Consumer Price Index was rising by 9.1% year-over-year and the widely followed gauge of household satisfaction with the economy - the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index - tumbled to a record low. While inflation has receded and sentiment has begun to recover, surveys show Americans still feel the sting of lingering high prices, and they blame Biden and Democrats for it. RACIAL JUSTICE On his first day in the White House, Biden signed an executive order aimed at addressing racism, police brutality, poverty and inequities impacting Black people and other communities of color. But reform has been slow. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics and racial bias, stalled in Congress. In 2022, Biden issued an executive order directing the Department of Justice to create a national database of misconduct by federal law enforcement officers and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the use of deadly force or deaths in custody. It also restricted federal agencies from using chokeholds and no knock entries. While Biden's Justice Department revived investigations into civil rights abuses, which had largely stopped under Trump, it has failed to secure a single binding settlement in the 12 investigations opened into possible police civil rights abuses since Biden took office. On the economic front, Black unemployment fell to a historic low last year. This year alone, the administration directed $1.5 billion in loans to Black-owned businesses. It has also invested more than $16 billion in historically Black colleges and universities and distributed $2.2 billion to more than 43,000 Black and other farmers who experienced discrimination. Last year, the Biden administration allocated $470 million to improve maternal health. FOREIGN POLICY From wars in Ukraine and Gaza to civil bloodshed in Sudan, overseas conflicts have dominated Biden's foreign policy agenda. Biden came to office promising to restore U.S. global leadership in the world and determined to push back on an increasingly aggressive China. In some ways, his administration has done just that. After the chaotic 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Biden rallied U.S. allies the following year to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has also revitalized alliances across Asia to pressure China's leadership. But the U.S. has struggled to bring the grinding conflicts to an end, and hasn't been able to prevent the deepening ties between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Now in its third year, the war of attrition in Ukraine continues despite billions of dollars in U.S. military aid and massive losses on both sides. The conflict is increasingly international, with Western accusations that Moscow is receiving weapons and soldiers from North Korea, missiles and drones from Iran and technical and other support from China. The war between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, which started when Hamas fighters staged a deadly attack into Israel, has metastasized into conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants Hezbollah and sparked reprisal attacks between Israel and Iran. Biden's staunch support for Israel has divided his party and undercut the United States' ability to criticize others on human rights and violations of international law. A conflict in Sudan has triggered ethnic violence and famine conditions in Sudan's Darfur region, where violence about 20 years ago led to the International Criminal Court charging former Sudanese leaders with genocide and crimes against humanity. The United States has been trying to help broker an end to the 18-month-long conflict. ENERGY TRANSITION Biden entered the White House with huge ambitions to fight climate change by transitioning the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels to cleaner, renewable sources - all while creating new green, unionized jobs and re-shoring U.S. manufacturing. Among his goals: put an end to federal oil and gas leasing, expand deployments of solar and wind energy to decarbonize the power grid, electrify the nation's vehicle fleet, and ultimately put the economy on a path to become carbon-neutral by 2050. On the win side of the ledger, Biden signed into law three pieces of legislation that have driven a massive investment in the clean energy economy: the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act, which aims to establish a domestic semiconductor supply chain that could insulate the domestic energy sector from supply shocks. Under the IRA, companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in new solar, wind, electric vehicles and infrastructure, battery storage and other climate-friendly projects that have sped up the energy transition and created jobs - largely in Republican states whose lawmakers did not support the legislation. The administration has awarded $90 billion in grants to climate, clean energy, and other projects under the IRA, or about 70% of the law's climate-focused grant money, according to administration officials. The Biden administration also expanded federal leasing for renewable energy projects, and passed new regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations. On the loss side, his administration's attempts to end federal oil and gas leasing failed in the courts, and his policies failed to prevent a massive surge in U.S. oil and gas output - mostly on privately owned lands in Texas and New Mexico - that has made the U.S. the world's top petroleum producer. And in perhaps the best litmus test of Biden's climate actions, projections from the Rhodium Group show U.S. greenhouse gas admissions set to decline by 32-43% by 2030 under current policies, short of Biden's 50-52% goal.",
        "summary": "As Americans prepare to vote, many express dissatisfaction with the direction of the country under President Biden. Despite a strong economy, inflation and high-profile challenges like immigration and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have fueled discontent.  Biden's efforts on climate change and racial justice have seen mixed results, while foreign policy has been dominated by international conflicts.",

        "text": "The body of the 64-year-old American woman, who became the first person to use a suicide pod in Switzerland, has strangulation marks on the neck, the police have said. Authorities suspect \u201cintentional homicide,\u201d as a forensic doctor found serious neck injuries, which suggests that she may have been strangled.\nShe died on September 23 in Merishausen after activating a device that releases nitrogen gas into the sealed chamber. When authorities investigated the body, they discovered strangulation marks on her neck, which has raised suspicions of foul play. Dr Florian Willet, the president of The Last Resort, the organization behind the capsule, was present at the scene and has been arrested.\nAccording to the Dutch news outlet de Volkskrant, the marks on her neck could be linked to a serious health condition she was going through for two years. The woman reportedly suffered from osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone marrow caused by bacteria or fungi, which could have caused similar marks on her neck.\nBefore her reported death, the 64-year-old woman spoke to the news outlet and explained her decision to use the pod. She said, \u201cFor at least two years. Since I was diagnosed with skull base osteomyelitis.\u201d The machine she used was designed by Australian doctor and physicist Philip Nitschke, who added her condition was so severe it couldn\u2019t be treated. The woman experienced intense headaches that on some days, even moving or going to the bathroom was impossible.\nDr Florian Willet, who was reportedly alone with the woman when she pushed the button on the pod, explained it was opened and closed multiple times to ensure it was working correctly. The woman activated the pod by pressing a button that released nitrogen gas. According to Willet, she lost consciousness almost thirty seconds after pressing the button. Two and a half minutes later, he noticed her body was cramping, which is a common response during deaths caused by nitrogen. He mentioned that, after losing consciousness, it takes a while for the heart to stop beating completely.\nPods inventor, Philip Nitschke said, \u201cAlmost immediately, she presses the button. It is 3:54:46 PM, and she takes a deep breath. She has received extensive instructions beforehand. Everything went well. The woman was calm, everything went according to plan. It was clear that she wanted this.\u201d\nWhile investigators suggest that the American woman may have been strangled, there is currently no official autopsy report to confirm this claim.",

        "text": "Washington: For those accustomed to India\u2019s first-past-the-post general elections, the US presidential election is a confounding system that includes primaries, caucuses, an electoral college, the \u2018early voting\u2019 option, the so-called battleground states \u2014 and no federal Election Commission.\n\nBut there is a fixed date for presidential elections: the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November every fourth year. And the race, most likely, has only two serious contenders, one from the Democratic Party (this time, Vice President Kamala Harris) and the Republican Party (Donald Trump).\n\nThe voters, however, don\u2019t just pick the man or woman they want as President. The ballot paper could include options to pick representatives to the state legislatures and even local bodies. And voters could also be asked to participate in \u201creferendums\u201d on issues before the lawmakers in that particular state.\n\nFor example, legalising recreational marijuana is on the ballot papers in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota. Colorado wants to know this time if proceeds from a sales tax on guns should be spent to help victims of crime.\n\nState administrations conduct elections. So, processes vary. Opening and closing times at polling centres can be different from state to state. And if you think about it, November 5 is just another date. Depending on their state, people have mailed in their ballot papers or used drop boxes to cast their vote days earlier.\n\nIn many states, a driving licence is about the only document you have to produce before casting your vote. An election ID card is just something that Trump wants everyone to possess.\n\nThe process begins months ahead of the so-called polling date. Parties pick their candidates through primaries and caucuses held across states.\n\nTechnically, voters don\u2019t pick the man or woman they want to be the next president. They vote for presidential electors \u2013 a body of eminent people chosen earlier from each state. Broadly, each state gets a certain number of electors based on its representation in the US House and Senate.\n\nBut when it comes to the crunch, it\u2019s not proportional representation. If Kamala Harris wins the popular vote in \u2018battleground\u2019 or swing state Pennsylvania, she wins the votes of all 19 electors from the state \u2014 even if there is space here for some legalistic quibbling later on.\n\nThe presidential electors from Pennsylvania form part of the 538-member electoral college drawn from all states. The candidate who wins 270 or more votes nationwide is the next President.\n\nUsually, the candidate who wins the electoral college vote has also won the majority of the popular vote. But there have been exceptions \u2013 twice in the last six US presidential elections. Hillary Clinton\u2019s lost to Donald Trump in 2016 despite winning the nationwide popular vote.\n\nUnlike the Indian system, there is no cooling off period between the campaigning and the polling, and between the polling and the counting.\n\nSeveral hours before centres opened for polling across the country, the tiny New Hampshire resort town of Dixville Notch finished with its own in-person voting \u2013- following a tradition that allows it to be the first.\n\nAt the stroke of midnight, its six voters began casting their ballots. Fifteen minutes later the vote count was complete \u2013 a 3:3 split between Harris and Trump.\n\nWithin a couple of hours of polls closing in most states, counting trends to hazard predictions could be available from at least some of the battleground states. These swing state, which can turn an election, are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",

Early results based on partial returns may not be predictive of the final vote tallies in the counties.MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONAHome to Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona, is key to winning the southwestern state as it makes up about 60% of the statewide vote. In the 2020 election, President Biden won this county by 2.2 percentage points while former President Donald Trump won the county by almost 3 percentage points in 2016.COBB COUNTY, GEORGIALarge and racially diverse Cobb County in Atlanta's northern suburbs is a spot Democrats could pick up the large number of votes needed to win the state, as Democratic President Joe Biden did in 2020 when he won the county by about 14 percentage points. In 2016, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton carried Cobb county by just 2 percentage points and lost the state to Trump.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");BALDWIN COUNTY, GEORGIAIn central Georgia, Baldwin County is much smaller than Cobb but an indicator of Black voter turnout, as about 40% of voters in this county are Black. This is one place in Georgia where Biden's 2020 margin was narrower than Clinton's in 2016.WAYNE COUNTY, MICHIGANHome to Detroit's 1.7 million residents, Wayne County, Michigan, is about 40% Black. Biden in 2020 won this county with more than 68% of the vote, helping him clinch the state.WASHOE COUNTY, NEVADAIn the northwest corner of Nevada around Reno, Washoe County is less racially diverse than the Las Vegas area, but has been trending more Democratic in recent elections. Biden won this county by more than 4 percentage points in 2020 over Trump.WAKE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINAThe city of Raleigh in Wake County, North Carolina, has boosted statewide turnout for Democrats in recent elections, as was the case when Biden in 2020 won 65% of the vote in the area. That was not enough to keep Trump from carrying the state in 2020.ERIE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIAErie County in northwest Pennsylvania has voted for the winning presidential candidate in the last four elections, including Biden in 2020 when he won the county by 1 percentage point. In 2016, Trump won this county by 2 percentage points.BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIANorth of Philadelphia, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, is another highly competitive county due to its large population of working class voters -- a demographic group where Trump has made major inroads in his eight years on the national political stage. Trump is looking to win back the state -- as he did in 2016 -- but Biden won this county in 2020 by 4 percentage points, which helped him clinch the state.CUMBERLAND COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIAThe suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's capital, have supported Trump in the last two elections. But Democrats could cut those gains in Cumberland County by attracting the area's growing population of white collar workers. In 2020, Trump won this county by 11 percentage points.WAUKESHA COUNTY, WISCONSINThe populous western suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, have been another stronghold for Trump in his past two campaigns and the Republican won Waukesha County by more than 20 percentage points each time. Voters here will need to vote for Trump again at similar levels in order for Republicans to win back the state that Biden carried in 2020.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

According to data from the University of Florida\u2019s Election Lab, as of Monday night, more than 82 million voters had already cast their ballots.\n\nThis election is widely regarded as one of the most divisive in American history.

        "text": "Richard Gere and his wife, Alejandra Silva have sold their Connecticut property in the US after the earlier announced plans to move to Spain. The couple sold the mansion, located in New Canaan for $10.75 million (approx Rs 90.4 crore) and is reportedly mulling to settle in Madrid with their two young sons, Alexander and James. The Connecticut property included two homes, a lovely main house built in 1938 with six bedrooms and a cosy three-bedroom cottage created by famous architect Harold R Sleeper. It also features 11 bathrooms, a swimming pool, multiple gardens, a natural pond and even a private waterfall. Before Richard and Alejandra purchased the property two years ago, it was owned by music legend Paul Simon and his wife, Edie Brickell.\nAccording to Mansion Global, the Pretty Woman star had purchased the 31.8-acre property from Paul and Edie for $10.8 million (approx Rs 90.8 crore), so the recent sale comes with a small loss for him. Interestingly, at one point, Alejandra had considered transforming the land into a farm. The couple had already started raising animals and they enjoyed growing their fruits and vegetables.\nSince tying the knot in 2018, Richard Gere and Alejandra Silva have lived in the US. However, in an interview with Vanity Fair Spain earlier this year, the veteran star shared his wish to spend more time in Alejandra\u2019s home country, Spain so that she could be closer to her family.\nRichard said, \u201cFor me, going to Madrid is going to be a great adventure because I have never lived full-time outside the United States. And I think it will be very interesting for my children as well. For Alejandra it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends and her culture. She was very generous in giving me six years of living in my world, so I think it is only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers. In any case, I love Spain and I think your lifestyle is fabulous. Also, your ability to live transmitting joy and happiness. It is a beautiful place, the food is extraordinary and the people exude sensitivity and generosity, as well as a strong will to laugh and enjoy.\u201d\nBefore moving to Connecticut, Richard Gere lived in a home in Pound Ridge, a town near New York City. He sold this property in May 2022 for $28 million. Just two months after the sale, the actor purchased the New Canaan estate.",

        "text": "Migrants from various regions, spanning Latin America, Africa, and Asia, arrive in the US with hopes of reaching the U.S. to escape economic struggles and, in some cases, threats to their lives.\n\nDiscouraging unlawful border crossings\n\nHowever, the Biden administration\u2019s program, aimed at discouraging unlawful border crossings, allows individuals in Mexico to schedule a time for processing at a legal entry point. Due to high demand, however, migrants are facing months-long wait times.\n\nVice President Harris has committed to maintaining Biden administration policies that heavily restrict asylum for those attempting to enter the U.S. without an appointment through CBP One. In contrast, former President Donald Trump has pledged to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border, which would include ending the CBP One process and other programs enabling lawful entry for migrants.\n\nWhat will the Trump victory mean for migrants?\n\nFollowing the imposition of Biden\u2019s extensive asylum restrictions, illegal border crossings, which had surged to unprecedented levels late last year, fell to a four-year low. Although these unauthorized crossings have remained at this lower level for several months, U.S. officials worry that the upcoming presidential election might disrupt this trend.\n\nSome officials speculate that a Trump victory could prompt a surge in illegal crossings by migrants hoping to enter the country before he assumes office in January. Trump has committed to terminating the CBP One app and reinstating his strict immigration policies, which include militarizing the border and conducting what he describes as the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.\n\nRevision of U.S. immigration policy\n\nTrump has proposed a sweeping revision of U.S. immigration policy if re-elected, one that would build upon the stringent measures from his first term. He intends to carry out mass deportations of millions, potentially involving extensive workplace raids and the use of the U.S. military, alongside a push for more border wall construction.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan would represent a substantial shift in immigration policy, affecting millions of undocumented immigrants and reshaping the national stance on immigration. Since the start of his political career, Trump has adopted a hardline view on immigration, which some see as influenced by an idealized vision of national identity. He has, on separate occasions, described migrants as a \u201cthreat\u201d to the country and made controversial comments about undocumented immigrants.\n\nRead More: Trump Or Harris?

        "title": "Andhra Pradesh turns to Netherlands' gravity canal system to help curb flooding",
        "text": "As Amaravati takes shape, the ambitious capital city project of Andhra Pradesh is taking cues from the Netherlands\u2019 gravity canal system to control flooding. On Monday, the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) announced several initiatives aimed at upgrading the city\u2019s infrastructure, which includes integrating gravity-based water canals modelled after the Dutch approach.The CRDA revealed the details of the project after a meeting chaired by Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, where Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) P Narayana confirmed that the World Bank would allocate Rs 15,000 crore towards Amaravati\u2019s development. However, this funding depends on the swift implementation of effective flood prevention measures.\u201cThe severe flooding in Vijayawada in September highlighted the urgent need for flood protection in the capital region,\u201d Minister Narayana explained. \u201cAs part of this, reservoirs are being constructed across the 217 km stretch of Amaravati.\"In his statement, Minister Narayana stressed the importance of finalising these measures as soon as possible to secure World Bank funding and meet development goals. \u201cThese reservoirs will play a crucial role in maintaining Amaravati\u2019s safety and ensuring a stable water flow, much like the gravity canal systems that have safeguarded the Netherlands for centuries,\u201d he said.The CRDA has started constructing gravity canal reservoirs in locations such as Kondaveeti and Palavagu. Additional storage reservoirs are also underway at Neerukonda, Krishnayapalem, Sakhamuru, and Vundavalli to manage excess water and protect low-lying areas from potential flooding.GRAVITY CANAL SYSTEM EXPLAINEDThe gravity canal system is a method of water management that uses natural gravitational force to direct water through canals and reservoirs without any pumps or external energy. It enables water to flow from higher elevations to lower areas, aiding both irrigation and flood control by diverting excess water to controlled storage locations.The state\u2019s flood strategy also includes plans for new inner and outer ring roads to bolster Amaravati\u2019s connectivity and resilience, despite existing bypass roads.FRESH TENDERS FOR AMARAVATI PROJECTSIn addition to the gravity canal system, the CRDA has decided to invite fresh tenders for all Amaravati projects by January, closing those originally tendered between 2014 and 2019, many of which were left incomplete by the previous government. Narayana disclosed that approximately Rs 35,000 crore had already been invested in high court and legislative buildings, residential complexes for officials, and infrastructure, yet some critical payments had been delayed.

The message stated that if Salman Khan wanted to remain safe, he should either visit their temple to apologise or pay Rs 5 crore.\u201cIf he does not comply, we will kill him; our gang remains active,\u201d read the message, which claimed to be from Lawrence Bishnoi\u2019s brother.The police said the message was received on Monday, and an investigation is underway.The process of registering the case is ongoing at Worli Police Station, with efforts to trace the phone number from which the message was sent, Mumbai Police confirmed.This marks the second death threat Salman Khan has received in a week.In an earlier threat also received by Mumbai Police\u2019s Traffic Control, a ransom of Rs 2 crore was demanded from the actor.On October 24, Mumbai Police arrested a man from Jamshedpur for threatening Salman Khan in the name of Lawrence Bishnoi and demanding a ransom of Rs 5 crore.This incident follows the recent murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique.Baba Siddique, former Maharashtra minister and NCP leader, was shot dead on October 12 by three assailants near the office of his son, Zeeshan Siddique, in Mumbai\u2019s Nirmal Nagar area",

Posters, banners, and flexis have come up in various parts of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad to welcome the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha. Traffic intersections, flyovers and other places have been decked up with party flags, banners and flexis carrying photographs of Rahul Gandhi, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, senior leader Sonia Gandhi, Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, and state unit President B. Mahesh Kumar Goud. Since this is Rahul Gandhi's first visit to Hyderabad after the appointment of Goud as the state chief, he and other leaders are rolling out a red carpet for him. \"We love you Rahul Gandhi Ji for caste census in Telangana,\" reads a flexi with heart symbol put up by Dr Kota Neelima, Congress in-charge for Sanathnagar Assembly constituency. Several such flexis and hoardings have come up around Begumpet Airport, where Rahul Gandhi would be arriving for a two-hour visit to the city. The banners, posters and flexis have also been erected on the route from the Begumpet Airport to Gandhi Ideology Centre, Bowenpally, where he will be addressing the meeting organised by the Telangana Congress. Former minister and Khariratabad MLA D. Narender, former MLA Mynampalli Hanumanth Rao, his son and MLA Mynampalli Rohith have also put up banners and hoardings to welcome Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leader is likely to give direction to the party functionaries a day ahead of the launch of the state-wide survey in line with his idea of a caste census. After the meeting, the Chief Minister, Goud, and some senior leaders are likely to meet Rahul Gandhi separately at the same venue. Rahul Gandhi's visit is significant as Telangana is set to become the first state to undertake a caste survey as promised by him in the elections. He is expected to give directions to the party leaders on the need to successfully undertake the exercise as the party is keen to project the Telangana model to replicate the same in other states ruled by it. A comprehensive door-to-door household survey (socio, educational, economic, employment, political, and caste survey) of the entire state will be undertaken from November 6. More than 85,000 government employees will conduct the survey for which the Planning Department has been designated as the nodal department. (With inputs from IANS)",

        "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris has built a significant net worth of approximately $8 million, according to Forbes. Her wealth stems primarily from her long career in public service, book royalties, and strategic investments, alongside her husband, Douglas Emhoff, a former entertainment lawyer.\n\nCareer and Income Sources\n\nHarris, 60, has dedicated most of her adult life to public service, beginning as the District Attorney of San Francisco before becoming California\u2019s Attorney General and later serving as U.S. Senator. In 2020, she became the Vice President of the United States under President Joe Biden.\n\nDuring her tenure as San Francisco District Attorney from 2004 to 2010, Harris earned around $200,000 annually. She accepted a pay cut when she transitioned to California Attorney General, with an annual salary of $159,000. In 2016, she was elected to the Senate, where she earned $174,000 per year. As Vice President, Harris now receives a salary of $235,100 annually.\n\nHer husband, Douglas Emhoff, also 60, had a successful career as an entertainment lawyer for three decades before stepping back to support Harris in her political career.\n\nPublic Disclosures and Investments\n\nHarris has consistently disclosed her income and assets in forms submitted to the Office of Government Ethics. According to the 2023 public disclosure report, Harris takes a conservative approach to investing, favoring passively managed index funds. These funds were part of two deferred compensation plans she accrued during her time working in California, alongside certain pension plans. Her total pension assets are valued at less than $1 million.\n\nEmhoff also has a similar investment strategy, with over 30 investments, most of which are passively managed. Both Harris and Emhoff have cash holdings ranging from $850,000 or more, as indicated in their financial disclosures. An analysis of their combined assets, including retirement accounts and other investments, estimated their holdings at between $2.9 million and $6.6 million.\n\nThe couple also holds a family trust, named The KDH/DCE Family Trust, although the exact value of the trust is not disclosed in the public filing.\n\nGifts and Royalties\n\nAmong the more interesting entries in their financial disclosure forms is a gift from music superstar Beyonc\u00e9, who gifted Harris concert tickets valued at $1,655.92. This gift is notable as \u201cFreedom\u201d by Beyonc\u00e9 is the campaign song for Harris\u2019 presidential run, and the singer has publicly endorsed Harris.\n\nAdditionally, Harris received football game tickets worth $1,890 from ESPN for a game between Florida A&M University and her alma mater, Howard University.\n\nHarris has earned more than $500,000 in royalties from her books, which include Smart on Crime, Superheroes are Everywhere (a 2019 children\u2019s book), and her memoir The Truths We Hold.\n\nReal Estate Holdings\n\nHarris and Emhoff also own a home in Los Angeles valued at over $4 million, according to Forbes, adding to their overall wealth.\n\nIn summary, Harris\u2019 financial portfolio is built on a steady stream of income from her public service roles, book earnings, royalties, investments in index funds, and various gifts. While her wealth is modest compared to some, it is the result of decades of public service and careful financial management.\n\nRead More : A Systematic Breakdown Of Donald Trump\u2019s Net Worth, From His DJT Stock To Real Estate Holdings",

        "text": "IANS Bhavish Aggarwal-run Ola Electric Mobility saw its share nosedive further to a fresh low of Rs 74.18 apiece on Tuesday after touching Rs 73.84 during the intra-day trading -- losing almost 8.5 per cent in a day. The scrip of the EV firm has so far plunged 53.2 per cent from its all-time high value of Rs 157.47. The company will announce its second quarter (Q2) FY25 results on November 8. \"We wish to inform you that a meeting of the Board of Directors of Ola Electric Mobility Ltd is scheduled to be held on Friday, November 8, 2024, inter alia, to consider and approve the unaudited standalone and consolidated financial results of the company for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2024, along with the Limited Review Report of the Auditors thereon,\" it said in a stock exchange filing. IANS According to market experts, the company's stock can further slip towards the Rs 70-mark. IT made its public debut at Rs 76. The stock is in a weak position and remains in a 'no-trade' zone, said market analysts. Ola Electric's share slipped below the issue price of Rs 76 on October 29 for the first time in its listing history. Ola Electric's shares were listed in the stock market in August this year. After listing, a sharp rally was seen in Ola Electric and the counter touched an all-time high of Rs 157.40 before starting a steep fall and has slipped almost 50 per cent from its highest level. According to market experts, if Ola's stock remains below its IPO price of Rs 76 for a few days, it may see a further decline due to selling by institutional investors and retail investors. \"Selling is being seen in shares at every level. Due to continued weakness, investors should stay away from this stock and invest in companies with strong fundamentals,\" they added. The reason for the weakness in the shares of Ola Electric is being attributed to the company's weak sales figures and poor service.

        "text": "The Opposition lawmakers, who are part of the Parliamentary committee on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Tuesday to register their protest against 'unilateral' decisions taken by the panel chairman and BJP MP Jagdambika Pal. Opposition MPs from parties including Congress, DMK, TMC, AAP and SP met Om Birla on Tuesday and complained about the 'arbitrary' behaviour of committee chairman Jagdambika Pal. As per reports, the Opposition MPs alleged that the JPC Chairman is arbitrarily calling the meetings and inviting those people and organisations for presenting their views, who are not stakeholders in this matter. They also claimed that the Opposition lawmakers were being denied the proper opportunity to speak and also their views were not being paid heed upon. After meeting Speaker Om Birla, AAP MP Sanjay Singh told the media that a delegation of Opposition Parliamentarians impressed upon the Speaker about the problems and challenges being faced in the JPC meetings. Singh said that the Speaker has assured the Opposition MPs of discussing the things out and finding a solution soon. The Opposition MPs of the JPC scrutinising the Waqf Amendment Bill are also understood to have submitted a letter to the Om Birla, listing their complaints and grievances regarding the amendments. In the letter signed by the Opposition lawmakers, they have raised multiple allegations against the JPC chief. Meanwhile, Jagdambika Pal has refuted all the charges and said that the Opposition MPs who levelled these charges are continuously attending these meetings and being given ample opportunity to speak and share their views on Waqf amendments. Notably, the JPC's proceedings have lately been marred by frequent protests from the Opposition members over a host of issues. BJP members have rejected these charges and accused the Opposition of scuttling the progress made in past JPC meetings. The panel is expected to submit its report by the first week of Parliament's Winter Session. (With inputs from IANS)",

        "text": "A person, who earlier threatened Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, has been traced to Karnataka. The Mumbai Police officials have identified the origin of the message received on the traffic police control to be from Karnataka. After this, a team of cops has been dispatched to nab the culprit in the bordering state of Maharashtra. This is the third such incident in a span of 3 weeks where different people have threatened the Bollywood superstar demanding money from him in exchange for \"security\". Earlier, a person who allegedly issued death threats to Salman was nabbed from NOIDA in the NCR region. Prior to that, a person from Jharkhand sent threatening messages to Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, and later issued an apology. Earlier, the person in question had portrayed himself to be a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, and had asked for Rs 5 crore to settle the matter. The traffic police had received a message stating that the message shouldn't be taken lightly, and if Salman wants to end the feud with Lawrence then he has to pay Rs 5 crore to settle the matter. The message further stated that if Salman fails to do so then he will face a similar fate as slain politician Baba Siddique. Baba Siddique, who joined Ajit Pawar faction of NCP, died after being shot at by unidentified persons on October 12. The firing took place outside his MLA son Zeeshan Siddique's office near Colgate ground in Nirmal Nagar in the Bandra area of Mumbai. Salman and Baba Siddique were close friends as the politician held the constituency where Salman lives. Baba Siddique's Iftar parties were considered one of the high profile events of India's entertainment capital. Several media reports state that Salman, who will be seen in a cameo appearance as Chulbul Pandey in the upcoming Rohit Shetty directorial 'Singham Again', is spending sleepless nights after Baba's assassination as he was his close friend.

        "text": "A significant development emerged regarding the Noida International Airport (NIA) under construction in Jewar, Greater Noida. In a gesture of respect and acknowledgment, the farmers who have contributed their land for the construction of the airport will be the first passengers on its inaugural flight. The Uttar Pradesh government confirmed this as part of a special plan to honour these farmers, whose land is crucial to the airport\u2019s development.\nThe inaugural flight, set to take off once the airport becomes operational, will be a special IndiGo flight. The government selected this airline as a symbol of appreciation for the landowners. As a part of the launch ceremony, the first flight will include Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and several other VIPs, who will join the farmers on their maiden air journey from Noida to Lucknow.\nIn a further move to honour the contribution of the farmers, the second flight from the airport will be entirely dedicated to them. This flight, which will have a total of 210 seats, will prioritise those farmers who directly gave up their land for the airport\u2019s construction. This gesture ensures that those who helped make the airport a reality will be among the first to experience air travel, making the event even more meaningful.\nNoida International Airport: A Milestone for Aviation\nThe Noida International Airport, currently under construction, is slated to be one of the largest airports in Asia, with plans to become the fifth-largest airport globally once completed. Scheduled to begin full-scale operations in April 2025, the airport will mark a major milestone in the region\u2019s infrastructure development.\nFrom day one, 30 flights will operate out of the airport, including 25 domestic flights, 3 international flights, and 2 cargo flights. The international services will connect Noida to global hubs, with initial flights to Singapore and Dubai. These routes will be serviced in collaboration with international airlines Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, both of which have already signed agreements with the airport.\nAhead of its grand opening, ticket bookings for flights from Noida International Airport are expected to begin 30 days before the commencement of operations. Travellers will be able to book tickets for both domestic and international flights starting at that time.\nKey Dates and Airport Timeline\nThe Noida International Airport has made rapid progress since its inception. The foundation stone for the airport was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 26, 2021. Since then, a major portion of the construction work has been completed, with final touches being added to ensure the airport is ready for operations. When it opens, the Noida International Airport will serve as a critical hub for both domestic and international flights, contributing to the region\u2019s economic growth and connectivity.\nOnce operational, the airport will be managed by the Noida International Airport Authority, which is overseeing the development of the site. Construction is progressing at full speed, with strict oversight from relevant authorities to ensure the airport meets both international standards and local expectations.\nA Game-Changer for Greater Noida\nThe Noida International Airport is set to redefine the aviation landscape, providing a much-needed air traffic hub for the northern region. With its ambitious expansion plans, it promises to boost tourism, trade, and overall economic activity, positioning Greater Noida as a key player in the global aviation industry.",

        "text": "Washington: For those accustomed to India's first-past-the-post general elections, the US presidential election is a confounding system that includes primaries, caucuses, an electoral college, the early voting' option, the so-called battleground states -- and no federal Election Commission. But there is a fixed date for presidential elections: the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November every fourth year. And the race, most likely, has only two serious contenders, one from the Democratic Party (this time, Vice President Kamala Harris) and the Republican Party (Donald Trump). The voters, however, don't just pick the man or woman they want as President. The ballot paper could include options to pick representatives to the state legislatures and even local bodies. And voters could also be asked to participate in referendums on issues before the lawmakers in that particular state. For example, legalising recreational marijuana is on the ballot papers in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota. Colorado wants to know this time if proceeds from a sales tax on guns should be spent to help victims of crime. State administrations conduct elections. So, processes vary. Opening and closing times at polling centres can be different from state to state. And if you think about it, November 5 is just another date. Depending on their state, people have mailed in their ballot papers or used drop boxes to cast their vote days earlier. In many states, a driving licence is about the only document you have to produce before casting your vote. An election ID card is just something that Trump wants everyone to possess. The process begins months ahead of the so-called polling date. Parties pick their candidates through primaries and caucuses held across states. Technically, voters don't pick the man or woman they want to be the next president. They vote for presidential electors a body of eminent people chosen earlier from each state. Broadly, each state gets a certain number of electors based on its representation in the US House and Senate. But when it comes to the crunch, it's not proportional representation. If Kamala Harris wins the popular vote in battleground' or swing state Pennsylvania, she wins the votes of all 19 electors from the state -- even if there is space here for some legalistic quibbling later on. The presidential electors from Pennsylvania form part of the 538-member electoral college drawn from all states. The candidate who wins 270 or more votes nationwide is the next President. Usually, the candidate who wins the electoral college vote has also won the majority of the popular vote. But there have been exceptions twice in the last six US presidential elections. Hillary Clinton's lost to Donald Trump in 2016 despite winning the nationwide popular vote. Unlike the Indian system, there is no cooling off period between the campaigning and the polling, and between the polling and the counting. Several hours before centres opened for polling across the country, the tiny New Hampshire resort town of Dixville Notch finished with its own in-person voting - following a tradition that allows it to be the first. At the stroke of midnight, its six voters began casting their ballots. Fifteen minutes later the vote count was complete a 3:3 split between Harris and Trump. Within a couple of hours of polls closing in most states, counting trends to hazard predictions could be available from at least some of the battleground states. These swing state, which can turn an election, are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",

Despite Musk promoting his upcoming interview with Joe Rogan and inviting audience questions, the audio failed when the operator attempted to connect listeners.\n\nMusk\u2019s Optimism Quickly Derailed\n\nWhen asked if he believed Trump would win the election, Musk expressed confidence, saying, \u201cWell, I think if people vote tomorrow, we\u2019re definitely going to win.\u201d However, the event was soon abandoned after technical glitches continued to plague the stream. Musk quickly announced, \u201cLet\u2019s cancel this, since we seem to be having some technical issues.\u201d\n\nFollow-Up Stream Also Fails\n\nAfter canceling the town hall, Musk attempted to salvage the situation by launching an X Spaces stream. That, too, flopped after a full minute of silence. Musk then pivoted to discuss unrelated topics, including a viral story about a euthanized squirrel, and redirected followers to his earlier interview with Rogan, where the podcaster had endorsed Trump.\n\nRecurrent Technical Issues Spark Online Criticism\n\nThis isn\u2019t Musk\u2019s first brush with technical mishaps during election-related events on X. In August, a similar issue delayed an interview with Trump by 40 minutes, with some speculating that it was a result of a cyberattack, while others attributed it to user overload. A glitch-riddled launch of Ron DeSantis\u2019 campaign on the platform last year also saw a 25-minute delay. These ongoing failures raise questions about Musk\u2019s ability to manage tech infrastructure, even as he pushes X as a platform for political engagement.\n\nNetizens React to Musk\u2019s \u2018Govt Efficiency\u2019 Promise\n\nThe repeated technical failures led many to question how Musk, who has positioned himself as a champion of \u201cgovernment efficiency,\u201d can handle such issues. One user tweeted, \u201cHe can\u2019t even organise a group call despite being the owner of one of the biggest social networks and multiple technology companies in the world.\u201d Another added, \u201cOh, the irony. I thought he was a tech genius.\u201d\n\nThese glitches underscore the technical challenges X faces under Musk\u2019s leadership, despite his vision to make the platform central to political discourse.",

        "text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday (November 5, 2024) alleged that the Congress is not bothered about electoral victory or defeat, and its only intention is to put hurdles in the State\u2019s development.\n\nLikening the Opposition party to a \"male cow\" that cannot produce milk, he claimed that the Congress will not be able to bring development even if it gets votes.\n\nAddressing his first rally for the State\u2019s by-elections at Dholai, Mr. Sarma said, \u201cThe Congress has no issue this election. They are not bothered about victory or defeat. They only want to hamper development. They don\u2019t want poor people to get government benefits.\u201d \n\n\"The Congress should sit at home and take rest. They won\u2019t come to power for another 50 years,\u201d Mr. Sarma, who had been busy with Assembly polls in Jharkhand as the BJP\u2019s co-in-charge there, added.\n\nMr. Sarma claimed that the grand old party incited violence in the state earlier, which has been effectively controlled by the BJP-led government.\n\n\u201cThe Congress was busy creating conflicts between Assamese and Bengali people. Such conflicts are no longer there. There is no difference between Brahmaputra valley and Barak valley now. The same development is happening everywhere,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BJP leader urged the people to vote for the party\u2019s candidate Nihar Ranjan Das, claiming that uninterrupted, accelerated development of the constituency can be ensured if the MLA is from the ruling party.\n\n\u201cIf an MLA or an MP both are from BJP, with BJP governments at Dispur and Delhi, they will work together. But if the Congress candidate wins, he will later say that he cannot get things done as the BJP is in power in the state and at the Centre,\u201d the CM added.\n\n\u201cThe Congress is like a male cow, you can feed it as much as you want, but it cannot give you milk. Similarly, you can vote for the Congress, but it cannot give you development,\u201d Sarma said.\n\n The Chief Minister asserted that the BJP has been fulfilling its poll promises, including providing one lakh government jobs, and all assurances will be implemented before the next Assembly elections in 2026.\n\nBy-elections are scheduled in five Assembly constituencies of the State on November 13.\n\nBesides Dholai, the BJP has fielded candidates in Samaguri and Behali seats, while its allies AGP is contesting from Bongaigaon and UPPL from Sidli.\n\nThese by-polls were necessitated by the election of the incumbent MLAs to the Lok Sabha.\n\nOf these five seats, BJP and its allies held four, with Congress holding one.",

This develops the scope and, the degree of openness in the Indian mutual fund industry.\n\nThis new guideline raised the limit of investment for Indian MFs to 25% of their TAA in overseas funds. In this regard, it is usually made for exposure to a pre-determined amount of Indian securities. Such a methodology would attract foreign money with stringent oversight of Indian assets covered within the foreign funds.\n\nKey Conditions for Investment\n\nSebi has set specific rules for these investments:\n\nCombined Investments: Indian MFs must pool all their investment in foreign funds into one single investment vehicle. There should not be separate accounts or \u201cside\u201d arrangements for different investors.\n\nBlind Pool System: Foreign mutual funds must function as blind pools, meaning they cannot have separate portfolios for each investor. This ensures that all investors share the returns equally based on how much they invest.\n\nAdvisory Limitations: To avoid conflicts of interest, Sebi has banned advisory agreements between Indian MFs and foreign funds. This will protect the interests of all investors and ensure fair decision-making.\n\nMonitoring Compliance\n\nIf an overseas fund exceeds the 25% limit on Indian securities, Indian MFs will be granted an observation period of six months during which the fund\u2019s rebalancing actions can be monitored. At this time, the offending overseas fund cannot have new subscriptions until it has brought its exposure below the regulation limit.\n\nThe introduction of these guidelines now opens a new chapter for Indian MFs, which will facilitate them to better diversify their portfolios while there will also be stringent rules safeguarding investments.\n\nAlso, Read: Gold Prices in India May Hit New Highs by Next Diwali",

        "title": "US Presidential Elections 2024: How Crucial Are The Indian-American Voters?",
        "text": "There are roughly 5.2 million Indian Americans in the US, forming the second-largest immigrant group in the country, after Mexicans. The community has played an important role in the country\u2019s politics, with many presidential candidates and Congressmen elected from the community.\nHistorically, Indian Americans have favoured the Democratic Party in overwhelming numbers. But the Republican Party feels that their votes can be tapped into over the party\u2019s stand on economy, social issues, and India-US bilateral relations.\nThe Mood Of The Indian Americans This Election\nMilan Vaishnav, senior fellow and Director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told ANI that Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Michigan are important swing states where Indian Americans are large enough in numbers to be greater than the margin between the two Presidential nominees.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Carnegie Endowment International Peace in October 2024, which was a follow up to a survey done in 2020, 47% of respondents identify as Democrats, down from 56% in 2020. The share of Republican identifiers has held steady while the percentage of independents has grown.\nThe 2024 survey also highlighted that 61% of registered Indian-American voter respondents plan to vote for Harris while 32% intend to vote for Trump. There has been a modest shift in the community\u2019s preferences, with a greater share of respondents willing to vote for Trump since the last 2020 election.\nThe survey showed 67% women of Indian-American voter respondents intend to vote for Harris compared to 53% of men. Twenty-two percent of women intend to vote for Trump while 39% plan to cast their ballots for him.\nThe data suggest that the Indian-American community holds a dim view of the Republican Party. The party is out of sync with the multiple policy positions held by the members of the community.\nThe survey also stressed that abortion and reproductive rights are a \u201chighly salient issue for Indian Americans this election year, ranking as their second-most-important policy concern\u201d, after inflation, economy and jobs.\nDemographics of Indian Americans\nThere are approximately 5.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the US today, of which 3.9 million are 18 or older. Based on 2022 data, there are roughly 2.6 million eligible Indian-American voters today.\nBetween 2010 and 2020, the community has grown by 50%, making it the second-largest immigrant community by origin, after Mexican-Americans. Of those born outside the US, 70% entered the country after the 2000.\nOver the years, the community has elevated its socio-economic status, making them an attractive target for the political parties. An average Indian-American household has an income of $153,000, more than double the figure for the country as a whole.\nHarris vs Trump\nAfter Harris received the Democratic presidential nomination in August, various Indian-American and South Asian American groups have been engaged in mobilising support for her, including through raising funds.\nIn the final New York Times/Siena College national poll from October 20 to 23, the two aspirants are tied at 48%. The remaining 4% are yet to decide on their preference.\nA separate poll conducted by the Financial Times and the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business showed that 44% of respondents trust Trump to handle the economy as opposed to 43% for Harris.\n\u201cWhen you ask Indian-American voters why they don\u2019t associate themselves with the Democratic Party, why is that they choose not to identify with the party that it has long been the natural home for Indian-Americans for the last several election cycles, they say things like and they believe that the democratic party is too weak on illegal immigration, they are quite concerned about inflation, about prices, about job opportunities and a significant percentage of them believe that the Democrats and left has been too involved in identity politics. So, these are some of the things that we are seeing in the data, particularly amongst men,\u201d Vaishnav said.\nThe Carnegie Endowment survey also suggested that Asian Americans may be gradually shifting their loyalties from the Democratic Party towards the Republican Party. \u201cCompared to other racial groups, Asian Americans tend to have weaker attachments to political parties, and recent elections have seen an incremental shift in this group\u2019s voting behavior in favor of the Republican Party, a trend observed among other non-White voters as well,\u201d the survey showed.\nThe seven key swing states which are seen to be crucial to determining the election results are Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada.\nRise Of Indian Americans In US Politics\nIn 2013, the House of Representatives had a single Indian American member. Fewer than 10 were serving in state legislatures. None had been elected to the Senate. Ten years later, the Congress included five Indian Americans. Nearly 50 are in state legislatures.\nNikki Haley\u2019s campaign announcement in 2023, Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s candidacy early this year and Kamala Harris running for president made 2024 the first cycle with two Indian Americans.\nThe watershed appears to have been 2016, just after then-Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana became the first Indian American to run for president. The same year, Representatives Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Ro Khanna of California and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois were elected, bringing the number of Indian Americans in the House from one \u2014 Representative Ami Bera of California, elected in 2012 \u2014 to four. It was also the year Kamala Harris became the first Indian American elected to the Senate.\nSince then, the number in state legislatures has more than tripled. In January 2023, the four House members \u2014 who call themselves the Samosa Caucus \u2014 were joined by Representative Shri Thanedar of Michigan.\nBy and large, Indian Americans have been elected from the Democratic Party. All five Indian Americans in Congress, and almost all state legislators, are Democrats.\nIn a 2020 study, nearly 60% of Indian Americans did say they would be open to voting for an Indian American candidate \u201cregardless of their party affiliation,\u201d as per The New York Times.\nIndian Americans Running This Election\nMore than three dozen Indian Americans are running for local bodies and state legislation elections this time.\nProbably the largest number of Indian Americans running for local offices are in the state of California, which sends two members to the House of Representatives \u2013 Ro Khanna and Dr Ami Bera \u2013 in addition to Vice President Kamala Harris whose mother was from India.\nAdlah Chisti is running for County Supervisor for District 11, Aliya Chisti for City College Board San Francisco, Darshana Patel for State Assembly, Nicole Fernandez for San Mateo City Council, Nithya Raman for Los Angeles City Council, Richa Awasthi for Foster City Council and Sukhdeep Kaur for Emeryville City Council.\nTara Sreekrishnan is seeking to enter California\u2019s State Assembly from District 26 in Silicon Valley.\nIn Michigan, Dr Ajay Raman, is running for Oakland County Commissioner for District 14; while Anil Kumar and Ranjeev Puri are running for the Michigan State House.\nIndian Americans form a crucial part of Arizona\u2019s diversity. riya Sundareshan is running for the State Senate in Arizona and Ravi Shah is running for School Board. In Pennsylvania, Anand Patek, Anna Thomas, and Arvind Venkat are running for State House, while Nikil Saval is seeking to enter the State Senate.\nIn Illinois, Anusha Thotakura is running for school board and Nabeel Syed for State House.\nIf elected Ashwin Ramaswamy would be the youngest ever elected to the Georgia State Senate. Of late he has been subject to racial and hate attacks by his opponents.\nIn Ohio, Chantel Raghu is running for County Commissioner and Pavan Parikh for County Clerk of Courts, while in Virginia Danny Avula is running for Mayor of Richmond.\nIn New York, Jeremy Cooney and Manita Sanghvi are running for State Senate while Zohran Mamdani is seeking to enter the State Assembly.\nIndian Americans running for local offices in Texas are Ashika Ganguly for City Council, Karthik Soora (State Senate), Nabil Shike (County Constable), Ramesh Premkumar (City Council), Ravi Sandill (Judge), Salman Bhojani (State House), Shekhar Sinha (State House), Sherine Thomas (Judge), Suleman Lalani (State House) and Sumbel Zeb as County Appraisals Court.\n (with inputs from PTI)",

        "text": "Quincy Jones, the legendary music producer and composer, best known for his collaborations with Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles, passed away on Sunday, November 3, at his Bel Air home in Los Angeles. He was 91. Following the news of his passing, his family released a statement: \u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing, and although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d\nQuincy Jones, a celebrated American record producer and composer, leaves behind a remarkable legacy that has inspired generations.

Connick remembered Jones as \u201cone of the greatest minds\u201d in the music industry.\n\u201cMy hero. Truly one of the greatest minds the music world has ever known.

He walked around with his heart wide open, and he treated everybody as if they were the most important person he\u2019d ever met. He was the Light. No shadows.\u201d\nHonouring his legacy, Winfrey concluded her post with, \u201cHe was the Mightiest of Souls. His life enhanced mine and every life he touched. That will be his global legacy.

        "text": "The United States is in the midst of a pivotal presidential election as citizens prepare to choose between Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. Voting takes place on November 5 (U.S. time), kicking off a complex, months-long election process that will culminate with the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States in January.\n\nThis extended election timeline includes critical steps, from voting and ballot counting to the formal Electoral College process and Congress\u2019s role in finalizing the results.\n\nNovember 5 \u2013 Election Day: The Start of Voting\n\nOn November 5, American citizens head to the polls to cast their ballots for president. However, unlike in many other democracies, this popular vote doesn\u2019t directly determine the next president. Instead, it signals each state\u2019s selection of electors in the Electoral College, who will ultimately decide the presidency. The Electoral College system can be intricate, but it aims to balance representation across states with varying populations.\n\nNovember 6 to December 11 \u2013 Ballot Counting and Certification\n\nFollowing Election Day, the focus shifts to counting ballots and certifying the results. Given the volume of mail-in and early voting ballots, this can be a lengthy process. Each state has its own procedures and timelines for verifying and counting votes, which often includes multiple stages of review.\n\nResults at both county and state levels must be certified by December 11. This process ensures that all votes are accurately counted and confirmed, offering both transparency and accountability.\n\nDecember 17 \u2013 The Electoral College Votes\n\nOne of the most unique features of the U.S. election system is that American citizens do not directly elect the president. Instead, they vote for electors who represent each state in the Electoral College. On December 17, these electors will gather in each state to formally cast their votes for president and vice president.\n\nThese Electoral College votes are then documented in certificates, which must be sent to the president of the U.S. Senate by the fourth Wednesday in December. This year, that deadline falls on Christmas, adding a significant milestone to the holiday season.\n\nJanuary 3 \u2013 New Congress Members Sworn In\n\nAs the new year begins, newly elected members of Congress, both representatives and senators, take their oaths of office on January 3. At this point, Congress will also receive the certified Electoral College vote certificates. The House of Representatives and the Senate will later review these documents as part of the vote-counting process.\n\nJanuary 6 \u2013 Congress Confirms the Electoral College Votes\n\nOn January 6, Congress holds a special joint session to count the Electoral College votes and confirm the election results. For a candidate to win, they must secure a majority of 270 electoral votes. This session officially reveals the next president and vice president, with Congress\u2019s role here marking the last step in the election\u2019s verification.\n\nIf neither candidate reaches 270 electoral votes, a rare but constitutionally provided process known as a \u201ccontingent election\u201d takes place. This would require the House of Representatives to choose the president and the Senate to select the vice president, further extending the process.\n\nJanuary 20 \u2013 Inauguration Day: The New Term Begins\n\nThe final step in the election process is the inauguration, which takes place on January 20 at noon (Washington, D.C. time). The candidate who won the Electoral College and was confirmed by Congress will take the presidential oath, marking the official beginning of a four-year term. The new vice president is also sworn in on this day, signifying the transition to the new administration.",

        "text": "In a significant address to industry leaders and experts at the 9th Heli Power India 2024, Civil Aviation Minister Shri Ram Mohan Naidu outlined a series of ambitious initiatives aimed at transforming the helicopter sector in India. Hosted by the Rotary Wing Society of India (RWSI), the event served as a platform for the Minister to share his vision of making helicopters a vital mode of transportation across the nation.\n\nAccelerator Cell for Industry Support\n\nAnnouncing a specialised Helicopter Accelerator Cell within the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Minister said, \u201cThis cell will be a dedicated platform for addressing the regulatory and operational needs of the helicopter industry. It\u2019s time for tailored support and faster responses to sector-specific challenges.\u201d By involving experts and streamlining decision-making, the cell aims to make helicopter operations smoother and more responsive to the industry\u2019s growth demands.\n\nExpanding Infrastructure and Fleet\n\nRecognizing the need for significant growth in India\u2019s helicopter fleet and infrastructure, Shri Ram Mohan Naidu revealed plans for new helipads and heliports nationwide. With only one licensed heliport currently, he stated, \u201cIndia, with over 140 crore people, operates merely 250 civilian helicopters. Countries like Brazil have over 2,700, underscoring the vast opportunity before us to enhance connectivity and meet India\u2019s demand.\u201d He also urged manufacturers to establish Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facilities within India, which would lower maintenance costs and support fleet expansion.\n\nEnhanced Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS)\n\nThe Minister highlighted the life-saving potential of helicopters in emergency medical services (HEMS). Proposing a network of over 50 HEMS units along national highways and expressways, he said, \u201cWe are committed to making HEMS a robust part of our healthcare infrastructure, bringing rapid medical assistance to areas that need it most.\u201d This initiative aligns with global standards and aims to increase India\u2019s helicopter utilization for emergency medical services.\n\nBoosting Heli Tourism for Religious and Recreational Sites\n\nShri Ram Mohan Naidu underscored the government\u2019s commitment to growing heli tourism across India\u2019s popular pilgrimage and tourist destinations. He remarked, \u201cFrom Kedarnath to Vaishno Devi, demand for heli tourism has surged, and we are committed to making these journeys accessible and safe for all.\u201d Under the UDAN 5.1 initiative, helicopter travel is becoming more affordable and convenient, transforming religious tourism and reducing travel times significantly.\n\nPolicy Reforms Tailored for Helicopter Operations\n\nThe Minister acknowledged the unique needs of helicopter operations and announced plans to implement separate regulations. Currently treated under fixed-wing aircraft rules, helicopter operations face specific constraints. \u201cThe time has come to establish a regulatory framework dedicated to helicopters, including helicopter corridors and streamlined permissions,\u201d he said. This reform will create an enabling environment and simplify processes for helicopter operators.\n\nBuilding Public Confidence in Helicopter Safety\n\nAddressing safety concerns surrounding single-engine helicopters, the Minister expressed his commitment to a public awareness campaign. \u201cSingle-engine helicopters are cost-effective and safe, designed with advanced technology and high safety standards,\u201d he explained, adding that these helicopters play critical roles in emergency services and tourism. This initiative aims to build public trust and make helicopter travel a preferred choice across the country.\n\nIn closing, Shri Ram Mohan Naidu reiterated the Ministry\u2019s commitment to collaborating with the RWSI, state governments, and industry stakeholders, reflecting the government\u2019s principle of \u201cSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.\u201d \u201cTogether, we can make helicopter travel an integral part of India\u2019s connectivity revolution,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThese initiatives mark a significant step forward in creating a robust, inclusive, and sustainable helicopter ecosystem, aiming to meet the diverse needs of India\u2019s population. The vision shared at the 9th Heli Power India 2024 heralds a new era of growth, accessibility, and safety for India\u2019s helicopter industry.\n\nRead More: Maharashtra Appoints Sanjay Verma As DGP After Rashmi Shukla\u2019s Removal",

She even added that they could fire her on the spot if she didn\u2019t match their expectations for the role. But why is she desperate for a job?\nWell, the woman has only three months to find a job or she will have to return home. The post gained the attention of many social media users, who criticised her. According to her LinkedIn post, the Leicester-based student moved to the UK for higher education in 2022. The woman who was looking for design engineering roles said that she was unable to secure a role, despite 300 applications.\nIn her LinkedIn post, she wrote, \u201cHire me for free for one month.

I have applied to 300+ jobs and got a handful of useful feedback.\u201d\nOn top of this, the Indian student also promised to work overtime and without holidays, just so she could stay in the country. \u201cI\u2019ll work 12 hours per day and 7 days a week to prove my worth,\u201d she wrote.\nThe student\u2019s post caught the attention of social media users on Reddit and Linked In who criticised her for setting a poor example.\nSharing his views, a Reddit user wrote, \u201c12 such candidates for 12 months and the company\u2019s golden. Zero salaries given and free labour. These folks don\u2019t realize the level of harm these kind of posts do.\u201d\nWith Attitude and approach like this\u2026forget about Indian workplace,we are even gonna make other workplaces toxic too byu/Resurrect_Revolt inIndianWorkplace\n\nAnother noted, \u201cDesperate to hold on to a country that wants to kick you out.\u201d\nWith Attitude and approach like this\u2026forget about Indian workplace,we are even gonna make other workplaces toxic too byu/Resurrect_Revolt inIndianWorkplace\n\n\u201cLooking for \u2018design\u2019 engineer roles, and a post like this.

A user noted, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going through her mind right now, in 30 days she has to get a job or else it\u2019s back to India with a huge loan to repay.\u201d",

        "title": "US Election 2024: A Look Back At 1872, When A Presidential Challenger Died Mid-Election",
        "text": "The 1872 United States presidential election, held on November 5th, remains one of the most extraordinary in American political history. It stands as the only instance in which a major candidate passed away during the election process itself, throwing a shadow over what was already a contentious and highly unusual contest.\n\nThe Candidates: Ulysses S. Grant vs. Horace Greeley\n\nAt the heart of the 1872 election was the contest between incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant and his challenger, Horace Greeley, the founder and editor of The New York Tribune. Grant, who had served as the 18th President of the United States since 1869, was seeking a second term. His administration had been marked by efforts to implement Reconstruction policies in the South following the Civil War, but his approach had drawn significant opposition within his own party.\n\nIn response to Grant\u2019s policies, a faction of Republicans broke away from the party and formed the Liberal Republican movement. This group was disillusioned with Grant\u2019s handling of Reconstruction and his inability to push through reforms in government. In 1872, the Liberal Republicans held their own convention, where they nominated Horace Greeley to challenge Grant in the presidential race.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, the Democratic Party\u2014typically aligned with the opposition\u2014also endorsed Greeley\u2019s candidacy. This created a rare moment of unity between the Liberal Republicans and the Democrats, who sought to capitalize on growing dissatisfaction with Grant\u2019s administration.\n\nHorace Greeley: The Editor with No Political Experience\n\nHorace Greeley was a passionate and outspoken critic of Grant\u2019s administration, but he had little experience in elected office. As the editor of The New York Tribune, Greeley was known for his fiery rhetoric and strong opinions on national issues. However, his blunt and often divisive style of communication did not resonate with all voters, and many saw him as lacking the political acumen required to lead the nation.\n\nGreeley\u2019s public persona as a reformist editor clashed with his lack of a coherent political platform. He was a staunch abolitionist and proponent of civil rights, but his views on other issues were often seen as inconsistent, and his lack of executive experience was a significant disadvantage.\n\nMeanwhile, Grant, who had won national acclaim for his leadership during the Civil War as a general, was widely regarded as a popular figure. His reputation as a war hero helped solidify his standing among the electorate, especially in the post-war South, where he was seen as a key figure in Reconstruction. Despite criticisms of his administration\u2019s inefficiencies, Grant had solid backing within the Republican Party and among voters who saw him as a strong leader for the Union.\n\nThe Election Results: A Grant Landslide\n\nWhen election day arrived on November 5, 1872, Grant and Greeley were the main contenders. Grant\u2019s popularity, especially in the Northern and Southern states, made him a strong favorite. On the other hand, Greeley struggled to gain traction in the South and in certain parts of the country, where his alignment with the Liberal Republicans and his controversial stances alienated voters.\n\nOn election night, the results were largely predictable, with Grant securing a sweeping victory. He won 286 electoral votes, taking 29 states, while Greeley was left with no electoral votes. However, the outcome was marred by the fact that 14 electoral votes were invalidated due to issues surrounding the voting process, leaving Greeley\u2019s total completely absent in the final count.\n\nThe Tragic Death of Horace Greeley\n\nJust three weeks after the popular vote had been cast, Horace Greeley\u2019s health began to deteriorate significantly. The stress of the campaign, combined with his declining health, took a heavy toll on the 61-year-old editor. Greeley passed away on November 29, 1872, before the Electoral College could meet to cast their official votes.\n\nGreeley\u2019s death before the formal voting process led to an unprecedented situation. The electors who had been pledged to Greeley were left with no clear direction on what to do next. While some electors considered casting their votes for other candidates, the lack of a clear replacement for Greeley led to confusion and ultimately to the invalidation of many of the votes meant for him.\n\nThe Aftermath: An Electoral College with No Votes for Greeley\n\nIn the aftermath of Greeley\u2019s death, the electors who had been pledged to him were left with little choice but to cast their votes for other presidential candidates. Instead of voting for Greeley, the electors voted for four different presidential candidates, while also selecting eight different nominees for vice president. As a result, Greeley did not receive any electoral votes, and the final tally of votes showed a landslide victory for Grant.\n\nGrant ultimately secured 286 electoral votes, with 14 votes being invalidated due to various issues surrounding the election process. Greeley\u2019s death meant that the Democratic and Liberal Republican alliance was unable to secure any meaningful electoral success. The election results showed that Grant had captured the majority of the electorate, winning 29 states, while Greeley\u2019s campaign was effectively erased from the electoral record.\n\nDespite winning the popular vote, Greeley\u2019s tragic passing led to a situation where no votes were cast in his favor during the Electoral College process. This outcome was a reflection of the challenges Greeley faced as a candidate, not only in terms of his political experience but also in his ability to garner the support necessary to win the presidency.\n\nA Footnote in History: The Only Election with a Candidate\u2019s Death Mid-Campaign\n\nThe 1872 election remains a unique and tragic chapter in American political history. Greeley\u2019s death during the election process is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of political campaigns and the impact that personal circumstances can have on the outcome of an election. It also underscores the importance of the Electoral College process, which, in this case, was thrown into disarray due to the untimely death of a major candidate.\n\nThis event is remembered as the only instance in U.S. history where a major candidate died before the Electoral College could cast its votes, leading to the complete invalidation of his campaign. Despite his early support and the rare cross-party endorsement he received, Horace Greeley\u2019s death ultimately ensured that the 1872 election ended with a decisive victory for Ulysses S. Grant, who would go on to serve a second term as president.\n\nIn hindsight, the election of 1872 serves as a fascinating historical footnote, highlighting not only the peculiarities of the American political system but also the unpredictable nature of elections themselves, where unforeseen circumstances can alter the course of history in dramatic ways.",

On being asked by the media, CM Siddaramaiah said, \u201cYes, Mysore Lokayukta has issued a notice regarding MUDA. I will go to Mysore Lokayukta on November 6.\u201d (ANI)",

        "title": "As Modi govt issues notice to Wikipedia, here are 6 problematic things OpIndia found about the \u2018free encyclopedia\u2019 in our dossier",
        "text": "On Tuesday (5th November), the Modi government sent a notice to Wikipedia pointing out the biased and inaccurate information published by the \u2018free encyclopedia.\u2019\n\nThe notice was issued by the Union Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry. It highlighted the hegemony of a small group of editors and their control over its content. \n\nThe Modi government has asked Wikipedia why it shouldn\u2019t be treated as a publisher instead of an intermediary. It is important to mention that OpIndia highlighted the same issue in its 187-page dossier published on 9th September 2024.\n\nGovt of India puts Wikipedia on notice. Govt writes to Wikipedia pointing out many complaints of bias and inaccuracies in Wikipedia, points out a small group having editorial control and asks why Wikipedia shouldn\u2019t be treated as a publisher instead of an intermediary: Sources\u2014 ANI (@ANI) November 5, 2024\n\n\u201cGovernment of India puts Wikipedia on notice. Government writes to Wikipedia pointing out many complaints of bias and inaccuracies in Wikipedia, points out a small group having editorial control and asks why Wikipedia shouldn\u2019t be treated as a publisher instead of an intermediary,\u201d news agency ANI reported citing sources.\n\nWikipedia, which is owned by Wikimedia Foundation, is currently in the midst of legal cases in India for its inaccurate and defamatory targeting of various organisations including ANI. \n\nThe news agency had accused Wikipedia of tarnishing its reputation and discrediting its goodwill. The news agency also sought \u20b92 crore in damages from Wikipedia. \n\nDuring the course of preparing the dossier, OpIndia discovered 6 disturbing things about the \u2018free encyclopedia\u2019\n\n1. Wikipedia is not neutral\n\nWikipedia in all its communication purports that it is a free-for-all online encyclopaedia which depends on the \u2018wisdom of the crowd\u2019 to general \u2018free knowledge\u2019 for the entire world. They essentially claim that Wikipedia is a free, fair and \u2018neutral\u2019 platform. \n\nWikipedia\u2019s pronounced ideological bias has been carefully and structurally cultivated. There is existing research, including the analysis of Wikipedia\u2019s co-founder Larry Sengar, which has detailed how Wikipedia is not neutral. \n\nThe research cites three prior researches to bolster its case. Research by the Manhattan Institute published in June 2024 by David Rozado concluded that Wikipedia heavily leans towards the Left. \n\nThe Critic Research focuses on two internet policies of Wikipedia \u2013 Neutral Point of View and Reliability. The research concludes that it isthe editors who decide which sources are reliable to be cited and which are not. \n\nThose considered reliable lean Left and Right-leaning are blacklisted. Therefore, a Neutral Point of View merely means that \u2018reliable sources\u2019 are represented thoroughly. Not that all points of view would be represented. \n\nThird is Larry Sengar who has widely criticized Wikipedia for being Left-leaning, unreliable and biased.\n\n2. Wikipedia is tightly controlled\n\nWhile Wikipedia claims that everyone is free to edit, the truth is that there are only a handful of people who have the ultimate say in what content is added and what isn\u2019t. \n\nIt is also a handful of people who have the power to ban edits, ban editors, decide disputes, delete pages, lock pages, override content etc.\n\nThere are merely 435 active administrators across the world who have sweeping powers. There are only 10 active members of ArbCom. \n\nIt is also true that there are many editors and administrators who are actively paid by the Wikimedia Foundation under the \u2018editor retention program\u2019. \n\nFurther, the Wikimedia Foundation pays many of them in the name of \u2018grants for projects\u2019. Wikipedia indeed has a solid hierarchy just as any other publishing house with strict editorial control and editorial lines that the editors and administrators toe.\n\n3. \u2018Anonymised\u2019 funding and its use by Wikimedia Foundation\n\nThe Tides Foundation and Wikimedia Foundation give money to each other, but chart it as \u2018anonymous\u2019 donationsbecause they are not obligated to reveal details when it\u2019s a donor-directed fund.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation has enough money to keep Wikipedia alive and running for decades, even if does not earn another penny either from donations or donations from corporations.\n\nThe fact that the Wikimedia Foundation continues to get donations and grants much beyond what it needs to run Wikipedia, in the name of Wikipedia, points to a few things.\n\nFirstly, the Wikimedia Foundation is spending millions in grants to further its own business interests. Second, it is extending grants to Left organisations with the money it collects in the name of keeping Wikipedia alive and claiming that without these donations, Wikipedia wouldcease to exist (a lie).\n\nAll of this happens behind the garb of keeping \u2018knowledge free\u2019 and Wikimedia uses this trope to skirt the law of the land, especially in India, as would be demonstrated further in this paper. \n\nAccording to the Wikimedia Endowment Fund page current, here are some notable patrons of the Tide Foundation run endowment fund which is noteworthy: \n\nAmazon \u2013 $5 million+\n\nGoogle.org \u2013 $2 million + \n\nGeorge Soros \u2013 $2 million + \n\nMusk Foundation \u2013 $2 million+ \n\nFacebook \u2013 $1 million+ \n\nThe Rothschild Foundation \u2013 $50,000+\n\n4. Wikipedia supports anti-India, anti-Hindu organisations\n\nThe Tides Foundation and the Wikimedia Foundation provide donations and grants to several anti-Hindu, anti-India organisations and elements.\n\nThey have given grants to Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR) which has links to Islamists and Khalistanis and was formed in 2019 by two Islamist advocacy groups, Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and Organization for Minorities of India (OFMI).\n\nThe Tides Foundation has disbursed grants to the Association for India\u2019s Development (AID) which has campaigned for Naxal Binayak Sen, funded Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s NGO and also has connection to separatists. \n\nFurther, Tides has funded AMAN Public Charitable Trust (AMAN) \u2013 The trust lists several prominent organizations as partners, including the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, Tides Foundation, Ford Foundation, Oxfam, European Commission for Humanitarian Organisations, and others. \n\nAman has received funding from the Tides Foundation, which has been linked to various organizations that promote left-leaning agendas, including anti-Hindu and anti-India narratives. Aman Public Charitable Trust is connected to the NewsClick-China funding scandal, where it is alleged that Chinese entities funded NewsClick to disrupt Indian sovereignty. \n\nNewsClick\u2019s founder, Prabir Purkayastha, was arrested on charges of receiving more than \u20b980 crore from Chinese companies. Dilip Simeon,the Chairman of Aman Public Charitable Trust, was named in the NewsClick FIR by Delhi Police for his involvement in attempts to sabotage India\u2019s 2019 General Elections. \n\nTides Foundation also has worked with Alliance India, which is chaired by DY Qureshi. Links have also emerged in the research with the OCCRP, George Soros and the Adani Attack.\n\nWikimedia Foundation funds Arts+Feminism which spread fake news about CAA in India, leading to violence. It also funds Whose Knowledge, which in turn is connected with Equality Labs and Black Lunch Table. \n\nIt also funds Black Lunch Table separately. It is pertinent to note that Whose Knowledge, funded by the Wikimedia Foundation partners with Art+Feminism, Equality Labs and CIS \u2013 all of which receive funds from the Wikimedia Foundation among others.\n\nIt also partners with \u2018Black Lunch Table\u2019 \u2013 which is also funded by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimedia Foundation also funds Access Now. On the Board of Access Now is Seema Chisti.\n\nSeema Chisti, who is the wife of Communist Sitaram Yechury and editor of TheWire, is also an advisor at National Foundation for India \u2013which funds AMAN along with Tides Foundation, Ford Foundation and others. \n\nOther advisors include Dhanya Rajendran of The News Minute and P Sainath. Interestingly, Dhanya Rajendran and P Sainath, both have featured prominently in the NewsClick-China funding case.\n\nApart from funding through CIS-India, we also found that Wikimedia pays individuals like \u2018ArtWhoring\u2019 for collaborations in promoting programs like \u2018Know The Wiki\u2019.\n\n5. Wikipedia does not submit to Indian laws\n\nWikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, has no presence in India. It has declared in the BBC documentary controversy that it is a foreign entity and therefore, Indian courts have no jurisdiction over it. \n\nDespite having no presence in India, it has consistently funded entities and individuals to further its own business and ideological interests in India. \n\nWikimedia Foundation regularly solicits donations from India. That donation, since it comes from individuals, it not against the law. However, Wikimedia not only takes donations from India, it spends millions of dollars in India as well. \n\nAll of this, while refusing to submit to Indian laws. While it continues to toe a rigid editorial line on Wikipedia, it insists that it is an intermediary and not a publisher.\n\n6. Wikipedia is not an \u2018intermediary\u2019 but a publisher\n\nBy definition, an intermediary is not supposed to follow a specific editorial line. It is meant to merely be a platform for the public to air their own views. However, that is not the case with Wikipedia. \n\nFirstly, not everybody can air their views on Wikipedia. Secondly, only a small group of editors and administrators have the final say on the nature of content that is added in any articles, making the articles one-sided, biased, and toeing a specific ideological line. \n\nThirdly, several of these so-called \u2018volunteers\u2019 are paid by the Wikimedia Foundation to further their ideological and business interests.\n\nThe sources that are allowed to be quoted in Wikipedia articles also suffer the same bias, often injected by editors and administrators who are directly paid by Wikimedia Foundation. \n\nWith all of these realities, Wikipedia does not fall under the intermediary category, but the publisher category \u2013 additionally \u2013 a publisher that is actively undermine the interest of India without following the law of India \u2013 financially or editorially.",

        "title": "Meta Opens Its AI Models to US Defense Agencies and Contractors",
        "text": "Meta has granted approval for US government agencies and defense contractors to use its AI models, opening the door for Meta\u2019s technology to play a key role in military and national security efforts.The Facebook-parent company is making its large language models, called Llama, available to more than a dozen US agencies and contractors, including Lockheed Martin Corp., Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc.While Meta\u2019s AI models are open source, meaning they are free for developers to use, the company\u2019s \u201cacceptable use policy\u201d forbids people from using them on any projects related to \u201cmilitary, warfare, nuclear industries or applications, [and] espionage,\u201d among other things.But Meta is making an exception for US defense agencies and their contractors as it works to expand its reach in the public sector and increase Llama\u2019s foothold in the burgeoning AI arms race. \u201cAs an American company, and one that owes its success in no small part to the entrepreneurial spirit and democratic values the United States upholds, Meta wants to play its part to support the safety, security and economic prosperity of America - and of its closest allies too,\u201d wrote Nick Clegg, Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, in a blog post Monday.Meta is also making Llama available to similar government agencies and contractors in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a spokesperson confirmed. Those nations have an intelligence-sharing partnership known as Five Eyes. Israel, the closest US ally in the Middle East, was not included on the current list of partners.The move comes on the eve of the US election and at a time when Meta faces some concerns about the potential of developers in countries like China to use Llama for military applications. Large language models are the foundation of the current AI boom and can be used for a variety of services, including powering chatbots. In the world of defense and security, Llama could help with tasks like data analysis and synthesizing documents, or to \u201ctrack terrorist financing or strengthen our cyber defenses,\u201d Clegg wrote.Meta will not have a say in how US agencies or its partners use the Llama technology, but a Meta spokesperson said via email that \u201cit is the responsibility of countries leveraging AI for national security to deploy AI ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with relevant international law.\u201dMeta\u2019s motivation to work with US defense agencies is driven in part by its intention to further establish Llama as a dominant foundation for AI products globally. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg made Llama open source because he wants to have more control over the next major technological wave \u2014 a strategy that only works if Meta\u2019s technology is ubiquitous. On an earnings call last week, Zuckerberg said he was trying to get \u201cthe public sector to adopt Llama across the US government.\u201d The latest update could help with that goal and also pave the way for Zuckerberg to further develop relationships with elected officials. Meta has been criticized over the years for its role in policing user speech and an alleged failure to protect young people online. Former President Donald Trump has taken several shots at Zuckerberg in recent months, even suggesting he might try and put the Meta founder in jail if he is re-elected to the White House. Meta is also framing its decision to work with US defense agencies as a way of preventing US adversaries, like China, from gaining ground. \u201cWe believe it is in both America and the wider democratic world\u2019s interest for American open source models to excel and succeed over models from China and elsewhere,\u201d Clegg wrote.",

        "title": "Trump, Harris Conclude Final Rallies As Election Day 2024 Kicks Off",
        "text": "After nearly two years of campaigning, former President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to reclaim the White House is now in the hands of American voters. On November 5, 2024, Election Day has arrived, with voters across the nation heading to the polls to decide between Trump, the Republican nominee, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee who took over from President Biden just months earlier.\n\nWith over 75 million ballots already cast through early voting, the battle for the presidency is heating up. In-person voting is now underway, and both candidates are optimistic as they make their final appeals to voters in key battleground states.\n\nConfidence and Optimism in the Final Hours\n\nAt a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Harris rallied supporters with a confident message: \u201cMomentum is on our side,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you feel it?\u201d Her campaign is pushing forward with an optimistic vision for a united future, despite the intense race ahead.\n\nHarris later told a crowd in Pittsburgh, \u201cMake no mistake, we will win.\u201d As the election draws to a close, she emphasized a message of unity and hope, while avoiding direct mentions of Trump.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump, speaking to his supporters in Pennsylvania, expressed a contrasting sentiment, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this. I\u2019ve been waiting four years for this,\u201d as he reiterated his commitment to restoring America\u2019s strength.\n\nPennsylvania and Michigan: Battlegrounds That Matter Most\n\nTrump and Harris both spent their Election Eve in Pennsylvania, where 19 electoral votes are up for grabs. The state has been a key battleground in the 2024 race, as it was in 2020 when Trump lost narrowly to President Biden. In a rare twist, Harris closed her campaign in Philadelphia while Trump wrapped up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, another critical swing state.\n\nThe outcome of these two states, along with Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, could prove decisive in determining who secures the presidency.\n\nDivergent Messages in Final Days of Campaign\n\nAs their campaigns reached the final stretch, Harris and Trump presented starkly different messages to voters. Harris focused on optimism and unity, refusing to engage directly with Trump\u2019s accusations and instead promoting a hopeful vision for the future.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, painted a bleak picture of the country under the Biden administration, focusing on issues like immigration and questioning the administration\u2019s handling of the economy. His rhetoric resonated with voters who felt the current administration had failed them, offering a stark contrast to Harris\u2019s message of progress.\n\nKey Takeaways as Polls Open\n\nAs the day unfolds, the focus now shifts to voter turnout and the battleground states that will ultimately decide the race. Harris and Trump have spent months preparing for this moment, and it\u2019s clear that both campaigns are leaving nothing to chance.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s lead in key swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania potentially narrowing, and Harris\u2019s polling numbers rising in late September and October, analysts remain divided on who has the edge heading into the final hours. While Trump continues to argue that the election is \u201crigged,\u201d he also claimed that Republicans were outperforming in early voting.\n\n(Includes inputs from online sources)\n\nALSO READ: Michigan Hits Record Early Voting With Nearly 3.1 Million Ballots Cast",

        "text": "The historical city of Jaipur is a hotspot for cultural heritage and history. The city boasts a wide variety of notable landmarks such as Hawa Mahal, Jantar and The City Palace.While the palace is vast and magnificent, seven specific private rooms are particularly noteworthy in the stunning Chandra Mahal (\u2018Moon Palace\u2019). These private rooms offer a glimpse into the lavish lifestyle of the former rulers of Jaipur.\nRecently, Diljit Dosanjh, the Punjabi music sensation, brought his electrifying Dil-Luminati tour to the majestic city of Jaipur on November 3. Before taking the stage, the singer-actor indulged in the city\u2019s rich heritage and explored the iconic landmarks like the City Palace. Diljit struck a pose against the royal chambers of the grand courtyards and private rooms, bearing intricate decorations on the pillars and walls. The star shared glimpses of the opulent interiors on his Instagram handle.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by DILJIT DOSANJH (@diljitdosanjh)\n\nFrom the opulent Sukh Niwas to the mesmerising Rang Mandir, each room tells a story of royal grandeur and refined taste. If you are planning to visit the City Palace soon, check out the splendid luxury of these private rooms:\n\nThis elegant room, also called the \u2018Hall of Rest,\u2019 served as the royal drawing and dining room of the Maharaja. Painted in Wedgewood blue with white detailing, the room is adorned with silver and glass dining tables and Mughal miniatures.\nChhavi Niwas\nThis serene pavilion, also known as the \u2018Blue Parlour,\u2019 was the Maharaja\u2019s monsoon retreat. Located on the fifth floor of the Chandra Mahal, this private room features elegant architecture, delicate frescoes, and cooling fountains, providing a peaceful escape from the summer heat. Moreover, it offers panoramic views of the palace, making it a popular spot for taking pictures owing to its blue and white facade.\nShobha Niwas\nAlso known as the \u2018Hall of Beauty,\u2019 this room is situated on the fourth floor of the Chandra Mahal or Moon Palace. It was originally used for religious purposes, and the walls are lavishly embellished with mirrors, gold, glasswork, and blue tiles ornamented with mica and gold leaf detailing, making it a truly breathtaking sight.\nRang Mandir\nLocated on the third floor of the Chandra Mahal, Rang Mandir is a masterpiece of mirror work. This seven-storey palace is the residence of the Jaipur royal family and is intricately decorated with mirrors on the walls and ceiling, creating a dazzling visual effect.\nPritam Niwas Chowk\nAnother particularly beautiful palace complex is the Pritam Niwas Chowk, which translates to \u2018Courtyard of the Beloved.\u2019 It boasts four stunning and delicately painted doorways, designed to represent the four different Indian seasons. One of the gates, with peacock detailing, is among the most popular gates of the Pritam Niwas Chowk, often seen on posters and book covers.\nDiwan-i-Khas\nThis is the official court of the king, with several magnificent crystal chandeliers. The grand hall in the Diwan-i-Khas is a true architectural wonder, featuring marble flooring, brilliant lamp d\u00e9cor, and towering ceilings. Another highlight of this place is the giant silver urns, or Gangajelies, which are also listed in the Guinness Book as the largest silver objects in the world. The original purpose of these artifacts was to carry sacred water from the Ganges to London for Madho Singh II.\nMukut Mandir\nLocated on the seventh floor of Chandra Mahal, Mukut Mandir, or Crown Temple, is the highest point of the palace and offers panoramic views of the city. It is the place where the royal family flag is hoisted when the Maharaja is in residence.",

        "text": "Mathura\u2019s Banke Bihari temple has been in the news since Monday. A video of the temple surfaced online, showing devotees drinking water flowing from the mouth of an elephant statue. This video sparked numerous claims on social media, with some labelling the water as Charanamrit and others as AC water.\nWhen the Local 18 team visited the temple to understand the situation at the Banke Bihari temple, they spoke with the temple\u2019s sevayat (priest) to uncover the truth behind the viral video.\nThe water emerging from the Banke Bihari temple was neither AC water nor is there an AC unit installed within the Lord\u2019s sanctum sanctorum, the priest said. Sevayat priest Shalu Goswami, in conversation with Local 18, stated, \u201cThose who are calling it AC water are very foolish. Those who have spread this rumour are mocking religion.\u201d \n\u201cThis is not ordinary water. When Lord Banke Bihari is bathed or the sanctum sanctorum is cleaned, this water flows out through this drain. The water used to bathe Bihari Ji is no less than Amrit. Those who think it is AC water are very foolish,\u201d the sevayat explained. \nHe further added that any object that touches the Paras Mani also becomes precious. This is the water in which our idol has been bathed. Devotees also echoed the sentiment, describing the water as very special and refuting the AC water claim.\nThe temple video trended across various social media platforms on Monday, with claims circulating that devotees were consuming AC water. However, the AC water claim has been found to be false.",

        "text": "Madhya Pradesh Congress on Tuesday (November 5, 2024) claimed the deaths of ten elephants in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) were \"killings by the government\" and demanded the resignation of state Forest Minister Ramniwas Rawat.\n\nFormer Chief Minister Kamal Nath launched a scathing attack on the State government, demanding that it recommend a CBI or judicial probe into the deaths.\n\nOn October 29, four wild elephants were found dead in Sankhani and Bakeli under the Khalil range of the BTR in Umaria district, while four died on October 30 and two on October 31.\n\nChief Minister Mohan Yadav has suspended two senior officials of the BTR for lapses after a high-level probe team submitted its reports in connection with the deaths.\n\nTalking to reporters, State Congress president Jitu Patwari alleged, \"The deaths of ten elephants was not an accident. They were poisoned. Who poisoned them is a matter of investigation, but the government and forest department are the culprits. These are government killings.\" He further claimed that several elephant deaths were not made public.\n\n\"This government passes a budget for wild animals but indulges in corruption. About 140 tigers have died in Madhya Pradesh in the past three years. It is a big number,\" Mr. Patwari said.\n\nHe said while the government spent Rs 5,000 crore to bring cheetahs, tigers, which are the state's pride, are dying.\n\n\"The government only punishes employees, which is injustice. It should take the resignation of state Forest Minister Ramniwas Rawat, holding him responsible. He (Rawat) is caught up in the election while elephants are getting killed. This is the BJP's hypocrisy,\" he said.\n\nMr. Rawat is the BJP's candidate for the Vijaypur assembly bypoll scheduled later this month. A former Congress MLA, he joined the saffron party earlier this year and was appointed the forest minister.\n\nMr. Patwari said either the Chief Minister should take Mr. Rawat's resignation or the voters of Vijaypur will remove him in the November 13 by-election.\n\nTaking to X, senior Congress leader Mr. Nath said, \"It has been almost a week since the death of ten elephants in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, but the Madhya Pradesh government has not been able to clarify the cause of death, let alone catch the culprits.\" He said wild animals are in danger, and the state forest department is incapable of protecting them.\n\nHe claimed that the investigating agencies of the state are either inefficient or they don't have the facilities to properly investigate the deaths.\n\n\"In such a situation, I appeal to Chief Minister Mohan Yadav ji to either order a CBI inquiry or a judicial inquiry into the deaths of ten elephants. Due to the lack of a fair investigation, wild animals will remain in danger, and whoever is behind this will feel safe. They will dare to repeat such crimes,\" Mr. Nath wrote.",

        "title": "Historic showdown: Trump vs. Harris as America votes",
        "text": "The dizzying presidential contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris hurtled toward an uncertain finish on Tuesday as millions of Americans headed to the polls to choose between two sharply different visions for the country.\n\nA race whipsawed by unprecedented events - two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal and Harris' rapid rise - remained too close to call, even after billions of dollars in spending and months of frenetic campaigning.\n\n Read - BL Explainer. Understanding the election process: How is the US President elected?\n\nTrump's campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, just as he did four years ago. The former president has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected.\n\nNo matter who wins the White House, history will be made.\n\nHarris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.\n\nOpinion polls in the campaign's final days have shown the candidates running neck and neck in each of the seven states likely to determine the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nReuters/Ipsos polling shows a significant gender gap, with Harris leading among women by 12 percentage points and Trump winning among men by 7 percentage points.\n\nThe contest reflects a deeply polarized nation whose divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race. Trump has employed increasingly dark and apocalyptic rhetoric on the campaign trail, while Harris has warned that a second Trump term would threaten the very underpinnings of American democracy.\n\nControl of both chambers of Congress is also up for grabs. Republicans have an easier path in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats are defending several seats in Republican-leaning states, while the House of Representatives looks like a toss-up.\n\nThe candidates spent the final weekend barnstorming the swing states in search of every available vote. Trump staged his final rally on Monday evening in Grand Rapids, Michigan, while Harris held twin rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\n\nMore than 80 million Americans had already voted before Tuesday, either via mail or in person, according to the University of Florida Election Lab.\n\nDARK RHETORIC\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump hammered first Biden and then Harris for their handling of the economy, which polls show is at the top of voters' concerns despite low unemployment and cooling inflation. But he showed a characteristic inability to stay on message, at one point questioning Harris' Black identity and vowing to protect women \"whether they like it or not.\"\n\nHis unbridled approach seemed designed to fire up his supporters, rather than expand his appeal. Even more than in 2016 and 2020, Trump has demonized immigrants who crossed the border illegally, falsely accusing them of fomenting a violent crime wave, and he has vowed to use the government to prosecute his political rivals.\n\nPolls show he has made some gains among Black and Latino voters, despite the historic nature of Harris' candidacy. Trump has often warned that migrants are taking jobs away from those constituencies.\n\nBy contrast, Harris has tried to piece together a broader but challenging coalition of liberal Democrats, independents and disaffected moderate Republicans, describing Trump as too dangerous to elect.\n\nShe campaigned on protecting reproductive rights, an issue that has galvanized women since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 eliminated a nationwide right to abortion.\n\nHarris has faced anger from many pro-Palestinian voters over the Biden administration's military and financial support for Israel's war in Gaza. While she has not previewed a shift in U.S. policy, she has said she will do everything possible to end the conflict.\n\nAfter Biden, 81, withdrew amid concerns about his age, Harris sought to turn the tables on Trump, pointing to his rambling rallies as evidence he is unfit. Her campaign's embrace of viral memes and a parade of celebrity endorsements gained her traction with young voters seen as a critical voting bloc.\n\nTrump countered the likes of Harris supporters Taylor Swift and Beyonce with Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who played an increasingly visible role as a surrogate and a top donor to Trump's cause.\n\nTuesday's vote follows one of the most turbulent half-years in modern American politics.\n\nIn May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn star. Four weeks later, Trump and Biden met for their only debate, where the incumbent president delivered a disastrous performance that supercharged voters' existing concerns about his mental acuity.\n\nIn July, Trump narrowly escaped a would-be assassin's bullet at a Pennsylvania rally, just before the Republican National Convention. Barely a week later, Biden exited the race, bowing to pressure from Democratic leaders.\n\nHarris' entry into the race re-energized her party, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing Trump's lead over Biden in public polls.",

        "text": "Former President Donald Trump has arrived in Florida on the eve of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, where he is expected to cast his vote later today. The 77-year-old Republican nominee, who is aiming for a return to the White House after losing to Joe Biden in 2020, made his way to the Sunshine State following an intense series of rallies across the country. Trump\u2019s arrival in Florida marks the culmination of months of campaigning, strategy, and voter mobilization in key battleground states.\n\nFlorida: A Crucial Battleground State\n\nFlorida, a perennial swing state, has long been a focal point in presidential campaigns. Trump, who won the state in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, is hoping to maintain his stronghold here to secure an early advantage in the Electoral College. The state\u2019s diverse population and significant number of electoral votes make it a critical player in determining the overall outcome of the race.\n\nTrump has deep personal and political ties to Florida, residing at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. His presence in the state on Election Day underscores his continued connection to his base there, which could be pivotal for his chances of victory. A win in Florida would not only give Trump a boost but could also help solidify the momentum needed to carry him through the rest of the election.\n\nKey States and Voter Mobilization\n\nAs Trump heads into Election Day, his campaign is focused on energizing the GOP base, particularly in key swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. His team has worked tirelessly to mobilize voters, emphasizing high turnout in these states where every vote counts. Trump\u2019s ability to turn out his supporters could be the deciding factor between a narrow win or a larger defeat.\n\nFlorida\u2019s early voting numbers have been strong for Republicans, and Trump\u2019s allies have worked strategically to secure critical precincts that could make or break the election results. The former president\u2019s participation in voting in Florida, where he has a loyal following, is also highly symbolic. Many are watching closely to see if his efforts to galvanize the state\u2019s electorate will pay off in a decisive way.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Demographic Dynamics\n\nFlorida\u2019s substantial Latino population and large numbers of senior voters make it a key battleground in the race for the White House. In recent years, both groups have increasingly leaned Republican, and Trump\u2019s final push in the state has been aimed at consolidating support among these demographics. His record on economic issues, as well as his hardline stance on immigration and national security, has made him particularly popular among older voters and Hispanic communities.\n\nThe Final Push and High Stakes\n\nWith just hours remaining for voting, all eyes are on Florida as both parties make their final push for votes. Trump\u2019s efforts to maintain or grow his support in the state will likely have significant implications for the outcome of the election. As the polls prepare to open, the stage is set for one of the most closely watched elections in recent U.S. history, with Florida poised to play a decisive role in determining who will occupy the White House for the next four years.\n\nRead More : Voters Casting Ballots On Numerous Measures Impacting Life, Death, Taxes, And More",

        "title": "U.S. Election Day vs. Final Results: Why Some States Count Slower Than Others",
        "text": "As Americans prepare for the upcoming U.S. elections on November 5, 2024, many are left wondering when the results will be announced and why some states take longer to count votes than others. With key swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin facing delays in vote counting due to various procedures, the likelihood of a swift outcome is low, especially in closely contested races.Factors such as narrow victory margins, state-specific absentee ballot rules, and potential legal challenges further complicate the counting process. Voters will need to be patient as election night unfolds, particularly with the concepts of red mirage and blue shift influencing initial results.The Anticipation of Election NightElection night has become a staple of American culture, with citizens eagerly awaiting results that could decide the presidency and control of Congress. Historically, the 2000 election set the stage for how states are viewed politically, giving rise to the terms red states for Republicans and blue states for Democrats. However, the highly contested nature of the upcoming election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump suggests that the final results may not be known on election night.Why Some States Count Slower Than Others?On U.S. Election Day, voters across the country cast their ballots, but the timing of when final results are announced can vary significantly from state to state. This discrepancy is due to several factors, including different state laws, voting methods, and counting processes.Some key factors are-State Laws and Procedures: Each state has its own laws regarding when and how ballots are counted. For example, some states may not start counting mail-in ballots until Election Day, while others can begin counting them earlier. This can lead to delays in reporting results, especially in states with high absentee ballot use.Swing States: Key swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are often in the spotlight for their counting processes. They may take longer due to their regulations surrounding mail-in ballots and the requirement for thorough verification.Mail-In Voting: The rise in mail-in voting, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, has added complexity. Some states allow ballots to be accepted for days after Election Day as long as they are postmarked by that date, extending the time it takes to finalize results.Close Races: When races are close, states may need to conduct recounts or face legal challenges regarding the counting of certain ballots, further delaying the results. For example, in highly contested states, even a small margin can lead to extended counting periods as every vote is meticulously checked.Historical Context: Past elections, like the infamous 2000 election in Florida, illustrate how a small number of votes can dramatically affect timing and result declaration. In such cases, the final outcome may hinge on mail-in ballots, provisional ballots, and military ballots.Swing States and Counting ProceduresKey swing states such as Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have absentee ballot procedures that can significantly delay the counting of votes. If these states are close, it may take days before a winner is declared. For example:Arizona and Nevada: It\u2019s unlikely results will be available on election night due to their established counting processes.Pennsylvania: Local election offices are prohibited from opening and counting mail-in ballots until Election Day, leading to a potential delay in results.Wisconsin: Similar to Pennsylvania, mail-in ballots cannot be processed before the election day.Factors Contributing to DelaysSeveral factors can prolong the announcement of results:Narrow Margins: If the margin of victory is less than 0.5%, states may require a recount, which can slow down the process.Absentee Ballots: Some states accept mail-in ballots up to 10 days after Election Day if postmarked by that date. Nevada is notable in this regard, allowing mail-in ballots to be counted until the Saturday following the election.Legal Challenges: Ongoing lawsuits regarding ballot counting can further delay results, especially concerning late-arriving or overseas ballots.States That Report Results FirstStates on the East Coast tend to report results more quickly due to their straightforward voting procedures and clear advantages for certain candidates. As the night progresses, states with close races may not report results until all votes are counted, potentially extending the wait for crucial outcomes.Understanding the Red Mirage and Blue Shift The terms red mirage and blue shift refer to the phenomenon where Republican candidates initially lead in results only for that lead to diminish as mail-in ballots, which tend to favor Democrats, are counted later. This was notably seen in the 2020 election when Trump had a significant lead early in the night, which evaporated as mail-in ballots were counted.The Complexity of Counting VotesThe counting process in U.S. elections can be confusing. Unlike many countries where a single tally determines the winner, the U.S. operates on a state-by-state basis. Each state has its own rules for counting, and the electoral vote system means that winning a state by a small margin gives all its electoral votes to one candidate.Electoral VotesTo win the presidency, a candidate must secure 270 electoral votes. Each state's number of electors is determined by its congressional representation, which includes both the Senate and House of Representatives.Summary of Key Swing States:Arizona: Late ballot processing.Nevada: Accepts ballots until Saturday post-election.Pennsylvania: Ballots cannot be counted until Election Day.Wisconsin: Similar restrictions as Pennsylvania.",

        "text": "In a revealing video posted on his popular YouTube channel, former mafia boss Salvatore \u201cSammy the Bull\u201d Gravano praised Donald Trump, calling him a \u201cgangster\u201d and recounting an attempt to bribe the former president that ultimately failed. Gravano, notorious for his role in the Gambino crime family and his later testimony as a witness against fellow mobsters, shared his thoughts on Trump\u2019s character and leadership, sparking considerable attention.\n\nGravano\u2019s Bribery Attempt and Trump\u2019s Integrity\n\nIn the video, Gravano spoke candidly about his personal dealings with Trump. \u201cYou can\u2019t bribe him. I was in the mob, I tried to bribe him, never worked. Never, never worked. And it was beneficial to him, he just wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Gravano said. According to him, Trump\u2019s refusal to be swayed by financial incentives demonstrated his unwavering commitment to principles. \u201cIn his mind, personal financial gain is the furthest thing,\u201d Gravano added, emphasizing that Trump\u2019s focus was not on lining his own pockets but on larger goals.\n\nWhy Gravano Prefers Trump Over Kamala Harris\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, Gravano made it clear where his allegiance lies. He expressed a preference for Trump, citing his business acumen as the decisive factor. \u201cI care about their policies. Trump is a businessman, his policies are great, he\u2019s a tough guy,\u201d Gravano stated. He went on to say that his support wasn\u2019t based on gender, appearance, or race, but solely on the candidate\u2019s abilities and policies.\n\n\u201cWe Need a Gangster\u201d\n\nGravano, who has been outspoken about his admiration for Trump\u2019s leadership style, went a step further by calling the former president a \u201cgangster.\u201d \u201cHe is a gangster. We need a gangster,\u201d Gravano remarked, reinforcing his view that Trump\u2019s no-nonsense, tough approach to politics makes him the ideal candidate. This term, though often used negatively, was in this context a form of praise, referring to Trump\u2019s strong, decisive manner of dealing with issues.\n\nGravano\u2019s Background and Criminal Past\n\nSalvatore Gravano\u2019s infamous rise through the ranks of the Gambino crime family culminated in his position as underboss. However, after being convicted for his role in numerous crimes, including 19 murders, Gravano cooperated with authorities and testified against his former mob associates, which led to a reduced sentence. Despite his criminal past, Gravano\u2019s views have continued to attract attention, and his YouTube channel now serves as a platform for his reflections on crime, politics, and American society.\n\nA Shift in Focus: Gravano\u2019s Support for Trump\n\nGravano\u2019s endorsement of Trump underscores the complex and often controversial dynamics in political support, especially as the 2024 election draws near. While his criminal background might seem at odds with the mainstream political discourse, Gravano\u2019s comments provide a unique perspective on Trump\u2019s appeal to certain segments of the electorate. His straightforward assessment of Trump\u2019s qualities\u2014business savvy, toughness, and an unwillingness to compromise\u2014resonates with some voters who are looking for a strong leader in a time of division and uncertainty.",

Now, they are brothers (Bhai-Bhai),\u201d Siddaramaiah remarked.The Chief Minister further criticized BJP candidate Bharath Bommai, suggesting that Bommai\u2019s wealthy background limits his understanding of village life and the struggles of the poor. \u201cIn contrast, our Congress candidate comes from a humble background and understands the hardships and joys of the poor. Electing him will support the development of the constituency,\u201d he said.Reflecting on his own career, Siddaramaiah emphasized that he has served as minister and chief minister for 40 years without any blemish on his record. He maintained that, despite false allegations against his family, the public would not let such baseless accusations bring him down.In a pointed attack, Siddaramaiah alleged that BJP state president BY Vijayendra, accused of taking bribes by cheque, was in no position to criticize him. \u201cEven his own party members, Yatnal and Ramesh Jarkiholi, have spoken about how Vijayendra amassed wealth. On one side, we have Vijayendra with his bribe taken by check, and on the other, \u2018Looti Ravi\u2019\u2014both leveling accusations against our government. People know their true colors,\u201d he asserted.He accused the BJP leaders of indulging in corruption and amassing wealth while in power, only to now use caste and religion to promote divisive politics. Siddaramaiah challenged Basavaraj Bommai\u2019s record, asking, \u201cBommai speaks of strength and competence, but what has he contributed to the state or his constituency as Chief Minister? People are now calling Bommai \u2018Shakuni,\u2019 alleging that he uses secret pacts to play politics. Such leaders should not remain in politics.\u201dHe highlighted his government\u2019s initiatives and programs for the poor and weaker sections of society.\u201cThrough our five guarantees, we have provided economic empowerment to women across the state and deposited Rs 56,000 crore directly into the accounts of the poor, regardless of caste or religion,\u201d he said.Siddaramaiah urged voters to support Congress candidate Pathan. \u201cJust as the sun and moon are certain to rise, so is a Congress victory in Shiggaon. If Congress wins here, it will bring more strength to me,\u201d he added.",

Radhakrishnan, he recollected how his academy had just one student when it opened in 2021, a number that has soared to 35 since then.\r\n\nAn array of relatively costly equipment, including blades, gloves, masks, breeches, lam\u00e9 \u2013 electrically conductive jacket, and chest guard seem to have served as a dampener though.",

        "text": "A Russian rocket blasted off successfully to carry a pair of Iranian satellites into orbit, a launch that reflected growing cooperation between Moscow and Tehran.The Soyuz rocket lifted off as scheduled from the Vostochny launchpad in far eastern Russia and put its payload into a designated orbit nine minutes after the launch. It was carrying two Russian Ionosphere-M Earth observation satellites and several dozen smaller satellites, including the two Iranian ones.Iran\u2019s two satellites, named Kowsar and Hodhod, were the first launched on behalf of the country\u2019s private sector.

        "title": "US Election 2024: Officials Reassure Voters Amid Conspiracy Theories",
        "text": "As millions of American voters prepare to head to the polls on Tuesday to select the nation\u2019s next leaders, election officials are emphasizing the importance of trusting the election process, despite the continued spread of unfounded claims about voter fraud. In an environment where election security has become a flashpoint, officials are working to ensure that voters are well-informed and that their ballots are accurately counted without interference.\n\nVoter Integrity Under Scrutiny\n\nThe 2024 presidential election comes after a tumultuous period following the 2020 election, where false accusations of widespread voter fraud gained traction, particularly from former President Donald Trump and his allies. Trump\u2019s repeated claims of election rigging have cast a long shadow over the process, leaving many voters uncertain about the legitimacy of the upcoming vote.\n\nAs voters across the country prepare to cast their ballots in a democratic process that will see tens of millions of votes cast without major incident, election officials are on high alert, especially in key battleground states. Issues like voter eligibility, long wait times, ballot integrity, and the accuracy of vote counts will all come under intense scrutiny.\n\nHowever, election officials are doing their best to reassure the public that the voting process is secure and fair. In states with a history of competitive races, including swing states like Georgia, officials are working around the clock to ensure that there are no disruptions and that any logistical hurdles are swiftly addressed.\n\nMUST READ: US Election 2024: Harris And Trump Focus On Pennsylvania In Final Campaign Push\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Commitment to Secure Voting\n\nGeorgia, a critical battleground state, has made headlines in recent years due to its controversial handling of the 2020 election. Despite this, officials are confident in the security of the state\u2019s election system. On Monday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger issued a statement reassuring voters that the state\u2019s election infrastructure is secure.\n\n\u201cHere in Georgia, it is easy to vote and hard to cheat,\u201d Raffensperger said, emphasizing that the state has robust safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the vote. \u201cOur systems are secure, and our people are ready.\u201d\n\nRaffensperger\u2019s remarks echo the sentiments of election officials across the country, who are calling for a focus on facts rather than conspiracy theories. Despite ongoing attempts to undermine the electoral process, experts insist that the 2024 election will be no different than past elections in terms of its transparency and accuracy.\n\nA Call for Calm Amid Election Chaos\n\nIn response to continued misinformation, election officials are urging voters to remain calm and trust the process. Many of the issues that Trump and his supporters have highlighted, such as problems with voting machines, long lines, or isolated cases of confusion at polling places, are being exaggerated to create a narrative that the election system is flawed.\n\nOfficials stress that while elections are not without challenges, these instances are typically handled swiftly and do not impact the overall outcome. The 2024 election, they argue, will proceed without significant disruption, despite the noise from those seeking to discredit it.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nThe 2024 election is not just a test of America\u2019s democratic system but a test of the resilience of truth in the face of misinformation. As voters head to the polls, they are encouraged to seek out reliable sources of information, avoid falling prey to conspiracy theories, and participate in the process with confidence.\n\nElection officials across the US are working to safeguard the vote, ensuring that all eligible Americans can cast their ballots and have them counted fairly. While the noise surrounding the election may grow louder, the message from those overseeing the process is clear: the 2024 election will be free, fair, and legitimate.\n\nTrust in the Process\n\nWith the election just days away, officials are calling for unity and a focus on the facts. As millions prepare to make their voices heard, the integrity of the vote remains a top priority for election officials across the country. And while the threat of disinformation looms, voters are urged to rely on trusted sources and avoid falling victim to false narratives.\n\nALSO READ: Voters Casting Ballots On Numerous Measures Impacting Life, Death, Taxes, And More",

        "text": "In the political landscape of East Vidarbha, particularly in the Nagpur district, the Shiv Sena has struggled to make significant inroads amidst the dominant presence of Congress and BJP. However, Ashish Jaiswal has emerged as a notable exception, consistently delivering victories for Shiv Sena in the Ramtek Assembly Constituency since 1999. His achievements include winning three consecutive assembly elections in 1999, 2004, and 2009 under the Shiv Sena banner, proving his unwavering influence in the region even against the backdrop of BJPs stronghold and prominent political figures like Devendra Fadnavis and Chandrashekhar Bawankule.Ashish Jaiswal, a figure synonymous with success for Shiv Sena in Ramtek, is once again in the spotlight as he contests from the Ramtek Assembly Constituency in the upcoming 2024 elections. His political journey has been marked by a unique blend of resilience and adaptability, managing to secure a victory as an independent candidate in 2019 amidst a breakup between Shiv Sena and BJP. This move demonstrated his deep-rooted influence and the unwavering support of his constituents, regardless of party affiliations. With such a track record, Jaiswal has rightfully earned the confidence of the Shiv Sena leadership, who once again have endorsed him for the 2024 assembly elections.Under Jaiswals leadership, the Ramtek Assembly Constituency has seen remarkable infrastructure development, a testament to his commitment to the regions progress. His efforts have resulted in the completion of two thousand kilometers of rural roads across Ramtek, Parshwini, and Mauda talukas, enhancing connectivity between villages and cities. Moreover, the construction of a 111 km long asphalt road under the hybrid annuity scheme of the state government further underscores his focus on improving local infrastructure. These initiatives not only facilitate easier movement but also contribute significantly to the socio-economic development of the area.Beyond infrastructure, Ashish Jaiswal has also focused on the spiritual and social welfare of his constituents. By supporting the construction of 64 Buddha Viharas in the region, he aims to foster spiritual sentiments among the local citizens, paying homage to Bharatratna Doctor Babasaheb Ambedkars legacy. Additionally, Jaiswal has been instrumental in implementing government schemes to provide housing for women in need. His decisive roles in the Shabari Griha Nirman Yojana and Ramai Housing Scheme have secured homes for thousands of tribal and Scheduled Caste women, respectively, embodying his commitment to empowering women at the grassroots level.Jaiswals leadership extends to enhancing the constituencys connectivity with pivotal bridge constructions over significant rivers like Kanhan and Pench. These projects, including the bridges from Waghola to Ghatrohana, Salai Mauli over Pench river, and Dahegaon Joshi to Isapur, not only improve transportation but also signify the strides made in regional development under his guidance. His aggressive yet constructive approach to leadership has solidified his reputation as a formidable figure in Ramteks political arena.Amid his various contributions, Ashish Jaiswal has not only fortified his political standing but also fostered strong relationships with influential figures across the political spectrum, including top BJP leaders and the current Chief Minister, Eknath Shinde. This network of alliances, coupled with his significant achievements, underpins the widespread belief among his supporters that he will once again hoist Shiv Senas saffron flag in Ramtek. As the 2024 assembly elections approach, Ashish Jaiswal stands as a beacon of hope for his party and constituents, ready to continue his legacy of development and success in the constituency.",

        "title": "US Elections 2024: What Is The President's Salary And Perks?",
        "text": "As the 2024 US presidential election heats up, with candidates like former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris vying for the highest office in the land, one question often comes to mind: What salary and perks does the President of the United States receive? As one of the most powerful individuals across the world, the US president enjoys a unique set of benefits, which go far beyond a substantial salary.\nHow Much Does the US President Earn?\nThe President of the United States receives a salary of $400,000 annually which amounts to roughly Rs 3.36 crore. In addition to this base salary, the President is allocated $50,000 (around Rs 42 lakh) annually for \u201cexpenses\u201d related to performing official duties. These additional funds help cover various costs associated with the role, such as entertainment and hospitality.\nFurthermore, when a new President is inaugurated, they receive a one-time allowance of $100,000 (approximately Rs 84 lakh) to help with initial expenses, such as redecorating and furnishing their new home and office. This sum can be used for renovations and improvements at the White House, which will become their official residence and workplace.\nA Historical Perspective: The US Presidential Salary Over Time\nThe first US President, George Washington, earned a salary of just $2,000 a year, a figure that was considered quite substantial in the 18th century. However, as the years passed and the nation grew in power and wealth, the presidential salary has seen multiple increases. Here\u2019s a quick overview of how the salary has changed over the years:\n\n1789: $25,000\n1873: $50,000\n1909: $75,000\n1949: $100,000\n1969: $200,000\n2001: $400,000 (last increase, during George W Bush\u2019s presidency)\n\nInterestingly, while the salary has not increased in the last 23 years, it remains among the highest for any world leader.\nAmenities and Perks of the US President\nThe President of the United States enjoys a vast array of perks that accompany the position, including a luxurious residence, travel privileges, and world-class security.\nThe White House: A Presidential Palace\nThe President\u2019s primary residence and workplace is the White House in Washington, DC. This iconic mansion, located on an 18-acre plot of land, is where the President lives rent-free. The sprawling estate includes lavish rooms, gardens, and extensive office spaces. Along with the White House, the President also has access to Camp David, a secluded retreat in the Maryland countryside, often used for rest or hosting important guests.\nEntertainment and Staff\nThe President\u2019s annual budget includes $19,000 for entertainment, which covers various activities, including hosting dignitaries, organising events, and maintaining staff for cooking and hospitality. These funds ensure that the President and their guests are well taken care of during official functions or private events.\nHealth and Medical Care\nHealthcare is provided free of charge to the US President and their immediate family. This includes access to some of the best medical professionals and facilities in the world, ensuring the President\u2019s health is always a priority.\nTravel and Security: The US President\u2019s Convoy and Air Force One\nSecurity is one of the most critical aspects of the presidency, and the US President is afforded the highest level of protection possible. The US President\u2019s security detail includes agents from the Secret Service, the FBI, and the Marines, ensuring that the US President is always safe, whether at home or abroad.\nWhen travelling, the US President uses Air Force One, a state-of-the-art aircraft designed specifically for presidential travel. The plane spans approximately 4,000 square feet, with office spaces, a meeting room, and even a private bedroom. The aircraft is equipped with sophisticated communication systems and defensive measures, making it one of the safest and most secure planes in the world. The US President\u2019s entourage travels with them on the plane, which can accommodate up to 100 people.\nIn addition to Air Force One, the US President\u2019s security detail includes a convoy of bulletproof limousines and Marine helicopters, all equipped with advanced missile defence systems and communication tools, ensuring the US President\u2019s safety even in the most dangerous situations.\nGlobal Comparison: How the US President\u2019s Salary Stacks Up\nWhile the US President\u2019s salary is undoubtedly generous, it pales in comparison to some world leaders. For instance, the Prime Minister of Singapore earns an annual salary of $1.61 million (approximately Rs 13.44 crore), making them the highest-paid leader globally. Other leaders, like the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, also earn a substantial income, with their salaries exceeding Rs 5.5 crore per year.\nIn comparison, the President of India receives a much smaller salary who earns Rs 5 lakh per month, or about Rs 60 lakh annually \u2013 a fraction of what the US President receives.\nThe Tradition of Charitable Donations\nIt\u2019s worth noting that many US Presidents have chosen to donate their annual salary to charity. Presidents like Donald Trump, John F Kennedy, and Herbert Hoover have made a point of forgoing their presidential pay and instead contributing it to various charitable organisations or causes. This tradition highlights the willingness of some leaders to use their position not just for personal gain, but for the broader good of society.\nAs the 2024 US presidential election approaches, the focus will inevitably be on the candidates\u2019 policies, leadership abilities, and vision for the country. But it\u2019s also fascinating to consider the financial perks and lifestyle that come with the job. With a substantial salary, luxurious living conditions, comprehensive security, and the world\u2019s most advanced travel and medical care, the President of the United States enjoys an enviable position in terms of both influence and resources.",

        "title": "US Elections 2024 : Why Does The New Hampshire Town Vote at Midnight?",
        "text": "In a historic tradition that has become an iconic part of the U.S. presidential election process, the tiny New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch cast the first votes of the 2024 U.S. election at the stroke of midnight. This small, unincorporated town, which lies along the U.S.-Canada border, is known for its unique position as the first polling place in the nation to open on Election Day, and it once again lived up to its legacy. In a surprising turn of events, the six registered voters in the town were evenly split between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, each receiving three votes. This rare tie is not only a noteworthy electoral moment but also highlights the significance of this small town\u2019s early role in determining the national political mood.\n\nWhy Dixville Notch Votes at Midnight\n\nThe tradition of midnight voting in Dixville Notch dates back to 1960, but it was inspired by an earlier practice established in the neighboring town of Hart\u2019s Location in 1948. The idea behind voting at the very start of Election Day was initially born out of necessity for local railway workers. These workers, whose odd shifts did not align with traditional polling hours, would often struggle to cast their ballots before the polls closed in the evening. In response to this, Hart\u2019s Location opened its polls at midnight to accommodate them.\n\nInspired by this model, Neil Tillotson, the town moderator of Dixville Notch, brought the same practice to his community. Tillotson, after hearing about it from a reporter, was keen to make his town part of this unique electoral tradition. Over the years, Dixville Notch has proudly continued this practice, ensuring that their votes are among the first counted in every U.S. presidential election. This midnight vote marks a symbolic start to Election Day, often garnering national media attention and sometimes even offering early insights into how the rest of the country might vote.\n\nA Civic Tradition With Deep Roots in American History\n\nWhile Dixville Notch\u2019s midnight voting is certainly a fascinating and quirky tradition, it carries a deeper meaning that goes beyond just the unusual timing. For more than half a century, the town\u2019s commitment to casting the first votes in the nation has become an important civic ritual, symbolizing the start of the American electoral process. It has come to represent the high value Americans place on voting as a civic duty. In many ways, it serves as a reminder that every vote counts, no matter how small the population of a given town might be.\n\nThis tradition also provides an opportunity to reflect on the importance of participating in the democratic process. Although Dixville Notch only has six registered voters, their participation in the election carries weight. The town\u2019s tradition provides a compelling visual demonstration of how every American citizen\u2019s vote contributes to the larger electoral process, regardless of the scale of their community. In fact, Dixville Notch\u2019s role has turned it into an unofficial \u201ccivics lesson\u201d for the nation, reminding everyone of the importance of turning out to vote and engaging in the electoral system.\n\n2024 Election: A Tie Between Trump and Harris\n\nIn 2024, the town\u2019s six voters\u2014four Republicans and two undeclared voters\u2014cast their ballots for the presidential candidates. This year, the results were particularly noteworthy, as both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris received three votes each. This tie is a rare occurrence in Dixville Notch\u2019s history, underscoring the close race between the two major candidates. Despite the small number of voters, the results were immediately shared with the media, and the town once again found itself in the national spotlight for kicking off the Election Day process.\n\nNotably, Dixville Notch also participated in the presidential primaries earlier in the year, holding its own midnight vote for the Republican and Democratic candidates. In January, the town overwhelmingly voted for former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the Republican primary, with all four Republican voters casting their ballots for her. This decision highlighted the town\u2019s strong ties to Republican politics, as well as its tradition of expressing early opinions on the candidates.\n\nDixville Notch: A Symbol of the American Electoral Spirit\n\nWhile it may only have a handful of voters, Dixville Notch\u2019s role in the electoral process is symbolic of the American spirit of democracy. The town\u2019s midnight voting tradition has grown beyond just the act of casting a ballot\u2014it\u2019s become a part of the national narrative that marks the beginning of the presidential election. It serves as a touchstone for journalists, political analysts, and voters alike, who look to the early results as an indication of larger political trends.\n\nThe town\u2019s early voting tradition has even helped reinforce the sense of community and national unity, bringing together the country\u2019s diverse electorate, regardless of political party affiliation. As the first town in the nation to vote, Dixville Notch\u2019s results, while small in number, often garner significant media attention and prompt national discussions about the state of the race, setting the tone for the rest of the election day.\n\nIn 2024, as in years past, Dixville Notch will once again be a part of the American political story, with all eyes on its early voting results. For this tiny community, the midnight vote is more than just an election ritual; it is a reminder that democracy is alive and well in even the smallest corners of America. Whether the candidates win or lose, Dixville Notch\u2019s tradition reminds us all that voting is a cherished right that should never be taken for granted.\n\nRead More : US Election 2024: Officials Reassure Voters Amid Conspiracy Theories",

        "text": "In the closing days of her campaign, Kamala Harris is making a final effort to reach out to Arab American voters who have turned away from the Democratic Party due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n\nHarris expressed her commitment at a rally in East Lansing, Michigan, stating her intention to do everything possible to bring an end to the war in Gaza, secure the return of hostages, alleviate suffering in the region, ensure Israel\u2019s security, and uphold the Palestinian people\u2019s rights to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination.\n\nArab Americans to vote for Trump over Harris\n\nThis appeal is underscored by recent polling data indicating that many Arab American voters\u2014traditionally a dependable Democratic constituency\u2014are now contemplating either abstaining from the election or supporting her opponent, Donald Trump.\n\nA recent Arab News/YouGov survey found that 45 percent of Arab American respondents indicated they were most likely to vote for Trump, while 43 percent favored Harris. When asked who would be better for the Middle East overall, both candidates received equal support at 38 percent.\n\nIn the 2020 election, Joe Biden garnered about 59 percent of the Arab American vote.\n\nArab American voters for Harris\n\nIn Michigan, a critical swing state with over 200,000 Arab American voters, their choices could significantly influence the presidential election outcome. Current polling shows Harris and Trump are closely matched in the state, where Biden won by a margin of 154,000 votes in 2020.\n\nThe rift between the Biden administration and Arab American voters has been growing for a year, largely due to Biden\u2019s unwavering support for Israel amidst the ongoing war in Gaza, which was ignited by a violent Hamas attack that resulted in 1,200 casualties in Israel.\n\nInitially, Harris suggested a different perspective on the conflict after stepping into the leading role on the ticket from Biden. However, she has not clearly outlined how her approach would differ if she were elected president.\n\nAt the rally in East Lansing, she acknowledged the challenges of the year, recognizing the extensive death and devastation in Gaza, along with the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. This sentiment mirrored her response to protests during a previous rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where demonstrators chanted about the conflict. Harris acknowledged the protesters and expressed a shared desire for the war to end promptly.\n\nYet, as the conflict drags on for more than a year, many in the Arab American community feel her words are insufficient.\n\nThere is a strong demand among many community members for Harris to endorse an arms embargo on Israel to help terminate the war, which has resulted in over 43,000 Palestinian deaths. Israel has also expanded its military operations into Lebanon against Hezbollah, leading to more than 3,000 fatalities.\n\nRead More: Why Migrants In US Fear A Trump Win",

        "text": "Arjun Khotkars political career, marked by his unwavering loyalty to Shiv Sena and the teachings of Balasaheb Thackeray, has been a significant factor in the Jalna Assembly Election 2024. His entry into politics was notable, becoming an MLA for Jalna at just 25 years old in 1990, and securing re-election in subsequent years, despite a brief setback in 2009. Khotkars influence extended into his roles within the Maharashtra government, serving under both the Narayan Rane and Devendra Fadnavis administrations, which underscored his prominence in the states political arena.In the lead-up to the 2024 elections, Khotkars efforts, alongside those of Shiv Sena, have greatly contributed to Jalnas development, with several key projects underway to enhance the districts infrastructure and economy. Notably, the improvement of the Nanded to Manmad railway line, the launch of a new Jan Shatabdi Express connecting Jalna and Mumbai, and the construction of the Samridhi Highway are set to significantly boost connectivity. Additionally, the Water Grid Project aims to mitigate Marathwadas water scarcity by diverting water from the Western Channel, demonstrating a commitment to solving long-standing regional issues.Khotkars dedication to Shiv Sena has been evident through his active leadership and his efforts to address the needs of farmers, especially during challenging times. His role in expanding the partys influence in Jalna and his initiatives during the Marathwada drought crisis reflect his deep commitment to the communitys welfare. Despite facing a defeat in the 2019 elections, Khotkar has remained a pivotal figure in Shiv Sena, showcasing his resilience and steadfastness to the partys ideals.The political landscape within Shiv Sena underwent a significant transformation in 2022 when Eknath Shinde led a rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray, resulting in a reshuffling of the partys leadership dynamics. Khotkars decision to align with Shinde was a strategic move, reflecting his adaptability to the evolving political scenario in Maharashtra. This realignment, which saw Shinde gaining support from a majority of MLAs and securing control over the party and its symbol, was a crucial moment that underscored shifting power structures within Shiv Sena.These strategic and development-oriented initiatives by Khotkar and his alignment with Eknath Shindes leadership in Shiv Sena have set a strong foundation for the upcoming 2024 assembly elections in Jalna. The regions political atmosphere is charged with anticipation, given the shifts in alliances and the emergence of new political forces. Nonetheless, the groundwork laid by Khotkar, coupled with Shiv Senas broader strategies under Shindes leadership, anticipates a highly competitive electoral battle, signifying the ever-evolving narrative of Maharashtras political landscape.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 5 (KNN) India's Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers has announced an ambitious plan to end urea imports by 2025, a move deemed crucial for the country's agricultural and economic sustainability.\n\nIn the 2022-23 fiscal year, India consumed over 36 million metric tonnes (MMT) of urea, with 20 per cent of that amount sourced through imports, costing the nation a staggering INR 38,000 crore.\n\nWhile domestic production met the majority of demand, primarily through fossil-fuel-based processes, the need for cleaner, sustainable alternatives has become increasingly pressing.\n\nUrea is a vital component in Indian agriculture, functioning as a key fertilizer, and serves as an essential raw material in the plastics industry and as nutrient feed for livestock.\n\nCurrently, the production process largely relies on natural gas, which accounts for 32 per cent of India's total annual natural gas consumption. With nearly 50 per cent of this gas being imported, India is particularly vulnerable to global market fluctuations.\n\nAccording to a 2022 report by McKinsey & Company, India emits approximately 2.8 giga tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, with projections indicating that it will need to manage a colossal 80 Gt of CO2 by 2070 to meet its net-zero goals.\n\nWhile the country has significant theoretical potential for carbon storage, a multifaceted approach to decarbonisation is essential.\n\nTo combat this, the proposed green urea production process offers a transformative solution. By utilising point-source CO2 emissions\u2014primarily from high-emission industries such as iron and steel, cement, and coal power\u2014India can significantly reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nThis method involves capturing CO2 emissions from these industries, generating hydrogen through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy, and extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere. Such a circular economy approach not only aids in decarbonisation but also promotes sustainability.\n\nFinancially, the transition to green urea production is projected to require a capital expenditure of INR 45,000 crore, with an annual operating cost of INR 27,000 crore, primarily driven by electricity needs for hydrogen production.\n\nHowever, this shift could potentially save India INR 12 lakh crore over the life of the production facilities by eliminating urea imports.\n\nMoreover, implementing green urea production could generate new jobs and stimulate economic growth, fulfilling the vision of an Atmanirbhar Bharat.\n\nBy capturing just 0.36 per cent of total point-source emissions (equating to 5.7 MMT of CO2), India could eliminate urea imports entirely. A more extensive application of this technology could allow for meeting the entire urea demand domestically.\n\nIn conclusion, transitioning to green urea production represents a vital step in reducing reliance on imports while aligning with India\u2019s environmental goals.\n\nBy investing in advanced carbon capture and renewable energy technologies, India not only positions itself for self-sufficiency in urea but also champions a sustainable future.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

From severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. to snow showers in the Northwest, the weather could complicate the voting process for many.\n\nStrong Cold Front, Thunderstorms, and Tornado Risk\n\nA powerful cold front is moving through the country\u2019s midsection, bringing thunderstorms and gusty winds to key battleground states. Michigan and Wisconsin will be especially affected, with heavy rain expected to impact voters throughout the day.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a threat of lightning and heavy downpours from Louisiana and Arkansas through the middle Mississippi River Valley and Lower Ohio Valley,\u201d said AccuWeather meteorologist Dan Pydynowski. The severe weather could create hazards for those waiting outdoors to cast their votes.\n\nAdditionally, areas in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas could experience tornadoes early on Tuesday, further complicating the Election Day experience for voters in these states.\n\nWarmth and Snow: A Tale of Two Extremes\n\nWhile severe weather impacts the central U.S., other parts of the country are facing opposite extremes. The Deep South and Ohio Valley will experience unseasonably warm temperatures, with highs in the 70s and 80s, while the Northwest braces for snow and blizzard conditions.\n\nAccuWeather forecasts indicate that snow and cold will affect parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana, potentially leading to difficult travel conditions and disruptions in voting.\n\nHeavy Rain, Flooding Expected in Some Regions\n\nMany areas, especially in the Plains and Midwest, will receive heavy rain, potentially causing flooding. Southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri, and central Oklahoma are expected to see 8 to 12 inches of rain, according to AccuWeather. As a result, localized flooding could cause delays at polling stations and on the roads.\n\n\u201cThe rain will bring much-needed moisture to the Plains, but it could also create dangerous driving conditions, particularly in areas with poor drainage,\u201d Pydynowski warned.\n\nDrier Conditions for Some Regions, Fire Threat in California\n\nThe Northeast, Southwest, and mid-Atlantic regions are expected to remain dry, allowing voters to go to the polls without worrying about weather delays. However, California faces critical fire weather conditions due to gusty winds and dry conditions, creating challenges for both voters and emergency responders in the state.\n\nForecasts for Key Battleground States\n\nArizona: Mild temperatures in the 60s to 70s with dry weather before a cold front moves in Wednesday.\nGeorgia: Warm temperatures between 75\u201380\u00b0F, with rain possible in southwestern parts later in the day.\nMichigan: A rainy Election Day across the state, with highs in the upper 70s in Detroit.\nNevada: Calm weather expected, with temperatures in the 60s, and Las Vegas reaching around 70\u00b0F.\nWisconsin: Chilly, rainy conditions, especially in southern areas, with temperatures in the 50s and 60s.\n\nALSO READ: Trump Leads Harris By Narrow Margin In Battleground North Carolina Polls",

        "text": "US Elections: Financial markets appear to be positioning for a Donald Trump victory and Republican dominance in the upcoming November 5 US presidential election, despite the race remaining undecided, according to an ET report.Analysts suggest that a Kamala Harris victory would maintain current economic conditions with minimal market impact, while a Trump win could significantly affect emerging markets, equities, and currencies through reduced globalization policies.\"If Trump is elected as President, it could imply higher rates, gold prices, and global USD regime than our base-case forecasts, while crude prices could be lower. A Harris victory could mean that the markets could trade closer to our base-case projections with rates likely to ease and global USD to trade flat,\" ICICI Bank's head of economic research Sameer Narang said.Financial experts indicate that among emerging economies, India could benefit from a Trump presidency due to its domestic consumption-focused growth, potential advantages from reduced commodity prices, supply chain alterations, and foreign relations.Potential Effects of Trump's Victory on IndiaA Trump administration's restrictive trade policies could sustain strong US growth, potentially leading to Wall Street's superior performance compared to global markets.Also Read | \u2018Mr Modi is fantastic\u2026\u2019: Prem Watsa, known as \u2018Canada\u2019s Warren Buffett\u2019, says India can grow at 10% under PM ModiThis scenario could trigger increased yields, particularly in long-term securities, as investors anticipate higher supply. ICICI Bank analysts predict stronger US dollar performance, decreased Brent crude prices, lower global base metal prices affecting Chinese growth, and elevated gold prices due to increased safe-haven demand.ICICI Bank projects that with Trump's victory, the US 10-year Treasury yield could reach 4.40%-4.50%, while the Dollar Index might rise to 105-106, potentially reaching 106.50 by December 2024.Nomura's analysis suggests India's predominantly domestic demand-driven economy would experience limited negative effects from slower US growth.According to Nomura's Sonal Varma, India could actually benefit from reduced commodity prices resulting from decreased Chinese growth and lower oil prices, influenced by increased fossil fuel production.A decrease in crude oil prices would benefit Indian oil marketing companies including BPCL, IOCL, and HPCL, while potentially negatively affecting ONGC, Oil India, and GAIL.Also Read | PM Modi highlights Mark Mobius\u2019 \u2018love for India\u2019; says renowned global investor believes 50% should be invested in Indian stock marketPotential Effects of Harris's Victory on IndiaA Harris victory in the election would likely maintain current global and US economic structures, with expectations of a gradual economic alignment between the US and other nations influencing mid-term market dynamics.ICICI Bank indicates that various financial markets, including equities, energy, gold, base metals, and the US dollar, would likely remain stable without significant fluctuations.\"In case of a Harris victory, we see the UST 10yr moving to the 4.00%-4.10% range and the DXY trading in the 101.50-103.50 range by December 2024. Global commodity prices could trade flat if Harris wins,\" it said.India's export performance to the US could benefit under Democratic leadership, considering the positive trade relationship during Biden's administration. According to Phillip Capital, Harris's anticipated support for skilled immigration policies would benefit India's IT sector.Historical US Market Performance Analysis:The Dow Jones, excluding recession-related declines, increased 28% under Bush, 78% during Obama's presidency, and 54% under Trump, while Biden's current term shows 41% growth.The Indian markets showed substantial growth during different US presidencies: Bush's term saw a 200% increase, Obama's presidency witnessed 55% growth, Trump's tenure recorded 63% gains, and Biden's administration has achieved 89% growth so far.114915351",

        "text": "Leaders from southern India continue to voice concerns over the imposition of Hindi in official communications, with the latest protest coming from CPM Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas. Brittas, the party's deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, on Sunday raised objections to Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu's practice of sending official responses in Hindi. In a protest gesture, Brittas wrote back to the minister in Malayalam.Brittas had raised issues in the Rajya Sabha about food quality on trains and the need for more bogies for general passengers. However, the minister's reply was in Hindi, despite a convention that MPs from South India should receive responses in English.The MP expressed his frustration in a post on X, stating that it is customary for Union government communications to MPs from southern states to be in English. \"Lately, however, that\u2019s not the case, and @RavneetBittu makes it a point to write exclusively in Hindi. Am compelled to reply to him in Malayalam!\u201d Brittas posted. In his statement, Brittas emphasised that Kerala has not adopted Hindi as an official language, citing provisions of the Official Languages Act. The Act specifies that English must be used for communication between the Union government and states that have not adopted Hindi as their official language. Brittas argued that the use of Hindi-only replies violates these provisions, making communication difficult for MPs from non-Hindi-speaking regions.Brittas' protest is not isolated. Several southern leaders, including DMK's MK Stalin and Karnataka\u2019s Siddaramaiah, have previously raised concerns over what they perceive as attempts to impose Hindi on non-Hindi-speaking states. Stalin, who has vocally opposed Hindi imposition, recently clashed with Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi for omitting Tamil during a Hindi Month celebration.

The current conflict started after almost a year of increasing cross-border fights, with Hezbollah firing rockets into northern Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. This marks a major escalation in what is already Israel's deadliest war against Hamas, which began after a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year.Since the onset of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in late September this year, Israeli forces have intensified their bombardment of Hezbollah targets across Lebanon. This military campaign has resulted in the deaths of several key commanders and leaders of Hezbollah, including its former chief, Hassan Nasrallah.",

The interception is not expected for political differences, professional or family disputes. However, Shukla did use the permission for the purpose other than it was meant for, thereby misleading the government and misusing the permission,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe committee found that Shukla had tapped the phones for reasons other than the permissions she had sought and found this to be illegal.\n\n\u201cIt was also found that Shukla tapped the phones of Patole by changing his name as Amjad Khan, minister of state for education Bacchu Kadu as Babu Shaikh, former MP Sanjay Kakade as Abhijit Nair and former legislator Ashish Deshmukh as Mahesh Salunke.\n\n\u201cTheir phones were tapped on the plea that they were involved in the sale of drugs,\u2019\u2019 the report said.\n\nFurther, a case was registered against Shukla at the Bund Garden police station in Pune for allegations of illegal phone tapping.\n\nShe was booked under Section 26 of the Indian Telegraph Act.\n\nThereafter, another committee was formed to look into the allegations of illegal tapping of politicians\u2019 phones.\n\nThe three-member committee was headed by the former acting director general of police Sanjay Pandey.\n\nThe committee observed that Shukla had illegally tapped phones and hence a case has been registered against her and others.\n\nHowever, the Bombay High Court in March 2022 had restrained Pune police from arresting her till March 25, 2022.\n\nSubsequently, the High Court quashed two FIRs registered in Pune and Mumbai against Shukla pertaining to the alleged tapping of Opposition leaders\u2019 phones.\n\nWhen Shukla was heading the state Intelligence department, she in her report penned in August 2020 named two senior politicians \u2013 the then home minister and another person known as \u201cDada\u201d, and six IPS officers and 23 state service police officers.\n\nShe also named some private individuals who acted as middlemen to facilitate transfers and secure desired postings for senior police officers in exchange for money and by using their close connection with the two politicians.\n\nThereafter, the former Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had sought the CBI enquiry based on Shukla\u2019s report.\n\nHe then claimed large-scale corruption in police transfers saying that he had 6.3 GB of data of call records intercepted by Shukla where the names of several key police officers were discussed.\n\nDespite controversies, the Mahayuti government comprising BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP, appointed Shukla as the state DGP in January this year although she was to retire in June.\n\nShe was given an extension till January 2026.\n\n(Sanjay Jog can be contacted at sanjay.j@ians.in)",

        "text": "Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson criticized AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday for misleading the public with his comments and for running a modus operandi related to the Waqf Amendment Bill. \n\n\u201cOwaisi Ji should answer that why is he against the poor muslims? \u201c\u2026Section 40 of the Waqf Act gives the power to the Waqf board to declare any property under Waqf. You will have to go to the Waqf Board if you appeal. What kind of justice is this? This country runs through the Constitution, not by any religious doctrine. And in such a country, in any civil case, one has to go to the civil court\u2026That\u2019s why it is important the amend this Act,\u201d BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said while speaking to the ANI. \u201cWe have seen how Waqf has tried to encroach on the lands of farmers in Karnataka\u2026Where there is a Congress government, the lands are being given to the Waqf. It is important to stop this. The land encroachment by Waqf is unconstitutional,\u201d he added,\n\nNotably, 41 farmers of Honwada village located in Tikota taluk of Vijaypur district of Karnataka were recently sent a notice by the Waqf Board, in which it was claimed that their 1500 acres of land is the property of the Waqf Board.\n\nAIMIM chief and MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday criticised the Modi government\u2019s proposed Waqf ammendment bill, questioning the mandatory inclusion of two non-Muslim members in the central Waqf Council.\n\nOwaisi questioned that if Muslims cannot be trustees of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) then how can a non-Muslim be in the Waqf board?\n\nAddressing a press conference AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said, \u201cNot even a single member of the 24 members of TTD Board (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams) is a non-Hindu\u2026The new Chairman of TTD says that the people working there should be Hindu\u2026We are not against this, we just have an objection to the fact that Narendra Modi\u2019s government is saying in the proposed bill of Waqf that in the central Waqf Council, it has been made mandatory that 2 non-Muslim members should be there\u2026Why are you bringing this provision in the Waqf bill? TTD is a board of the Hindu religion and Waqf Board is for the Muslim religion. There should be parity\u2026When the trustees of TTD cannot be Muslims, how will a non-Muslim member be on the Waqf Board?\u201d\n\nThe Waqf Act, 1995, which was created to regulate waqf properties, has long faced allegations of mismanagement, corruption and encroachments. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha this August, seeks to bring sweeping reforms, introducing digitisation, stricter audits, transparency and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties.\n\nNotices were sent to the farmers, in which it was said that this land was marked as Waqf property. However, the farmers said that there is no dargah of this name in their village and this land is the ancestral property of their families.\n\nHowever, following protests by people, the Karnataka government decided to withdraw the notice issued by the Wakf Board after it arbitrarily claimed 1,500 acres of farmers\u2019 land",

First, we have to accept that there is local involvement somewhere. Such places are being searched which can create an atmosphere of violence and unrest among the people.

        "text": "The Supreme Court recently pressed the Delhi government and police for explanations regarding the widespread use of firecrackers during Diwali, despite a clear ban aimed at reducing severe air pollution in the city. On Monday, the court expressed concerns about the failure to enforce this prohibition, especially given Delhi's ongoing struggle with toxic air quality. In response, the court requested formal explanations from both the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the Delhi police on why they did not curb firecracker usage as ordered. The Supreme Court emphasized the need to manage pollution caused by firecrackers, cautioning that unchecked pollution contributes to disorder and health risks. The court called for \u201cstrict action, such as sealing of premises\u201d against those flouting the firecracker ban in Delhi, stressing the importance of such measures to ensure compliance with the court\u2019s directives during future Diwali celebrations. To reinforce this, the bench proposed that Delhi consider a year-round ban on firecrackers, rather than limiting it to festival periods. Additionally, the court turned its focus to the states of Punjab and Haryana, seeking explanations for an uptick in farm fires during the Diwali season. This query followed a report from the Centre for Science and Environment indicating a significant increase in crop burning, which further aggravated air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas. The court\u2019s intervention highlights the urgent need for stricter enforcement of pollution-control policies in the capital and neighboring states.",

He also accused the Congress of targeting any woman official.Speaking to ANI, Mumbai BJP chief Shelar said, \u201cIf EC has made this decision, all I would like to say is that there are two things to be kept in mind \u2013 targeting any woman official in this manner by Congress and taking this towards torture is not right. This can come to Congress also. Second, they should now make it clear, MVA should make it clear if EC is fair. They demanded Rashmi Shukla\u2019s transfer and it was done \u2013 so EC is fair today. Tomorrow, if something happens against their wish \u2013 it is biased. Congress should not do this duplicity.\u201dActing on the complaints from Congress and other parties, the Election Commission has ordered the transfer of Rashmi Shukla, DGP Maharashtra with immediate effect and ordered the Maharashtra Chief Secretary to hand over her responsibilities to the next senior-most IPS officer in the cadre.

The aim was to exhibit solar technology applications that can be scaled up and build the capacity of Member Countries to replicate these solar-powered solutions. Today, 11 of these projects were dedicated to the people of the respective countries: Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cuba, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Samoa, Senegal, The Gambia, and Tonga. ISA remains committed to supporting governments in their efforts to scale up solar energy projects and improve the lives of their people.\n\nAccording to Minister Joshi, the ISA acknowledges that accelerating adoption of advanced technologies relies on a skilled workforce that can design, install, and maintain them effectively. For advancing capacity building in its Member Countries, the ISA had launched the STAR-C initiative for setting up Solar Technology Application Resource Centres (STAR-Centres), in collaboration with the Republic of France. These national centres are equipped with specialized training facilities, tools, and structured learning modules designed to cultivate a highly skilled solar workforce.\n\nThe minister said ISA has successfully established and operationalized STAR Centers in seven countries: Ethiopia, Somalia, Cuba, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kiribati, Ghana, and Bangladesh. Since their launch, these centers have already trained thousands of professionals in various aspects of solar energy, preparing them to contribute effectively to the sector\u2019s rapid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe Assembly will also consider other substantial matters, such as work plans for the coming year and include updates on ISA\u2019s priority areas of work and projects.

        "text": "The first documented case of a woman using the Sarco \u201csuicide pod\u201d in Switzerland has taken a new turn. An autopsy reportedly found strangulation marks on her neck, sparking speculations about her death. This has led to questions about a possible equipment malfunction or interference, according to the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant.The 64-year-old American woman died on September 23 in a secluded forest area near a cabin in Merishausen, a sparsely populated region of Switzerland close to the German border, BBC reported.The Sarco pod, designed by Dr Philip Nitschke, founder of Exit International, is intended to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives. Operated by the Swiss assisted-dying group The Last Resort, the pod requires the user to press an internal button, which releases nitrogen gas, causing them to fall asleep and then die peacefully within minutes due to oxygen deprivation.Swiss police were notified and later found the woman's body inside the pod. Dr Florian Willet, president of The Last Resort, was reportedly the only person present at the time of her death and remains in custody.Swiss Chief Prosecutor Peter Sticher, leading the investigation, has suggested that the woman's death may not have been as intended, indicating the possibility of \u201cintentional homicide,\u201d according to de Volkskrant. The report highlights that strangulation could be a factor, raising questions about the circumstances of her death.The report notes that the pod was opened and closed several times before the procedure began to verify its seal. A forensic expert testified in court that the woman had severe injuries to her neck, which has further fuelled suspicion.The incident was reportedly recorded by two surveillance cameras \u2013 one inside the pod, focused on the control button, and another mounted on a nearby tree. These cameras were motion-activated and not set to record continuously. De Volkskrant, who reviewed the footage, observed that the internal camera activated twice in quick succession around two minutes after the woman pressed the button, although the camera angle did not clearly show what occurred.According to the report, Dr Willet later informed police that about two and a half minutes into the procedure, the woman's body appeared to cramp strongly \u2013 a reaction he described as typical in deaths involving nitrogen. Six and a half minutes after the woman initiated the process, the pod's iPad reportedly emitted a loud alarm, prompting Dr Willet, who was on a call with Dr Philip Nitschke, to say, \u201cShe's still alive, Philip.\u201d The alarm ceased after some time, and roughly 30 minutes after pressing the button, Dr Willet reportedly confirmed, \u201cShe really looks dead.\u201dThe Swiss authorities have yet to confirm these findings publicly, and the prosecutor's office has refrained from making an official statement on the ongoing investigation.Swiss law prohibits assisted suicide if external assistance is involved or if those assisting have any \u201cself-serving motive.\u201dHelplinesVandrevala Foundation for Mental Health9999666555 or help@vandrevalafoundation.com TISS iCall022-25521111 (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm) (If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)",

Oka and Justice Augustine George Masih during an ongoing annual hearing into Delhis persistent air quality crisis.What is the order (on banning of firecrackers)... how is it being implemented... something has to be worked out, the court questioned, urging the Delhi government to devise a plan at least for next year to prevent severe pollution levels from blanketing the city in 2025. Delhi Chokes: AQI Hits Hazardous Levels, Setting Off Warnings Before WinterOn Monday morning, Delhis air quality index (AQI) dropped to the severe category across the city, even four days post-Diwali, with readings surpassing the 400-mark (on a scale of 500) in several areas, including Anand Vihar, Rohini, Ashok Vihar, and Vivek Vihar.Even affluent areas like Lodi Road could not escape the toxic air.As of 7am, the 24-hour average AQI stood at 373, close to Sundays season-high of 382. These numbers were recorded despite a 15 per cent drop in the contribution from farm fires, emphasising the severity of the pollution crisis.The situation remained concerning across the NCR region, with AQI levels recorded at 305 in Noida, 295 in Ghaziabad, and 276 in Gurugram.High AQI levels were also reported in neighbouring states, including 372 in Hisar (Haryana), and 397 and 320 in Sriganganagar and Bharatpur (Rajasthan), respectively.",

        "text": "Tablet shipments worldwide grew by 20.4 percent year-over-year in the third quarter (Q3) of 2024, with shipments totalling 39.6 million units, according to a report by a market research firm. The report notes that the \"dismal 2023 market\" makes for an easy YoY comparison but the supply growth is nevertheless a good thing for the tablet market. According to the report, which is based on preliminary data, AI integrations in tablets contributed to the growing optimism in tablet shipments in Q3 2024.\r\n\r\nWorldwide Tablet Shipments Grew in Q3 2024\r\n\r\nAccording to an International Data Corporation (IDC) report, worldwide tablet shipments increased 20.4 percent to 39.6 million units in Q3 2024 from 32.9 million units in Q3 2023. The report is based on IDC Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker's preliminary data and notes that in comparison to Q3 2023, the reason for tablet supply growth in Q3 2024 includes increasing AI integration in the devices. Apart from the Microsoft Surface Pro with CoPilot+, all other AI-integrated tablets are in their early days at best, the report noted. However, these new features are said to be \"piquing consumer interest\" and resulting in potentially higher average selling prices (ASPs). \r\n\r\nApple shipped 12.6 million tablets in Q3 2024, growing 1.4 percent YoY, while Samsung recorded 7.1 million shipments in Q3 2024 with an 18.3 percent YoY growth, the report stated. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra and Galaxy Tab S10+ were launched with AI features during the quarter but the Galaxy Tab A9 models drove sales in most regions. Smartphone Shipments in India Grew 7 Percent YoY in H1 2024: IDC\r\n\r\nThe Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet was refreshed with generative AI features. Amazon saw 4.6 million tablet shipments in Q3 2024 with a 111.4 percent YoY growth. Most of their sales came from Prime Day deals thanks to big discounts. With 3.3 million and 3 million units shipped respectively, Huawei and Lenovo saw a YoY tablet shipment growth of 44.1 percent and 14.7 percent in Q3 2024.\r\n\r\nAmong different ways to increase their market presence, brands collaborated with educational institutions, announced entertainment and gaming partnerships, promoted cross-device connectivity, and more, the report noted. Including AI-backed features in tablets is said to have helped the companies to grow in these areas. AI innovations have also led customers to be willing to pay premium prices and prioritise devices with these features more over others, the report states.",

        "title": "KTR slams Congress government's first year in Telangana",
        "text": "In an open letter addressed to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, KT Rama Rao (KTR), working president of Telangana opposition party Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), voiced his harsh criticism of the Congress-led government\u2019s first year in office in Telangana. KTR\u2019s letter listed a series of grievances, suggesting that the new administration not only failed to meet its campaign promises, it also regressed the state\u2019s development by a decade.FAILURE TO KEEP PROMISESKTR\u2019s primary allegation revolved around the Congress party\u2019s unfulfilled promises made during their campaign. He specifically pointed to the six major guarantees that were touted as crucial for the state\u2019s welfare but have since been ignored. Promises like farm loan waivers and support for students and the unemployed, he claimed, were merely strategies to secure votes, with no real intent to follow through once in power. \u201cThese broken guarantees reflect a betrayal of the people's trust,\u201d KTR stated, expressing frustration over the government\u2019s lack of accountability.ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SETBACKSKTR raised alarm over the state\u2019s economic decline, asserting that mismanagement by the Congress government has stalled progress. He highlighted that various social groups, including farmers, students, police, and weavers, have taken to the streets in protest, indicating widespread dissatisfaction with the current administration. \u201cThe once thriving economic landscape of Telangana is now marred by unrest and frustration,\u201d he remarked, emphasising the dire need for effective governance.MISMANAGEMENT AND SCANDALSThe BRS leader did not shy away from addressing corruption, particularly in relation to the controversial Musi River project. KTR alleged that the project has become a breeding ground for corruption, prioritising corporate interests over the public good. He criticised Congress for its collaboration with private entities, arguing that these alliances were detrimental to the long-term welfare of Telangana and its residents.NEGLECT OF WELFARE AND BASIC SERVICESAccording to KTR, the Congress government\u2019s first year was characterised by a troubling neglect of basic services and welfare initiatives. Auto drivers, weavers, and police officers were among those he claimed who were pushed into poverty due to the government\u2019s incompetence. He highlighted the administration's insensitivity to citizens impacted by recent natural disasters, further exemplifying the government\u2019s failure to protect its most vulnerable citizens.A CALL FOR ACCOUNTABILITYKTR\u2019s letter culminated in a direct challenge to Rahul Gandhi, urging him to engage with the common people of Telangana. \u201cDo you have the courage, Mr. Gandhi, to face the people directly?\u201d he asked, calling for Gandhi to visit communities affected by the government\u2019s policies and to address their grievances.AN APOLOGY TO TELANGANAConcluding the letter, KTR called for a public apology from Rahul Gandhi to the people of Telangana, demanding that Congress rectify the grievances stemming from their unfulfilled promises. He lamented that Telangana, once seen as a beacon of progress, has now become a symbol of \u201cbroken promises and corruption\u201d. KTR warned that the people of Telangana would not tolerate further neglect, emphasising that accountability must be upheld.Published By: Afreen Published On: Nov 4, 2024Must Watch",

        "text": "Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump capped off his rally in Georgia by dancing to the classic hit \u2018YMCA,\u2019 showcasing his signature style of blending entertainment with political messaging. As he rallied support just ahead of the US Presidential Elections, Trump declared his commitment to restoring the \u201cAmerican Dream,\u201d criticising Democratic rival and US Vice President Kamala Harris for allegedly undermining that dream. He vowed, \u201cI will bring back the American dream, and we\u2019ll bring it back stronger than ever before,\u201d while promising to address pressing issues like inflation and immigration. Trump emphasised that his leadership would usher in a new era of prosperity, asserting, \u201cAmerica will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before.\u201d His campaign rhetoric contrasted what he termed the \u201cincompetence and failure\u201d of the current administration with the transformative success he claims would follow his return to office.In a pointed critique of President Joe Biden, Trump expressed scepticism about Biden\u2019s visibility leading up to the elections, asking, \u201cWhere the hell is he?\u201d He further suggested that Harris had undermined the electoral process, accusing her of stealing the election from Biden. In a provocative statement, Trump called for Biden to \u201cfire Kamala,\u201d proclaiming, \u201cYou\u2019re the worst ever. Kamala, you\u2019re fired. Get the hell out of here.\u201dMeanwhile, Kamala Harris will continue her rallies on Noember 5 breezing through Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Philadelphia , Phoenix, Raleigh, Pittsburgh. \u201cIn this election, we need to remind our neighbors and friends that their vote is their voice, and their voice is their power. Don\u2019t let anybody take your power from you. When you love something, you fight for it\u2013and I love this country with all my heart, \u201d Harris said in her posts on X. As the November 5 elections draw near, recent polling data indicates a competitive race, with a New York Times and Siena College survey showing Trump and Harris tied at 48 per cent in the popular vote. With both candidates vying for a historic moment in US politics, the upcoming election promises to be a pivotal event in the nation\u2019s future.",

        "text": "Accusing Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu of writing letters in Hindi to South India MPs, Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP, John Brittas replied to the letter in Malyalam as a mark of protest and said that the former needs to respect the sentiments of the people.Speaking to ANI, John Brittas asserted that they have always been fighting against the move to impose Hindi on South Indian states.\u201cThere is a deliberate attempt to impose Hindi on south Indian MPs. This particular minister, Ravneet Singh Bittu has been consistently writing letters in Hindi not just to me but to all the South Indian MPs. We feel that there is an intent behind such Hindi letters. We feel that the only way to respond to such haphazard actions by ministers is to respond in our own language. This is not only a protest but the only way\u2026He needs to respect the sentiments of the people,\u201d he said.In a post on X, the CPI-M MP, while replying to the letter of Bittu, said, \u201cIt has been a norm and precedent that letters addressed from Union Govt to south MPs are written in English. Lately however that\u2019s not the case, and Ravneet Bittu makes it a point to write exclusively in Hindi. Am compelled to reply him in Malayalam!\u201dIn another post, Brittas said that Hindi \u2018imposition\u2019 is not new to them but it has gained faster pace in recent times.\u201cEven those Ministers well versed in English switch over to Hindi while speaking, especially in Parliament, knowing very well that those from the South can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d the CPI-M MP added on X.Previously, a war of words erupted between the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin and Governor RN Ravi over the alleged imposition of Hindi and a row over the State anthem.On October 18, Stalin condemned the distorted rendition of the State anthem, without the reference to the glory of \u201cDravida\u201d land, at a DD Chennai function in which Governor RN Ravi participated.Stalin blamed the Governor for the distorted rendition, alleging that it was the latter\u2019s \u201cdeliberate disrespect\u201d to Tamil Nadu and its people.The Tamil Nadu CM also wondered if Ravi was the \u201cGovernor\u201d or an \u201cAryan\u201d. Following these remarks, the Governor accused the Chief Minister of making racist remarks against him.RN Ravi in response accused MK Stalin of making racist remark against me and levelled false allegations of showing disrespect to Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu.\u201cChief Minister Thiru MK Stalin has issued a regrettable tweet this evening in which he made a racist remark against me and levelled false allegation of showing disrespect to Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu\u2026 Making racist remarks and alleging incorrect imputations against the governor by the chief minister is unfortunately cheap and lowers the dignity of the high constitutional office of the chief minister,\u201d the Governor said in a post from the X handle of Tamil Nadu Raj Bhavan.Reacting to governor\u2019s allegation, MK Stalin said that Tamil language is the race and lifeblood of Dravidians, and said that if racism is the mother tongue of this land, then it is his pride",

        "text": "Hyderabad: The Hyderabad cybercrime police successfully refunded an amount of Rs.1.05 crore to victims who were defrauded by cybercriminals on the pretext of investments in trading with promises of substantial profits. A complaint was received from a private employee aged around 52 in which he stated that cyber fraudsters deceived him with promises of profits from trading in an institutional account on \u2018Lazardoosvip.Top,\u2019 leading him to transfer an amount of approximately Rs.1.22 crore to bank accounts provided by fraudsters, the police said. In response, the Cybercrime police registered a case under Sections 66(C), 66(D) of the IT Act, and Sections 319(2), 318(4), 338, 336(3), and 340(2) of the IPC. Inspector K. Madhusudhan Rao and his team, under the supervision of DCP Cyber Crimes D. Kavitha, worked diligently to address the complaint.

After obtaining court orders, authorizing to return the amount, the police refunded Rs.1.05 crore to the victim\u2019s account. In an advisory, Hyderabad Police Commissioner CV Anand asked the people to be careful of fake investment advertisements popping up on various social media platforms promising high returns with little risk. \u201cNever believe the promises of huge returns and fake profit screenshots. Don't fall for these scams! Always use SEBI - approved apps for investment. Always ask a SEBI registered financial advisor before investing. Scammers will credit a small amount in the victim's account to gain the victim's confidence and allow withdrawal amount as well,\u201d he advised. There is a possibility to get a refund of at least part of the lost and \u201cPut on Hold Amount\u201d, if it is reported immediately.

We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted. We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada. The outreach of our Consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike will not be deterred by intimidation, harassment and violence,\" said Jaiswal.Violence broke out at a Hindu temple in Brampton during a consular camp organised by the Indian High Commission. Alleged pro-Khalistani supporters reportedly assaulted devotees and trespassed onto temple grounds, leading to widespread condemnation from Canadian leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and opposition leader Pierre Poilievre.Trudeau described the violence as \"unacceptable,\" asserting that every Canadian should be able to practice their faith freely and safely.The attack has heightened existing diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, which have been strained since Trudeau levelled allegations regarding India's involvement in the killing of pro-Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Jaiswal noted that India's diplomatic personnel are operating in an environment marked by extremism and violence, further complicating relations between the two countries.",

        "text": "Karti P Chidambaram, Congress party\u2019s Lok Sabha MP from Sivaganga, said actor Vijay\u2019s political entry will affect three parties\u2019 vote bank, but not of DMK.Chidambaram, in an exclusive interview, agreed that there was \u201clatent energy\u201d in Vijay\u2019s party but was sceptical about whether that would transform itself to face an assembly election. \u201cDefinitely there is latent energy, definitely there is an appeal particularly among a certain section of people, especially younger, semi-urban, rural men. Whether it will turn into a consolidated vote bank, whether it will be able to win an election, a multi-cornered fight, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Karti P Chidambaram said. \u201cThis party\u2019s formation will definitely affect three players directly, in my opinion, and perhaps others indirectly, depending on the decisions they take,\u201d the Congress MP said. However, according to him, DMK will not be affected by Vijay\u2019s Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK). \u201cI don\u2019t think DMK vote bank will be affected. DMK is a cadre-based party. It is a very strong organisation with great resources. Next leadership within the party has also been identified,\u201d he clarified. According to Karti P Chidambaram, one of three that would be affected by TVK\u2019s entry would be Naam Tamilar Katchi and its leader Seeman, as a significant part of the vote bank will move to Vijay\u2019s party. \u201cHis brand of anti-establishment, Tamil nationalism, angry young man\u2019s vote\u00e2\u0080\u00e6 definitely a significant part will move to Vijay as he is a much more popular film star who is much more recognisable and identifiable,\u201d Karti P Chidambaram said. The Congress MP commented that Vijayakanth\u2019s party had significantly declined, and Vijay\u2019s political entry might question its need to exist independently. He added that the BJP\u2019s efforts to position itself as an alternative to the Dravidian parties, along with Annamalai\u2019s social media efforts, will lose support among the lower-income groups. \u201cI believe that BJP will have far fewer votes in 2026 than in 2024, and BJP will find it difficult to make a credible alliance\u201d, stated Karti P Chidambaram.Karti also commented on actor-politician Vijay\u2019s selective adoption of Dravidian and Congress policies. \u201cHe has gone to the buffet table and chosen what he wants. Even within the Dravidian pantheon, he has chosen one name and rejected two names. He must explain why he has chosen some figures and rejected others. His clarity can only come if he\u2019s willing to take unscripted questions. Right now, it\u2019s just sloganeering, like punch dialogues in Tamil cinema, but the devil is in the details.\u201dKarti acknowledged Vijay\u2019s support for power-sharing within alliances, a stance he had raised in June. \u201cEvery party wants to be part of the government after winning an election. In Tamil Nadu, you are going to see a paradigm shift, where you can\u2019t say that you are a part of the electoral alliance and not part of the government. Karti P. Chidambaram pointed to Andhra Pradesh as an example, where Chandrababu Naidu formed an alliance, won a majority, and still included alliance partners in the government. \u201cThis is a positive sign. It\u2019s not just my view; VCK, the Communist parties, and now Vijay\u2019s party are also supporting this approach,\u201d he said. Published By: Preeja Published On: Nov 4, 2024Must Watch",

It depicts the attendant conducting the ECG on a patient while continuously referring to the YouTube video. In the background, family members can be heard requesting a certified doctor or qualified staff, but the attendant remains unfazed, proceeding with the procedure as if nothing were amiss.Despite the familys visible concern and their attempts to document the situation, the lab attendant focuses solely on the tutorial, disregarding established medical protocols. Dressed in yellow, he performs the scan, while a family member in a blue t-shirt expresses unease over the unfolding events.

However, while being taken away from the court, Sanjay Roy denied charges, claiming that he was being framed in murder of the trainee doctor.\"I have been framed. I told the judge that I am innocent but they did not listen to me,\" says accused Sanjay Roy while being taken out of Sealdah court. \u2014 PTI_News (@PTI_News) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is leading the investigation, had filed a charge sheet against Sanjay Roy about a month ago. The other two arrested in connection with the August 9 rape and murder of the junior doctor \u2013 former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh and ex-Tala OC Abhijit Mandal \u2013 were accused of conspiracy and evidence tampering.Previously, a Sealdah court had ordered that charges be formally filed on November 4, with an in-camera trial set to commence on November 5, running four days per week. Roy faced charges under specific sections relating to rape and murder, which, if proven, could result in the death penalty.In the charge sheet submitted on October 7, the CBI claimed that Roy\u2019s involvement in the crime was \u201cclearly established\u201d through 11 points of evidence, including oral testimonies, documents, forensic findings, and other supporting evidence. CCTV footage confirmed Roy\u2019s presence on the third floor during the night of August 8-9, while his phone records aligned with his presence at that location. Roy\u2019s defense has signaled plans to challenge the charges.The evidence against Roy appears significant. The police, who initially handled the investigation, found Roy\u2019s jeans and shoes with the victim\u2019s bloodstains. DNA analysis confirmed matches between Roy and the victim. Additionally, it was confirmed that Roy sustained injuries between the night of August 8 and midday on August 9, coinciding with the timeframe of the crime.

        "text": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin addressed allegations made by actor-turned-politician Vijay. The accusations focused on unfulfilled promises and governance issues. Stalin responded during an event in the Kolathur assembly constituency, Chennai, on November 4. Vijay had criticised the ruling partys performance, claiming that their election manifesto was deceptive and aimed solely at gaining power.At a recent executive council meeting of Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam, Vijays party passed 26 resolutions. Key among these were opposition to One Nation, One Election and NEET. He also alleged that the law and order situation in Tamil Nadu was neglected to benefit certain individuals. These statements were part of his broader critique of the current administration.Chief Ministers RebuttalIn response to these claims, Chief Minister Stalin asserted that most of the governments poll promises had been fulfilled. He stated, Some are claiming that our government hasnt done anything. They should all see this, whichever party they may be. Whatever promises we made, we have accomplished and the remaining one or two will be implemented soon. His remarks aimed to counter the narrative of inaction presented by Vijay.Stalin highlighted Tamil Nadus strong performance in growth-related data released by the Union Government. He attributed this success to the Dravidian model of governance. This model has been a cornerstone of his administrations policies and achievements, according to him.Addressing CriticismsThe Chief Minister also addressed those forming new political parties with hopes of dismantling the DMK. He expressed confidence in his governments four-year track record and quoted Anna, saying, long live critics. He added, I dont care (about the criticisms), our job is to work for the benefit of the people. We dont need to respond to anyone unnecessarily.Stalins comments reflect a broader strategy to maintain focus on governance rather than engaging in political disputes. By emphasising accomplishments and future plans, he seeks to reassure supporters and counter detractors effectively.The ongoing political discourse between Stalin and Vijay highlights key issues within Tamil Nadu politics. As both figures continue their exchanges, public attention remains fixed on how these discussions will influence future governance and policy decisions in the state.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court of India on Monday (November 4, 2024) agreed to examine a petition filed by the Jharkhand Government against an interim order of the State High Court to constitute a fact-finding committee, which includes Central officers, to look into allegations of illegal immigration into the State from Bangladesh.\n\nThe September order of the High Court was based on a Union Government affidavit which said \u201cinfiltration has been assessed to have taken place\u201d. The State Government has challenged the Union Government\u2019s opinion, saying the conclusion was not backed by data.\n\nA Bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ahsanuddin Amanullah listed the case for hearing on Friday (November 8, 2024.) Justice Dhulia orally observed the State appeal presented a serious issue, and the Bench needed time to go through the files carefully.\r\n\nJustice Amanullah, however, questioned the High Court\u2019s intervention, noting that the State had independent powers under the law to tackle the problem, if any. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Jayant Mohan, appearing for the State, sought a stay of the High Court order.\r\n\nMr. Sibal said Jharkhand was not a border State, but the court order has become a topic for speeches in the run-up to Assembly elections scheduled in November.\r\n\nThe senior lawyer asked whether the High Court order was based on any cogent data presented before it. \u201cWe seek a stay,\u201d Mr. Sibal submitted.\r\n\nThe High Court order was based on a public interest petition filed by Danyaal Danish alleging widespread illegal immigration and infiltration into the six districts of Godda, Jamtara, Pakur, Dumka, Sahibganj and Deoghar.\r\n\nThe petitioner in the High Court had claimed that the demographic set up of Jharkhand, in particular the Santhal Pargana region was changing rapidly, showing a decrease in the tribal population.\n\nThe petition in the High Court had urged that the \u201cinterest of the State of Jharkhand, in particular the tribal community, would be jeopardised.\u201d It had argued that the tribal population in the region had drastically come down from 44.67% in 1951 to 28.11% in 2011 while the Muslim population had seen a manifold rise from 9.44% of the total population in 1951 to 22.73% in 2011. The High Court had blamed the State for taking a \u201clackadaisical approach. \n\nThe State\u2019s appeal in the apex court said the High Court order was based on population figures pertaining to the years 1961 and 2011 and did not represent the current status on the ground.\r\n\nIt said the formation of a fact-finding committee would amount to an \u201cinterference in the autonomy and power of the State Government to deal with the issue of illegal migration and infiltration which was found to be non-existent\u201d.\n\nThe State also noted that the Supreme Court was already hearing a batch of petitions concerning illegal immigration from Bangladesh since 2017.",

        "text": "Kolkata: Eighty-seven days after the body of a woman medic was discovered at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, a city court on Monday framed charges against the prime accused, Sanjay Roy, who claimed he has been framed.The court announced that day-to-day trial would commence from November 11. Roy has been booked under Section 64 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) Section 66 (which pertains to punishment for causing death or resulting in a persistent vegetative state) and 103 (punishment for murder). \"I have done nothing. I have been framed in this rape-murder case. Nobody is listening to me. The government is framing me and threatening me not to open my mouth,\" Roy told reporters as he was led out of the court. In its initial charge-sheet submitted last month, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) identified Roy as the \"sole prime accused\" in the case. The CBI's charge-sheet also acknowledged the possibility of a \"bigger conspiracy\" behind the crime. On August 9, the body of the on-duty woman medic was found in the seminar hall of RG Kar hospital, prompting junior doctors across West Bengal to go on a 'cease-work' protest demanding justice for the victim.",

Today, Kolhan is determined to uproot the corrupt JMM government.\u201d\n\nHe prophesied that BJP will be next to form government in the state..\n\n\u201cThis is my second rally here, and from the enthusiasm I see, I can confidently say that BJP will form the government with record-breaking seats.\u201d\n\nPM Modi underscored the BJP\u2019s commitment to Jharkhand, invoking a popular slogan that has gained traction among the masses: \u201cRoti, beti aur maati ki pukaar, Jharkhand me BJP-NDA sarkar,\u201d affirming that if the NDA assumes power, it will focus on addressing local demands symbolised by \u201cRoti, Beti, Maati\u201d (livelihood, daughters, and land).\n\nHe praised the BJP\u2019s historical role in advancing Adivasi rights, stating, \u201cWhen the BJP first formed a government at the Centre, it was under Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s leadership that Adivasis were granted their own states, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. For the past decade, we have tirelessly advocated for Adivasi demands nationally and globally.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister contrasted BJP\u2019s pro-Adivasi approach with the Congress, RJD, and JMM, accusing them of being \u201canti-Adivasi\u201d forces.\n\n\u201cNo one has been a bigger enemy to the Adivasi community than Congress and RJD,\u201d he asserted, urging young people to remember the Gua Goli Kand incident of the 1980s, where Adivasis were reportedly oppressed and even shot at under the Congress government in Bihar for demanding statehood for Jharkhand.\n\nContinuing his critique, PM Modi claimed that RJD leaders once vowed that Jharkhand would only be formed \u201cover their dead bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the JMM is aligned with the RJD, which resisted Jharkhand\u2019s formation from the start. No party has been a bigger enemy of Jharkhand than the Congress and RJD,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Prime Minister also highlighted that the Congress, with \u201cAdivasi blood on its hands,\u201d is now supporting JMM, illustrating what he described as the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Adivasi aspirations by these alliances.\n\nThe Prime Minister pointed out that, unlike the Congress, the BJP has appointed Adivasi leaders to top positions, including President Droupadi Murmu, Chhattisgarh\u2019s Vishnu Deo Sai and Union Minister Savitri Thakur.\n\nHe noted that the BJP-led NDA was responsible for giving India its first female Adivasi President.\n\n\u201cEven when we chose an Adivasi woman as the President of India, these Congress leaders opposed it,\u201d he said, underlining BJP\u2019s commitment to empowering the Adivasi community.\n\nPM Modi also accused the Congress, JMM, and RJD of repeatedly \u201cinsulting\u201d the Adivasi community, citing the dismissal of Champai Soren from the Chief Minister post as a direct affront to Adivasis.\n\n\u201cToday, the voice of Adivasis is represented by our President, but Congress, JMM, and their allies cannot tolerate an Adivasi President. They didn\u2019t shy away from hurling insults at her,\u201d he stated, concluding with a strong appeal to Jharkhand\u2019s electorate.",

        "text": "BJP leader and Leader of Opposition Karnataka Assembly R Ashoka has urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, Jagadambika Pal to instruct Chief Secretary of Karnataka to immediately stop all registrations and land transactions involving Waqf Board in Karnataka alleging recent atrocities by Karnataka Waqf Board on farmers.In a letter dated November 2 to Home Minister Amit Shah, R Ashoka said, \u201cIn Karnataka, hasty attempts are being made to register lands claimed by Waqf Board perhaps in anticipation of the amendment that Joint Parliamentary Committee could bring to the Waqf Act. As part of this pre-emptive attempt the state government and Waqf board have reportedly begun altering revenue records, transferring ownership of farmers\u2019 lands to the Waqf. This hurried whitewashing and registering of unjust claims of land to Waqf Boards will deprive thousands of farmers and poor people of Karnataka of their just and ancestral property rights.\u201dHe further said that while this issue came to light after notices were saved to hundreds of farmers claiming about 15,000 acres of land Vijayapura district, it is alleged that across each district of Karnataka, approximately 10,000 acres of land are reportedly being claimed by the Waqf in this clandestine manner.\u201cAdditionally, the Waqf board is also claiming lands belonging to temples, Mutts and other religious organizations. It is shocking that even grave yards belonging to Hindu community are being claimed as Waqf Properties. The 13th century Virakta Mutt\u2019s 1.28 acres land in Sindagi, the historical Someshwara temple in Vijayapura, the Beeradevara temple in Kalaburgi and several other temples across Karnataka are reportedly being claimed by the Waqf board,\u201d he further said.He further said that these hasty attempts to register properties claimed by Waqf board has created insecurity and panic among people and has erupted violence in Haveri district.\u201cIn the light of these incidents, I urge you to instruct the Chief Secretary of the Government of Karnataka to immediately stop all land registrations to Waqf Board until the proceedings of the JPC is complete,\u201d he further added.Earlier, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Tejasvi Surya had accused the Waqf Board of encroaching on thousands of acres of farmers\u2019 lands with the support of the Karnataka government.Speaking to ANI, Surya stated, \u201cThere have been multiple press conferences and videos in the public domain where the Minister himself has admitted that these Waqf adalats are being conducted under the Chief Minister\u2019s instructions. This is a grave matter, where thousands of acres of farmers\u2019 lands are being encroached upon by the Waqf Board with the active support and collusion of the State Government.\u201dHe mentioned that, in recent days, farmers from various districts across Karnataka have reported that, without prior notice, ownership of their lands has been abruptly transferred to the Waqf Board.Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge criticised BJP MP Tejasvi Surya, claiming he has done nothing for Bengaluru. Kharge\u2019s remarks came in response to the BJP MP\u2019s accusations regarding Waqf Board land encroachment.The Congress leader assured that the Karnataka government is committed to protecting farmers\u2019 properties",

This is something that the entire society has to resist forcefully and effectively, and we will do it,\u201d the Bengal Governor said. His reaction comes amid the ongoing demand for justice for the RG Kar rape and murder case victim. Governor Bose made this statement after attending a celebration for Jay Jawan Day with veterans. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari on Sunday met the parents of the victims in the RG Kar rape and murder case and extended his support to the family. The Leader of Opposition (LoP) in West Bengal said that he and the entire BJP stand with the family. \u201cThe whole of the BJP and I am with this family. Our minister of state visited them twice. I also met them during the Durga Puja. Our fight is ongoing for justice. We will continue the fight for it. The family demands justice, to punish the culprit and those who destroyed the evidence. They also want legal action against the state government which is equally responsible,\u201d Adhikari said.Earlier, junior doctors had called for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take strict action and ensure capital punishment for those responsible. Senior BJP leader Dilip Ghosh also lashed out at Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Saturday, accusing the party of fostering an atmosphere of fear and tension in the lead-up to the Medinipur by-elections. \u201cTMC conducts by-elections here. They decide who has to get the vote. They create an atmosphere of fear and create tension right before the elections,\u201d he said",

        "title": "Supreme Court demands Delhi Police explain lapses in Diwali firecracker ban enforcement: Senior Advocate HS Phoolka",
        "text": "Senior Advocate HS Phoolka on Monday highlighted the Supreme Court\u2019s recent intervention in Delhi\u2019s air pollution crisis, especially regarding the enforcement of the firecracker ban during Diwali. According to Phoolka, the apex court expressed concern over the lack of action and issued a notice to the Delhi Police Commissioner, demanding an affidavit explaining why the ban wasn\u2019t enforced.\u2018The matter of air pollution in Delhi was listed in the Supreme Court today, and the court has taken very serious notice of this. The Supreme Court has issued notice to the Police Commissioner to file an affidavit and explain why this ban has not been enforced,\u201d Phoolka told ANI. The Senior advocate added that the apex court might consider implementing a complete yearly ban on firecrackers.Phoolka also shared a personal incident, recounting how a large group of people gathered outside his daughter\u2019s residence in Hauz Khas and continued bursting firecrackers for hours, despite the police being unable to stop them. Phoolka added, \u201cThe Supreme Court said that now the offence of firecrackers is payable. They say we will consider giving more power to the police to enforce this ban on firecrackers.\u201dSpeaking to ANI, Phoolka also mentioned that the issue of farm fires was addressed in the hearing, with the Supreme Court directing the Central government to respond to Punjab\u2019s plea for funds to combat crop burning. Punjab had previously requested Rs 1,200 crore to support measures against stubble burning, a significant contributor to air pollution in Delhi during winter. The Central government has been asked to decide on the funds by November 11, the next date for the court hearing.With the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention, Phoolka expressed optimism that the steps taken would help improve Delhi\u2019s air quality. \u201cIt is quite hopeful that due to the intervention of the Supreme Court, the Delhi air probably will improve and the children of Delhi and the people of Delhi will get to at least breathe in unpolluted, pure air,\u201d he said",

Kalyan criticised the government\u2019s failure to maintain law and order, suggesting that past administrative weaknesses emboldened criminals and contributed to an unsafe environment, particularly for women and children.Kalyan\u2019s remarks came as he discussed the alarming increase in violent crimes, including recent cases of child sexual abuse and theft, which he claimed stem from a mentality cultivated under the former government. \u201cThe reason for the existence of people who commit despicable acts like raping children as young as three and five years is because of the environment fostered by past leaders who failed to uphold basic law and order,\u201d he said. Kalyan accused prior officials, including a former Director General of Police (DGP) of neglecting their responsibilities, allowing criminals to act with impunity.\u201cWhen my family received threats, including threats against my children, the police did nothing,\u201d he stated, criticising what he described as selective enforcement and disregard for accountability. He urged the current administration to set a better example for future generations and demanded greater accountability across the board. \u201cWhat kind of practices are we teaching society?\u201d he asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t the safety of every family matter?\u201dKalyan extended his criticism to social media, highlighting the prevalence of deepfake photos, rape threats, and other forms of harassment. \u201cIf anyone speaks up here, the response is a threat against their family. Won't such lowly lives be held responsible?\u201d he asked, questioning why the justice system continues to allow criminals to walk free. Taking aim at the YSRCP government, Kalyan pointed to a recent incident in Garuda, where a senior police official allegedly instructed citizens to remain silent about crime issues. \u201cYou can demand people\u2019s silence, but why can\u2019t we demand accountability against rapists and criminals?\u201d he asked. He questioned why those associated with the former administration were not held accountable for disruptive social media activity, while common citizens were expected to stay silent.He suggested that the state should take cues from countries like Singapore and Dubai, where strict punishments serve as effective deterrents against crime. \u201cThere are no cases like this in Singapore or Dubai, where capital punishment is applied. Why are we allowing these criminals to go scot-free?\u201d Kalyan remarked, suggesting that harsher punishments, including castration for rapists, should be considered in extreme cases. He referenced the words of a Delhi High Court judge who had once proposed castration for convicted rapists, recalling similar public calls for the death penalty following the Nirbhaya case.He also chastised Home Minister Vangalapudi Anitha, and implied that her leadership in enforcing law and order has been inadequate. \u201cIf I had taken up the Home Ministry, things would be starkly different,\u201d he asserted, hinting that he may consider the role in the future if changes are not implemented. \u201cI am the Panchayat Raj Minister, and I am telling you, do your responsibility as Home Minister. If things don\u2019t improve, a time may come when I have to assume the role of Home Minister myself,\u201d he warned Anitha.Published By: Afreen Published On: Nov 4, 2024Must Watch",

Madhusudana Chary, former minister V. Prashanth Reddy, MLA Dr. K. Sanjay and several other BRS leaders criticised the government on Monday (November 4, 2024) for resorting to \u2018illegal\u2019 arrest of former sarpanches and said the attitude was undemocratic.\n\nThey sought to know why the government was arresting the former sarpanches who worked for development of villages by borrowing money from lenders, by selling or mortgaging properties and gold jewellery belonging to their family members. They asked whether \u2018praja palana\u2019 meant arresting those who were protesting seeking clearance of bills pertaining to works executed by them.\n\nThe BRS leaders alleged that the police had shifted the former sarpanches - who were arrested by the police on reaching Hyderabad - from Bollaram police station to different places after learning that a team BRS leaders and activists led by Mr. Harish Rao was reaching there.\n\nLater, the BRS leaders reached Tirumalagiri police station where some of the arrested former sarpanches were lodged and staged a protest demanding their release and opportunity to meet the Chief Ministerto represent their woes. Speaking at Tirumalagiri police station, Mr. Harish Rao sought to know why the government was denying clearance of pending bills of the former sarpanches when it had ample money to clear the bills of major contractors.\n\nWhere was the need to arrest the former sarpanches around midnight as if they were terrorists, forgetting the fact that it was their hard work along with those by employees that had transformed villages in Telangana and helped them bag several awards. During the last 10 months, they had come to Hyderabad four times to represent their problems but there had been no response from the government.",

The scheme offers free bus travel to women in the state.Speaking to ANI, BJP leader Dr CN Ashwath Narayan said that the Shakti scheme lead to inconveniences to the people. With overcrowding and inefficient services led to collapse of the public transport system in Karnataka. Now realising the mistake, the Congress government wants to withdraw the scheme. \u201cWith the existing fleet of buses, they implemented the Shakti scheme which led to lots of inconveniences to the people. Students and labourers suffered due to overcrowding and inefficient services which led to the entire collapse of the public transport system. Now realising the mistake, the Congress government wants to withdraw the Shakti scheme. That\u2019s the right thing to do.Dr CN Ashwath Narayan further said, \u201cThe conflicting statement by Karnataka Deputy CM and Congress National President is very surprising. It has become a comedy government.\u201d Earlier, BJP National spokesperson CR Kesavan criticised the Congress-ruled states alleging that their flagship programs have turned out to be disastrous failship programs.Speaking to ANI, BJP National Spokesperson CR Kesavan said, \u201cThe so-called flagship programs of the Congress-ruled states have turned out to be disastrous failship programs which have wrecked the state economies and sunk them into the depth of financial despair and brink of bankruptcy.\u201dCR Kesavan further mentioned the reason for the flawed and reckless policies of the Congress state governments.\u201cThe reason for the flawed and reckless policies of the Congress state governments is because they have blindly followed the irrational and absurd Khata Khat economics of Rahul Gandhi. Himachal Pradesh run by the Congress is facing economic emergency. They\u2019re facing an economic catastrophe,\u201d he said.Earlier today, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar reconsidered his statement and said, \u201cKarnataka guarantee model is a model for the entire country. BJP and other parties are also adopting it and we are proud that we could implement that and we could deliver that. The people of Karnataka and the country are very happy with our model, \u201d Shivakumar told reporters.While speaking to the media reporters, DK Shivakumar said that his statement was twisted and whatever the elders say we have to follow that.\u201cWhatever our elders say we follow that.

        "title": "Channapatna bypoll in limelight as Congress, JD(S) vie for influence, prestige",
        "text": "In Karnataka, Channapatna assembly seat prepares for a high-stakes by-election on November 13, with significant implications for the Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress. Known as a former stronghold of the JD(S), the Channapatna seat in Ramanagara district is also a battleground for two of the state\u2019s most prominent Vokkaliga leaders: Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar of the Congress and Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy. While the election pits Kumaraswamy\u2019s son, Nikhil, against Congress candidate CP Yogeshwar, many see it as a proxy contest between Shivakumar and Kumaraswamy, testing loyalty within the Vokkaliga community. Kumaraswamy hopes Nikhil will extend the family\u2019s influence, while Shivakumar aims to solidify his leadership ambitions. Both Nikhil, representing the JD(S), and Yogeshwar view Channapatna as pivotal not just for themselves, but as a proving ground for their future within their respective parties. CHANNAPATNA AS VOKKALIGA BATTLEGROUNDThe Vokkaliga community, which forms a significant voter base in Old Mysuru, has long been a central support group for both the JD(S) and Congress. \u201cSome feel that this election is a battle between HDK and DKS, rather than between Nikhil and Yogeshwar,\u201d Kumaraswamy remarked, alluding to the clash of political personalities within the Vokkaliga community. For the JD(S), the stakes are especially high as this seat has been represented by HD Kumaraswamy himself four times in a row. Nikhil, acknowledging his role as a successor to this legacy, said: \u201cFor the past thirty years, I have seen many people who have supported Deve Gowda Ji and now HD Kumaraswamy.\u201d Nikhil\u2019s campaign is in full swing, with the JD(S) chief expressing optimism for his prospects. \u201cUltimately, he decided to run due to public pressure. Initially, we thought this election would be very challenging, but seeing the response, he is likely to win comfortably,\u201d Kumaraswamy said.The Congress, meanwhile, has deployed CP Yogeshwar, a former JD(S) member who recently switched allegiances after being denied a BJP ticket. Now firmly in the Congress camp, Yogeshwar underscored his familiarity with Channapatna and stated: \u201cI am very confident of winning this election. This is the tenth time I'm filing nomination from here.\u201d His appeal as a local with deep roots in Channapatna counters JD(S)\u2019s emphasis on Nikhil\u2019s political lineage, who at times have been perceived as an outsider. Nikhil, however, has dismissed this and said: \u201cWe may not have been born here, but that does not mean we aren\u2019t locals. HDK (his father) has been elected here four times in a row, and my mother was also an MLA from this region. People hold this in their hearts and know who has truly worked for them.\u201dThe by-election was necessitated after Kumaraswamy vacated his MLA seat when he won his Lok Sabha membership from Mandya. HIGH-STAKES CONTEST OF PERSONAL PRESTIGEThe Channapatna by-election is equally crucial for the Congress, whose campaign is spearheaded by Shivakumar, who is also the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president. For Shivakumar, the by-election represents an opportunity to consolidate his standing as a capable leader with the potential to succeed Siddaramaiah. He also sees this as an opportunity to settle scores after his brother DK Suresh was defeated in the recent Lok Sabha election in Bengaluru Rural, which was the only seat the Congress won in 2019. Highlighting Congress's development initiatives, he stated: \u201cPeople here are well-informed; they understand. I believe they will consider what they stand to gain in the future.\u201d However, the campaign has not been without controversy. Both Shivakumar and Kumaraswamy have addressed issues related to recent MUDA and Valmiki scandals. Shivakumar has downplayed allegations of corruption linked to the Congress, calling them \u201cpurely political\u201d and a tactic to create a narrative against the government. On the other hand, Kumaraswamy sees these issues as reflective of Congress\u2019s shortcomings. Nikhil has criticised the Congress guarantees as unfulfilled, framing the election as a broader battle against corruption.Published By: Preeja Published On: Nov 1, 2024",

He further mentioned Himachal Pradesh and said that Chief Minister Sukhvinder Sukhu has asked state government employees not to take their salaries.\u201cWhat about there announcements and promises in Himachal Pradesh? However, the CM there has asked state government employees not to take their salaries. They were also planning to impose a tax on toilets as well but had to withdraw the decision following a row over it,\u201d he added. The BJP leader further said that Congress just makes announcements and fool the public for the sake of votes.\u201cThey just make announcements and fool the public for the sake of votes and then they don\u2019t implement their promises\u2026In Karnataka, they (Congress) announced five guarantees. Today, they are talking about reviewing the free bus scheme (Shakti)\u2026BJP always fulfils the promises that we make,\u201d he said. He said that Congress has accepted today through its president that Congress has always talked about trying to deceive the public. \u201cFor the first time, Congress has accepted that they have misled the public\u2026Will Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge apologise for what is happening in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh?\u2026 The INDI alliance will do the same in Maharashtra and Jharkhand and mislead the public\u2026Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the nation,\u201d the BJP leader said. Earlier today, Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge meted out advice to the Congress units headed for polls cautioning them to announce guarantees on the basis of their budget.Kharge urged for careful consideration and warned that an unplanned approach could lead to financial difficulties and negatively impact future generations.During the press conference, he underscored the importance of fiscal responsibility, stating that if the government fails to deliver on its commitments, it could result in a bad reputation and hardships for the community.Kharge said,\u201d In Maharashtra, I\u2019ve said that they shouldn\u2019t announce 5, 6,10 or 20 guarantees. They should announce guarantees based on budget. Otherwise, there\u2019ll be bankruptcy. If there\u2019s no money for roads, everyone will turn against you. If this government fails, the future generation will be left with nothing but a bad name. They\u2019ll have to live in exile for 10 years.\u201dKharge\u2019s statement came after the Congress government in Karnataka suggested that it could review the Shakti scheme which ensured free bus transport for women.However, on Thursday, Karnataka Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy said that there will be no review or stoppage of the scheme.Earlier today, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar reconsidered his statement and said, \u201cKarnataka guarantee model is a model for the entire country. BJP and other parties are also adopting it and we are proud that we could implement that and we could deliver that. The people of Karnataka and the country are very happy with our model, \u201d Shivakumar told reporters.While speaking to the media reporters, DK Shivakumar said that his statement was twisted and whatever the elders say we have to follow that.\u201cWhatever our elders say we follow that. My statement was twisted. A few have suggested is what I have said. There is no question of closing the schemes. I had just said that we will discuss it. But the BJP just wants to do politics. They have nothing to do better,\u201d he said",

The shock move was announced by telecoms operator EMTEL, which said it was ordered late Thursday by the Information and Communication Technologies Authority to block access to all social media platforms. The blockage is due to last until November 11 -- a day after the election. EMTEL said the order referred to \"illegal postings that may impact national security and public safety\". It follows a scandal that broke out earlier this month when secret recordings of phone calls by politicians, journalists, members of civil society and even foreign diplomats were leaked online.There was no immediate comment from the government on the social media ban. \"It's shocking, revolting, and unacceptable. It's a sign of panic,\" said Paul Berenger, one of the leaders of the opposition Alliance for Change coalition. \"We are dealing with people who are dangerous to the country. Lawyers are working on what can be done legally. We will move very quickly on the legal and political level.\"Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth is seeking re-election as head of the Militant Socialist Movement. He inherited the premiership on the death of his father in 2017 and secured a victory for his coalition in polls two years later. \"This is the last desperate act of a regime in disarray,\" said Nando Bodha, head of opposition grouping Linion Reform.\"It attacks head-on the fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by the constitution, including freedom of expression,\" he added, calling for an intervention by the Election Commission to ensure the polls are \"free and fair\".

Asking them to carefully consider all factors, Kharge cautioned party-units going to elections that an unplanned approach could give rise to financial problems and cast a negative impression upon future generations. Addressing the media briefing, Kharge highlighted the role of financial responsibility, saying that if the government is unable to deliver upon its guarantees, it will lead to bad reputations and hardships for the communities. Dressing down the Karnataka Congress over not meeting their guarantees, Kharge said, \"You promised five guarantees in Karnataka. Inspired by you, we made a promise of five guarantees in Maharashtra. Today, you mentioned that you would cancel one of those guarantees. It seems like you all don't read the newspapers, but I do, so I'm telling you this.\" This remark came after the Congress-led Karnataka government said that it would review the Shakti scheme, which ensured to provide free bus services to women commuters. However, on Thursday, Karnataka Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy said that the scheme will not be reviewed. \"I advised Maharashtra Congress leaders not to keep making promises of five, six, seven, or eight guarantees. Instead, make promises that align with your budget. Making promises without considering the budget could lead to bankruptcy; there wouldn\u2019t even be money to put sand on the roads.

Patrolling in the Depsang sector is expected to start soon, Indian Army Sources said. The coordinated patrolling would mean that both sides will know about the schedules of patrols or both sides. Earlier on Thursday, Armies of both the countries exchanged sweets at various border points in the Ladakh sector on the occasion of Diwali. Indian and Chinese Army exchange of sweets took place at Hot Springs, Karakoram Pass, Daulat Beg Oldi, KongkLa and Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in Ladakh.Ladakh MP Haji Hanifa welcomed the disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.\u201cThose of us who live near the border know what war feels like. We desire peace along the border. We welcome the agreement between the two countries, but we want to see it implemented on the ground. Tensions along the border should be reduced through diplomatic means,\u201d said MP Hanifa.Earlier, Chief of Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi stressed that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations. He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions.Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said that it was natural for India and China to have differences as neighbouring countries but the important thing is how to handle and solve these differences.India and China have recently agreed on patrol arrangements along the LAC at the India-China border. The border standoff between India and China began in eastern Ladakh along the LAC in 2020, triggered by Chinese military actions. This incident led to prolonged tensions between the two nations, significantly straining their relations",

While the Centre approved Rs 817.80 crore VGF for the project, Kerala has been asked to repay this amount through revenue sharing.The project is designed as a major transshipment hub under India's \"Maritime India Vision 2030\" and \"Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047.\"The Chief Minister highlighted that VGF, intended to be a non-repayable grant, aims to support essential yet financially challenging projects, and Kerala's already heavy investment in the port makes the repayment condition particularly burdensome. Kerala is contributing Rs 5,595 crore toward the Rs 8,867 crore project and would face an additional Rs 10,000-12,000 crore financial strain if required to pay back in Net Present Value (NPV) terms through revenue sharing.\u201cGiven the fact that the ports in India account for a lion share of the Customs duties collected in the Country (now estimated in the Union Budget for the current year of Rs.2.38 lakh crores), Vizhinjam International Seaport, which is to be commissioned in December 2024, will soon contribute very significantly to this,\u201d he wrote. The Chief Minister also highlighted the revenue potential of the Vizhinjam seaport, estimating that it could contribute Rs 10,000 crore annually in Customs duties, generating an additional Rs 6,000 crore for the central government each year. Vijayan's letter also questioned why similar repayment terms were not imposed on the recent VGF approval for Tuticorin Port's Outer Harbor project, urging the Centre to provide Vizhinjam Port with comparable support to prevent a significant financial impact on Kerala\u2019s resources.

As of H1 FY25, revex is tracking 4.2 per cent vs the budgeted target of 6.2 per cent.\n\n Also read: \u20b91-crore-plus individual IT filers surge 41% in H1\n\n\u201cCapex (capital expenditure) is more concerning \u2013 down by 15 per cent thus far vs the budgeted growth of 17 per cent, implying the need to grow by a vast 52 per cent in H2 if the annual target is to be met. Public capex shortfall when private capex remains uneven and weak would be negative for the investment outlook,\u201d Nomura said. \n\nRevex growth recovery seems more feasible, and positive for government consumption GDP. We see a downside risk to our FY25 growth forecast of 6.7 per cent (RBI: 7.2 per cent). \n\n\u201cThat said, there is good news for fiscal. If capex were to grow by say, 30 per cent in H2 FY25 (vs the required 52 per cent), there could be fiscal savings of 0.3 per cent of GDP. On the revenue side, corporate tax collections are trailing, but higher income tax collections should help bridge much of that shortfall. Thus, we think there could be a positive surprise to the FY25 fiscal deficit target of 4.9 per cent of GDP,\u201d Nomura added. \n\n Also read: India\u2019s business activity grows at faster clip in Oct, PMI shows",

May the people of the state keep progressing in the times to come,\u201d said PM on his social media account.\n\nThe state of Kerala was created on 1 November 1956.

M. S. Namboothiripad-led government became the first elected Communist government in the world.\n\nMore popularly known as Kerala Day in English and Kerala Piravi in Malayalam, the day is celebrated every year on November 1 to commemorate the establishment of the state of Kerala.\n\nOn a broader note, this day is also seen as one to spotlight Kerala\u2019s progress, achievements, and cultural heritage on a global stage.\n\nKerala Piravi is derived from the Malayalam word \u2018piravi\u2019 meaning birth.\n\nThe occasion marks the unification of Malayalam-speaking regions into a single state.\n\nOn this day, the tradition continues although on a smaller scale, women are generally dressed in the traditional set and mundu, more popularly known as Kerala Saree, while men wear \u2018mundu\u2019 (white dhothi).\n\nLikewise, on this day, there is increased activity at educational institutions and in some government offices Malayala Bhasha Vaarams, or language contests, to foster the cultural and linguistic heritage of the state.",

Suitcase handles are aligned in a direction that is easy for customers to pick up,\" Habuta said.\"We hand fragile items, strollers, surfboards and skis directly to passengers,\" he said.Luggage is on the carousel inside in the terminal building \"within 15 minutes of the aircraft's arrival to minimise stress of customers,\" he added.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");One of Japan's busiest international airports, Kansai was ranked the World's Best Airport for Baggage Delivery by UK-based airport rating organisation SKYTRAX in April.\"Everyone at the Kansai Airport is proud of this,\" co-CEO of the airport Benoit Rulleau told AFP.Rulleau acknowledged that it is easier to achieve zero lost bags at an airport such as Kansai, which serves relatively few connecting passengers.But he said the achievement reflects the \"incredible devotion\" of the airport's staff. The number of lost or delayed bags has sharply decreased globally in the past decade thanks to technology, said Nicole Hogg, baggage portfolio director at SITA, a Geneve-based IT services provider in the air transport industry.\"If you think about the passenger volumes that we have, 6.9 bags being mishandled (per 1,000 passengers) is a very low figure,\" Hogg told AFP.\"A decade ago, we were in double figures,\" she said, adding \"the industry investing in technology is definitely paying off.\"She explained that baggage is rarely mishandled when passengers have no connections.\"The complexity really comes in the transfer process where passengers have short connection times and they're trying to get from one flight to another,\" she said.Kansai recently returned to its pre-pandemic level of 25 million international passengers a year.Ahead of the Osaka Expo 2025 it has gone through a renovation with a new security checkpoint that allows for an even smoother experience.Rulleau said the airport will be able to accommodate up to 40 million passengers a year -- and probably none of them will lose their bag.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border, but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength,\u201d he said.\u201cWe will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi,\u201d Trump had said.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Utsav Sanduja, founder and chairman of Hindus for America First told PTI in an interview that they are very grateful to President Trump.\"I'm very grateful to President Trump, eternally grateful and eternally appreciative. It sucks that Kamala Harris hasn't said anything about this issue. I think that there's going to be a big change in this election coming from this,\u201d Sanduja said.HinduAction also thanked Trump for his statement.\u201cAs you rightly pointed out, the situation of the Hindus in Bangladesh is precarious. Below is a summary head with regularly updated data on the atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh,\u201d it said.\u201cThank you President Trump for showing moral clarity and unequivocally condemning anti-Hindu pogroms in Bangladesh,\u201d said Indian-American Nathan Punwani.\u201cTrump is a great man and, a great leader, full credit goes to him for wishing all the Hindus, Buddhists, and Jain Sikhs a very blessed Diwali. I think Trump really, really cares about these communities. He really understands what's going on in Bangladesh. He sees the ongoing persecution of Hindus. He is concerned about religious minorities that are suffering right now in that country,\u201d Sanduja said.\u201cHe has done such a great favour to millions of Americans who are concerned about human rights issues. To deliver on Diwali, such an auspicious day, such a magnificent thing. I'd like to say that many of us in the Hindu community played a small part in persuading President Trump's team, talking about this, giving briefings, and putting papers together,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are seeing that 60 per cent of Indian Americans are supporting Kamala Harris. In the last election, I think 68 per cent supported Biden. There's a dip in support for the Democratic presidential candidate. Trump, last time around, had 22 per cent of the Indian American community. Now he's at 32 per cent. This is according to Carnegie Endowment's latest survey on Indian American attitudes,\u201d he said.\u201cWith this statement, it's going to open up the eyes of more Indian Americans, Hindu Americans, and so on. They're going to give President Trump the vote,\u201d Sanduja said.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

But for One Nation One Election, the money saved, and economic development should be proper. Development process also will smoothly run. It is welcome steps,\u201d he said. Earlier on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after paing tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his birth anniversary had said that his government is working towards achieving simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and State assemblies. We are now working towards One Nation One Election, which will strengthen India\u2019s democracy, give optimum outcome of India\u2019s resources and the country will gain new momentum in achieving the dream of a developed India. Today, India is moving towards One Nation One Civil Code that is a Secular Civil Code,\u201d he said.Former President of India Ramnath Kovind had led a high-level committee on the issue and submitted a report in favour of holding simultaneous elections in the country. Notably, on October 6, speaking on the issue at 30th Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial Lecture Kovind said that during the first four electoral cycles of the country, Lok Sabha and state assembly elections were \u201csynchronised,\u201d which was later broken in the year 1968.\u201cSimultaneous elections were the norm in the early years of the republic. Elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies were synchronised during the first four electoral cycles\u2026 This cycle of concurrent elections was broken in the year 1968 when several state assemblies were prematurely dissolved by the then Union Government exercising its power under Article 356\u2026Some sections of society have termed simultaneous elections undemocratic and unconstitutional. It is hard to miss the irony when we look into the genesis of the disruption of electoral cycles\u2026 Simultaneous elections were the vision of our constitutional forefathers,\u201d he said. Simultaneous elections is a contentious topic since the submission of the report, with Congress President calling the idea as \u201cimpossible\u201d on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Congress President Kharge said, \u201cWhat PM Modi has said, he will not do it, because when it comes in the parliament, he has to take everybody into confidence, then only this will happen. This is impossible, \u2018One Nation One Election\u2019 is impossible.\u201d (ANI)",

His affidavit, however, has sparked controversy over discrepancies in his age. Soren\u2019s 2019 nomination listed him as 42 years old, but this year\u2019s affidavit states his age as 49, raising questions. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has called for Soren\u2019s nomination to be canceled, citing inconsistencies. BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo criticized the seven-year age increase over five years and pointed to Soren\u2019s reported income drop from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 4 lakh. Additionally, the party claims some assets were not disclosed. Complaints have been filed, and the BJP plans to approach the Election Commission.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP co-incharge for the elections, accused the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) of operating a \u201cfake\u201d system, linking the affidavit issues to governance concerns. Meanwhile, JMM leader Manoj Pandey defended Soren, dismissing BJP\u2019s claims as baseless and driven by fear of defeat. Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal called the controversy a diversion tactic by the BJP.The elections will occur in two phases, on November 13 and 20, with results on November 23. Around 2.60 crore voters are expected, up from 2.23 crore in 2019. The BJP aims to reclaim power from the JMM-led alliance.",

The incident occurred in Mandipanka village under the Daringbadi block.Despite government-provided rations, many tribal communities in the area continue to include mango kernels and bamboo flowers in their diet as part of their traditional food practices.According to reports, the women experienced severe stomach pain and discomfort after consuming the mango kernel dishes. Initially treated at the local Godapur Community Health Centre (CHC), they were later transferred to the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur when their conditions worsened.Tragically, one of the women died while receiving treatment, and a young girl passed away en route to MKCG. While doctors have yet to confirm the exact cause of death, locals suspect food poisoning linked to the consumption of mango kernel dishes.Kumari Mallick, the Sarpanch of Gadapur Gram Panchayat, noted, \u201cThough people here are covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and receive rice as per law, they continue to consume mango kernel and bamboo flowers to preserve their traditional food practices. Some have stopped eating mango kernels, but others still enjoy dishes like mango kernel pudding and mango kernel custard as part of our cultural heritage.\u201dCommunity members explain that mango kernel dishes can become toxic if not consumed fresh, especially if stored in unhygienic conditions. Consumption of mango kernel a traditional food practice\"Some people say that due to limited resources for buying vegetables and other essentials, locals in South Odisha rely on forest produce like grasses, mushrooms, pulses, and mango kernels. However, this isn't entirely accurate. Our forefathers traditionally consumed these forest foods, but unexpected health issues arise when people today don't prepare or consume them properly,\" a relative of a patient undergoing treatment at MKCG Medical College and Hospital explained to reporters on Friday.Sources said the state government asked the Kandhamal district administration to conduct a probe into the incident and submit a report to it.",

Kerala state is known for its mesmerising landscapes, vibrant traditions and hardworking people. People from Kerala have made their mark all over the world, across different fields. May the people of the state keep progressing in the times to come,\u201d said PM on his social media account.\r\n\r\nThe state of Kerala was created on 1 November 1956. Prior to 1956, Kerala had been divided into four regions: South Canara (Kasaragod region), Malabar, Cochin, and Travancore.\r\n\r\nOn 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Canara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras, and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act.\r\n\r\nThen soon came the first Assembly election and that too was a record of sorts when the now legendary Communist E. M. S. Namboothiripad-led government became the first elected Communist government in the world.\r\n\r\nMore popularly known as Kerala Day in English and Kerala Piravi in Malayalam, the day is celebrated every year on November 1 to commemorate the establishment of the state of Kerala.\r\n\r\nOn a broader note, this day is also seen as one to spotlight Kerala's progress, achievements, and cultural heritage on a global stage.\r\n\r\nKerala Piravi is derived from the Malayalam word 'piravi' meaning birth.\r\n\r\nThe occasion marks the unification of Malayalam-speaking regions into a single state.\r\n\r\nOn this day, the tradition continues although on a smaller scale, women are generally dressed in the traditional set and mundu, more popularly known as Kerala Saree, while men wear \u2018mundu\u2019 (white dhothi).\r\n\r\nLikewise, on this day, there is increased activity at educational institutions and in some government offices Malayala Bhasha Vaarams, or language contests, to foster the cultural and linguistic heritage of the state.",

I am talking about CM Soren. In the 2019 affidavit, he stated his age as 42 years, and in this affidavit, he stated it as 49 years. This means either he was lying then or he is lying now. Both affidavits provided his age. In five years, we have never seen a common person\u2019s age increase by seven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many differences in his affidavit like there was a property of Rs 10 lakh in which the rate of that property has decreased. Generally, it increases but in his case, the rate is decreasing. Soren also didn\u2019t mention the land he bought in between 2004-2006 in the affidavit. But, now it is mentioned in the affidavit of 2024. He has also not mentioned his wife Kalpana Murmu Soren\u2019s bank account in the Bank of Baroda. So for this reason, we have complained to the Returning Officer and the Election Commission of India to invalidate his nomination in the forthcoming elections,\u201d he concluded.\n\nHowever, JMM leader Manoj Pandey on Friday clarified all the allegations of the BJP about the age of the Jharkhand CM and said there was no need to do politics on this as everything was crystal clear.\n\nManoj Pandey said, \u201cEverything is crystal clear. All the information related to CM Soren is in the public domain. We do not believe in telling lies. He was born in 1975, so according to that he is 49 years old now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there were any mistakes earlier, then they should be corrected. There is no need to raise questions on such things. The JMM neither promotes fake things nor presents fake documents. We are not among those who have not passed even class eight and talk of a degree in political science. We don\u2019t tick the column of being unmarried if we are married. So, we are not like that,\u201d he added.",

Regarding the situation with dissatisfied rebel Congress leaders in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, Gehlot said, \u201cThere is already a favourable atmosphere for Congress. I was in Maharashtra recently, and there is an anti-government sentiment among the common people, which will benefit us. I hope that according to the current atmosphere, Congress and the alliance will win the elections. Regarding convincing the rebels, the process has been ongoing since the day the forms were filled. We are in constant contact with them. The last date for form withdrawals is November 4, and I expect that many rebel leaders will withdraw their forms by that date.\u201dOn the upcoming by-elections for seven seats in the Rajasthan Assembly, Gehlot mentioned, \u201cThese elections are local. Voting is done properly and elections are held based on local issues. I still feel that local problems and issues play a significant role, and these elections will be conducted accordingly. It is too early to predict what the situation will be, but everyone is committed, and Congress is united for this election.\u201dGehlot also underlined the importance of democratic dialogue for the One Nation, One Election initiative and expressed confidence in Congress\u2019s unity for the upcoming local elections in Rajasthan.Gehlot also reacted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s comments on implementing the One Nation, One Election initiative and the Uniform Civil Code, saying, \u201cLook, these are immoral people. They have no faith in democracy; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t act in haste. If you (the government) want to do any work, bring the bills while involving the public and opposition parties in Parliament. Just look at the farmers\u2019 movement, where 700 farmers lost their lives unnecessarily, and the government had to yield, causing the bill to be halted. So what was the benefit of that?\u201dThe former Rajasthan CM also spoke on Rajasthan\u2019s current Education Minister Madan Dilawar\u2019s comment about the absence of textbooks on the Godhra incident.In response to Education Minister Dilawar\u2019s remarks about the lack of textbooks related to the Godhra incident during Gehlot\u2019s previous administration, the former Chief Minister stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have any information on this matter, but you know the minister. He can say anything about anyone. The Chief Minister hasn\u2019t commented on this. I have said that I don\u2019t have any information, but adding or removing subjects from textbooks is not a good tradition. There should be a committee that decides which subjects to include and which to exclude, and there is indeed a committee for that.\u201d (ANI)",

They are on a mission to reclaim that glory in the current campaign, and whilst their forms have been at the opposite ends of the spectrum thus far, the incredible quality of players in their ranks assures spectators of an engaging encounter with a significant lot to play for.\n\nPlaying in their backyard is usually supposed to produce positive results for teams, but such hasn\u2019t been the case for FC Goa in recent times. They have now gone four games without a victory at home, their longest such streak in the ISL, and the quicker they snap this \u2013 the better it will be to fuel their efforts of getting their fans to rally behind them this season.\n\nOne factor that can help the Gaurs turn around their form is head coach Manolo Marquez\u2019s commendable record against Bengaluru FC. The coach\u2019s teams have not lost a game against the Blues in his eight face-offs against them. Bengaluru FC are one of the two teams along with East Bengal FC that he has faced at least thrice but never lost against in the ISL. Can his lucky charm against the Blues propel the Gaurs to success tomorrow?\n\nWith 16 points from six games, this is Bengaluru FC\u2019s second-best start to an ISL season \u2013 only behind the 2018-19 campaign when they went on to finish atop the table. They seem to be on similar momentum this time around, winning five encounters, drawing once, scoring 11 goals and conceding merely once thus far.\n\nBengaluru FC have completed 82.1% of attempted passes in ISL 2024-25, which is the highest amongst all teams in the league. They have evidently been patient in their build-up, asserting pressure on the opposition\u2019s backline, taking the game to them, and creating opportunities that their efficient frontline has been able to convert at ease. The Blues also scored thrice in their last away match, which was a 3-1 win against Kerala Blasters FC and the last time they netted multiple strikes on consecutive games at the opposition\u2019s home was a sequence of three games between January-February 2023.\n\nFC Goa head coach Manolo Marquez quipped that his attack has been performing at an optimal level and he praised his team for producing competitive performances this season.\n\n\u201cThe only game that we played bad was against Mohun Bagan. Against Mumbai, the match was even and other games we have played at a good level. The attack I feel is performing well now,\u201d Marquez said.\n\nBengaluru FC head coach Gerard Zaragoza shared an interesting insight about a defensive game plan that is helping them prevent more goal-scoring chances from coming into their box.\n\n\u201cWe work hard to stop balls coming into our box. We try to protect our goal, we try to protect Gurpreet. When we do that, we will leave something open. If we close the areas in the middle, there will be space outside. We took a risk but at the moment in six games we haven\u2019t conceded from crosses,\u201d Zaragoza said.",

The minister also interacted with a Tangkhul Naga Group from Manipur who had come for the unveiling of the statue of Major Bob Khathing.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier in the day, following disengagement between India and China, Indian troops started patrolling the Demchok sector in eastern Ladakh. This development comes after both countries agreed to disengage and initiate coordinated patrols based on their perception of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Demchok and Depsang sectors. Indian Army sources indicated that patrolling in the Depsang sector is expected to begin soon.Coordinated patrolling means that both sides will be aware of each other\u2019s patrol schedules. Earlier on Thursday, the armies of both countries exchanged sweets at various border points in the Ladakh sector to celebrate Diwali. The Indian and Chinese armies exchanged sweets at Hot Springs, Karakoram Pass, Daulat Beg Oldi, KongkLa, and the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in Ladakh. (ANI)",

The video gives a glimpse into the chaos of the September 1 attack, which also involved two vehicles being torched. Taking responsibility for the attack, the Lawrence Bishnoi-Godara gang member on social media said, \"On the night of September 1, there were shootings at two places in Canada: Victoria Island (B.C.) and Woodbridge, Toronto. I, Rohit Godara of the Lawrence Bishnoi group, take responsibility for both incidents.\"The gang alleged that the attack was in response to the singer featuring Salman Khan in a music video. \"The house on Victoria Island belongs to AP Dhillon. This person is getting a lot of attention after including Salman Khan in his song. We came to your place; either come out, or show yourself in action. The underworld life you all try to copy is the life we\u2019re actually living. Stay in your place, or you'll be killed,\" the post reads.The gang is currently under probe in connection with high profile cases, including the killings of Sidhu Moosewala and Baba Sidiqqui. Meanwhile, the Canadian police have arrested 25-year-old Abhijeet Kingra in connection with the shooting incident outside the residence of AP Dhillon. He is being charged with the \"discharge of a firearm with intent and arson,\" and is slated to be presented before an Ontario court today. The police have also issued an arrest warrant for another suspect, 23-year-old Vikram Sharma, who the authorities believe is in India.

        "text": "A British ban on protesting outside abortion clinics went into effect on Thursday, though it left a question mark over whether anti-abortion demonstrators who pray silently will be breaking the law.The law, which applies to England and Wales, bars protests within 150 metres of clinics. Scotland and Northern Ireland, which make their own health policies, recently enacted similar bans.The new rules make it an offense to obstruct someone using abortion services, \u201cintentionally or recklessly\u201d influence their decision, or cause \u201charassment, alarm or distress.\u201d Offenders face a fine, with no upper limit.The buffer zone rule was passed 18 months ago as part of the previous Conservative government's Public Order Act, but wrangling over whether it would apply to silent prayer protests, and a change in government in July, have delayed it taking effect.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The Crown Prosecution Service says silent prayer near an abortion clinic \u201cwill not necessarily commit a criminal offense,\u201d and police say they will assess each case individually.Anti-abortion campaigners and religious groups argue that banning silent-prayer protests would be an affront to freedom of religion. But pro-choice campaigners say silent anti-abortion demonstrators are often intimidating to women entering clinics.\u201cIt's difficult to see how anyone choosing to perform their prayers right outside an abortion clinic could argue they aren't attempting to influence people \u2014 and there are countless testimonies from women who say this makes them feel distressed,\u201d said Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, one of Britain's biggest abortion providers.In March 2023, lawmakers rejected a change to the legislation proposed by some conservative legislators that would have explicitly allowed silent prayer within the buffer zones. The final rules are a potentially messy compromise that is likely to be tested in court.Crime and Policing Minister Diana Johnson said she was \u201cconfident that the safeguards we have put in place today will have a genuine impact in helping women feel safer and empowered to access the vital services they need.\u201dBut Bishop John Sherrington of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, said the government had \u201ctaken an unnecessary and disproportionate step backwards\u201d on religious freedom.\u201cReligious freedom includes the right to manifest one's private beliefs in public through witness, prayer and charitable outreach, including outside abortion facilities,\u201d he said.Abortion is not as divisive an issue in the UK as in the US, where women's access to terminations has been rolled back, and banned in some states, since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe vs Wade ruling in 2022.Abortion was partly legalised in Britain by the 1967 Abortion Act, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors approve. Later abortions are allowed in some circumstances, including danger to the mother's life.But women who have abortions after 24 weeks in England and Wales can be prosecuted under the 1861 Offenses Against the Person Act.Last year a 45-year-old woman in England was sentenced to 28 months in prison for ordering abortion pills online to induce a miscarriage when she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant. After an outcry, her sentence was reduced.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "'Congress accepted they misled public': BJP demands apology from Kharge, Rahul Gandhi",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad made a sharp criticism at the Congress party on Friday for its 'Shakti scheme,' demanding an apology from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. Prasad accused the grand old party of misleading the public and making empty promises.Speaking at a press conference, Prasad referenced Kharge's recent statement on announcing schemes based on budgetary provisions. \"The Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge has accepted that we should make an announcement for only those items for which we have budgetary provisions and financial availability, Has Mallikarjun Kharge taught this lesson to Rahul Gandhi? Rahul Gandhi is an expert in making announcements, and he keeps doing it\" Prasad said. He questioned if Kharge had shared this advice with Rahul Gandhi, who, according to Prasad, frequently makes unfulfilled promises.Prasad also criticised the situation in Himachal Pradesh, where chief minister Sukhvinder Sukhu reportedly asked state employees to forgo their salaries. He pointed out that the Congress government had to withdraw a proposed tax on toilets due to public backlash.He accused the grand old party of making false announcements for votes without any intent to implement them, citing Karnataka as an example. \"They just make announcements and fool the public for the sake of votes and then they don't implement their promises,\" Prasad said.\"For the first time, Congress has accepted that they have misled the public...Will Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge apologise for what is happening in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh?... The INDI alliance will do the same in Maharashtra and Jharkhand and mislead the public...Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the nation,\" the BJP leader added.Pralhad Joshi, a Union minister, echoed Prasad's sentiments, accusing Congress of making promises solely for electoral gains without following through. \"Congress throughout the country in many states are making false promises and are not implementing the guarantees,\" Joshi told ANI.Earlier today, Mallikarjun Kharge advised Congress units to be cautious with their promises, stressing fiscal responsibility. \"They should announce guarantees based on budget. Otherwise, there\u2019ll be bankruptcy. If there\u2019s no money for roads, everyone will turn against you,\" Kharge said.Conflicting statements within the Karnataka Congress emerged regarding the Shakti scheme, which offers free bus transport for women. While there were suggestions of a review, Karnataka transport minister Ramalinga Reddy assured that there would be no changes to the scheme. Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar also clarified his stance, stating that his previous comments were misinterpreted and reaffirming commitment to the scheme.\"Whatever our elders say we follow that. My statement was twisted. A few have suggested is what I have said. There is no question of closing the schemes. I had just said that we will discuss it. But the BJP just wants to do politics,\" he said.",

        "text": "The Border Security Force (BSF) troops on Friday recovered two drones and one packet of suspected heroin at three different places in the border area of district Amritsar.Based on information from the BSF intelligence wing, the troops foiled the attempt of drone smuggling through the border.According to an official statement, one packet of suspected heroin (Gross weight- 570 Grams) was recovered by BSF troops during the night hours of October 31 at about 11:15 pm from a harvested paddy field adjacent to the village- Pulmoran of Amritsar district.The narcotics were wrapped with yellow adhesive tape and a steel ring and an illuminating strip were also found attached to the packet. The first drone (DJI Mavic 3 Classic) was recovered by BSF troops at about midnight 12:30 am from a farming field adjacent to the village- Pulmoran, Amritsar.The second drone (DJI Mavic 3 Classic) was recovered by BSF troops during morning hours at about 08:45 am from a farming field adjacent to the village- Dhanoe Kalan of Amritsar district. The reliable input from the BSF intelligence wing and the timely action of diligent BSF troops foiled these drone intrusions and narco-smuggling attempts from across the border.Earlier on October 29, acting on specific information about smuggling activity near the border, alert troops of BSF successfully nabbed 3 Narco Smugglers alongwith one packet of Heroin and 2 smartphones in the late evening hours along the Amritsar border. All the apprehended smugglers are residents of Border villages of Amritsar. The smugglers have been handed over to police for further investigation to establish their possible links to Pakistan-based narcotics networks. This significant apprehension reflects BSF\u2019s professional competence and dedication to securing our borders & combating cross-border smuggling. On October 28, acting on specific information from BSF\u2019s intelligence wing about a suspected narco-drone, alert troops of BSF recovered 1 deone and 480 grams of Heroin from a farming field during a search operation near village Roranwala Khurd in Amritsar district.

        "text": "In today\u2019s world, public figures are often viewed as other-worldly and elite. But as some say, \u201cCelebrities are just normal people,\u201d and the common language that all regular folks speak is just one: food! Many celebrities love food as we do, and some even adore our favourite dishes and restaurants. Vizagites, don\u2019t fret, for we aren\u2019t left out of this loop. A couple of eateries in Visakhapatnam are known to be appreciated by celebrities and politicians, and we\u2019ve got a list of them:\n\n1. Venkatadri Vantillu\n\nThe legendary director, SS Rajamouli, visited this iconic restaurant back in 2019. He even took to social media to express his feelings after eating here, and said, \u201cIt is very rare to find healthy food that tastes really good. Indirakka at Venkatadri Vantillu in Vizag does it with korralu dosa..Delicious..\ud83d\ude0b.\u201d Check out his post on X here.\n\nStarted by Indira Vankineni, Venkatadri Vantillu is one woman\u2019s dream come true. To financially support her family, she ventured into the food businessin 2002 with just Rs 5,000/-. In a tiny, rented space, she began making punukulu, mirchi bhajji, masala vada and other snacks. Much positive feedback motivated her to introduce her signature dish \u2013 sponge dosa. Since its inception, Venkatadri Vantillu and Vizag have never been the same.\n\nKnown for its mesmerizing Ghee Karam Sponge Dosa which is served with a variety of rich chutneys and sambar, this place presently offers an extensive range of dosas, pesarettus, and idlis at prices that won\u2019t burden your wallet. Venkatadri Vantillu also offers an array of fresh fruit juices, shakes, and desserts.\n\n2. Vasena Poli\n\nThere\u2019s no better brag than impressing the (former) Vice President of India, and Vasena Poli \u2013 a humble tiffin stall in Vizag \u2013 did just that! On a visit to the coastal town in 2021, M Venkiah Naidu enjoyed a signature meal of \u201cVasena Poli\u201d idli, i.e., idli made from millet flour and steamed in conically-folded leaf-plates or Vistarakulu!\n\nBeyond satisfied with his food, the politician went on social media to make a viral post about his experience. \u201cHad a sumptuous breakfast of millet idlis today made by \u2018Vasena Poli\u2019 stall run by a young agri-entrepreneur Chittem Sudheer in Visakhapatnam. With a rich flavour and taste, such millet-based food offer a healthy and organic alternative to our diet\u2026 Such innovative efforts by our youth to go back to our traditional diet & lifestyle are commendable.\u201d\n\nChittem Sudheer, the owner of the stall, hails from Guntur and takes a health-focused approach to his cooking. In an interview with Yo Vizag, he shared that he uses Vistaraku leaf because it is anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and contains antioxidants.\n\nOne of the most popular eateries in Visakhapatnam, you can find hearty dishes here including Millet Dosa, Millet Soup, Jowar Roti, and over 6 kinds of Millet Idlis!\n\n3. Hut Arabica\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, on his radio show, \u2018Mann Ki Baat,\u2019 expressed his love for Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC)\u2019s Araku Valley coffee globally. The brand plays a big role in the \u2018Make in India\u2019 movement and its mission of helping local products attain global recognition. More importantly, the coffee, produced in the highlands of Alluri Seetharamaraju region, has an exceptionally rich taste and aroma that one can\u2019t forget!\n\nThe Prime Minister was first seen enjoying this coffee with Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu at the G20 Summit in Delhi. Though he did not physically visit the cafe in Vizag, the same mesmerizing taste of Araku Valley Coffee can be found at Hut Arabica in Vizag, a Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd initiative! You can find a variety of hot and cold coffees, cappuccinos, americanos, and lattes, coming in vanilla, chocolate, and caramel flavours.\n\n4. S kota\u2019s Hotel Muntaj\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard of Hotel Muntaj, you\u2019ve probably heard of the tagline that goes with it \u2013 \u201cPrabhas\u2019 favourite fry piece biryani!\u201d Being a staple since 1974, this restaurant is a favourite among our favourite celebrities! As it is situated on the Vizag-Araku route, many film troupes that set out to shoot at the hill station grab a few bags of Hotel Muntaj\u2019s famous Biryani for the road.\n\nThe restaurant was started by a couple in S Kota 55 years ago. Today, their three sons run the place and have opened its branches in Visakhapatnam \u2013 which have risen to become some of the most popular eateries here.\n\nFamous celebrities including Sathyaraj, Nani, Saptagiri, Raghu Kunche, and more have dined at the original outlet in S Kota.\n\nSome of the specialities here (apart from the Chicken Fry Piece Biryani) include the Chicken Dum Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Biriyani, and Mutton Kheema Biriyani.\n\n5.

The launch was initially reported by South Korean media, citing the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The information was later confirmed by the Japanese Coast Guard.According to South Korean and Japanese sources, the launch of an unknown type of missile was made from the Pyongyang area. The flight trajectory was specific. Having started at an acute angle, the missile reached a high altitude, performed a maneuver, and immediately went down. Although the product covered a little more than 300 kilometers in a straight line, its flight time was several tens of minutes. This means that with a relatively flat trajectory, the missile could have reached a target at a distance of 10 thousand kilometers or even further. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});The current missile launch was the second since the beginning of autumn. In late September, North Korean developers and the military tested a ballistic missile with a super-heavy warhead. And in mid-May, Pyongyang tested tactical missiles with a new control system.It is clear that the DPRK, like any other country, carefully guards its missile and nuclear secrets. Meanwhile, if you compare the facts and analyze the available information, then Pyongyang's plan for nuclear deterrence of its opponents becomes more or less understandable. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});What's in the arsenalThe exact composition of North Korea's nuclear arsenal is unknown. According to Western experts, it is no more than 30 charges with a capacity of 10 to 20 kilotons. Such special ammunition is classified as tactical. But it is highly likely that Western figures are incorrect.Most likely, we are talking about 50-70 nuclear warheads. At the same time, Pyongyang has, at a minimum, several charges with a capacity of over a hundred kilotons. And such ammunition is already approaching the capabilities of strategic nuclear weapons. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});The North Korean arsenal is gradually growing. According to conservative Western estimates, by 2030 Pyongyang will have 80 to 90 nuclear warheads. Most likely, there will be more charges. Moreover, the emphasis will be on creating special warheads of increased power.Over the past few years, the North Korean military-industrial complex has managed to develop a whole line of ballistic missiles. Thus, the Hwasong-15, -17, and -18 products are capable of hitting targets at a distance of 13 to 15 thousand kilometers. These missiles caused the most negative reaction from the United States and Japan. In addition to intercontinental missiles, the DPRK's arsenal includes a large number of products with a flight range of 300 to 2500 kilometers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});North korean Nuclear missile test [PHOTO: OUTRIDER]This year, Pyongyang was able to radically improve its intercontinental ballistic missiles. Thus, in the spring, two tactical missiles with a new control system werelaunched. Analysis of the missiles' flight parameters suggests that at least one of them was an ICBM. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});North Korean developers have tried to implement a new control system on one of the Hwasong family missiles, which can ensure the execution of maneuvers during the active section of the trajectory.Already in September, the Hwasong-11 missile with a new high-power warhead was tested. And here it should be noted that this was not a combat test. A mass-dimensional model of the missile's warhead was tested. The new product is designed for the use of high-power nuclear warheads. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Unlike its older \u201csisters\u201d, the \u201celeventh\u201d is a tactical missile. Its flight range does not exceed 800 kilometers. Meanwhile, in terms of dimensions and technical solutions, it is virtually identical to the longer-range Hwasong-15, -17, -18. Therefore, with a high degree of probability, the new warhead is not intended for the tactical \u201celeventh\u201d, but for heavier intercontinental ballistic missiles of this family.The current launch allowed Pyongyang to once again test the complex control system for its ICBMs. That is why the missile launched on October 31 had such a complex flight profile. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});These facts indicate that North Korea will receive an updated arsenal of ICBMs in the very near future.First, the missiles will be able to perform maneuvers during the active part of the trajectory \u2014 when the engines are still running. This is necessary to evade the American missile defense systems that Washington is deploying on the Korean Peninsula. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});According to Aljazeera, THAAD batteries usually are made up of 95 soldiers, six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors \u2013 eight for each launcher \u2013 one radar system, and a fire control and communications component.In its southern part, several batteries of American THAAD anti-missile systems were deployed back in 2017. In 2022 and 2023, they underwent major modernization. In particular, radars, control, and information exchange systems were updated in each system. But most importantly, their arsenal included new PAC-3 MSE anti-missiles. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Formally, THAAD is designed to protect against short- and medium-range missile attacks.But in reality, the main goal of the American missile defense is to intercept ICBMs launched by Pyongyang. With the PAC-3 MSE, THAAD crews will be able to confidently hit North Korean missiles precisely in the active part of the trajectory.But now the negative situation for Pyongyang is starting to change. Thanks to the updated control system, North Korean ICBMs will be able to perform a special maneuver at least once while the engines are running. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});It is important to understand that the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for interception for THAAD is extremely narrow \u2013 only a few minutes. At the same time, due to the enormous launch speeds of ICBMs, the anti-missile will not be able to maneuver much.Therefore, a maneuver by a North Korean missile, where it first changes trajectory and then returns to it, will, with a high degree of probability, lead to a failure of the interception. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Secondly, Pyongyang is betting on equipping ICBMs with single-block high-power nuclear warheads. The warheads of missiles for such products have already been tested. And most likely, they are already being installed on Hwasong with an intercontinental range.The target is American megacitiesWhy did North Korean engineers and military personnel choose this path? After all, global trends in the development of missile and nuclear technologies indicate the need to equip intercontinental ballistic missiles with separate warheads with individual guidance. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});The North Korean military and political leadership soberly assesses its capabilities for producing special ammunition. The option with warheads will require a serious increase in the production of nuclear warheads, as well as making them high-tech. Most likely, Beijing's scientific, technical, and production levels do not yet allow for such developments.

        "text": "New Delhi: The Indian Army began patrolling at Demchok on Friday, days after Indian and Chinese troops completed disengagement at the two friction points in eastern Ladakh, Army sources said.Patrolling at Depsang is expected to resume shortly, they said. Indian and Chinese troops have completed disengagement at two friction points at Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh and patrolling is set to commence soon at these points, Army sources had said on Wednesday. The following day, Indian and Chinese troops exchanged sweets at several border points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the occasion of Diwali. The traditional practice was observed a day after both the countries completed troop disengagement at the two friction points, bringing a fresh thaw in Sino-Indian ties. Patrolling has begun at Demchok, an Army source said. Sources had earlier said that the areas and patrolling status were expected to be moved back to pre-April 2020 level. The verification process after disengagement was in progress and patrolling modalities were to be decided between ground commanders, the sources had said on Wednesday. \u201cTalks will continue at the local commander level,\u201d they had added. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on October 21 said in Delhi that an agreement was finalised between India and China following negotiations over the past several weeks and that it would lead to a resolution of the issues that arose in 2020. The agreement was firmed up on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff. The move marks a significant development in the pursuit of reduced tension along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades. The ties between the two Asian giants had nosedived following the clash.",

        "title": "Odisha government imposes seven-month fishing ban to protect Olive Ridley turtles in Gahirmatha",
        "text": "Bhubaneswar: In a move to protect the endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles, Odisha\u2019s government has implemented a seven-month fishing ban in the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary, spanning 1,437 square kilometers within the Bhitarkanika National Park.The restriction, effective from November 1, 2024, to May 31, 2025, aims to ensure safe conditions for the annual mass nesting of these rare sea turtles, which are known for their synchronized nesting, called \u201carribada,\u201d where thousands gather on the beach to lay eggs.The ban affects not only Gahirmatha but also extends to critical nesting and breeding areas at the mouths of the Rushikulya, Dhamra, and Devi rivers. Fishing activities, particularly the movement of mechanized trawlers and large boats, are prohibited up to 20 kilometers from the coastline stretching from the Dhamra river mouth to the Devi river. This designated buffer zone is intended to reduce disturbances during the Olive Ridleys\u2019 mating and nesting season, providing an optimal and secure environment for them to reproduce.\u201cWe have imposed a strict seven-month ban on fishing and trawling in Gahirmatha, especially as the turtles are expected to arrive this month to begin mating,\u201d said local Rajnagar Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Sudarshan Gopinath.\"Protecting these endangered turtles requires intensive measures. While we enforce year-long conservation efforts, this seven-month ban is particularly stringent to safeguard the breeding process.\"Odisha's coastline is one of the largest nesting grounds globally for Olive Ridley turtles, attracting conservationists and marine biologists who monitor the turtles\u2019 migratory and nesting patterns.The turtles, which weigh up to 50 kilograms, travel thousands of kilometers to Odisha\u2019s warm coastal waters for their annual breeding. Following their November arrival, the nesting period is expected to peak around March, with each female laying approximately 100 to 120 eggs.Conservation efforts include the establishment of onshore and offshore protection camps by the Odisha Forest Department, which is coordinating with marine police to enforce the ban. This year, several patrol camps have been set up in and around the Bhitarkanika National Park, with an emphasis on preventing illegal fishing activities. These camps are equipped with rapid-response teams to monitor the waters, prevent intrusions, and ensure the survival of both nesting females and hatchlings, which face threats from poaching and accidental capture in fishing nets.The state government has also initiated community engagement programs to educate local fishing communities about the ban\u2019s importance, encouraging cooperation to protect the turtles while considering their livelihood needs. Many fishers receive alternative employment and support during the restricted period through government welfare programs.While Olive Ridley turtles are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), their numbers have shown positive growth due to such stringent protective measures. The efforts of the Odisha government, in collaboration with conservation organizations, have been instrumental in preserving this vital part of the marine ecosystem.The annual mass nesting of Olive Ridleys at Gahirmatha and nearby areas is not only a spectacular natural phenomenon but also an essential process for the species' survival, contributing significantly to global biodiversity.With the seven-month ban in place, Odisha reaffirms its commitment to safeguarding the Olive Ridley turtles and maintaining the ecological balance of its unique coastal habitats, say experts.",

        "title": "'Reply laced with attacks': Cong slams EC's 'condescending tone', warns of legal action",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday slammed the Election Commission for its \"generic\" response to the party's complaint over alleged irregularities in the recently concluded Haryana assembly elections, particularly criticising the poll panel's \"tone and tenor, and the language used\".\u2014 Jairam_Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) \"The Election Commission's reply is nothing more than generic set of bullet points on how machines work rather than specific clarification on our Haryana complaints ... While our complaints in Haryana were specific, the EC's response is generic and focused on diminishing complaints and petitioners,\" the party said in a letter addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar. The Congress also took a jab at the EC for giving a \"clean chit to itself\" and slammed the poll panel for its \"condescending\" reply.\"If the EC's goal is to strip itself of last vestiges of neutrality, then it's doing remarkable job at creating that impression,\" the Congress added.What Congress said\"First, the ECI prefaces its reply by stating the 'exceptional' nature of its indulgence in engaging with us on the issues raised. We do not know who is advising or guiding the Hon'ble Commission, but it seems that the Commission has forgotten that it is a body set up under the Constitution and charged with the discharge of certain crucial functions- both administrative and quasi- judicial. If the Commission grants a recognised National Party a hearing or examines issues raised by them in good faith it is not an 'exception' or 'indulgence'. It is the performance of a duty which it is required to do.\"\"If the Commission is refusing to grant us a hearing or refusing to engage on certain complaints (which it has done in the past) then the law allows recourse to the Higher Courts' extraordinary jurisdiction to compel the ECI to discharge this function (as happened in 2019). Se let us disabuse the ECI of this notion that it has in any way, shape or form indulged us.\"\"Second, the recent tone of the Commission's communications to the INC is a matter that we refuse to take lightly anymore. Every reply from the ECI now seems to be laced with ad-hominem attacks on either individual leaders or the party itself. The INC's communications confine themselves to issues and are written with a regard for the high office of the CEC and his brother Commissioners. This can be verified from the INC's representations which are in the public domain. However, the ECI's reply are written in a tone that is condescending. If the current ECI's goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression. Judges who write decisions do not attack or demonise the party raising the issues. However, if the ECI persists then we shall have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks (a remedy with which the ECI is familiar since it unsuccessfully sought to do the same with a High Court's unflattering but accurate observations after Covid).\"\"Third, the 'pattern' sought to be identified by the ECI in Para 8 of its reply is disingenuous, the vast majority of issues raised relate to that short period from the announcement of the Model Code of Conduct to the conclusion of the Elections i.e. the date of counting. The causes of action arise quickly, in literal minutes, and sometimes only become apparent after the results are declared and sometimes after the information from other booths can be compared. If they are not redressed on the ground then they become redundant. And then the only remedy available is an Election Petition which is a lengthy process taking years to resolve. Thus, we approach the ECI with whatever information we have, and the ECI with the vast resources at its command, examines and reviews this information to see if the same is correct. Many times, the ECI has found our information to be correct. Other times, not so. But we do not name and shame the ECI for those moments after the Election is over.\"\"Fourth, if we were bad faith actors, then we would never engage with the ECI to begin with. We would not painstakingly document our grievances and present them with legal precedent and arguments. Instead, we would focus on naming and shaming the Commission with examples from the ECI's own recent history which do not shroud it with glory. We would highlight that of over a hundred complaints against the PM and HM, the ECI has taken action in precisely zero complaints, while calling our party president and former party president to account for their actions/speeches. We would point out how the ECI never published a dissent note, actively suppressing it instead, by a former Commissioner in this regard. We would point out that the ECI has almost always fought any move for transparency and increase in VVPAT verification numbers, with the same having to be ordered by the Supreme Court. We challenge the ECI to fact check the above since it finds the INC's misgivings to be based on phantoms. We have many such examples, far more than the same 2-3 examples the ECI seems adamant on repeating.\"\"Finally, as stated at the outset we are not surprised that the ECI has examined our complaints and given itself a clean chit. The answer given to the question of the machines' fluctuating batteries seeks to confuse rather than clarify. At any rate, the ECI reply is nothing more than a standard and generic set of bullets on how the machines function rather than a specific clarification on specific complaints. In short, while our complaints were specific the ECI response is generic and focused on diminishing the complaints and the petitioners.\"The sharp criticism came days after the EC categorically dismissed the party's claims of irregularities in the Haryana Assembly elections as \"baseless\" and \"frivolous\". The poll panel had emphasised that it found no evidence to support Congress's allegations, particularly those concerning the display of a 99% battery status on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during vote counting. The ECI further said that such unfounded accusations could incite public unrest and disrupt social order, urging political parties to refrain from making sensational complaints during critical electoral phases. In a letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the ECI criticised the party for raising doubts about electoral integrity without substantial evidence, stating that this behavior undermines the credibility of the electoral processIn response to the EC's dismissal of Congress's allegations, BJP leaders had reiterated their confidence in the electoral process and characterised Congress's claims as a \"habitual pattern of questioning electoral integrity whenever they face defeat\". BJP leader Sanjay Seth stated, \"It is Congress' character that when they lose, they doubt EVMs and the ECI\".The BJP also emphasised its successful performance in the elections, securing 48 out of 90 seats, and described it as a clear mandate from the people of Haryana. The party said the EC's rebuttal was validation of their electoral victory and a rejection of what they termed \"frivolous complaints\" from Congress.(With inputs from agencies)",
        "summary": "The Congress criticized the Election Commission for its generic and condescending response to complaints about irregularities in Haryana elections. The EC's dismissal of allegations as baseless and its defence of EVM battery statuses were highlighted, alongside Congress\u2019s claims of biased treatment compared to actions against BJP leaders. \"If the EC's goal is to strip itself of last vestiges of neutrality, then it's doing remarkable job at creating that impression,\" the Congress said.",

        "title": "Kerala bypolls: With no sympathy factor, pure politics drives byelections in Palakkad and Chelakkara Assembly seats",
        "text": "The performance of mainstream political parties in Assembly byelections in Kerala seems to have been inconsistent and influenced by multiple factors, including sympathy waves.\n\nHowever, the upcoming bypolls in Palakkad and Chelakkara is set to be purely political and may possibly shape the template for the 2026 Assembly elections in the State. These seats were vacated by Shafi Parambil of the Congress and K. Radhakrishnan of the CPI(M) after they won the Vadakara and Alathur Lok Sabha seats, respectively.\n\nGiven the chaotic political landscape, political parties will also need to evaluate their performance in the three-tier local body polls in 2025 before formulating their strategies. In 2021, since the Left Democratic Front (LDF) came to power consecutively, the State witnessed two bypolls \u2013 at Thrikkakara and Puthuppally \u2013 following the deaths of Congress leaders P.T. Thomas and Oommen Chandy.\n\nIn both instances, emotionally charged byelections resulted in victories for their family members \u2013 Uma Thomas, wife of P.T. Thomas, clinched Thrikkakara in June 2022, while Chandy Oommen, son of the former Chief Minister, secured Puthuppally in September 2023.\n\nThis pattern of sympathy-driven electoral victories was evident during the United Democratic Front\u2019s (UDF) tenure as well. The 2015 Aruvikkara bypoll saw Congress candidate K.S. Sabarinadhan emerge victorious following the vacancy created by the death of his father and former Speaker G. Karthikeyan. While Mr. Sabarinadhan successfully retained the seat in 2016, he faced defeat in the 2021 Assembly elections.\n\nSimilarly, in Piravom, Anoop Jacob of Kerala Congress (J) won the byelection in 2012, following the death of his father T.M. Jacob. Mr. Jacob went on to retain the constituency in both the 2016 and 2021 Assembly elections.\n\nBypolls were held to six Assembly segments \u2013 Pala, Manjeswaram, Ernakulam, Aroor, Konni and Vattiyurkavu \u2013 in 2019 when the LDF was in power. The Pala seat became vacant after the death of Kerala Congress (M) leader K.M. Mani. This seat was won by Mani. C. Kappan, who was then with the National Congress Party, however, after trouncing Jose Tom Pulikkunnel, the KC(M)\u2018s nominee. \n\nThe Indian Union Muslim League\u2019s M.C. Kamaruddin won the Manjeswaram seat after the bypoll was necessitated following the death of P.B. Abdurazak. \n\nThe bypolls in Ernakulam, Konni, Vattiyurkavu, and Aroor were necessitated after representatives \u2013 Hibi Eden, Adoor Prakash , K. Muraleedharan of the Congress and A.M. Ariff of the CPI (M) \u2013 were elected to Lok Sabha from Ernakulam, Attingal, Vadakara and Alappuzha respectively. The Congress\u2019 local leader T.J. Vinod retained the Ernakulam seat.\n\nInterestingly, CPI(M) nominees K. U. Jenish Kumar and V. K. Prasanth, captured the Konni and Vattiyurkavu seats respectively. Likewise, Shanimol Usman secured the Aroor Assembly seat, compensating for her earlier defeat in the Alappuzha Lok Sabha elections. While Mr. Kumar and Mr. Prasanth successfully defended their seats in the 2021 Assembly polls, Ms. Usman was unable to retain her seat.\n\nThe Congress party is now experimenting a similar strategy by nominating Ramya Haridas, who previously lost her Alathur Lok Sabha seat, as its candidate for the Chelakkara Assembly bypoll. Whether these electoral dynamics will prove successful in the segment remains to be seen.",

Srikanth laid a wreath at Vijay Smarak in Fort William to pay tribute to bravehearts, who made the supreme sacrifice in the service to the nation, in the morning. Several events were organised during the day, including interactions between officers and troops.\n\nAccording to an official, the Eastern Command was raised in Lucknow on November 1, 1920. It then had territorial jurisdiction over Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and Assam. Thereafter, the Command headquarters moved to Barrackpore, Ranchi and back to Lucknow. After the India-China War of 1962, the Command settled down permanently at Fort William in Kolkata.\n\n\u201cEastern Command continues to remain the Army\u2019s largest operational command with its jurisdiction covering eight states. It monitors 8,350 km of land borders with five neighbouring countries. The Eastern Command has actively participated in all wars fought by India but the crowning glory was the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War that led to the Liberation of Bangladesh. The \u2018Warriors of the East\u2019 have also conducted successful counter-insurgency operations in the northeastern states whenever required,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe command is also entrusted with managing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the states of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. The official said that personnel from the command cover terrain ranging from high-altitude peaks in the Himalayas with sub-zero temperatures to steaming rain forests with fast-flowing rivers.\n\n\u201cThe Command has also brought significant changes in the lives of citizens, particularly in the northeastern states, through initiatives like Operation Sadbhavana and Operation Samaritan. Officers and troops not only provide relief during disasters and help to restore law and order, they also interact with the local population on a regular basis through medical camps. Training is also provided to local youth to join the armed forces or take up professional courses like engineering and medicine,\u201d the official added.",

The party had promised to transfer \u20b96,000 annually to 11 crore farmers, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been fulfilling it with a click of button.\n\nWhether it is giving free grains to 80 crore people or welfare measures for women in different States, the BJP has been fulfilling them, Prasad added.\n\nIt has led to a reduction in poverty, he said.\n\n\"I greet Kharge sahab for realising this wisdom at this age. This should have dawned on him earlier. Please give the first lesson of your confession to Rahul Gandhi,\" the BJP leader said.\n\nMr. Kharge should apologise to the country and so should Gandhi, he said. The senior BJP leader also took a swipe at AAP leader and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as well, saying he also makes all kinds of announcements.",

        "text": "Responding strongly to the Election Commission's reply to its complaints about \"irregularities\" in the Haryana Assembly elections, the Congress has accused the poll body of attacking the party and its leaders and threatened to take legal action for expunging such remarks if it continues to do so. \n\nIn a strongly worded letter on Friday, the Congress said its communications to the Election Commission of India (ECI) are restricted to the issues and respect the office of the Chief Election Commissioner and the election commissioners but the poll body's replies are written in a condescending tone. \"If the current ECI's goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression,\" the Congress wrote.\n\nReplying to the Congress' complaint on Tuesday, the Election Commission had criticised the party for making \"baseless allegations when faced with inconvenient electoral outcomes\" and cautioned it against making \"unfounded and sensational complaints\". The poll body had also termed the allegations \"irresponsible\" and asked the party to take steps to curb a \"tendency of frivolous complaints\" while insisting that the electoral process in Haryana was flawless. \n\nThe Congress, in its response, said it was not surprised that the Election Commission had given a clean chit to itself but said the \"tone and tenor of the ECI's response, the language used, and the allegations\" made against the party compelled it to reply. \n\nThe party said the Election Commission had raised the \"exceptional\" nature of engaging with it on the issues raised and said it seemed the poll body had forgotten that it was its duty to do so. \n\n'Laced With Attacks'\n\n\"Second, the recent tone of the Commission's communications to the INC is a matter that we refuse to take lightly anymore. Every reply from the ECI now seems to be laced with ad-hominem attacks on either individual leaders or the party itself. The INC's communications confine themselves to issues and are written with a regard for the high office of the CEC and his brother Commissioners,\" the letter, signed by nine senior leaders including KC Venugopal, Ashok Gehlot and Ajay Maken, stated. \n\n\"However, the ECI's reply are written in a tone that is condescending. If the current ECI's goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression. Judges who write decisions do not attack or demonise the party raising the issues. However, if the ECI persists then we shall have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks (a remedy with which the ECI is familiar since it unsuccessfully sought to do the same with a High Court's unflattering but accurate observations after Covid),\" it added.\n\nThe last comment was a reference to the Madras High Court castigating the Election Commission in 2021 and observing that the poll body allowing political parties to take out rallies and organise meetings had led to a surge in Covid cases. \n\nThe Congress claimed that the Election Commission has almost always fought any move for transparency and that while its complaints on the Haryana poll process were specific, the poll body's comments were \"generic and focused on diminishing the complaints and the petitioners\".\n\n'Totally Unexpected'\n\nWhen the counting for the Haryana elections was held on October 8, the BJP surged ahead after early leads for the Congress and ended up winning a record third straight term with 48 of the state's 90 seats while the Congress got 37. The Congress had complained of an \"unexplained slowdown\" in updating results, which the Election Commission had dismissed.\n\nLater that day, the Congress said it could not accept the verdict of the elections saying they were \"totally unexpected, completely surprising and counter-intuitive\".\n\n\"What we have seen today in Haryana is a victory for manipulation, a victory for subverting the will of the people and it is a defeat for transparent, democratic processes. The chapter on Haryana is not complete,\" senior leader Jairam Ramesh, who is also one of the signatories of Friday's letter, had said.",

        "text": "As companies seek to capitalize on the diverse perspectives of Gen Z, attracting and retaining members of this demographic is increasingly important. At TechCrunch's recent Disrupt conference, industry leaders shared valuable insights on understanding Gen Z values and building an engaging workplace culture.\n\nPanelists noted that Gen Z workers exhibit less loyalty than previous generations, averaging just over a year at each job. However, this also challenges employers to continuously improve the employee experience. Transparency was highlighted as a core Gen Z priority \u2013 they openly discuss salaries and work experiences. Companies can build trust by being transparent in their own communications.\n\nWhile some argue younger workers lack commitment, the panel pointed out Gen Z has entered the workforce during tumultuous times. The pandemic, economic uncertainty and tech layoffs have shaped their expectations. Rather than criticism, employers would be wise to understand this context and how it influences Gen Z priorities.\n\nDiversity and inclusion also aid retention. Gen Z consumers are a highly diverse demographic, so companies should ensure their workforce reflects this. A variety of ages, backgrounds and perspectives yields innovative solutions attuned to the needs of all. As one participant noted, discriminating against any group hurts businesses and contravenes equality laws.\n\nWith open communication, a supportive culture and diverse teams, firms can leverage Gen Z talent. While change can be challenging, embracing different viewpoints will future-proof companies and foster engaged, productive workforces for years to come. Understanding today's youngest workers is key to their success, and society's progress.",

        "text": "Kanpur: A prominent businessman, his wife and their domestic help died allegedly of suffocation inside their house here following a fire that broke out from a 'diya' early Friday, police said. The couple had installed an electronic lock on their bedroom door but as the blaze erupted, they failed to enter the correct unlocking code in panic and remained trapped, a senior officer said. Sanjay Shyam Dasani (49), his wife Kanika (45) and their domestic help Chhavi Chauhan (24), a resident of the city's Pandu Nagar area, died in the fire. Dasani, a prominent local businessman, owned a biscuit company Ambaji Foods and was involved in other business ventures. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Kanpur) Dinesh Tripathi said the fire began around 3 am, after the family performed late night prayers, leaving the lamp burning in the temple, made of wood. \u201cDasani, his wife and their maid had all retired to their bedrooms on the first floor of their three-storey house and were asleep when the fire spread rapidly through the house,\u201d the officer said. \u201cWhen local officials, including fire brigade, were alerted, they reached the spot and the trio was rushed to the Regency Hospital where they were declared dead by doctors\u201d he said. DCP Tripathi said the couple apparently tried opening their bedroom door but were unable to do so due to an electronic lock. In the midst of the emergency, they might have struggled to enter the correct code on the lock panel, he said. Around 4 am, their son Harsh Dasani returned home after Diwali celebrations with friends and discovered the house filled with thick smoke and flames, according to the police. He immediately alerted neighbours, who then contacted the police and fire department. The DCP said the bodies were sent to the mortuary for autopsy, which is expected to be performed on Friday evening. Further legal proceedings are ongoing as the police are probing the circumstances surrounding the fire, he added.",

        "title": "He Has Aged 7 Years In Last 5 Years: BJP Mocks JMM Chief Hemant Soren",
        "text": "In the lead-up to the Jharkhand Assembly elections, a stir has been caused by the nomination papers submitted by Chief Minister Hemant Soren. Representing the Barhait constituency once more, Sorens latest affidavit has raised eyebrows with its claim that his age has leapt from 42 to 49 in just five years, a revelation that has sparked a significant amount of debate and scrutiny.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has taken a firm stance against this discrepancy, demanding that Sorens nomination be invalidated. The partys spokesperson in Jharkhand, Pratul Shahdeo, has publicly questioned the possibility of such an unusual increase in age over a relatively short period.Beyond the age issue, the BJP has also highlighted a reported decline in Sorens declared income mdash;from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 4 lakh mdash;and accused him of failing to disclose several assets. These allegations have led to formal complaints being lodged with election authorities, signaling the BJPs intent to escalate the matter to the Election Commission for further investigationDefence Amidst AllegationsThe Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Sorens party, has countered these accusations, portraying them as an act of desperation by the BJP. JMM leader Manoj Pandey has assured that all documents submitted for Sorens candidacy were thoroughly verified and has branded the BJPs claims as unfounded. He interprets the BJPs focus on the affidavit as evidence of their fear of losing the upcoming election. Similarly, Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal has dismissed the controversy as a mere diversionary tactic by the BJP, expressing confidence in the electoral victory and the formation of their government again.BJPs Broader CriticismsFurther intensifying the political drama, Assam Chief Minister and BJP co-incharge for the Jharkhand Assembly elections, Himanta Biswa Sarma, launched a broader attack on the JMM, labeling its entire system as fraudulent. He criticized the partys governance and warned against the dangers of their re-election, mentioning specific grievances including inaction against controversial statements made by individuals like Irfan Ansari.The unfolding electoral drama in Jharkhand is set against the backdrop of a two-phased election scheduled for November 13 and November 20, with the final count on November 23. The electorate has expanded since the last assembly elections in 2019, now boasting around 2.60 crore electors, which includes over 11.84 lakh first-time voters as well as more than 1.13 lakh individuals classified as persons with disabilities, third-gender individuals, and senior citizens above 85 years of age. The BJP, having lost to the JMM-led alliance in the previous election, is keen to regain its foothold in this tribal-dominated state.In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Hemant Sorens age and the allegations of undeclared assets have added a layer of intrigue to the Jharkhand Assembly elections. While the BJP seeks to challenge Sorens candidacy on these grounds, both the JMM and Congress have dismissed these claims as baseless, viewing them as political strategies aimed at undermining their prospects. As the election process progresses, the debates and disputes between these parties underscore the intense political rivalry and the high stakes involved in the battle for Jharkhands leadership.",

You came to power by promising these guarantees to the voters. Your statements (about the Shakti scheme) could turn Congress into a party that betrays the people. People will not remain silent if they feel cheated. They will fight back,\u201d he asserted.This response follows advice from Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge to party units preparing for elections, urging them to announce guarantees aligned with their budgets.Kharge advised careful consideration, warning that a poorly planned approach could lead to financial strain and negatively impact future generations.During a press conference, he highlighted the importance of fiscal responsibility, cautioning that failure to fulfil commitments could result in reputational harm and challenges for the community.Kharge said, \u201cIn Maharashtra, I advised that they shouldn\u2019t announce 5, 10, or 20 guarantees. Guarantees should be based on budget. Otherwise, there\u2019ll be bankruptcy. If there\u2019s no money for roads, people will turn against you. If this government fails, future generations will inherit only a bad reputation. They\u2019ll face a decade in exile.\u201dKharge\u2019s comments came after indications that the Karnataka Congress government might review the Shakti scheme, which provides free bus transport for women.However, on Thursday, Karnataka Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy clarified that there would be no review or suspension of the scheme.Earlier today, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar revised his statement, saying, \u201cKarnataka\u2019s guarantee model is an example for the entire country. The BJP and other parties are also adopting it, and we\u2019re proud to have implemented and delivered it. The people of Karnataka and the country are very pleased with our model,\u201d Shivakumar told reporters",

        "title": "If goal is to strip itself of neutrality, it is doing remarkable job: Congress slams Election Commission",
        "text": "The Congress on Friday (November 1, 2024) hit out at the Election Commission (EC) after it rejected allegations over irregularities in the Haryana assembly polls, saying if the poll panel's goal is to \"strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality\", then it is doing a \"remarkable job\" at creating that impression.\n\nThe Opposition party claimed that the EC's reply was written in a tone that is condescending and warned that if the poll panel persists with such language then it would have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks.\n\nAlso Read: Congratulations to the Election Commission for being included in the agenda: Manoj Jha\n\nThe Congress's response came days after the EC rejected allegations levelled by it over irregularities in the just-held assembly polls, saying the party was raising \"the smoke of a generic doubt\" about the credibility of an entire electoral outcome like it did in the past.\n\nIn its letter to the EC signed by nine senior Congress leaders, including general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh, the party said, \"We have carefully studied your response to our complaints. Not surprisingly, the ECI has given a clean chit to itself. We would normally have let it be at that. However, the tone and tenor of the ECI's response, the language used, and the allegations made against the INC compel us to submit the counter-response.\" \n\n\"We do not know who is advising or guiding the Hon'ble Commission, but it seems that the Commission has forgotten that it is a body set up under the Constitution and charged with the discharge of certain crucial functions - both administrative and quasijudicial,\" the response by the Congress leaders said.\n\nPosting the reply on X, Congress general secretary Mr. Ramesh said, \"ECI gave a non-reply to Congress' specific complaints in 20 Vidhan Sabha constituencies in Haryana.\" \n\nThe Congress letter said that if the Commission grants a recognised national party a hearing or examines issues raised by them in good faith it is not an 'exception' or 'indulgence' but it is the performance of a duty which it is required to do.\n\n\"If the Commission is refusing to grant us a hearing or refusing to engage on certain complaints (which it has done in the past) then the law allows recourse to the higher courts' extraordinary jurisdiction to compel the ECI to discharge this function (as happened in 2019),\" the letter said.\n\nThe Congress leaders, who had petitioned the EC alleging irregularities in the polls, said every reply from the EC now seems to be laced with ad-hominem attacks on either individual leaders or the party itself.\n\nThe leaders said the Congress' communications confine themselves to issues and are written with a regard for the high office of the CEC and his brother Commissioners. \n\n\"However, the ECI's reply are written in a tone that is condescending. If the current ECI's goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression,\" the party said in its letter to the EC.\n\n\"Judges who write decisions do not attack or demonise the party raising the issues. However, if the ECI persists then we shall have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks (a remedy with which the ECI is familiar since it unsuccessfully sought to do the same with a high court's unflattering but accurate observations after Covid),\" said the letter signed by Ramesh, K.C. Venugopal, Ashok Gehlot, Bhupinder Hooda, Ajay Maken, Abhishek Singhvi, Uday Bhan, Partap Bajwa and Pawan Khera.\n\nIn a strongly-worded letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the poll panel had said such \"frivolous and unfounded\" doubts have the potential of creating \"turbulence\" when crucial steps like polling and counting are in live play, a time when both public and political parties' anxiousness is peaking.\n\nThe BJP retained power in Haryana winning 48 of the 90 seats in the October 5 Assembly elections with the Congress bagging 37 seats, INLD two and Independents three seats.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: The State government is reportedly mulling increasing liquor prices to overcome its revenue deficit. The government was expected to increase liquor prices by 10 percent to 15 percent with 20 percent being the outer limit on all varieties of liquor, ordinary, medium and premium.\r\n\r\nSources say the government\u2019s Budget Estimates for 2024-25 predicted Rs. 25,617.53 crore in revenue from excise, however, the actual collections have fallen short by Rs 2,000 crore, hence this shortfall has created a pressing need for revenue-raising measures. During the previous fiscal year, while the State government estimated a revenue income of Rs 17,482.19 crore, it actually collected Rs 18,470.45 crore.\r\n\r\nHowever, this time with a revenue defict of Rs. 2,000 crore, the government is not expecting to reach the target without increasing the prices of liquor. Hence, a price increase was being seen as one of the most immediate solutions to reach the target, sources added.\r\n\r\nThe rate fixation committee was expected to make its recommendations soon following which a final decision on the price hike would be made, sources said, adding that the government was planning to increase the prices of beer by Rs. 20 and quarter bottle liquor by at least Rs. 20 to Rs.70. The prices of full bottle liquor was likely to increase by Rs. 70 to 300.\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, this would be the third price hike and the first by the Congress government since it was voted to power in December last. Last year, before assembly polls, the then BRS government had reduced the prices of liquor marginally.\r\n\r\nIt is learnt that all the breweries operating in the State have submitted a proposal before the Excise Committee to raise the prices by at least 20-25 percent, saying that their operating expenses have increased hugely and the prices have not been increased since 2021.\r\n\r\nThere are 2,620 A4 liquor shops, 1,200 bars and clubs in the State. Last year, the government earned a revenue of about Rs. 35,000 crore through the sale of liquor and it wants to increase it to Rs. 45,000 in the current financial year.",

        "title": "KTR terms Congress rule in Telangana a disaster",
        "text": "Hyderabad: In a scathing attack, BRS working president KT Rama Rao found the Congress rule in Telangana to be a disaster that poses a huge challenge for the BRS when it comes to power, to overcome the downfall and bring back the State to a decent position. He remarked that nothing much can be expected from the party that won on false guarantees and propaganda.\r\n\r\n\"They deceived people and now trying to get away with false narratives and propaganda. All they can do is distract and blame,\" he said, emphasising the need for stringent electoral reforms to prevent political parties from misleading voters in the future.\r\n\r\nParticipating in the #AskKTR question and answer session on social media platform X on Thursday, Rama Rao raised alarm over the economic decline under Congress\u2019s rule. He pointed to dwindling State revenues, a struggling agriculture sector, rising unemployment, and companies moving out of Telangana. \"Not sure about their plans to undo the damage they have done in very short time,\" he said.\r\n\r\nOn environmental initiatives like the Musi River rejuvenation project and lake encroachment clearance, the former Minister argued that while the projects appear promising on paper, the real agenda is concealed. He reiterated that the BRS is not against the Musi rejuvenation, but against siphoning off public funds. \"It is the country\u2019s largest Scam in the making,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe also criticised the controversial HYDRA, calling it a tool for \u201cblackmail and extortion\u201d targeting builders and businessmen. \"HYDRA is selective, harassing the poor and middle-class citizens, while the rich and mighty go untouched,\" he noted.\r\n\r\nThe BRS working president shifted his focus on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's hypocrisy in encouraging defections in Telangana, while opposing them elsewhere. \"Don't be a hypocrite, Rahul Gandhi. Don\u2019t preach what you can\u2019t practice,\" he said, asserting that Telangana has no local governance and is controlled from Delhi. \"For Delhi, By Delhi, To Delhi - That\u2019s Congress mark democracy,\" he added.\r\n\r\nHe did not hesitate to speak about the secret collusion of the Congress and the BJP in Telangana, especially coordinated efforts between Chief Minister Revanth Reddy and union Minister of State for Home Bandi Sanjay. \"BJP and Congress are shamelessly working in tandem in Telangana,\" he stated, pointing to various incidents that indicate their collusion.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the BJP\u2019s \u201cOne Nation, One Election\u201d proposal, he questioned its feasibility, suggesting it might be just another empty promise as no legislation has yet been introduced. He expressed doubts about its practicality and genuine intent from the Centre.\r\n\r\nWhen a netizen inquired about constitutional avenues to change the Congress government before its term ended, Rama Rao suggested for respecting the democratic process. Regarding Chief Minister Revanth Reddy\u2019s tenure, he observed that politics is a dynamic field and the Congress\u2019s track record is unpredictable.\r\n\r\nHe was also critical of the Congress-led government for imposing Section 144 in Hyderabad for a full month, finding it an extreme measure for a major metropolitan city. On recent incidents of communal violence, he noted that the BRS prioritised law and order during its term, whereas under the Congress, the police are preoccupied with political vendettas and trivial matters. He emphasised the need for a dedicated Home Minister and giving a free hand to efficient police officers to ensure public safety.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned about the possibility for Andhra Pradesh's capital, Amaravati, to surpass Hyderabad as an IT hub, the former Minister was skeptic, citing Hyderabad's unique standing. \"Chandrababu Naidu is an ambitious leader, but Hyderabad is in an orbit of its own. We once surpassed Bengaluru's IT growth rate, but with Congress in charge, future here is uncertain,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nOn relations with TDP and YSRCP in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, he said they have good personal equation with top leadership of both the parties. \"We might differ on issues, but broadly speaking, we have nothing personal against anyone per se,\" he added.",

        "text": "The Election Commission of India (ECI) has dismissed allegations by the Congress party regarding irregularities in the recent Haryana elections. In response, the Congress submitted a \u201ccounter response\u201d to the ECI on Friday, describing its initial reply as \u201cgeneric\u201d and focused on dismissing the complaints and their petitioners.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh shared the letter on X, stating, \u201cThe ECI gave a non-reply to INC India\u2019s specific complaints in 20 Vidhan Sabha constituencies in Haryana.\u201dThe party further remarked, \u201cNot surprisingly, the ECI has given a clean chit to itself. Ordinarily, we would have left it there. However, the tone and tenor of the ECI\u2019s response, the language used, and the accusations levelled against the INC compel us to submit this counter-response.\u201dThe Congress also criticised the \u201cpattern\u201d outlined by the ECI in Paragraph 8 of its reply, calling it \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\u201cThe majority of issues raised concern the period between the announcement of the Model Code of Conduct and the end of the election, i.e., the date of counting. Grievances arise quickly, often within minutes, and sometimes only become apparent once results are declared or information from other booths can be compared. If not addressed on the ground, these issues become moot, leaving only the option of an Election Petition, which is a lengthy process that can take years to resolve,\u201d it stated.The party added, \u201cWe approach the ECI with whatever information we possess, and the ECI, with its vast resources, examines and reviews this information to assess its accuracy. Often, the ECI finds our information correct; at other times, it does not. Yet we refrain from \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 the ECI after the election concludes.\u201dThe Congress also claimed that, despite filing over a hundred complaints against the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, the ECI has taken action on none, while holding Congress\u2019s president and former president to account for their actions or speeches.\u201cAs mentioned, it is unsurprising that the ECI has reviewed our complaints and exonerated itself. The response on the fluctuating battery levels of the voting machines is more obfuscating than clarifying. In essence, the ECI\u2019s reply is a standard, generic explanation of machine functionality, rather than a specific response to the particular complaints we raised. While our complaints were specific, the ECI\u2019s response is generic and focused on dismissing the complaints and the petitioners,\u201d the Congress said.On October 29, the ECI had categorically rejected the Congress\u2019s allegations, describing them as \u201cbaseless, misplaced, and devoid of facts.\u201dReacting to the developments, Congress leader Pawan Khera commented, \u201cIf the Prime Minister considers himself God, his CEC will, naturally, see himself as God\u2019s gift to mankind.\u201d (ANI)",

All of us need to offer our respects to our motherland by hoisting the flag of the land high,\u201d he stated, urging citizens to honour their cultural heritage.Shivakumar also paid homage to Karnataka\u2019s natural beauty, calling it \u201cheaven\u201d, and highlighted its sacred rivers like Tunga, Bhadra, Cauvery, and Krishna. \u201cIt is 50 years since we named our state Karnataka,\u201d he said, noting that Kannada pride extends beyond the state borders and listed Kannadigas\u2019 contribution world over.Reflecting on Kannada\u2019s historical depth, Shivakumar described the language as more than 2,000 years old, and he encouraged all to protect and celebrate it.

Following recent talks, there has been a broad consensus to restore the ground situation. This consensus has developed on the basis of equal and mutual security. The agreement includes rights related to patrolling and grazing in traditional areas. Based on this consensus, the disengagement process is nearly complete. We will strive to move beyond just disengagement, but for that, we will need to wait a little longer.\u201dThis came after both India and China confirmed that an agreement had been reached between two nations regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas.The border standoff between India and China began in eastern Ladakh along the LAC in 2020, sparked by Chinese military actions. This incident led to prolonged tensions between the two nations, significantly straining their relations.Following this, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit. The meeting marked the first formal, structured interaction between the two leaders in five years.Xi Jinping and PM Modi stated that ties between the two nations are important for the people of India and China and for regional and global peace and stability. Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong earlier said that he hope the bilateral ties would move forward smoothly and ties between both countries would not be restricted or interrupted by specific disagreements.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also highlighted the contribution of first Home Minister Sardar Patel on his birth anniversary, saying, \u201cThere are so many names that didn\u2019t get a proper place in our history but that doesn\u2019t mean their sacrifices were small.

After facing harassment and torture, they were taken to a military base.In a post on X, the BYC stated, \u201cLast night, around 9:00 PM, nine prominent Baloch artists were forcibly taken by security forces from the Kech Cultural Museum. These artists were subjected to severe torture and harassment before being transferred to the military cantonment. They were detained there without any legal justification until the following day, then moved to police stations, where they were locked up for the entire day and later on released.\u201dAccording to the BYC, this grave injustice done to artists and musicians by the Pakistan armed forces represents the harsh truths of Baloch artists who instead of being appreciated for their cultural contribution and talents are being subjected to severe human rights abuses and harassment.The BYC added that they stand with the artists and demand the safety and \u201d well-being\u201d of \u201d invaluable cultural assets.\u201dThe committee has urged the Baloch people to raise their voices against human rights violations meted out against these artists as the armed forces are given \u201cunchecked\u201d rights to detain and harass any individual during raids. This shows that no individual is safe in Balochistan due to the increase in the cases of enforced disappearance.There have been more than a hundred cases of mass abduction in Balochistan by the Pakistan forces. This has created a situation of terror and anxiety in the minds of people. The Pakistan armed forces have used different violent measures to stop the protest but the BYC along with the Baloch people is fighting against the enforced disappearances.",

Viva #CubaLibre.\"Argentina has traditionally voted against the embargo on Cuba.Local media quoted foreign ministry sources as saying that while it was awkward diplomatically for Argentina to have opposed the US and Israel, the votes of Cuba and its allies would be needed in any future resolutions on Argentina's claim of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, a British territory.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Following recent talks, there has been a broad consensus to restore the ground situation. This consensus has developed on the basis of equal and mutual security. The agreement includes rights related to patrolling and grazing in traditional areas. Based on this consensus, the disengagement process is nearly complete. We will strive to move beyond just disengagement, but for that, we will need to wait a little longer.\u201dThis came after both India and China confirmed that an agreement had been reached between two nations regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas.The border standoff between India and China began in eastern Ladakh along the LAC in 2020, sparked by Chinese military actions. This incident led to prolonged tensions between the two nations, significantly straining their relations.Following this, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit. The meeting marked the first formal, structured interaction between the two leaders in five years.Xi Jinping and PM Modi stated that ties between the two nations are important for the people of India and China and for regional and global peace and stability.Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong earlier said that he hope the bilateral ties would move forward smoothly and ties between both countries would not be restricted or interrupted by specific disagreements.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also highlighted the contribution of first Home Minister Sardar Patel on his birth anniversary, saying, \u201cThere are so many names that didn't get a proper place in our history but that doesn't mean their sacrifices were small. It is our duty to remember their sacrifices and give them respect\u2026I pay respect to India's first Union Home Minister and the brain behind the unity of the country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.\u201dUnion Defence Minister Rajnath Singh participated in the inauguration ceremony of the Bob Khathing Museum, unveiling the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.Singh further noted that the kind of unity we get to see in India is amazing, urging everyone to maintain this speciality.\u201cWhenever India's name is taken in the world, they also say \u2018Unity in Diversity'\u2026there are many languages, cultures and religions present in this country.

Speaking about Thackeray, Raut said, \u201cHis son is contesting the elections, so you can understand his mental state. This leader did not even allow PM Modi and HM Amit Shah to come to Maharashtra, but now he has started praising them, so he has fear in his mind.

        "title": "The 22nd Amendment: Why No US President Can Serve More Than Two Terms",
        "text": "The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution limits the president to two elected terms in office. This amendment was part of a broader set of 273 recommendations made to Congress by the Hoover Commission, established by President Harry S. Truman to overhaul and improve the federal government. The formal proposal was presented to Congress on March 24, 1947, and the amendment received ratification on February 27, 1951.This amendment was initiated following President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented election to four terms, during which he served for 12 years until his death in 1945. In response, Congress proposed the 22nd Amendment to formalise presidential term limits.What The 22nd Amendment saysSection 1 of the 22nd Amendment: \u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.\u201dSection 2 of the 22nd Amendment: \u201cThis article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.\u201dWhat are The 22nd Amendment's main takeawaysA US president can only serve for a maximum of 10 years.No one is eligible to serve as president more than twice.A person is only eligible to be elected president once if they have held the office for more than two years (for instance, a vice president who becomes president).Nevertheless, the discussion surrounding term limits continued. According to a report in the New York Times, in 1987, then-President Ronald Reagan expressed a desire to initiate a movement aimed at repealing the constitutional amendment that restricts presidents to two terms. If successful, this could have enabled Reagan \u2014 then in his late 70s and a few years away from an official Alzheimer's diagnosis \u2014 to seek re-election.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\")",

The air in Anand Vihar, a major terminus, was especially polluted with AQI in the \"severe\" category.\n\n Thirty-eight monitoring stations showed that air was in a \"very poor\" category across the city.\n\n The 24-hour average air quality index on Wednesday (October 30, 2024) stood at 307.\n\n An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', 401 and 450 'severe' and above 450 'severe plus'.\n\n In 2023, Delhi residents enjoyed clearer skies and abundant sunshine, with an AQI of 202 in the morning, according to the data.\n\n Delhi recorded an AQI of 218 on Deepavali last year, 312 in 2022, 382 in 2021, 414 in 2020, 337 in 2019, 281 in 2018, 319 in 2017, and 431 in 2016, according to Central Pollution Control Board data.\n\n Last year, a decrease in stubble-burning incidents and rain before Deepavali, along with favourable meteorological conditions, prevented the national capital from turning into a gas chamber after the festival.\n\n Delhi earlier in the month announced a comprehensive ban on the manufacture, storage, sale, and use of firecrackers.\n\n On Wednesday (October 30, 2024), Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai announced that 377 teams had been formed to enforce the ban on firecrackers across the national capital.\n\n He said that authorities are in touch with the resident welfare associations, market associations, and social organisations to spread awareness.\n\n Police teams have been formed to ensure that firecrackers are not burst.\n\n \"Legal action will be taken against those found bursting crackers. They may also be booked under the relevant sections of the BNS (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita) for violating government orders,\" an officer said.\n\n Unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicular emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers and other local pollution sources, contribute to hazardous air quality levels in the Delhi-NCR during winters.\n\n According to a Delhi Pollution Control Committee analysis, the city experiences peak pollution from November 1 to 15, when the number of stubble-burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana increases.",

        "text": "Nairobi, Oct 31 (IANS) The International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN migration agency, appealed for $27.8 million to protect and support migrants, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and mobile populations, as well as the communities they interact with, from the outbreak of mpox.\n\nThe IOM on Wednesday said the appeal is in response to the escalating number of people affected by the mpox outbreak, spreading across parts of Africa, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\n\u201cIOM appeals to international donors, governments, and partners to support the mpox response to protect the health and well-being of migration-affected communities,\u201d it said in a statement released in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.\n\nThe IOM has been responding to mpox since the recent outbreak and spread of the disease in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe IOM said it had expanded the East, Horn and Southern Africa\u2019s plan into a multi-country mpox preparedness and response plan for Africa, covering the period from September 2024 to February 2025.\n\n\u201cThe plan aims to address the health needs of migrants and IDPs by providing health screenings, risk communication and community engagement within affected communities,\u201d the IOM said.\n\nThe plan also seeks to support cross-border coordination between governments and local communities and support countries to strengthen response at key borders and points of entry in high-risk areas across Africa.\n\nAccording to the IOM, the number of confirmed cases across Africa has risen sharply from over 2,800 in 12 countries to more than 9,300 in 34 countries as of October 20, 2024.\n\nThe latest appeal comes after an initial 18.5-million-dollar request for funding for countries affected in East, Horn and Southern Africa was issued in August.\n\nThe IOM said the virus, which spreads through close contact with infected persons, is disproportionately affecting IDPs, migrants, and highly mobile populations living in cross-border communities due to the absence of disease prevention, detection and control measures available to them.\n\nThe risk is further heightened by their overcrowded and poor living and working conditions, as the UN agency said that its response plan seeks to address pressing health vulnerabilities exacerbated by high mobility across the continent.\n\nDespite the work of the IOM, however, the funding gap remains significantly low, with only 1 million dollars secured from the 18.5-million-dollar appeal.\n\n\u201cWithout additional support, crucial activities at points of entry are likely to face disruptions,\u201d the IOM warned, adding that over 1,047,900 health screenings have been conducted in the DRC, Guinea, and Uganda for over four months.",

The consensus includes the rights of patrolling and grazing in traditional areas. Based on this consensus, the process of disengagement is almost complete. Our efforts will be to take the matter beyond disengagement but for that, we will have to wait a little longer,\u201d the Defence Minister said after virtually dedicating to the nation \u2018Desh ka Vallabh\u2019 statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and Major Ralengnao \u2018Bob\u2019 Khathing \u2018Museum of Valour\u2019 at Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nSingh carried out the inauguration from 4 Corps Headquarters in Assam\u2019s Tezpur.

This 2,000-km long highway will prove to be an important strategic and economic asset for the region as well as the entire nation,\u201d he added.\n\nSingh also commended the Armed Forces\u2019 engagement in the region, from NCC initiatives and local economic support to crucial disaster relief efforts.\n\n\u201cArmed Forces not only provide security but also become a medium for development in that region by cooperating with the people of the border areas.

Dhoni is expected to be retained by the franchise as an 'uncapped player' thanks to the new rule but the franchise are looking at a future plan. According to a report by Indian Express, India star Rishabh Pant has emerged as the top pick for CSK. The franchise is keen on buying Pant if he enters the auction pool and that is mainly the point that has governed their planning for the IPL 2025 retentions.\r\n\r\nwindow._rrCode = window._rrCode || [];_rrCode.push(function(){ (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\"); });The report claimed that CSK have decided to retain skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sri Lanka fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana and Dhoni. However, the decision on India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja will completely depend on Pant's situation at Delhi Capitals.In case Pant enters the auction pool, CSK believe that he will command a price around Rs 20 crore and that may result in the franchise not retaining Jadeja. However, the report also claimed that CSK are looking to use the Right To Match (RTM) option for Jadeja in that case.Gujarat Titans is likely to retain skipper Shubman Gill, star spinner Rashid Khan, young opener Sai Sudharsan and explosive hitters Rahul Tewatia and Shahrukh Khan ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction, reported ESPNCricinfo.These retentions will leave the 2022 champions with one right-to-match (RTM) card option at the upcoming mega auction.With the amount given to each player still unknown, GT will have around Rs 51 crores deducted from their overall purse of Rs 120 crores for retaining three international players and two uncapped players. If they pay more than Rs 51 crores for these retentions, a higher amount will be deducted from the purse.Thursday, October 31 is the deadline by which all the franchises are supposed to submit the list of their retained players ahead of the mega auction. Each team can retain six players, out of which a maximum of five can be capped and two uncapped. This can be either via retention or by using the Right to Match (RTM) option.(With ANI inputs)",

        "title": "7 Key States That May Decide Kamala Harris, Donald Trump's Fate",
        "text": "Around 240 million Americans are eligible to cast their votes in the November 5 US presidential elections. But a small number of crucial swing states are key to deciding the next US President.Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump are zeroing in on these battlegrounds, where the outcomes remain uncertain.What Are Swing States?Swing states, often referred to as battlegrounds, are instrumental in presidential elections. They are characterised by a nearly equal level of support for both major political parties, in this case, Democrats and Republicans, making them key to a candidate's electoral strategy.In 2024, the seven swing states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. These regions have shown fluctuating voter preferences in recent elections.ArizonaIn Arizona, where US President Joe Biden won narrowly by just 10,000 votes in 2020, immigration remains a hot-button issue. With a lengthy border with Mexico, the state's voters are concerned about immigration policies, a topic Trump has vehemently criticised Harris for. Abortion rights have also been a bone contention, as Republicans attempted to reinstate a nearly total ban on abortions.GeorgiaGeorgia, another state where Biden registered a victory by a slander margin of 13,000 votes, is not just a swing state but also a legal battlefield for Donald Trump, who faces allegations of election interference. The state is home to a diverse demographic, with a significant African-American population crucial to Democratic strategies. Harris's campaign aims to engage this demographic amid reports of growing disillusionment with the Biden administration.MichiganIn Michigan, where Biden won by 1,50,000 votes, the landscape is complicated by significant discontent among key voter groups. President Biden has faced criticism for his foreign policy, particularly on US military aid to Israel, which has bombarded Gaza for over a year. Michigan has the largest proportion of Arab-American residents in the US, and their support for Biden has become increasingly tenuous. Harris has shifted her tone vis-a-vis Israel, aiming to reassure voters who feel sidelined by the administration's policies while Trump keeps firm his stance on rapid military action.NevadaNevada, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, shows signs of a tightening race, with recent polls suggesting a shift in favour of Republicans. Both campaigns are actively courting Nevada's substantial Latino population, crucial to any candidate's success in the state. The economic recovery post-COVID has been sluggish in Nevada compared to the rest of the country, making it a big concern. The high unemployment rate and cost-of-living pressures are also key issues for voters in this state.North CarolinaIn North Carolina, Donald Trump's narrow victory margin in 2020 (by 74,000 votes) has made this state a toss-up for 2024. With demographics and issues mirroring those of neighbouring Georgia and Arizona, both candidates are pouring resources into North Carolina. Trump recently held a rally here, promising to end inflation, stop the influx of criminals into the country and restore the American dream.PennsylvaniaPennsylvania holds 19 electoral votes and is a critical target for both candidates. Biden's roots in Scranton give him a personal connection to voters in this working-class state. The economic landscape has shifted dramatically since Biden took office, with inflation affecting household budgets. Recent statistics show that grocery prices in Pennsylvania have risen faster than in any other state, leading to significant cost-of-living pressures among residents. Both campaigns are acutely aware that economic issues could sway undecided voters, particularly in counties like Erie, where food insecurity is a growing concern.WisconsinFinally, Wisconsin has historically been a bellwether state, having backed the winning candidate in the last two elections. After a victory with just over 21,000 votes for Biden in 2020, the state is crucial for both the candidates. There is a growing concern about third-party candidates potentially syphoning votes away from the main candidates. Independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr suspended his campaign in late August and endorsed Trump, which could alter the dynamics in this tightly contested state. Democrats are also facing challenges with Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose inclusion on the ballot has been contested. Trump has stressed Wisconsin's significance, declaring that winning the state could clinch the election.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\")",

Central to this election is the Electoral College, the process through which Americans elect their president and vice president. Much like the 2016 and 2020 elections, the Electoral College is likely to be a topic of interest this year as well. The system has resulted in two presidents being elected without winning the popular vote.Understanding The Electoral CollegeThe Electoral College is not a place, but a body of Electors that formally elects the President and Vice President of the US. A candidate must secure a majority of the 538 electoral votes \u2013 at least 270 - to win the presidency. Electors are chosen by political parties in each state, and in most states, they are required to cast their votes for the candidate who wins the popular vote within their state. Most states use a winner-take-all system. It means the candidate with the most votes in the state receives all its electoral votes. Only Maine and Nebraska use a proportional allocation system, allowing some electoral votes to be split.The Electoral College was established by the Founding Fathers as a compromise to balance the influence of populous and less populous states and was influenced by concerns about direct democracy.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");How The Electoral College WorksEach state's electoral votes are based on its representation in Congress \u2013 two for its senators and the number of its representatives in the House. This means larger states have more electoral votes. For instance, California has 54 electoral votes, while smaller states such as Wyoming have only three. Washington DC has three electoral votes, despite not being a state.Voting ProcessAfter the general election, a state's executive prepares a document called the Certificate of Ascertainment. This lists the electors for each candidate and shows how many votes each received. This document is sent to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as part of the official election records.Electors meet on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December following the election. They cast their votes for President and Vice President on separate ballots. The votes are recorded on a Certificate of Vote, which is also sent to Congress and NARA.If a candidate wins the popular vote in a state, they typically receive all of that state's electoral votes (except in Maine and Nebraska, which can split their votes).On January 6 of the following year, Congress holds a joint session to count the electoral votes. Members of the House and Senate gather in the House Chamber to conduct this count. The Vice President oversees the counting and announces the results, declaring the elected President and Vice President.The President-elect is sworn in on January 20 of the year after the election, officially becoming the President of the United States.If no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the election is decided by the House of Representatives, with each state delegation casting one vote for President. The Senate elects the Vice President.There is significant debate over the process, with many Americans favouring a popular vote system instead. However, attempts to reform or abolish the Electoral College have not succeeded.Occasionally, electors may not vote for the candidate they are pledged to, known as \u201cfaithless electors.\u201d While this has occurred, it has never changed the outcome of an election.",

        "text": "India and China have continued talks to resolve conflicts in some areas of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday, adding that now there was a broad consensus between the two countries to restore the situation on the ground.\nHis remarks followed the completion of troop disengagement in areas where tensions have persisted since the 2020 clashes. Speaking to the media in Tezpur, Assam, Singh emphasised that the agreement was reached based on \u201cequal and mutual security.\u201d He added that the consensus includes rights for traditional patrolling and grazing.\n\u2018Beyond disengagement\u2019\n\u201cIndia and China have been holding talks at both diplomatic and military levels to resolve the differences in some areas along the LAC. As a result of the talks, a broad consensus was developed on the basis of equal and mutual security,\u201d the defence minister said.\n\u201cThe consensus includes the rights of patrolling and grazing in traditional areas. Based on this consensus, the process of disengagement is almost complete. Our efforts will be to take the matter beyond disengagement; but for that, we will have to wait a little longer,\u201d he added.\nEarlier this month, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said in New Delhi that the agreement was finalised following negotiations over the past several weeks and that it would lead to a resolution of the issues that arose in 2020. Since the announcement ending over four years of military standoff at eastern Ladakh, China released fewer details except acknowledging that the process of disengagement is going on smoothly.\nOn Thursday, Singh virtually dedicated to the nation \u2018Desh ka Vallabh\u2019 statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and Major Ralengnao \u2018Bob\u2019 Khathing \u2018Museum of Valour\u2019 at Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh on October 31.

        "text": "On October 31, 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi marked National Unity Day, or Rashtriya Ekta Diwas, with a powerful address at the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, emphasizing the importance of national unity and the need to identify and combat Urban Naxalism.In his speech, Modi called attention to certain forces that he claimed are attempting to destabilize Indias economy and dissuade global investors.He urged citizens to recognize and stand against these so-called Urban Naxals, whom he described as agents of discord threatening the nations unity. These individuals, while invoking the Constitution and democracy, are working to divide India among its people, Modi stated. The Naxalism that once thrived in rural areas has evolved into a new model of urban Naxalism, and it is essential for us to confront those who seek to break our country apart.During the event, Modi reiterated his governments commitment to achieving One Nation, One Election, which aims to synchronize the electoral process for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, as reported by Hindustan Times. He expressed optimism that this initiative would enhance democracy in India and optimize the countrys resources. India is also moving towards a One Nation, One Civil Code, which embodies the spirit of a secular state, he added.The Prime Minister remarked on the last decade as a period of unprecedented achievements for national unity, stating that this unity will be reflected in every government initiative. He noted, Today marks the beginning of Sardar Patels 150th birth anniversary year, a time for us to honour his contributions to Indias unity. This celebration will span two years and will be filled with initiatives that reflect national unity.Modis tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, often called the architect of a unified India, was a central theme of his address. He emphasized Patels legacy in bringing together hundreds of princely states post-independence, stating, When India gained independence, many believed the nation would disintegrate. However, Sardar Patels realism, resolve, humanitarian spirit, and nationalistic aim ensured that a united India emerged.Earlier in the day, Modi paid tribute to Patel at the Statue of Unity and administered the Unity Oath, followed by attending the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade, as reported by Hindustan Times. nbsp;The parade featured 16 marching contingents from nine states and one Union Territory, including four Central Armed Police Forces, and the National Cadet Corps (NCC). Highlights included a spectacular flypast by the Indian Air Forces Surya Kiran team and displays of Indian martial arts by the Border Security Force (BSF).In conclusion, PM Modis address on Rashtriya Ekta Diwas served not only as a tribute to Sardar Patel but also as a call to action for citizens to remain vigilant against divisive forces while working towards a more unified and prosperous India.",

It provides health insurance coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh to poor families. West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi have not adopted the scheme.\n\nThe petition filed in the High Court was signed by all seven BJP Lok Sabha MPs from the national capital. BJP\u2019s Delhi unit chief Virendra Sachdeva claimed that the scheme was not being implemented \u201cpurely for political reasons\u201d, according to The Hindu.\n\nThe non-implementation of the scheme had resulted in the denial of health care to the elderly and the poor, he added.\n\nThe petition came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the health insurance scheme to include senior citizens aged 70 years and above. He also criticised the Delhi and West Bengal governments for not implementing the scheme due to \u201cpolitical\u201d interests.\n\n\u201cI apologise to all the elderly aged above 70 years of Delhi and West Bengal that I cannot serve them,\u201d Modi said on Tuesday. \u201cI would get to know about your pains and sufferings but I won\u2019t be able to help you.\u201d\n\nIn response, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal called the Ayushman Bharat a \u201cmajor scam\u201d, The Hindu reported.\n\nHe added that there was no need to implement the scheme in the national capital as the Aam Aadmi Party government provides free treatment up to Rs 1 crore to residents.\n\n\u201cEvery resident of Delhi, whether they have a simple cold or need hospitalisation, receives treatment, medication, and tests free of charge \u2013 no limits, no caps,\u201d Kejriwal said. \u201cIn Delhi, whether it\u2019s a five-rupee tablet or a treatment costing Rs 1 crore, everything is provided free of charge.\u201d\n\nCiting a performance audit undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the Ayushman Bhara scheme in 2023, the Aam Aadmi Party chief claimed that it was riddled with scams.\n\nAs per the audit report, nearly 7.5 lakh beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat scheme were registered under a single cellphone number \u2013 9999999999. The report noted that mobile numbers were important as those availing of the scheme could use them if they lost their identification cards.\n\nThe report also flagged that in thousands of cases, beneficiaries of the scheme had been shown to have unusually large families.

        "text": "India have not added any extra player to their squad ahead of the third Test against New Zealand and also does not have any plans of resting pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah before the upcoming long five-Test series against Australia Down Under starting in November. Amid reports that the team management had called up Harshit Rana to train and bowl for the team ahead of the third Test against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium, there was expectation that Rana could be added to the squad just like Washington Sundar was called up just before the second Test in Pune as the Delhi medium pacer is one of the bowlers picked in the Australia tour squad.\r\n\r\nwindow._rrCode = window._rrCode || [];_rrCode.push(function(){ (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\"); });But on Wednesday, India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar clarified that not extra player has been added to squad while also confirming that they have no plans of resting Bumrah despite it being an inconsequential Test as New Zealand has already taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. There has been concerns regarding the workload of Indian pacers in the last few years as many of them have broken down even during a series.Bumrah has a history with injuries and thus there was hope that the team management would like to keep him fresh ahead of the Australia series. But Nayar said the team management is aware of his workload but feels that the seasoned pacer from Gujarat has not bowled too many overs in two Tests, which incidently ended prematurely, thus giving him some extra rest days.\"I think in the two Test matches he's (Bumrah) bowled around 20, 25 overs. So he's not bowled a lot. Yes, there'll always be a thought process about his workload. Also, we played two games where we not at 5k cricket, it's been more three, three-and-a-half days, so he could have rest. But Booms is very important to us and the workload will always be something on our mind,\" Nayar said in a pre-match press conference at the wankhede Stadium here on Wednesday.Another reason for the team management opting against resting Bumrah is that the Wankhede pitch is expected to help seamers in the first hour or so every day.\"I always believe that Wankhede will always give pace a chance no matter what, especially when Mumbai winter doesn't feel like it. But in the morning there will be a bit of moisture, there will be a bit of dew around. So you will expect the first sessions to have a bit of swing. I'm not sure of the pitche yet because it's covered, but if the pitch is hard, then there will be a bit of swing as well. But at Wankhede, you will always see fast bowlers with a bit of a smile on their face in the morning,\" said Nayar.He said the Indian team needs do some self-reflection after losing a home series in more than a decade.\"Firstly, I will start with giving a lot of credit to New Zealand for the way they played and countered spin in the two Test matches. I feel that though the conditions will be different with a red-soil pitch. The last time we played on a red soil, which was in Chennai, a lot of the guys have been a lot of local cricketers and they understand what these conditions are and how the pitch is going to pan out. I think it's more about, at this level, self reflection for every player to go in and understand their game plans,\" he said.\"So for us, it's more about self reflection and what we can do as a team. There's always advantages, but I always believe that what you've done in the past doesn't really matter in the present. It's about how you turn up on that particular day,\" he added.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Indian and Chinese troops have exchanged Diwali sweets on five locations long the Line of Actual Control, including two in Ladakh. This comes a day after the two sides completed military disengagement from the Depsang and Demchok areas, in line with last week's patrolling agreement.\n\nSweets have been exchanged at Chushul Maldo and Daulat Beg Oldi in Ladakh, Banchha (near Kibutu) and Bumla in Arunachal Pradesh, and Nathula in Sikkim.\n\nThe patrolling deal called for removal of military personnel and infrastructure, including temporary camps, from the Depsang plains and Demchok, and withdrawal of troops to pre-April 2020 positions.\n\nThe deal, hopefully, will end nearly four years of military and diplomatic tension triggered by skirmishes and violent clashes in the Pangong Lake and Galwan regions in May-June 2020.\n\nThese clashes included the death of 20 Indian soldiers in Galwan in June.\n\nIndian Army sources told NDTV Wednesday the verification process - to cross-check that China had, in fact, withdrawn its troops, is ongoing, and that ground-level commanders from each side will inform the other prior to regular patrols \"to avoid miscommunication\". Significantly, both Delhi and Beijing will each continue to have surveillance options in Depsang and Demchok.\n\nDepsang, Demchok Disengagement Pics\n\nLast week NDTV accessed the first satellite images of the disengagement process.\n\nThe agreement was announced on Monday and, on the following Monday, a satellite image from the Depsang plains - from the 'Y' Junction - showed four vehicles and two tents.\n\nNDTV Exclusive | 1st Images Of Chinese Troops' Disengagement In Ladakh\n\nA second image, taken four days later, showed Indian military tents taken down and vehicles moving away, while images from Demchok showed temporary Chinese structures removed by October 25.\n\n\"Trying To Restore Trust\"\n\nOn the disengagement process Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi said this week the Indian military is \"trying to restore trust\" in its Chinese counterpart.\n\n\"This (rebuilding of trust) will happen once we are able to see each other, and convince and reassure each other, that we are not creeping into buffer zones that have been created,\" the General said.\n\nREAD | \"Trying To Restore Trust\": Army Chief On India-China Patrolling Deal\n\nDe-escalation of military tension in the area will be taken up after disengagement is over.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar declined to give a timeline for the de-escalation, saying only it would not happen till Delhi is sure that its Beijing counterparts had honoured their side of the deal.\n\nREAD | Troops' Disengagement First, De-Escalation Next: S Jaishankar\n\nDe-escalation is still a concern in other areas, including the Gogra-Hot Springs area in Ladakh, after Indian and Chinese forces backed down in September last year. However, intel indicates China continues to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north, in the Depsang plains area.\n\nDepsang is seen as critical for India since it provides access to the airstrip at Daulat Beg Oldie and prevents Chinese troops from threatening vital logistics centres in the area. Demchok, meanwhile is divided in two by the LAC; India controls the western part, which is claimed by China.\n\n\"After de-escalation, how to manage the borders will be discussed,\" he said in Mumbai.\n\nREAD | PM Modi, Xi Welcome \"Complete Disengagement\" Along LAC\n\nThe India-China patrolling agreement was announced hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia for the BRICS summit where he would hold a bilateral with China's Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking after it was confirmed, Mr Modi told the Chinese leader, \"It should be our priority to ensure there is peace and stability along our border\", and stressed the need for \"mutual trust, mutual respect\".",

Seven of the dead elephants were females, each around three years old. The eighth was a four-five-year-old male.\n\nThe condition of a ninth elephant - of a herd of 13 - is critical, wildlife officials have said.\n\nA tenth that was receiving medical care has recovered and has been released.\n\nThe three remaining members of the herd are under close observation.\n\nA three-member team from the NTCA, or National Tiger Conservation Authority, is in Bandhavgarh, while a five-member team from the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests is conducting an independent inquiry, the report of which will be filed in 10 days.\n\nThe primary suspected cause of death is poisoning.\n\nWildlife officials have searched over a dozen farms and houses in the area in which the elephant carcasses were found, and have questioned five people. The investigation area is spread over a five km radius and over 100 forest officials, including a canine squad, have been deployed.\n\nAmong other points being investigated are if the animals ate Kodo millet seeds; these can become dangerous if contaminated with a fungus that produces a toxic substance called cyclopiazonic acid. Samples have been collected from faecal matter, soil, and nearby plants.\n\nSamples from nearby fields and crops, and a watering hole, will also be studied.\n\nPossible man-animal conflict with villages in the area is also a concern.\n\nThe investigation, however, is being hampered by the presence of a larger and more aggressive herd of elephants - with around 20 individuals - in the area, as well as three tigers.\n\nREAD | 7 Elephants Dead In Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve In Madhya Pradesh\n\nMeanwhile, the bodies of the eight elephants have been buried.\n\nThe Bandhavgarh reserve was in the news in August after a spate of tiger deaths prompted a major administrative shake-up.

        "text": "by Stella Paul (cali, columbia)Thursday, October 31, 2024Inter Press Service\n\nHe silently slipped out of the bed and hid behind a tree at the back of the house.\n\n\"My wife was woken up by the armed men who asked her where I was and when she said she didn't know, they demanded money from her. When she said she had no money on her, they hit her in the face. Then they took turns to rape her. The next day I took them to Rwanda,\" Aruna recalls the horror.\n\nSince then, Aruna's family has lived in Rwanda, but he has continued to work in the DRC, often in hiding and on the run but never giving up the cause. He leads an environmental group called Congo Basin Conservation Society in the vicinity of Kahuzi Bieza National Park, which is, besides gorillas and chimpanzees, also famous for redwood and vast deposits of charcoal. The redwood is felled by loggers primarily to smuggle to China, while the charcoal is sold both in domestic and international markets. As CBCS tries to stop the smugglers, their members are regularly attacked, kidnapped for ransom and killed.\n\nSurviving in the Dangerous Forests\n\nAccording to Global Witness 2023 report Missing Voices, 74 environmental defenders have been killed in the DRC in the past decade\u2014mostly in the Congo Basin\u2014a hotspot of illegal mining and illegal logging.\n\nDRC also features in the World Peace Index as the 6th most dangerous country in the world. \"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, rebels and warmed forces wander certain areas at will. Crimes, including murder, rape, kidnapping, carjackings, burglaries, muggings, and highway robberies, are fairly common,\" says the report.\n\nJose says that the local men and women who are trying to preserve biodiversity in their neighborhoods face the greatest risk.\n\n\"We are crushed by dual evils. On one side, there are illegal, armed militias that target us. On the other hand, we face threats from the corrupt army and government officials who are directly linked to those running illegal businesses. We have nowhere to go.\"\n\nThe total area of the Congo River Basin is 3.7 million square kilometers\u2014double the size of its neighboring country, Uganda. It is also known as the lungs of Africa. There are dozens of armed insurgents that operate in the area, but it is the Owazalendo militia partnering with Congo military and Forces D\u00e9mocratiques de Lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda (FDLR), a Hutu rebel group linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, that are the most powerful. Both Owazalendo and FDLR are also giving direct support to illegal miners and loggers both inside the protected forests and outside of it, Aruna informs.\n\n\"We are mostly in hiding. If we are caught by the rebels, we will be asked to pay anything between five hundred and fifty thousand American dollars to be free. Can you imagine that kind of money?\" he asks.\n\nAruna is at COP16, where country representatives are currently finalizing the best ways to implement the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). The GBF's Target 22 specifically mentions that countries must \"ensure the full protection of environmental human rights defenders,\" and Aruna thinks that it is time for the parties to accept that environmental defenders are greatly vulnerable and lack both government support and resources required to protect themselves.\n\nArms for Arms: Case of Myanmar\n\nSunita Kwangta Moomoo is a Karen\u2014an indigenous community from the Kayin state of Myanmar\u2014a country under military rule and also in the middle of a civil war.\n\nBut the Karen community, which has been demanding a separate homeland for Karen people, has been in an armed conflict that precedes the military coup and fall of democracy in February 2021. The fights have, however, intensified manifold since various pro-democracy groups started an armed resistance against the army all across the country, including Loikaw, the heartland of Kayin State, where the Karen National Liberation Army is leading the fight.\n\nMoomoo, who now lives in neighboring country Thailand, has family members who are still in Myanmar.\n\n\"The situation is tough. Every now and then, we have air strikes by the military directed at the villages. The only way to escape these airstrikes is to hide in a mountain cave. Sometimes the military also conducts raids in villages, and they always follow a \"scorched earth\" policy, so they burn down everything\u2014homes, animals, vegetation\u2014along their way.\"\n\nThis has not just destroyed human lives but also the culture of the Karens since their belief system, including social and religious rituals, is integrally tied to land and forests. \"When we sow crops, when we harvest, when we celebrate a birth, we perform rituals on the land that we own or live on. Now, those are gone.\n\nThe concept of environmental defense, obviously, doesn't exist anymore either since survival has become the only goal of the Karens. And in the desperate struggle for survival, even civilians have armed themselves. \"Everyone is a soldier now,\" says Moomoo.\n\n\"Environmental defenders arming themselves is bound to happen if the state is not able to protect themselves and Myanmar is a classic example of that,\" says Joan Carling, Executive Director of Indigenous Peoples Rights International, a Philippines-based global organization that works to safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nPhilippines is yet another country that has gained notoriety for killing environmental defenders, especially in the indigenous territories.\n\nThe statistics from the Missing Voices report show that of the 196 defenders reportedly killed or forcibly disappeared globally in 2023, 17 were in the Philippines, the highest toll in Asia. More environmental defenders have been killed in the country than anywhere else in the region over the past 11 years.\n\nCarling, who has been attending COP16, reveals that the indigenous people's body has been demanding the formation of a new, official forum within the UNCBD to ensure safety and inclusion of indigenous peoples as the implementation of GBF begins worldwide. The new platform\u2014a permanent subsidiary body\u2014will specifically focus on Article 8J of the KMGBF that commits to, among others, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities... for the conservation of biological diversity.\n\n\"We need to recognize indigenous environmental defenders as the key actors in biodiversity conservation in this COP,\" Carling says.\n\nTargeted by the Drug Cartels\n\nColombia, the host of COP16, holds a dubious record of witnessing the greatest number of murders of environmental defenders. The country was in an armed conflict with ultra-communist rebels led by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for five decades until it signed a peace agreement with the government in 2016. During the period, nearly half a million Colombians were killed and forcibly disappeared, of which 200,000 were civilians.\n\nToday Colombia is no longer in an armed conflict yet it continues to witness murders of environmental defenders.\n\nOn October 28, in a plenary session focused on Target 22 of the GBF, it was revealed that 240 people had been killed between 2016 and 2024 in Colombia for opposing destruction of forests and nature. Drug cartel runners were responsible for the majority of murders.\n\nOn 29 October, at a side event, speakers from different UN agencies and the government of Colombia drew attention to the dire need for international collaboration to curb drug trafficking. This, they said, could only be done if the peace treaty is implemented well and in time and concrete steps were taken in collaboration with international communities to destroy the supply chain of drugs originating from Colombia.\n\nAccording to Jose Manuel Peria, head of green business at the Ministry of the Environment, Colombia, the government has been proposing new strategies to ensure the rights of farmers and those on the frontline of environmental conservation. These include restructuring the government system and building new channels for generating resources for the communities, especially with an environmental focus.\n\n\"There is no longer just talk of agricultural production, but sustainable agriculture. We are now building this narrative in the ministries and portfolios involved in all these (implementation of the peace accord) processes. And indeed, biodiversity and the sustainable management of life are at the very center of this process,\" Peria asserts.\n\nBut Mary Creagh Raine, the Nature Minister for the United Kingdom, who also spoke at the event, said that while the action at the local and national level was crucial, it was also equally important to crack down on the international markets of Colombian drugs. The UK, said Creagh Raine, was one such market for the drug cartel and if the cartel and the violence they unleash on local environmental defenders were to stop, Colombia and the UK would have to work closely to ensure that the smuggling route and the markets are also closed.\n\n\"There is still so much to do to ensure that crimes against the environment and people are prosecuted and punished with the severity they deserve,\" said Craigh Raine. \"The transnational nature of drug trafficking is modern, agile and highly sophisticated. If we really want to be effective, we must do more together to demonstrate the same multinational consistency and coordination, Creagh Raine said.\n\nNo End of Conflict, No Peace with Nature\n\nThe Biodiversity COP started with the overarching goal of \"Making Peace with Nature,\" but can this be ever achieved given the current scale of war and armed conflict across global regions and their high impact on biodiversity?\n\nAnswering this question, Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, told IPS that achieving peace with nature is only possible if there is a political solution to the ongoing wars and conflicts.\n\n\"To make peace with nature, we must first make peace with ourselves. That is why we have been asking for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, release of the hostages and the massive humanitarian aid to Gaza. That is why we are asking for peace in Lebanon\u2014a peace that respects Lebanese sovereignty, Lebanese territorial integrity and paves the way for a political solution. That is why we are asking for peace in Sudan\u2014the enormous stress that exists. To make peace with nature, we must first make peace with ourselves because wars are won at the most devastating impacts of biodiversity, climate and pollution,\" said Guterres.\nIPS UN Bureau Report\n\nFollow @IPSNewsUNBureauFollow IPS News UN Bureau on Instagram\n\n\u00a9 Inter Press Service (2024) \u2014 All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press Service",

        "title": "Israel's Ban on UNRWA Threatens the Stability of Palestine",
        "text": "by Oritro Karim (united nations)Thursday, October 31, 2024Inter Press Service\n\nThis comes after nearly eight decades of work done by UNRWA in Palestine to provide refugees with essential humanitarian aid. The absence of UNRWA activity in Palestine is expected to further restrict humanitarian access in the nation, leaving millions to fend for themselves amid the ongoing hostilities and the upcoming harsh winter. UNRWA has actively supported Palestinians since 1948, distributing essential resources including food, water and shelter, and providing critical public services such as healthcare and education.\n\nUNRWA and the United Nations (UN) have responded to the bills and denounced Israel's actions towards the people of Palestine. \"The implementation of the laws could have devastating consequences for Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is unacceptable,\" said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. \n\nUNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini issued a statement to X (formerly known as Twitter) saying, \"These bills will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell. It \u2060will deprive over 650,000 girls & boys there from education, putting at risk an entire generation of children. These bills increase the suffering of the Palestinians and are nothing less than collective punishment.\"\n\nIsraeli authorities doubled down on their stance on the bills, accusing UNRWA of promoting terrorism and antisemitism. Yulia Malinovsky, a member of the Knesset, told reporters that UNRWA does not deserve legal immunity from Israeli retaliation, saying that aid personnel should no longer receive \"five star treatment\" in Israel. Malinovsky also opined that UNRWA colluded with Hamas. \n\n\"UNRWA chose to make itself an inseparable component of Hamas' mechanism \u2013 and now is the time to detach ourselves entirely from it,\" said former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz. \n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued a joint statement to Israeli authorities, warning that the newly passed bills \"would devastate the humanitarian response in Gaza at this critical moment and deny essential educational and social services to tens of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem\".\n\nThis is particularly concerning to humanitarian organizations as almost all of Gaza's population depends on aid to survive. At this moment, humanitarian aid is more crucial than ever as Gaza grapples with the high risk of a polio outbreak, the destruction of critical infrastructure, and dwindling resources. \n\n\"Israel has bombed Palestinians to death, maimed them, starved them, and is now ridding them of their biggest lifeline of aid. Piece by piece, Israel is systematically dismantling Gaza as a land that is autonomous and livable for Palestinians. The banning of UNRWA today is condemnable and another step in this crime,\" says Sally Abi Khalil, Oxfam Regional Director in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nUNRWA and its partners, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), began the second round of polio vaccinations in Gaza on October 14. Although initially successful, continued bombardments halted the campaign from reaching northern Gaza, home to approximately 120,000 unimmunized children. The deadline to provide these children with the crucial second dose falls in mid-November, after which, chances of full immunization significantly decline. \n\n\"This is a risk not just to the 120,000 children who remain in northern Gaza, children aged ten, and below that is, but also to children in the larger region. And that's why we are so incredibly worried and pressing for this second round to happen by the beginning of November,\" says Rosalia Bollen, UNICEF's Communication Specialist in Gaza. \n\nBollen adds that the polio outbreak, continued hostilities, and the lack of humanitarian aid have taken a severe toll on children's education, describing Gaza's children as \"a lost generation\". UNRWA hosts a variety of social services in Palestine, including over 183 schools in Gaza. These schools are set to shut down due to the two newly passed bills. \n\nAs the bills were being passed by the Knesset, Israel continued its aerial campaign in Gaza. On the morning of October 29, Israel launched another airstrike on a displacement shelter in Beit Lahiya, causing at least 109 civilian casualties and leveling a five-storey residential building. Gaza's health ministry has reported that a series of bombardments in densely populated districts in northern Gaza has resulted in over 800 deaths in a three week aerial campaign. \n\n\"The bombing in north Gaza is non-stop. The bombs continue to fall, the Israeli military is separating families and detaining many people and people fleeing have been reportedly shot at. The Israeli Government's policies and practices in northern Gaza risk emptying the area of all Palestinians. We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,\" said UN Human Rights Chief Volker T\u00fcrk. \n\nAdditionally, intense bombardments have halted humanitarian aid, essentially cutting off the flow of supplies for millions of Palestinians. Resources have been almost completely depleted, with humanitarian organizations fearing the onset of famine in Gaza. A statement by the World Food Programme (WFP) states, \"Gaza's food systems have largely collapsed due to the destruction of factories, croplands and shops. Markets are nearly empty as most commercial channels are no longer functioning.\"\n\nIn early October of this year, a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned that approximately 96 percent of Gaza will face severe food insecurity, with almost half a million people facing \"catastrophic levels\" of hunger. Famine has been described as imminent. \n\nWithout UNRWA's activity in the occupied Palestinian territories, conditions are expected to severely deteriorate as the harsh winter approaches. \"After being forced to flee time and time again, hundreds of thousands of families in Gaza are living in inadequate tents and makeshift shelters. When winter comes, these shelters will not keep them safe from strong winds, heavy rains and cold temperatures,\" said Alison Ely, Shelter Cluster coordinator in Gaza. \n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Spokesman for the Secretary-General St\u00e9phane Dujarric confirmed that the UN will continue to do whatever they can to assist the Palestinian people. Dujarric also noted that due to UNRWA's removal from Palestine, Israel has an obligation to meet the needs of the millions of people residing in their sovereignties. \"Israel would have to fill the vacuum and meet those needs, or be in violation of international law,\" explained Dujarric. \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement declaring Israel's intentions to provide humanitarian aid for affected communities in Gaza. \"In the 90 days before this legislation goes into effect \u2014 and after \u2014 we stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure that Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza in a manner that does not threaten Israel's security,\" says Netanyahu. \n\nHumanitarian organizations and U.S. officials have expressed their concerns that Israel will not be able to effectively facilitate the duties that were conducted by UNRWA. Matthew Miller, spokesperson for the United States Department of State, said. \"There's nobody that can replace them (UNRWA) right now in the middle of the crisis\". \n\nGuterres echoed these sentiments in a post shared to X. \"There is no alternative to UNRWA.\"\n\nIPS UN Bureau Report\n\nFollow @IPSNewsUNBureauFollow IPS News UN Bureau on Instagram\n\n\u00a9 Inter Press Service (2024) \u2014 All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press Service",

The verification process was being done physically as well as using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\nTroops on both sides have been withdrawn to be stationed at depth in the rear locations as part of the disengagement process. The patrolling, which will be undertaken to points hitherto inaccessible since April 2020 will be done by small parties of troops numbering around 10 to 15 soldiers.\n\nIndia and China have been locked in a military standoff along the LAC in eastern Ladakh following Chinese incursions over four and half years ago.\n\nLast week, four days after India announced that an agreement on patrolling in the Depsang Plains and Demchok had been reached with China, Beijing affirmed the same, saying that \u201cthe Chinese and Indian frontier troops are engaged in relevant work, which is going smoothly at the moment\u201d.\n\nSources in the Army said that following the completion of the verification process, the coordinated patrolling will begin within the next two days.

He was also a stalwart Congressman. Continuous efforts are being made to (mis)appropriate his legacy by those whose ideological gurus opposed the Quit India Movement in which the Sardar was jailed for almost three years and who criticised the Constitution, a key committee of which was chaired by the Sardar later,\" Ramesh said in a post on X.\n\n \"This only exposes the insecurities and hypocrisy of the (mis)appropriators,\" he added.\n\n Mr. Ramesh said it was Jawaharlal Nehru who inaugurated a bronze bust of Patel in Godhra on February 13, 1949. An inscription below the bust also bears out this fact, he said.\n\n The bust had been installed by local Congressmen in Godhra, because this is where the Sardar had started his legal practice, he said.\n\n \"Nehru had come to Godhra after laying the foundation for the educational township Vallabh Vidya Nagar near Anand - named of course after Sardar Patel. At Godhra, Nehru spoke of how averse he was to the unveiling of statues, especially for living personalities - but that he had made an exception in the case of Sardar Patel, because they were the closest of colleagues and because of the Sardar's unique contributions to the making of Independent India,\" Ramesh said.\n\n \"This is among the very few, if not the only, busts of Sardar Patel erected when he was alive,\" he said.\n\n Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a post on X gave her tributes to \"one of the architects of modern India.\" \"From India's freedom struggle to the creation of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji's contribution is an example of service and dedication towards the country,\" she said.\n\n The Congress, on its official X handle, said Mr. Patel will always continue to inspire the people of the country.\n\n Born in Nadiad, Gujarat, in 1875, Mr. Patel was a pivotal figure in India's struggle for Independence.\n\n Renowned for his exceptional leadership and unyielding commitment to national integration, he is fondly remembered as the \"Iron Man of India.\" He died in 1950.",

Shivakumar that the government will hold discussions on the Shakthi scheme.\n\nThe CM stated, \u201cI will talk to Shivakumar about it. There is no proposal to revise the guarantee schemes at the government level. There is no intention on our side in this regard. There is no proposal as such to stop the Shakthi scheme. I don\u2019t know about it or Dy CM D.K. Shivakumar saying that few women are demanding that they want to pay and travel.\u201d\n\nShivakumar on Wednesday said the government will hold discussions on the Shakthi scheme in view of many women preferring to pay for their tickets. Sources stated that the government will conduct a meeting shortly to discuss the withdrawal of the Shakthi scheme. If not for total withdrawal of the scheme, the government will stop free travel service to all women, sources added.\n\nSources further explain that, following the drubbing in the Lok Sabha election, a large number of Congress leaders, including MLAs and Ministers, are pressuring CM Siddaramaiah to stop the guarantees or to impose restrictions on beneficiaries.\n\nSenior Congress MLA Raju Kage recently alleged that no schemes were introduced in the state for the farmers to survive. He even threatened to end his life at Vidhana Soudha for the agrarian cause. Veteran Congress leader R.V. Deshpande had also openly stated about the shortage of funds for the development works.\n\nThe Congress government is under tremendous pressure from its own legislators after the Lok Sabha election. The party hoped that through guarantee schemes it would manage to get more than 18 seats out of 28 seats. It could only manage to win nine seats with the majority of seats coming from the Kalyan Karnataka region, which has the most backward districts in the state.\n\nCommenting over the development, Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel H.D. Kumaraswamy stated on Thursday, \u201cAlready Anna Bhagya scheme where 10 kilos of free rice is promised for every individual of the family, the Congress government has imposed conditions and started giving guidelines. Through this, the quantity of rice has been lowered. We have to see where the trend will reach.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, we have to wait and see where the Congress government will take this. We are not jealous or unhappy about the guarantee schemes. Let them double the five guarantees, we are happy. My advice to them is not to push the state towards bankruptcy,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cYou look at the statistics available with the government. The government is not able to carry out any development work. The tax paid by the people of the state is utilized for the guarantees,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThe governments will have to create capital assets. Then the state becomes powerful economically. In Karnataka, the economic interests of the state are harmed. If freebies are continued by not arranging alternatives to generate capital, what will happen in future? We have seen the chaos and anarchy that have sunk different countries and my concern is it should not happen in Karnataka state,\u201d he stated.\n\nEarlier, Shivakumar said, \u201cMany women have been communicating to us through social media and emails that they would like to pay for their tickets. We will discuss this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout 5-10 per cent of women are saying that the conductors are not taking money for the tickets even when they volunteer. I will soon hold a meeting with Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy and discuss this,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Karnataka government is providing 10 kilos of free rice to every member of a BPL family under the Anna Bhagya scheme; Under the Gruha Laxmi scheme, every woman head of the BPL family is given Rs 2,000; Under Yuva Nidhi, unemployed graduates will get Rs 3,000 and diploma holders Rs 1,500 for two years.\n\nUnder the Gruha Jyothi scheme, every household is provided 200 units of free power and the Shakthi scheme offers free travel to women across the state. The Congress government is spending about Rs 52,000 crore annually on five guarantees.",

Finally, drones are employed for an aerial count, and the results are released after all three counts are completed.\nDouble Records Set in Ayodhya\nBarul further noted that this time, two world records have been established in Ayodhya, including the record for collective Saryu aarti, which was unique in its execution. \n\u201cThis is the first time someone has attempted this method. Ayodhya has been making history by lighting the maximum number of lamps for the past seven years. The previous record of lighting 22.23 lakh lamps simultaneously has been broken, as 25.12 lakh lamps were lit in Ayodhya yesterday,\u201d he added.\nHouses throughout the city also shone brightly, adding to the festival\u2019s breath-taking beauty as 500 drones, laser lights, cultural programmes and tableaux on Ramayana took the celebrations to unprecedented levels.",

It stands on the Sadhu Bet hillock, connected by a 300-metre bridge, which offers access from the mainland to the statue.Speaking to ANI, Journalist Esmeraldo Baptista from Angola said that it was amazing to learn about Sardar Patel because, \u201cMost of us are familiar with the story of Mahatma Gandhi. It was a good surprise for us to know the story behind Mr. Patel and the way he was able to unite all the kingdoms. So it\u2019s important for us to get to know this\u201d.\u201cIn the current days when we have wars and everything, we need to be reminded of unity. We need this unity if you want to strive as humanity\u201d, he said. Speaking about the takeaways from this visit, he said, \u201cSo there are a couple of things we can take from this, like leadership. Mr. Patel put his people behind himself, their needs before himself. It is touching the way he sacrificed himself for this country and his people\u201d.Another journalist from Nigeria told ANI that they got to learn more about Sardar Patel in terms of history, perspective about him and his politics, leadership skill and vision for India.A business journalist from Ghana- \u201cI\u2019m impressed to see the work being put in here and the huge effort to preserve this place for another generation to come and learn about\u201d.On October 31, India observes National Unity Day, also known as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas. This significant day commemorates the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a pivotal figure in India\u2019s struggle for independence and the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India. Renowned for his exceptional leadership and unyielding commitment to national integration, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is fondly remembered as the \u201cIron Man of India.\u201d National Unity Day serves as a reminder of his efforts to unite the diverse princely states into a single nation and fosters a spirit of solidarity among the people of India.",

The young boy lost his life after the situation between the two cousins went out of hand after a very heated argument took a sad turn into violence. The incident happened just a few days before Diwali added heartbreak to the joyous festivities in the locality.\n\nThat gruesome scene has been captured in a video where Anurag\u2019s tearful mother clutches to her chest her son\u2019s severed head, weeping bitterly over the loss that she cannot even imagine. It was going viral very fast on social media, raising waves of sadness and outrage over the graphic act of violence that has left many people wondering what kind of rivalry this could be, which is deeply ingrained, and how low a man would go on issues of land wrangles.\n\nAnurag Yadav beheaded by cousin Ramesh Yadav over 40-year-old property dispute\n\nTensions between the Yadav families over property rights had flared to dangerous levels over the past 40 years and on the day of the incident, it seemed to have reached a crescendo. In this case, the event appears to be more a case of land disputes having a destructive potential than religious hostility since both families are Hindus. It seems that strong feelings of great resentment have erupted in violent outbursts of angry furor, and this has culminated into this unthinkable tragedy.\n\nThe authorities are investigating the case and have arrested Ramesh Yadav. They will proceed to prosecute him for such a detestable crime. Leaders and officials of the local community have called for all the disputes regarding family matters or properties to be met peacefully with dialogue and available channels of law to stop these extreme results.\n\nThis has revealed vulnerability to peace in communities where issues are never solved for generations, and people should seek justice legally. However, the residents and social media users have collectively expressed their sympathies with Anurag\u2019s family in this tragic moment hoping that no other family has to face such a terrible loss for the sake of land or pride.\n\nAlso, see: Canada bans Diwali celebrations following strained relationship with India",

        "title": "Path To Oval Office: US Vice Presidents Who Went On To Became President",
        "text": "The United States goes to polls on November 5, and Vice-President Kamala Harris stands as one of the contenders for the top post. If Harris becomes the President, she will be only the 16th Vice-President -- of the 50 the US has had so far -- to ascend to the presidency since 1789.Here's a look at US vice presidents who ascended to the presidency:John Adams (1797-1801) John Adams, a prominent political philosopher, was the second President of the United States, following his role as the first Vice President under George Washington. When Adams secured the presidency, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson finished second, resulting in a president and vice president from opposing parties.Thomas Jefferson (1801 to 1809)Thomas Jefferson, a champion of democracy and an American Founding Father, was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and served as the third President of the United States. When Jefferson took office as President, he reduced Army and Navy spending, streamlined the budget, and abolished the unpopular whiskey tax that troubled the West.Martin Van Buren (1837-1841)Martin Van Buren was the eighth President of the US. A New York politician, he was appointed Secretary of State by Andrew Jackson. Skilled in managing the internal conflicts of the Jackson administration, Van Buren served as vice president during Jackson's second term from 1833 to 1837. He ran for president as a Democrat in 1836 and triumphed over three Whig candidates.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");John Tyler (1841-1845)John Tyler ascended to the presidency as the 10th President of the United States after the death of President William Henry Harrison in April 1841, just 32 days into his term. Often referred to as \u201cHis Accidency\u201d by critics, Tyler was the first Vice President to assume the presidency after the death of his predecessor.Millard Fillmore (1850-1853)Millard Fillmore, the 13th President of the United States and a member of the Whig Party, holds the distinction of being the last President not aligned with either the Democratic or Republican parties.Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)Andrew Johnson supported slavery and states' rights but opposed Southern secession in 1861. Selected as Abraham Lincoln's running mate in 1864 for the \u201cUnion\u201d party, he became the 17th President of the US after Lincoln's assassination in 1865.Chester A. Arthur (1881-1885)Chester A. Arthur, a Vermont native with limited political experience, was appointed collector of tariffs in New York, where he engaged in corrupt practices to fund the Republican Party. He joined the 1880 Republican ticket as James Garfield's running mate and became the 21st President of the United States, assuming office after the assassination of President James Garfield.Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909)Following the assassination of President William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, at just under 43 years old, ascended to the presidency as the 26th and youngest leader in American history. He infused the office with renewed energy and authority, passionately guiding Congress and the American public toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy.Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929)Calvin Coolidge served as lieutenant governor and governor of Massachusetts before becoming Warren Harding's running mate in 1920. He assumed the presidency in 1923 after Harding's death. Coolidge was re-elected in 1924 with the slogan \u2018Keep Cool with Coolidge.'Harry S. Truman (1945-1953)Selected as Franklin D. Roosevelt's running mate in 1944, Harry Truman became the 33rd President of the US after Roosevelt's death. Truman made some historic decisions, including authorising the atomic bombings of Japan.Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969)Lyndon B. Johnson was selected as John F. Kennedy's Vice President during the 1960 election campaign. After Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Johnson took the oath of office as the 36th President of the US.Richard M. Nixon (1969-1974)Richard Nixon, who served as both a US Representative and a Senator from California, was elected as the 37th President of the US. He is known for bringing an end to American military involvement in Vietnam and improving diplomatic relations with the USSR and China.Gerald R. Ford (1974-1977)Gerald Ford, a seasoned legislator from Michigan, became Richard Nixon's Vice President after Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973 due to corruption allegations. In August 1974, Ford ascended to the presidency when Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment.George H.W. Bush (1989-1993)George H.W. Bush, the 41st President of the US, served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president. He won the 1988 presidential election against Democratic candidate Mike Dukakis. Bush played a key role in ending the Cold War and led an international coalition to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait after their invasion.Joe Biden (2020-present)Joe Biden ran for president twice before being chosen as Barack Obama's running mate in 2008. He opted not to run in 2016, partly due to the cancer-related death of his son, Beau. Ultimately, Biden secured the presidency in 2020.",

        "text": "With the recent close of nominations, 685 individuals remain in contention for the first segment of the Jharkhand assembly elections. This follows the withdrawal of 58 nominations, setting the stage for an eagerly anticipated electoral battle.In the Dumka constituency, a seat reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST), the fight is primarily between the BJP and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM). Representing JMM is Basant Soren, brother of Hemant Soren, while Sunil Soren is the candidate for the BJP.Watch Out For These SeatsThe voter demographics in Dumka during the 2019 Assembly Elections included 165,820 registered voters, with a nearly equal split between 83,310 men and 81,723 women. Notably, there were no voters from the third gender, but the constituency saw 743 postal votes and included 272 service voters, comprising 262 men and 10 women. This marked a growth from 2014, where Dumka had 156,239 voters, with postal votes at 911 and service voters at 215. nbsp;The Ranchi constituency sees a contest between BJP incumbent CP Singh, a six-time winner, and Mahua Maji, a Rajya Sabha member from JMM. Despite being a stronghold for the BJP, Maji previously posed a significant challenge to Singh, who ultimately won by a margin of over 5,000 votes. The political landscape in Ranchi illustrates the intense competition and strategic candidate placement by the parties involved.Lohardaga, another Scheduled Tribes reserved seat, is significant due to its tribal and historical context. Predominantly inhabited by tribal communities like the Oraon and Munda, the constituencys majority engage in agriculture and related activities. The influence of these communities is pivotal in election outcomes.In the 2019 elections, Congress Rameshwar Oraon emerged victorious over BJPs Sukhdeo Bhagat. With 245,000 electors in 2019, Lohardaga had a voter turnout of 71.23 per cent, demonstrating the high level of engagement among the electorate.In Dhanwar, located within the Giridih district and a segment of the Koderma Lok Sabha constituency, a noteworthy battle saw Babulal Marandi of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Democratic) overpower BJPs Laxman Prasad Singh with a margin of 17,550 votes in 2019. Marandis triumph in Dhanwar was a significant achievement for his party, especially considering the BJPs strong performance in the Kodarma parliamentary seat during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. nbsp;The varied constituencies, each with unique demographic and political landscapes, highlight the multifaceted nature of Jharkhands electoral battleground. The electoral dynamics in these regions illustrate the intricate blend of tribal influence, historical significance, and political strategy that characterize the assembly polls.Voter engagement and turnout, particularly in seats like Lohardaga, underscore the electorates active participation and the critical role of tribal and rural communities in shaping the elections outcome.The assembly polls in Jharkhand are not just a contest of candidates but a testament to the vibrant democratic spirit and diverse socio-political tapestry of the state. As the election date approaches, the focus on key constituencies, candidate strategies, and voter demographics will intensify, setting the stage for a closely watched electoral contest.In conclusion, the assembly elections in Jharkhand are gearing up to be a pivotal event, with 685 candidates vying for voters approval across various constituencies. The electoral battle in Dumka, Ranchi, Lohardaga, and Dhanwar showcases the intense competition and strategic significance of these areas.

        "text": "Comedian Samay Raina, who is currently in news for his show, India's Got Latent, got into an ugly spat with ex-journalist-turned-Youtuber Shyam Meera Singh on social media over bursting firecrackers during Diwali. The two exchanged some of the choicest expletives on X, and their spat is now all over the internet.\n\nIt all began after Samay shared a video trolling those who advocate celebrating Diwali without firecrackers, stating that the same people are seen smoking on the streets. \"Jo karna hai karo,\" he said in a video.\n\nSoon after, Singh tagged Samay in a tweet and stated that the comedian had himself ranted about people bursting crackers in 2020, but he has now changed his stance to gain the support of 'sanghis' and 'bhakts'. He also shared an old tweet of the comedian in which he had written, \"Diwali is about finding how many dumb people live around your house. #NoToFirecrackers (sic).\"\n\nTo that, Samay responded, \"Ideologies change with time. I don't think yeh baat aapko samajh aayegi kyuki aap tab bhi ch**tiye the aur abh bhi ch**tiye hi ho (sic).\"\n\nNot one to step back, Singh swiftly replied and taking a dig at Samay wrote that writing abusive tweets was \"cool\". Samay then dug out an old picture of Singh from 2022 in which he was seen burning fireworks himself, thus shutting the Youtuber and ending the online fight.\n\nFor those unversed, Singh was fired from the media portal, Aaj Tak, for his controversial tweets on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021, post which he turned into a full-time Youtuber.",

BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha member is confident his daughter will gain support due to the development work he accomplished in the area. \u201cThe atmosphere is good,\u201d he said. The BJP leader also added, \u201cThe constituency I have represented in the Maharashtra Assembly for many years is now the same place where the BJP has fielded my daughter as the candidate because I am now serving in the Rajya Sabha. I am confident that the good work we have done for the common people, for the general category, and the development that has taken place there\u2013where I have nurtured it with great dedication over the years\u2013will resonate with the people. I believe that people have great hopes, and the next generation, including my daughter, is well-trained, sensible, and educated. In the future, this region will join the vision of a developed India.\u201dChavan also addressed the expectations and responsibilities that come with his political legacy, acknowledging the work it requires to maintain it.He credited his family\u2019s long-standing connection to the people and his efforts to nurture the constituency over the years. \u201cIn terms of legacy, maintaining and furthering it requires even more hard work,\u201d he said, adding that his bond with his constituents will continue through his daughter\u2019s involvement.Discussing the BJP\u2019s performance, Chavan said that elections depend on multiple factors beyond any one individual. \u201d An election doesn\u2019t depend on just one individual. Many factors play a role, especially in a national election. Perhaps certain areas fell short, but now with the elections coming again, we hope this time BJP will succeed. Our workers are still there; we take ownership. We never claimed that Nanded is our property; it\u2019s a developing district and doesn\u2019t depend solely on one individual.\u201d he added.He then recalled a past time when his relationship with Ashok Gehlot was strained, and he had considered joining the BJP. Eventually, he decided to remain, and he now views his switch to a new party as a fresh start. \u201cEveryone goes through these ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized it was better to make a fresh start at a new party.\u201dOn Maratha reservation issues, Chavan acknowledged lingering resentment, but he highlighted the progress made. \u201cMany improvements have happened that perhaps people are unaware of, like the 10 percent reservation that has created job opportunities and allowed people to receive certificates they previously couldn\u2019t. Numerous positive things have been achieved, which need to be communicated to people. With that explanation, the dissatisfaction has somewhat been addressed. The remaining issues can be resolved through further dialogue.\u201dWhen asked if Bhokar would finally support the BJP, Chavan expressed hope that the people\u2019s respect for him and support for his new party would yield positive results.\u201d Hope things will go well this time\u201d, he added",

        "text": "Ekta Nagar Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said some forces in and outside India are trying to destabilise the country and portray a negative image of the nation in the world, underscoring the need to \u201cidentify urban Naxals and unmask them\u201d.\n\nHe was addressing a gathering near the iconic Statue of Unity at Ekta Nagar in Gujarat\u2019s Narmada district after paying floral tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the birth anniversary of India\u2019s first home minister.\n\n National Unity Day\n\nSince 2014, Sardar Patel\u2019s birth anniversary has been celebrated on October 31 as \u2018Rashtriya Ekta Diwas\u2019, or National Unity Day.\n\n\u201cDue to India\u2019s increasing strengths and capabilities, some forces in and outside are trying to destabilise the country and spread anarchy. They want to hurt India\u2019s economic interests. They want to send a wrong message to foreign investors by portraying a negative image of the nation in the world,\u201d the PM said.\n\nDisinformation campaign\n\nWithout taking names, Modi said \u201cthese people\u201d are also targeting India\u2019s armed forces through a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d and trying to ignite sentiments of separatism in the Army.\n\n\u201cThese people are trying to divide the country on caste lines. Their only goal is to weaken the Indian society as well as people\u2019s unity,\u201d he said.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to see India as a developed country because what suits them is the politics of a weaker and poor India, he said, adding that such \u201cdirty politics\u201d went on for nearly five decades.\n\nModi alleged that though these forces always talk about democracy and the Constitution, they are actually working to divide the country.\n\nThe opposition led by the Congress has repeatedly targeted PM Modi, claiming that India\u2019s democracy and Constitution are \u201cunder attack\u201d by the ruling BJP.\n\nThe PM urged the people to identify this nexus of \u201curban Naxals\u201d, which he said is trying to break the country.\n\nAs Naxalism is ending in jungles, a new model of urban Naxals is raising its head, he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to identify such people who are dreaming of breaking the country. We have to fight these forces. Today urban Naxals target even those who say that you will remain safe if you remain united. We have to identify urban Naxals and unmask them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said due to the government\u2019s efforts in the past 10 years, Naxalism is counting its last breath in India.\n\nRecalling Sardar Patel\u2019s contribution, Modi said that although some people were sceptical of India\u2019s unification after independence, Sardar Patel made it possible. He added that the country will celebrate Patel\u2019s 150th birth anniversary in the next two years.\n\nAccording to Modi, every scheme floated by his government reflects the \u201cspirit of unity\u201d.\n\nHe said benefits were given to every citizen without discrimination, whether it was Har Ghar Jal, Ayushman Bharat, or PM Awas Yojna.\n\nModi said that after the success of the \u2018one nation, one tax\u2019 initiative in the form of GST (Goods and Services Tax), \u2018one nation, one ration card\u2019, and \u2018one nation, one health insurance\u2019 in the form of Ayushman Bharat scheme, his government is now working on \u2018one nation, one election\u2019.\n\nThis approach will strengthen democracy and give optimum outcomes on available resources, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are also moving towards the implementation of \u2018one nation, one secular civil code\u2019. Sardar Patel\u2019s message of unity in society is at the core of this decision. This will eliminate discrimination and strengthen unity among people,\u201d said the PM.\n\nReferring to the abrogation of Article 370, PM Modi said it stood as a barrier in implementing the Constitution in Jammu and Kashmir, where assembly elections were held recently.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 75 years, the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir has taken oath on the Constitution. I see it as a very important milestone for India\u2019s unity. I salute the people of Jammu and Kashmir who gave respect to the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout the ongoing wars in different parts of the world, Modi said India has emerged as \u2018Vishwa Bandhu\u2019 (friend of the world).\n\n\u201cIndia has emerged as Vishwa Bandhu when relations between different countries are getting strained. When differences between nations are growing today, countries are coming closer to India. A new history is being written. The world is watching how India is bringing solutions to its decades-old challenges,\u201d said the PM.",

Feyarets was a free-flying paraglider in his mid-sixties, officials said.\n\nTen paragliders were flying simultaneously and two of them crashed with each other mid-air.

        "text": "Newly appointed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Mumbai vice president Ravi Raja on Thursday expressed his disappointment in the Congress party he recently left, saying that the party does not give tickets to candidates based on merit. Raja said that he has worked diligently from the Sion Koliwada constituency for the last 25 years, but someone else who is relatively new was offered the ticket instead.\u201cI have fought from the Sion Koliwada constituency five times before, the ward beside it is Dharavi. Now you see that the person who has been there for 25 years, that person has not gotten a ticket and the person who has been just a member for the past 4 months that person has gotten a ticket, esa pata chalta hai ki bedh bhav hai (it shows that there is favouritism). It is looks like only one family is responsible for giving out tickets. It has happened in Mumbai and Maharashtra,\u201d he told ANI.\u201cI believe that they don\u2019t give ticket on the basis of merit, so sometimes people rebel,\u201d he added.Further saying that he will work to get the Mahayuti candidate electied from the Mumbai constituencies, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t have any expectations, and today they saw my experience and Ashish Shelar announced me as the Vice President of the BJP Mumbai unit, and I will campaign for the Mahayuti candidate all over Mumbai\u2019s constituencies and work to make them win.\u201dHe further said that the \u2018parivarvaad\u2019 in Mumbai is still going strong within the Congress. \u201cYou can see how someone was favoured before, then someone else was favoured, who was given ticket, it was all in the open. So in a way the parivarvaad within Congress is going strong,\u201d he said. Earlier today in a major blow to Congress in Mumbai, Raja resigned from the party. The letter read, \u201cSince 1980 as a Youth Congress Member, I have served the party with utmost sincerity and dedication and today I am made to believe that my 44 years of service for the Congress party is not respected and hence I take this decision of resigning from my party post.\u201dThe Assembly elections for the 288 Maharashtra Assembly are going to happen in a single phase on November 20, with the counting of votes to happen on November 23",

But today I tell you that the MahaYuti government will come back to power in the state with its Chief Minister.\u201d\n\nThe BJP leader also downplayed Raj Thackeray\u2019s comment that BJP will hold the Chief Minister\u2019s post.\n\nOn rebellion and cross forms filed by the MahaYuti allies in various Assembly constituencies, Deputy CM Fadnavis said, \u201cFiling of nominations was completed on October 30. In some places, we had cross-forms. A meeting was held at Chief Minister Eknath Shinde\u2019s house on Wednesday night in this regard.

        "text": "A Chinese citizen studying at the University of Michigan faces voter fraud and perjury charges after allegedly casting a ballot in the 2024 US election, Michigan authorities announced Wednesday. The 19-year-old student, a legal resident in the US but not a citizen, is accused of using his university ID and other documents to register at a polling place on Sunday before casting a same-day ballot. Local and federal officials are investigating whether this was an isolated incident or part of a broader attempt at election interference, CNN reported.After casting his ballot, the student reportedly contacted local election officials, attempting to retrieve his vote. Michigan\u2019s Secretary of State and Attorney General released a joint statement with Ann Arbour prosecutors following the charges. \u201cInvestigations in multiple states and nationwide have found no evidence of large numbers of non-citizens registering to vote. Even less common is a non-citizen actually casting a ballot. When it does happen, we take it extremely seriously,\u201d Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, both Democrats, stated.The student is charged with one count of illegal voting and one count of perjury. Legal experts indicate that, if convicted, he could face deportation. The charges come amid heightened scrutiny over election integrity, with former President Donald Trump and Republican supporters vocalising concerns over potential voting by non-citizens. Experts have emphasised that non-citizen voting remains extremely rare and is generally detected promptly.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel confirmed her office\u2019s \u201cindependent, parallel investigation,\u201d while Michigan officials work to determine if the incident involved any broader coordinated effort, with federal investigators also assessing the situation.The logistics of reversing the student\u2019s ballot have raised concerns about election secrecy and procedural limitations. Washtenaw County Clerk Lawrence Kestenbaum stated that once ballots are cast in-person and processed by tabulators, they are mixed with others and lack identifying information, reported CNN.\u201cThere\u2019s a box of ballots underneath the tabulator and all of the ballots \u2014 they all look the same \u2026 there\u2019s no way to go back and undo it,\u201d Kestenbaum explained, stressing that such procedures preserve voter anonymity.This security, although essential, has complicated attempts to retract improperly cast ballots. \u201cAn in-person ballot is placed in a tabulator or ballot box, intermingled with other ballots. This is to preserve secrecy, so you can\u2019t go into the ballot later and confirm who a particular person voted for,\u201d noted David Becker, former Justice Department voting rights official and founder of the Centre for Election Innovation & Research, CNN reported.Criticism over Michigan\u2019s lack of citizenship verification rules has arisen among GOP state lawmakers. Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, election law expert at Stetson University, noted, \u201cPlucking out an improperly cast ballot is basically impossible because it looks like every other ballot cast by an eligible voter,\u201d explaining the challenges of the secret ballot.",

No matter whose fault it is, he should say that together with the central government, he will remove the infiltrators,\u201d Sarma told ANI.Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Pratul Shah Deo targeted Hemant Soren, alleging discrepancies in his nomination papers.\u201d There are a lot of differences between CM Hemant Soren\u2019s nominations of 2021 and 2024\u2026in 2021, CM was 45 years old and after 5 years, he became 49 years old, how is it possible? so many assets about which he had mentioned in his 2021 affidavit, have disappeared now,\u201d Deo told reporters in Ranchi.As the Assembly election nears, the BJP has intensified its attack against Hemant Soren.On Wednesday, Sarma slammed Hemant Soren and his wife Kalpana Soren, saying that they focus solely on their family matters, while the BJP prioritizes the welfare of all people in Jharkhand.\u201cThere is an atmosphere of enthusiasm in Jharkhand, and the BJP is set to win with an absolute majority. Hemant Soren and Kalpana Soren only talk about their family, while we speak for the entire Jharkhand,\u201d Sarma told ANI.\u201cWe will secure a strong victory with a good number of votes,\u201d he added.Chief Minister Hemant Soren will contest from the Barhait Assembly constituency.Kalpana Soren, the JMM leader, filed her nomination as her party candidate from the Gandey Assembly constituency earlier in the month.Kalpana Soren is currently representing the Gandey constituency.Elections for 81 seats in the Jharkhand Assembly will be conducted in two phases on November 13 and November 20, with the counting of votes scheduled for November 23.A total of 2.60 crore voters are eligible to cast their votes in Jharkhand, including 1.31 crore male voters and 1.29 crore female voters.

PM Modi is currently on a two-day visit to Gujarat.Visuals captured the Prime Minister attending the Unity of Parade Ground in Kevadia, Gujarat.This time the National Unity Day has brought a wonderful coincidence. On one hand, today we are celebrating the festival of unity, and on the other, it is also Deepawali, PM Modi remarked.He added that the festival of lights not only illuminates the country but is increasingly connecting India with the wider world. His comments followed US President Joe Bidens Diwali celebration at the White House on Wednesday with over 600 notable Indian Americans present.It (Diwali) is being celebrated as a national festival in many countries, he noted.One Nation, One Election to be implemented soon: ModiThe Prime Minister reiterated the Centres commitment to its One Nation, One Election initiative, designed to synchronise all elections in the country on either a single day or within a set timeframe.The proposal, approved by the cabinet earlier this year, is expected to be tabled in the Winter Session of Parliament later this year.We are now working towards One Nation, One Election, which will strengthen Indias democracy, optimise the outcome of Indias resources, and drive new momentum towards a developed India. Today, India is moving towards One Nation, One Civil Code, which is a secular civil code, he stated.Article 370 Buried ForeverDiscussing the 2019 abrogation of Article 370, PM Modi declared that it has been buried forever. Criticising the opposition, he suggested that those who uphold the Constitution often fail to respect it fully.This is my biggest tribute to Sardar Saheb. For 70 years, Baba Saheb Ambedkars Constitution was not implemented in the entire country. Those who chant the name of the Constitution have insulted it so much. The reason was the wall of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 has been buried forever, he asserted.The PM also highlighted that many threats to national security have been neutralised during the last 10 years under his governments leadership. Terrorists masters now know that harming India wont yield results, as India wont spare them, he said.He claimed that several longstanding issues in the northeastern regions of the country have been addressed through dialogue, trust, and development.The Bodo and Bru-Reang agreements have established peace and stability. The National Liberation Front of Tripuras accord has ended long-standing unrest. India is moving forward with peace, development, and prosperity. We have resolved the border dispute between Assam and Meghalaya to a large extent, he explained.PM Modi remarked that, despite growing tensions between many countries globally, India is forming strong ties internationally.Highlighting the alertness and sensitivity of Indian citizens, he said, It is not normal for India to emerge as a vishwabandhu when there is a crisis of relations in different countries of the world. When the distance between one country and another is increasing in the world, then the countries of the world are getting closer to India. This is not normal; this is a new history being created. Today, the world is seeing how India is solving its problems with determination, he said.Mallikarjun Kharge reactsCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge slammed PM Modis remark on UCC and ONOE. Kharge called it impossible.What PM Modi has said, he will not do it, because when it comes in the Parliament, he has to take everybody into confidence then only this will happen. This is impossible, One Nation One Election is impossible...(With ANI inputs)",

Out of 20 promising early-stage companies that participated in the event, Salva Health emerged victorious after impressing judges with their innovative solution.\n\nStartup Battlefield is a renowned program that has helped launch over 1,500 companies since its inception. Past winners include major tech players like Dropbox, Discord, and Cloudflare. This year's event saw 20 carefully selected startups pitch their products in the hopes of winning $100,000 and recognition as the Disrupt Cup champion.\n\nAfter three days of intense presentations and deliberations, five finalists were chosen to demo their solutions once more in front of top venture capital judges. These included Gecko Materials, Luna, MabLab, Salva Health, and Stitch3D. However, it was Salva Health that ultimately took home the prize.\n\nFounded by Valentina Agudelo, Salva Health is tackling a huge gap in breast cancer mortality rates between Latin America and developed nations. Through her own research, Agudelo discovered that late detection is a major factor, as rural areas lack access to diagnostic tools like mammograms. Her vision is to create an affordable portable device capable of early detection.\n\nAgudelo and her team have developed a prototype that shows tremendous potential to save countless lives. Their solution could reach underserved populations and revolutionize cancer screening in vulnerable communities. Judges were impressed by Salva Health's meaningful mission and innovative approach.\n\nThe runner-up was Gecko Materials, created by Capella Kerst. Her company produces a super-strong dry adhesive inspired by gecko feet. It offers numerous advantages over traditional glues and tapes. Kerst showcased the product's abilities, like dangling a full wine bottle from just her pinky.\n\nBoth Salva Health and Gecko Materials are poised to make large impacts with their disruptive technologies. By winning Startup Battlefield, they are positioned to accelerate growth with the $100,000 prize and prestige of the Disrupt Cup title. Their successes also continue the storied history of breakthrough companies launched through this renowned startup program.",

We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala,\" the 78-year-old Trump told rally attendees.\"We will rapidly defeat inflation, and we will very simply make America affordable again,\" Trump said.In a confrontation with China, \u201cwe will kick their ass\u201d, Trump said, asserting, \u201cWe have the greatest military in the world\u201d.He said that if he were the president, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine or Hamas attacked Israel. \u201cUkraine was the apple of his (Putin's) eye, but I said, Vladimir, don't go in,\u201d Trump said.\u201cThis is the city where I was born and raised, and this is the town that taught me that Americans can do anything,\u201d he said, while talking about New York City.\u201cWe bleed the same blood. we share the same hope. we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God,\u201d he said.Elon Musk claimed that he would cut $2 trillion from the current federal budget of $6.5 trillion. \u201cYour money is being wasted,\u201d Musk . \u201cWe're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocket book.\u201d\"There's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico,\" said Tony Hinchcliffe. He went on to mock Hispanics as failing to use birth control, Jews as cheap and Palestinians as rock-throwers.\u201cI don't take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2,\u201d Rudy Guiliani said. \u201cI'm on the side of Israel.\u201dTucker Carlson, a former Fox News talk show host, ridiculed Harris, whose mother is Indian, as \u201ca Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ\u201d.An iconic venue with a dark historyHome to some of the biggest events in history, the 20,000-seat arena has seen iconic performances by the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe and U2, apart from appearances by two popes and \"the Greatest\" Muhammad Ali. Its darker history though includes a far-right rally in 1939, complete with eagles, Nazi insignia and Hitler salutes. Around 20,000 US-based Nazi sympathizers gathered under the banner of \"Americanization,\" denouncing Jewish \"conspiracies\" and then-president Franklin D. Roosevelt, sparking fierce counter-protests outside. A week later, tens of thousands attended a communist rally at the Garden.The Garden has also Democratic and Republican National Conventions since the 1800s, while Marilyn Monroe took the stage in 1962 to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to President John F Kennedy.This Garden was also the site of the 1976, 1980 and 1992 Democratic National Conventions and the 2004 Republican National Convention, according to New York Times. Jimmy Carter referred to the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal as he accepted his nomination. Carter returned in 1980, bagging another nomination. As Democrats met again in 1992, Bill Clinton accepted his nomination. The only Republican Party convention held at Madison Square Garden convention was in 2004, when New York was reeling from the 9/11 attacks at the World Trade Center. \u201cWe will build a safer world and a more hopeful America, and nothing will hold us back,\u201d President George W Bush had said.The arena hosted both Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in their campaigns. Roosevelt beat Hoover, then spoke at the Garden again during his 1936 and 1940 campaigns. \u201cNever before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today,\u201d Roosevelt said. \u201cThey are unanimous in their hate for me \u2014 and I welcome their hatred.\u201dHowever, among the most chaotic political events was the 1924 Democratic Convention, where the party took 16 days and 103 votes to pick a candidate.",

The multi-crore online trading scam in the state had come to light in August this year when investors, who had invested huge amounts of money in 29-year-old Barman's company, complained that he had not paid them the due returns and his office had been closed.Assam Director General of Police GP Singh in a social media post said, \u201cFinally, Dipankar Burman (is) arrested in Goa. The run ends. Congratulations Team @GuwahatiPol.\u201dHe further said, \u201cTotal cash seized Rs 27,06,750 from the house of Dipankar Burman at Goa.\u201dGuwahati's Police Commissioner Diganta Barah said a team led by ACP Amit Mahato made the arrest. Barman is likely to be produced before a court in Goa on Monday and brought to Guwahati on transit remand, a police officer said.Assamese actor Sumi Borah and her photographer husband Tarkik Borah were among those arrested in the scam. Barman's aide Monalisa Das, also an actor, was earlier arrested.It is significant that apart from Deepankar Barman, several online trading scams, all of which appear to have operated independently, came to light in Assam in August this year.The Assam Police registered several cases based on complaints from investors. All these cases were later handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is at present investigating 41 such cases from the state.While over 65 people, including those allegedly running similar scams, have been arrested, Barman was on the run for the past three months. His parents were also arrested in connection with the case.",

        "text": "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition fell short of his declared \"victory line\" of a majority in snap parliamentary elections, media projections showed Monday.AFP examines the options now for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after its worst result since 2009, and the prospects for its bruised leader Ishiba, who only took office on October 1.Why the big loss?Fiercely critical of former prime minister Shinzo Abe and his brand of establishment politics, Ishiba has long played on his relative popularity with voters as the LDP's \"intraparty foe\".But while this won him the party leadership, in the election citizens were more interested in punishing the LDP over a scandal that saw party members pocket money from fund-raisers.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");That the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) recently elected moderately conservative former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda as leader also didn't help.\"I think the majority of Japanese people trust Noda\", said Masato Kamikubo, a politics professor at Ritsumeikan University.\"He is a very stable politician\", Kamikubo said.While the LDP's seats as projected by public broadcaster NHK tumbled to 191, from 259 seats at the last election, the CDP's tally soared to 148 from 96.Komeito, the LDP's coalition partner, slipped to 24 from 32, with new party chief Keiichi Ishii losing his seat.Could the opposition form a government?This is tricky given the fragmented opposition, and memories of its tumultuous rule between 2009 and 2012, analysts say.\"The possibility of a handover of power to the opposition isn't zero, but there are far too many opposition parties for any of them to reach a majority,\" said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.Policy differences and past fallings-out continue to divide and hobble opposition parties, from communists to the liberal CDP, the centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPP) and the \"reformist conservative\" Japan Innovation Party.Can Ishiba find new partners?The prime minister has his work cut out to make it happen.On the campaign trail, CDP leader Noda said it would be \"impossible\" to join forces with the LDP, having been part of previous no-confidence votes.The Japan Innovation Party also remains unconvinced, with its head Nobuyuki Baba dismissing a tie-up with the LDP in its current scandal-tainted state as \"impossible\".The centrist DPP, too, denied it would sign up for the coalition.But its leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, left open the possibility of a \"partial coalition\" where it can offer some flexibility on individual policies it has an affinity with.What about Ishiba's future?Ishiba will likely therefore have to resort to heading a minority administration, seeking support from other parties on a case-by-case basis.But this is likely to destabilise Ishiba's nascent power base, and leave him susceptible to challenges from within his own party.Speculation is growing that Ishiba may be forced to resign to take responsibility for the debacle -- becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in Japan's post-war history.In a nuanced denial of this prospect, though, Ishiba on Sunday night answered in the affirmative when asked by a reporter whether the prime minister intends to follow through on his duties.\"If the ruling coalition or even just the LDP loses its majority, Ishiba will face harsh criticism from party members\", Yosuke Sunahara of Kobe University told AFP before Sunday.But at the same time, the ruling coalition's loss of a majority in the Lower House only goes to lay bare public disenchantment with the political funding scandal.So if \"Ishiba is ousted while the party tries to gloss over the issue, public backlash against the LDP will intensify,\" Sunahara said.\"This makes it difficult for Ishiba's rivals within the party to criticise him.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Toxic air in Uttar Pradesh's Greater Noida, Noida, and Ghaziabad is the result of Pakistan burning stubble, or agricultural waste, a state pollution board official declared this week.\n\nDK Gupta, a Regional Officer with the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board in Greater Noida, blamed the neighbouring country - which is over 500 km from Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad, at its nearest point to the border - for the blanket of polluted air smothering Delhi and the national capital region every winter, fed in significant part by farm fires from UP, Haryana, and Punjab.\n\n\"This is the first time this year that all three cities of Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad saw 'very poor' air quality on the same day. And our neighbouring country... Pakistan... needs to be blamed,\" he was quoted by The Times of India, \"Increasing instances of stubble burning has sent toxic smoke across the border.\"\n\nMr Gupta's remark came after the AQI in the three cities dropped to 'very poor' levels Sunday; Noida recorded an AQI of 304 (on a scale of 500), a deeply worrying spike from 169 a day earlier.\n\nGhaziabad reported a similarly worrying AQI - 324 - and Greater Noida 312.\n\nThe AQI in Delhi was even worse - an average of 352 was recorded Sunday, with the Anand Vihar area reporting a reading of 405 as a layer of acrid and lung-burning smog covered the city.\n\nThis morning the AQI in Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad dropped to 267, 248, and 252, with Delhi reporting an overall reading of 328 and 'very poor' air quality levels.\n\nThe lack of winds had compounded the problem - there was, literally, no breeze in parts of the city Sunday, according to the India Meteorological Department - trapping pollutants in the air.\n\nConcerns over air quality - and the consequent spike in respiratory illnesses - have become a perennial problem for Delhi and neighbouring regions; the Supreme Court last week grilled the central, Punjab, and Haryana governments over non-compliance of anti-pollution laws.\n\nA bench of Justice Abhay S Oka, Justice A Amanullah, and Justice AG Masih, dismissed as \"mere eyewash\" the Punjab and Haryana governments' efforts to stamp out farm fires contributing to the toxic air covering Delhi.\n\nREAD | \"Eyewash\": Supreme Court Raps Punjab, Haryana Over Stubble Burning\n\nThe top court also rapped the union government over \"toothless\" environmental protection laws, observing that laws meant to control pollution, specifically the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) Act of 2021 had been passed sans the administrative machinery to ensure implementation.\n\nAir quality levels will likely drop even further this week as the northern states celebrate Diwali by bursting firecrackers in violation of bans or restrictions imposed by several, including Delhi.\n\nData from the Central Pollution Control Board indicates AQIs have nosedived in and around Delhi on the day after Diwali in seven of the last eight years. The exception was last year after some respite due to rains. Even then, though, the AQI early post-Diwali morning was over 300 or 'very poor'.\n\nMeanwhile, the AQI in Lahore - last year the city with the fifth-most polluted air in the world - crossed a horrific 700 this morning, according to Pak newspaper Dawn. In Pakistan, as in India, the burning of farm waste, or stubble, is a serious problem that leads to polluted and unhealthy air.\n\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala,\" the 78-year-old told roaring supporters wearing trademark red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.Several speakers drew cheers with their own barbs against Harris as well as Puerto Rico and Latinos at the rally in the Democratic stronghold city.Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe took aim at birthrates among Latinos and called the caribbean US territory Puerto Rico \"a floating island of garbage\".(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");'Not a punchline'Harris, 60, seized on the attacks as she competes with the ex-president to win over Puerto Rican communities in the tight battleground states expected to decide the election.\"Puerto Ricans deserve a president who sees and invests in (their) strength,\" Harris said in a clip published on social media alongside Hinchcliffe's comments.Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, noted the state is home to almost half a million Puerto Ricans and nearly three quarters are able to vote.Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican superstar with 18.6 million followers on Instagram, quickly shared a video of Harris's appeal to Puerto Rican voters, along with a clip of Hinchcliffe's remarks.\"This is what they think of us,\" Martin wrote in Spanish. \"Vote for @kamalaharris.\"Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny also showed support for the vice president by sharing one of her videos to his 45.6 million followers on Instagram.Trump's rally at \"The World's Most Famous Arena\" included a surprise appearance by his wife Melania and backers such as billionaire Elon Musk, who has personally hit the campaign trail for the ex-president.However, the venue also hosted a far-right, pro-Hitler rally in 1939, complete with eagles, Nazi insignia and salutes -- an association that has generated darker headlines.Professional wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, who also spoke at the Republican convention in July, rejected criticisms of the rally: \"I don't see any Nazis in here.\"Harris 'boots on ground'Other speeches also drew concern and criticism, including from Stephen Miller, one of Trump's most hard-right advisors.\"America is for Americans and Americans only,\" he shouted into the microphone, after pledging a crackdown on cartels and \"criminal migrants\".While former Fox News host Tucker Carlson took a mocking shot at Harris's background, calling her \"a Samoan Malaysian low I.Q. former California prosecutor\".Harris, meanwhile, charged through a packed day of campaigning in must-win Pennsylvania's largest city, including stops at a Black church, a barbershop and a Puerto Rican restaurant.With barely a week to go, she was leaving nothing to chance in Philadelphia, where she must run up her vote tally to win the battleground state.\"We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets,\" she told a rally in Philadelphia.Sunday's visit was the vice president's 14th trip to Pennsylvania since she jumped to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden's shock withdrawal in July.\"This is the closest and the best opportunity we have to have a female in office who happes to be a Black female,\" Myrda Scott, from Philadelphia, told AFP at one of Harris's rallies in the city.Harris rolled up to Philly Cuts barber shop in the largely Black neighborhood of West Philadelphia to meet residents, before ducking into the African-American-themed Hakim's Bookstore & Gift Shop.\"She's boots to the ground,\" 43-year-old African-American woman Myrda Scott, who runs a financial firm, told AFP as she awaited Harris at a youth basketball rec center rally.On Tuesday, Harris will hold a major rally in Washington near the White House in the park where Trump fired up his supporters before they stormed the US Capitol to try to overturn the 2020 election result.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Jammu, Oct 28 (IANS) As a group of suspected terrorists allegedly fired upon Indian Army vehicles in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)\u2019s Akhnoor area, former J&K Deputy Chief Minister Kavinder Gupta on Monday said that locals, security forces and Intelligence agencies need to remain vigilant at all times. \n\nThe military on Monday launched massive search operations in the area after the terror attack. The target is believed to be the group of terrorists who were involved in the attack on the vehicles of the security forces.\n\nTalking to IANS, Kavinder Gupta said, \u201cYes, I got to know about the attack on an Army vehicle. Thankfully, there were no casualties. But, it is also the responsibility of the locals to report if they find anything suspicious apart from that of the security forces and Intelligence agencies, especially during the festive season.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs per the information received, the Army has surrounded the area and is likely to eliminate the terrorists in the ongoing operation. The gradual rise in such incidents is raising concerns. Both the state and central government should come together to combat terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\nGupta further accused the Congress of doing politics on terror attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Congress always does politics on these issues. They are not at all serious about these issues. The Congress only cares about Pakistan.

        "text": "Stand-up comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s performance at Donald Trump\u2019s Madison Square Gallery in New York city has sparked backlash after he called Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d At Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s rally the comedian and podcast host Hinchcliffe made a racist joke comparing Puerto Rico, which is a US territory referring to it as ocean waste, local media reported.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on, like, I don\u2019t know if you know this but there\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico,\u201d Hinchcliffe said.CNN quoted the comedian making racist comments against the Latinos claiming they \u201clove making babies.\u201d Hinchcliffe\u2019s joke drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, leading Trump\u2019s campaign to sideline itself from his comments.\u201cThis joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement to CNN after the rally.Hinchcliffe also made offensive comments about Latinos, Jews, and Black people, key groups in the upcoming election.Hinchcliffe joked, \u201cI think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico,\u201d referring to a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys know this, but there\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico,\u201d Hinchcliffe said during the rally.\u201cThese Latinos, they love making babies, too. Just know that they do,\u201d Hinchcliffe continued.Trump\u2019s rally included entertainers and MAGA politicians. Many Trump loyalists made it to the speakers\u2019 list ahead of the former president and took the opportunity to spew attacks at some of Trump\u2019s favourite targets. But Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks marred one of Trump\u2019s biggest election rallies.In a post shared on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not funny and it\u2019s not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!\u201d https://x.com/ScottforFlorida/status/1850671024204882016Florida Republican, Rep. Carlos Gimenez who is a close ally of Trump, also criticised Hichcliffe\u2019s statement on X. He wrote, \u201cThis is not a joke. It\u2019s completely classless & in poor taste,\u201d he said on X. \u201c@TonyHinchcliffe clearly isn\u2019t funny & definitely doesn\u2019t reflect my values or those of the Republican Party.\u201dhttps://x.com/CarlosGimenezFL/status/1850692548710318234Responding to Tony Hichcliffe\u2019s remarks, New York GOP Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito said, \u201cI\u2019m proud to be Puerto Rican. The only thing that\u2019s \u2018garbage\u2019 was a bad comedy set. Stay on message.\u201dhttps://x.com/ANTHONYDESPO/status/1850705066610553073Meanwhile, Latin artist Bad Bunny, whose official name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, sharedg on his Instagram story a video of Kamala Harris lashing out at Trump for delaying $20 billion in hurricane relief after the devastating Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the island in 2017.In the video, Harris said, \u201cThere is so much at stake in this election for Puerto Rican voters and for Puerto Rico.\u201dBad Bunny shared another clip from Harris where she says, \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did, and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader.\u201d The popular singer used his platform to highlight Harris\u2019 message and call out Trump\u2019s neglect of the island.Jennifer Lopez, who also has Puerto Rican roots posted a portion of Harris\u2019 video to her Instagram Story, along with a screenshot of Harris\u2019 plan for Puerto Rico.Ricky Martin too shared both Harris\u2019 video and a clip of Hinchcliffe making the racist joke.On Sunday, Trump closed his rally with an 80-minute speech where he vowed to crack down on migration while slamming his Democratic rival and Vice President Kamala Harris. Donald Trump during his speech repeatedly criticised migrants and promised to invoke an 18th-century law to carry out mass deportation operations in the United States of America.In the 2020 Presidential election, Biden narrowly defeated Trump in Michigan by just over 150,000 votes, a stark contrast to Trump\u2019s slim victory in 2016 against Hillary Clinton by less than 11,000 votes.The US presidential polls are scheduled to be held on November 5.",

        "text": "Congress leader and party candidate Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who arrived here on Monday for the election campaigns and spoke to the people. Speaking to the people, Vadra remembered an incident that had occurred with her when she had come to file her nomination and how it made her feel that Wayanad made her feel like she had a mother. \u201cA few days ago, when I had come to file my nomination for the UDF candidate, I had stopped my car and talked to one of the people who told me that his mother wanted to meet me but wasn\u2019t well. I had gone to the house of the person and met his mother. She hugged me as if I was her child, and hugged me like my mother. That is how Wayanad makes me feel like I already have a mother,\u201d she said. Further, she narrates how her visit to Wayanad during the landslide made her realize how a community could come together to help people. \u201cWhen I came here with my brother after the landslides, I understood how a community came together to help people. I saw each one of you help each other. Even the youngest kids who lost their families had dignity. You are courageous and you honor the teachings of all religions. How can I not be the proudest person to get an opportunity to represent Wayanad,\u201d she said. Vadra further spoke on how there were several issues in the state from the needs of the tribal community to MSP of crops, the tourism industry, and unemployment. Speaking on the same, she said \u201cWith these conversations with the people here, I am going to understand the issues faced by you. I understand what my responsibility is. I know you are here because of the love for my brother and I was sad too when he had to leave you all. Today, we are fighting a big battle for the values of our constitution, democracy, and equality.\u201dVadra added that it was the right time to stand for democracy and truth. \u201cIf there is a time to stand up for democracy for the right and the truth, it is now. My expectations are not any lakh number of votes, but it is to look within your heart,\u201d she concluded. Congress party approved Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s candidature on October 15, after the bypoll schedule was announced by the Election Commission of India.Wayanad will go to the polls on November 13 along with voting for bye-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. The first phase of assembly polls in Jharkhand will also be held on November 13",

        "text": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will make a final push to break their bitter deadlock as they head into the last week of the most dramatic and divisive White House race in modern times.Despite a series of historic upheavals in a US election like no other, polls show the Democratic vice president and Republican former president remain neck-and-neck in the polls as Election Day on November 5 looms.Both will pull out all the stops to sway voters, with Harris, 60, giving her closing pitch on Tuesday at the same spot where Trump rallied supporters to protest his election 2020 loss before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.Trump, 78, is also relying on spectacle, and he gave a barnstorming rally at the famed Madison Square Garden arena in his home city of New York on Sunday night to kick off his final effort.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");As the race goes down to the wire, the two rivals will hammer the seven battleground states where just a few thousand voters could decide who governs the world's top superpower.\"It's looking like a toss-up,\" John Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told AFP.A deeply divided United States will make history either way: by electing its first woman president, or by granting Trump a sensational comeback and putting the first convicted felon and oldest ever commander-in-chief into the Oval Office.'Crucial time in history'The choice reflects the starkly different visions offered by Harris, the first female, Black and South Asian vice president, and billionaire tycoon Trump.Harris at first focused on a message of joy and positivity after her shock replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in July, but has since switched to a relentless focus on Trump as a \"fascist\" who threatens democracy and women's reproductive rights.The Democrat has pointedly chosen the Ellipse on the National Mall in Washington for her rally exactly a week before Election Day as it is where Trump spoke to supporters to deny his 2020 election defeat by Biden, shortly before they stormed the Capitol.\"This is a very crucial time in history,\" supporter Kimberly Whittaker said at a Harris rally in Kalamazoo in the battleground state of Michigan.Trump is expected to reject the result in November if he loses again, raising the specter of chaos and violence in an already tense and deeply polarized United States.The Republican has doubled down on his extreme rhetoric, with his right-wing base further fueled by Trump surviving two assassination attempts over the summer.Trump has described migrants as animals, pledged to set up mass deportation camps and threatened to clamp down on domestic opposition, calling them the \"enemy from within.\"He has also ramped up his pledge to \"Make America Great Again\" with a focus on the economy, which like immigration remains a top concern for voters.\"I'm probably going to roll with Trump,\u201d said Drew Roby, a 21-year-old health science student from Arizona, who is Black. \u201cHonestly it was better when he was president.\"READ | Seven States That Will Decide US Presidency'Very competitive'At the heart of the race are the seven most hotly contested swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and -- most crucially -- Pennsylvania.The tightest US presidential election in decades will hinge on who can win over the few remaining undecided voters -- and who can get their base out to vote.Polls also predict a historic gender gap between the candidates, as well as deep faultlines on race and age.In the closing days both campaigns will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on ads while both are also rolling out star surrogates.Bruce Springsteen and Barack and Michelle Obama have turned out for Harris while on the stump for Trump is tech tycoon Elon Musk.But Harris may face a bigger challenge overall.Her campaign had a \"better ground game\" and more money but Trump \"probably still benefits\" from a built-in Republican advantage in the idiosyncratic US Electoral College system, said David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland.\u201cIt's very competitive.

        "title": "Farmers, locals in Krishnagiri face water crisis as toxic foam chokes local dam",
        "text": "About 60 km from Bengaluru city, at the Kelavarapalli dam in Krishnagiri district, it\u2019s not just water that is bubbling over. The dam\u2019s spillways are frothing with toxic chemical foam, which is accumulating in its water channels, creating a health hazard for the residents in the area. As the dam\u2019s gates open, water churns these pollutants into a thick layer of foam that is released into surrounding villages, covering the land with toxic foam that has caused an agricultural crisis.The Kelavarapalli dam is located just 10 km from Hosur, and for five long years, the sight of dense, hazardous foam accumulating and flying from the dam\u2019s reservoir has tormented local residents and farmers. The toxic foam has not just been choking the air with an unbearable stench, it has also been making the water unfit for irrigation and drinking. The foam, polluted by industrial effluents said to be released from factories in Bengaluru, has poisoned the water flowing through the Thenpennai river, disrupting the lives of locals. The Thenpennai river, originating in the Nandi Hills near Bengaluru in Karnataka, flows southward across Karnataka and Tamil Nadu crossing multiple districts. This vital river has, in recent years, become a conduit for industrial waste from factories, reportedly in and around Bengaluru, which has contributed significantly to the contamination problem. Reports indicate that various factories, particularly those dealing in chemical processing, textile manufacturing, and electroplating in the Peenya and Bommasandra industrial areas of Bengaluru, are among those allegedly responsible for releasing untreated effluents into the river. These pollutants have reportedly introduced toxic chemicals into Kelavarapalli dam and worsened the environmental impact on surrounding communities. HEALTH AND AGRICULTURAL DEVASTATIONThe foam is loaded with chemicals that destroy soil quality and damage crops like ragi and carrot, causing harvests to wilt before they can even reach the market. Farmers near the dam, who once relied on its water to irrigate their crops, now say their livelihood is at stake. \u201cThe wastewater from Bengaluru has destroyed everything. We\u2019re getting sick, children are falling ill, and our fields are dying,\u201d says a local resident. Many locals report that crops exposed to the water \u201cburn\u201d or fail to grow at all, leading to huge financial losses. \u201cThe water was clean ten years ago,\u201d another resident explains, \u201cbut now, with all the factories dumping waste, our crops are suffering.\u201d He points out that the foam problem intensifies during the rainy season, when waste from the river flows directly into the dam, further poisoning the water.LOCAL DEMANDS FOR SWIFT ACTIONThe impact extends well beyond the immediate region, with the Kelavarapalli dam supplying water to Tamil Nadu districts like Cuddalore, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Vellore. The toxic foam disaster at Kelavarapalli dam has created an environmental emergency that locals believe will only worsen unless government agencies take swift, decisive action. Desperate for clean water, residents are now demanding urgent intervention from both, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu state governments, to end this nightmare. Residents and farmers cling to the hope that officials will step up to protect their land and their lives from further contamination, bringing an end to this ongoing crisis. A STANDOFF BETWEEN STATESThis ongoing environmental crisis highlights a longstanding feud between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over water pollution. For years, Tamil Nadu officials have called on Karnataka to prevent untreated industrial discharge from polluting rivers that flow downstream, like the Cauvery and Thenpennai. The Tamil Nadu government has repeatedly requested intervention from the Central Water Commission (CWC) to impose stricter regulations on polluting industries across state borders. C Narsimhan, a former MP from Tamil Nadu, emphasises the urgency of the situation, stating, \u201cFor several years, we\u2019ve been trying to stop polluted water from entering the Kelavarapalli Dam. This water, mixed with harmful chemicals, is highly contaminated and unfit for irrigation and drinking. It\u2019s a pathetic situation. Politics aside, we urge the Karnataka government to immediately intervene and fix this issue. I also request the Tamil Nadu government to take appropriate measures to help the local residents.\u201dWhen contacted, KM Sarayu, the District Collector of Krishnagiri, was unavailable for a comment. Without immediate intervention and stricter enforcement, the pollution in the Thenpennai River threatens to turn into an environmental crisis and a full-scale disaster for Tamil Nadu\u2019s farming communities and residents.Published By: Afreen Published On: Oct 28, 2024Tune InMust Watch",

Will this work to the disadvantage of states that have been pioneers in family planning?\" the Congress leader said. It would be most appropriate if an all-party meeting is held soon to get clarity on these two vital issues, Ramesh asserted. The central deputation of Mritunjay Kumar Narayan, currently serving as Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, has been extended till August 2026, paving the way for him to lead the team to carry out the much-delayed decadal census of India. \"The President is pleased to extend the central deputation tenure of Shri Mritunjay Kumar Narayan, IAS (UP:1995), Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, Ministry of Home Affairs beyond 06.12.2024 for a period up to 04.08.2026 or until further orders whichever is earlier. The Headquarters of Shri Mritunjay Kumar Narayan, IAS (UP:1995) will be New Delhi,\" according to an official notification. Narayan is a 1995 batch IAS officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre and is holding the key post under the Ministry of Home Affairs since 2020. The house listing phase of the census and the exercise to update the National Population Register (NPR) were scheduled to be carried out across the country from April 1 to September 30, 2020 but were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The census operation continues to be on hold and the government has not yet announced the new schedule. The government is expected to announce the schedule for the much-delayed exercise soon.",

Immigration is a crisis, our emergency rooms are full,\" he added, echoing Trump's campaign message.New York is where Trump made his name as a playboy property developer, emblazoning skyscrapers with his name and searing himself into popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");On Trump's chances of carrying true blue New York State in the presidential election, Milland said \"it'd be a miracle -- but miracles have happened.\"Shouting and slursThe crowded streets near the venue were not without tension on Sunday.A woman wearing a green North Face puffer jacket screamed abuse at Trump supporters as a film crew captured the scene.Nearby, a uniformed NYPD police officer haggled with a Trump T-shirt seller, sizing up a \"Trump is my savior\" shirt before deciding against a purchase.An anti-Trump demonstrator held up a banner reading \"welcome to your Nazi rally,\" recalling the gathering held by an American Nazi group in 1939 at \"the Garden.\"Undeterred, a Trump supporter in a stylized black and white US flag hooded sweater posed smiling for a photo with his arm around a companion in front of the banner.\"I hope the terrorists kill you,\" one man screamed at the vendor of signature red Trump hats and T-shirts commemorating the former president's narrow escape from a sniper's bullet.Police, Secret Service agents and plainclothes officers swarmed the area, a hive of activity that is home to a rail, subway and bus terminal as well as the 20,000-capacity \"MSG\" arena.\"We hope people will be happy on November 6\" the day after the vote, said retired university professor Salvador, 70, from Barcelona as he and his wife weaved through Trump supporters.\"We wanted to come and see, for me it's interesting. Some people assume that we are against America -- but that's just the leftist politics in Europe,\" he said before heading to the airport to return home.Some tourists stumbled into the melee, checking map apps for how to get away as their children surveyed the scene.Fifty-five-year-old Democratic supporter Laura, who works in the lifestyle sector, had brought her Trump-supporting son to the rally \"and then we can talk about it and discuss it later,\" she said.\"I don't think all Trump people are evil,\" she said. \"Actually the people are a lot more normal than I thought they would be.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The first Kannur district panchayat meeting following the removal of P.P. Divya as district panchayat president descended into chaos on Monday (October 28, 2024) as Opposition members vocally demanded her expulsion and arrest in connection with the death of former Kannur Additional District Magistrate (ADM) Naveen Babu. The Opposition also called for a Vigilance inquiry into alleged corruption involving construction contracts awarded during Ms. Divya\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe uproar began as UDF members, led by Thomas Vekkathanam, sought to introduce an emergency resolution. However, panchayat vice president Binoy Kurian, currently serving as the acting president, blocked the motion, citing procedural rules requiring a seven-day advance notice for resolution submissions.\n\nProtests intensified, with Opposition members insisting on Ms. Divya\u2019s removal from the district panchayat and her arrest. They specifically targeted the scrutiny surrounding Carton India Alliance Pvt Ltd, the sole contractor for several projects since 2021, which reportedly received contracts exceeding \u20b912 crore. \n\nAllegations have emerged that the company, which specialises in pre-fabricated constructions, mismanaged funds in a facility built for stray dogs at Padiyoor. It has been claimed that the facility was budgeted for \u20b963 lakh but only accommodates 50 dogs, despite claims of housing 100.\n\nFurthermore, Carton India has secured contracts for the construction of 30 schools in the 2023-24 fiscal year and 46 schools in 2022-23. \n\nAccusations of inflated costs have also been levelled against the company, with reports indicating that a billboard worth \u20b957,000 was allegedly constructed at a cost of \u20b93 lakh.\n\nAs the protests escalated, the meeting\u2019s agenda was hastily completed, leading to its adjournment.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court recently observed that it can depart from the procedure as well as substantive laws as long as the decision is exercised based on considerations of fundamental, general and specific public policy.\nCiting the Constitution bench decision in Shilpa Sailesh Vs Varun Sreenivasan (2023), a bench of Justices BR Gavai, Aravind Kumar and KV Vishwanathan dissolved the marriage of a couple solemnised in 2013.\nThe bench pointed out that it has also been held that in exercise of power under Article 142(1) of the Constitution, this court has the discretion to dissolve the marriage on the ground of its irretrievable breakdown, and this discretionary power is to be exercised to do \u2018complete justice\u2019 to the parties, when this court is satisfied that the facts established show that the marriage has completely failed and there is no possibility that the parties will cohabit together, and continuation of the formal legal relationship is unjustified.\nThe matter before the apex court arose out of a transfer petition filed by the wife seeking shifting of the proceedings pending under the Hindu Marriage Act before the court of the Principal Judge, Family Courts, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, to the Family Court, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi.\nThe husband had filed a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for grant of decree of divorce alleging that the petitioner-wife had breached the trust for being in a relationship with another man.\nHaving secured a job as a teacher in July 2022, the man alleged that his wife had completely neglected him. Whereas the petitioner-wife contended that on account of the husband having neglected her and the daughter and having failed to take care of them, she was left with no other option but to return to her parental home and she had been residing there since 2019.\nThe matter was referred to mediation by the Supreme Court but it did not fructify into settlement. The parties also fairly admitted that the marriage had irretrievably broken down.\n\u201cIn the factual scenario, we are of the considered view that the exercise of the power under Article 142(1) of the Constitution is warranted in the facts and circumstances of the case and also to do complete justice between the parties particularly in the background of this court having noted herein that marriage between the petitioner and the first respondent has completely failed and the parties had not cohabitated from 2019 till date and there being no possibility that the parties will cohabitate in future. Hence, continuation of the legal relationship would be unjustified and would not subserve the interest of the parties,\u201d the bench said.\nThe court felt that the continuation of the proceedings before the trial court could only be an ordeal that both the parties would have to undergo.\n\u201cWe are of the considered view that marriage between the petitioner and respondent having irretrievably broken down, exercise of power by this Court under Article 142 of Constitution of India is called for in the facts and circumstances obtained and also keeping in mind that petitioner and first respondent are quite young namely 32 years and 38 years respectively and have future ahead of them,\u201d the bench said.\nThe court also noted that a settlement agreement was arrived at as a sum of Rs 7,00,000 was deposited by the husband in the name of the minor daughter. It directed the man to pay a sum of Rs 13 lakh to the wife to meet the ends of justice. \nThe court accordingly dissolved the marriage by granting a decree of divorce in exercise of the power vested under Article 142(1) of the Constitution.",

        "text": "Wayanad, Oct 28 (IANS) Congress-led UDF candidate Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday began her byelection campaign in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency by launching a scathing attack on the Centre, alleging that the values of the Constitution are constantly being subverted. She urged the people to vote for peace, democracy and equality in India.\n\nOn Monday, she has public meetings at three of the seven Assembly constituencies that fall in the Wayanad Lok Sabha and on Tuesday she will address four meetings before leaving for Delhi.\n\nHer first stop was at Meenagandi and then at Panamaram and the topic at both meetings was the same as she reminded the people about the need for voting for the Congress.\n\n\u201cYou know the times we are living in when the BJP is in Centre, where fear, anger and mistrust are spread among the people. You have seen the attacks against minorities and seen what has happened in Manipur. The values of the Constitution are thwarted and policies after policies are made to make the friends of the PM happy\u2026Today we are fighting a very big battle and Rahul Gandhi is leading that battle. All of us are fighting for the values of this country to be built. We are fighting for the values of our constitution. Today we are fighting for democracy equality, and truth and each one of you is an important soldier for this. So please understand that along with me you also have a responsibility towards the country. As if there is a time to stand up for truth and democracy the time is now,\u201d said Priyanka Gandhi.\n\n\u201cEach one of you with one vote of yours can stand up for it. On my way, journalists asked me what my expectations were as to how many lakhs votes I would get. But I expect to look into your hearts and recognize what has happened as your vote is for peace, democracy equality for India. If you choose to elect me as your MP, I will work as hard as possible to do my best. I will stand side by side with you and raise your issues. You give me your trust and I will not let you down,\u201d said the Congress general secretary.\n\nShe said the love the people in Wayanad are giving her makes her hugely indebted to all. She then recalled an episode with Mother Teresa and related it with the way she walked into the house of an ex-serviceman\u2019s home last Tuesday and met his aged mother Thresia when she came to file her nomination.\n\n\u201cWhen I was sitting next to Thresia who gave me the rosary, it reminded me of when I was 19 years old, my father had just died and Mother Teresa came to meet my mother. On that day I had a fever and was in my room. She wanted to meet me and put her hand on my head and just like Thresia gave a rosary in my hand, she also did the same. She might have realized that since my father had died I was sad and going through troubled times. Mother Teresa said to me, \u201cyou come and work with me. So I went to work with the sisters of Mother Teresa in Delhi, I started to teach the children a bit of English and Hindi. This is the first time am speaking about this in public but there is a context\u2026So my job was to teach the children and on Tuesday we washed the bathrooms, cleaned the vessels, taught the children to paint, and took them outside. By working with them I understood the pain and trouble they faced and also what it meant to serve. Then I learned how a community can help,\u201d said Priyanka Gandhi.\n\n\u201cWhen I came here after the terrible landslide, I immediately recognized how the way the community came together to help the suffering. I saw each one of you did whatever you could do to help irrespective of religion and profession. Many times in situations like these, we see human greed, people taking away things, but did not see that in Wayanad. Even the youngest of children had dignity and made me proud. You are a courageous people, you fought against the British and it\u2019s there in your history,\u201d said Priyanka.\n\n\u201cYour values are strong and belief in social justice and you honor the values of all religions. How can I be not the proudest person of the opportunity to represent the people of Wayanad? If you elect me it will be the greatest honour for me,\u201d said Priyanka and was greeted with a big roar.\n\nShe then pointed out that there was no compassion for the farmers who toil day and night in the heat. \u201cThere is no understanding of the traditions of the tribals and their lands are taken away and given to industrialists. In Wayanad, a strong farming community is engaged in the cultivation of various crops. Again and again, there are promises for MSP, but it has not yet come true. The tourism industry can be strengthened but nothing has been done. Big businesses flourish, but small traders are being tormented by numerous taxes. Unemployment is at an all-time high. Parents work hard to educate their children but no future for them,\u201d said Priyanka.\n\n\u201cNew opportunities have to be created for sports-loving people of Wayanad. Over the years change in cultivation has taken place and there is water shortage. Tribal communities need access to healthcare and better education. I was told by girls when I stopped and asked them what\u2019s the single biggest need, was a medical college. I know my brother has been fighting for it and will fight harder for this. Another gentleman said he wants the night travel ban to be lifted and also about the man-animal conflict,\u201d added Priyanka.\n\n\u201cSo now I am beginning to get an understanding of what the needs of the people are. This is just the beginning and I want to come and meet you and hear from all of you directly to find your problems. I understand what my responsibilities are. I also know that you came and stood to hear me because of your love for my brother. I am his sister and I know what a heavy heart he had when he left you. You gave him love when everyone turned their back on him. It\u2019s you, each one of you, who gave him the courage to travel across the country for unity and peace. He has a deep relationship with you all\u2026 he treats you as a family,\u201d said Priyanka.\n\nWayanad goes to the polls on November 13.\n\nThe by-election became a necessity after her brother Rahul Gandhi vacated the seat after retaining the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat in the 2024 general elections.\n\nThe CPI has fielded veteran former legislator Sathyan Mokeri who finished a close third during the 2014 general elections in Wayanad while the BJP has brought in young Kozhikode Corporation party Councillor Navya Haridas, a former software engineer who quit her job and plunged into full-time politics.\n\nRahul Gandhi won the 2019 general elections with a margin of 4.60 lakh from Wayanad which came down to 3.64 lakh in the 2024 general elections.",

It read: \u201cZionists are making a miscalculation with respect to Iran. They don\u2019t know Iran. They still haven\u2019t been able to correctly understand the power, initiative, and determination of the Iranian people.\u201d\n\nKhamenei\u2019s office maintains multiple X accounts on his behalf, through which the Iranian leader issues messages in several languages.\n\nThe second message uploaded on the Hebrew-language account on Sunday referred to Israel launching air strikes targeting military bases in Iran amid heightened tensions in West Asia. The strikes, which left four soldiers dead, were in retaliation for the launch of at least 180 missiles into Israel on October 1 by Iran. This was the first time that Israel claimed responsibility for an attack on Iran.\n\nIranian defence forces said that bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran had been hit but claimed that the attacks were \u201csuccessfully countered\u201d.\n\nHowever, satellite images showed that some of the buildings that suffered damage were located in Iran\u2019s Parchin military base, AP reported. The International Atomic Energy Agency suspects that Iran may have used the site in the past to test explosives that could trigger a nuclear weapon. Iran, on its part, has maintained that its nuclear programme is peaceful.\n\nAnother military base seen to have suffered damage as per satellite imagery was at Khojir. Analysts believe that the base hides an underground tunnel system and sites where Iran is manufacturing missiles.\n\nIran\u2019s missile attack on Israel\n\nIran said it launched the missiles at Israel on October 1 in retaliation for Tel Aviv having killed leaders of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, the Palestinian militant group Hamas and the Iranian military.\n\nHezbollah is an ally of Hamas. Both organisations are backed by Iran.\n\nHezbollah and Israel have exchanged near-daily strikes for over 10 months amid Tel Aviv\u2019s war on the besieged Palestinian territory of Gaza.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military offensive against Gaza began on October 7 after Hamas launched an incursion into southern Israel, killing 1,200 persons and taking over 200 hostages. Israel has been carrying out unprecedented air and ground strikes on Gaza since then. The attacks have killed more than 43,000 persons, including nearly 16,700 children.",

        "text": "Chennai: The AIADMK has demanded that Tamil Nadu\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin adhere to the dress code mandated by a Tamil Nadu government order.\r\n\r\nAIADMK legal cell secretary and former Tamil Nadu MLA, S. Imbadurai, stated on Monday that the government dress code, which applies to government employees, should be followed by the Deputy Chief Minister as well.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tamil Nadu Government Order (G.O.), male employees are required to wear shirts with formal pants or dhoti, in keeping with Tamil culture, or other traditional Indian attire.\r\n\r\nFemale employees must wear sarees or salwar suits.\r\n\r\nImbadurai also criticised Udhayanidhi Stalin for wearing a T-shirt displaying the DMK flag and the rising sun symbol of the party, which he wore at official events.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Chief Minister\u2019s choice of informal attire has drawn strong criticism from the Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nA petition has also been filed in Madras High Court, challenging Udhayanidhi Stalin\u2019s casual attire at official functions as unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIn the petition, advocate M. Sathyakumar argued: \u201cDisplaying the DMK party symbol at government functions violates Constitutional provisions and the Representation of the People Act, 1951. I assert that these actions are unconstitutional and illegal, calling for adherence to the dress code and separation between political affiliations and government duties.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe petitioner further contended that, as a public servant, Udhayanidhi should not wear party symbols in government meetings or while performing official duties, as it could amount to indirect solicitation for votes, which is legally inappropriate.\r\n\r\nHe also argued that wearing casual attire, such as a T-shirt, jeans, and informal footwear, at official events violates the formal dress code prescribed by the government.\r\n\r\nUdhayanidhi Stalin, seen as the heir apparent in the DMK, has been prepared to succeed his father M. K. Stalin as Chief Minister. Since becoming a minister, he has been promoted to Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. He was also in charge of the DMK\u2019s campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, actively travelling across the state as a lead campaigner for the party.",

Following Ms. Jaiswal and her family\u2019s altercation with Mr. Singh on September 15, the BJP worker\u2019s wife filed a police complaint over the alleged assault. \n\n\u201cWe are telling you the story of Roshni Jaiswal, a daughter of Varanasi, the Parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who gave the slogan \u2018Beti Bachao\u2019. A man named Rajesh Singh has been following Roshni for four years and threatening to rape her,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith no action taken against Singh despite repeated complaints, Roshni Jaiswal went to his house with her husband and brother and there was a scuffle. Roshni slapped Singh a couple of times after which her family had been put in jail,\u201d Ms. Lamba added. \n\nThe Mahila Congress chief said that while Mr. Singh is roaming free, Ms. Jaiswal\u2019s family is in jail and she is running from pillar to post, with her nine-year-old child and old parents, in search of justice. \n\nMs. Phogat said that she can assure every woman that the fight the women wrestlers and their associates began on the streets has brought her to the Legislative Assembly and she would stand by any daughter who feel something wrong is happening to her.\n\nShe said Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and a \u201ccriminal\u201d like Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh may forget about the power of the 50% population but women will fight. \u201cWe have to stand with Rohini Jaiswal and in all such cases, we will have to take this fight to a logical conclusion. The whole country is seeing the policies of the BJP, their attitude towards women, the fight is on. It will continue till Rohini Jaiswal gets justice and those who made indecent remarks against her are punished,\u201d Ms. Phogat added. \n\nLast week, raising the issue, Congress\u2019 social media head, Supriya Shrinate had asked, \u201cDoes the police administration want a woman to silently bear the threat of rape?\u201d \n\nCountering her claims, Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Harischandra Srivastava had said that the Yogi Adityanath administration and the law treats everyone equally and that no individual has the right to take the law into their own hands.",

        "text": "Tsewang Gyalpo Arya, the Dalai Lama\u2019s representative for Japan and East Asia, wrapped up his official tour of the Philippines, emphasising the ongoing struggle for Tibetan autonomy and human rights. According to a press release from the Central Tibetan Administration, Arya\u2019s visit included lectures and discussions centred on the Tibetan issue, reflecting the Philippines\u2019 historical support for Tibet\u2019s quest for freedom since the 1960s.During a meeting with Congressman Adrian Amatong, Arya highlighted the significance of the recent U.S. Resolve Tibet Act, advocating for similar legislative measures in the Philippine parliament. He underscored the urgency of raising awareness about the Tibetan plight, noting that many Filipinos resonate with Tibet\u2019s non-violent struggle for justice and freedom. Amatong echoed this sentiment, affirming that the Filipino spirit of freedom aligns closely with Tibet\u2019s aspirations.According to CTA, Arya also held discussions with Wallace Chow, representative of the Taipei Economic & Cultural Office, where they explored the interconnectedness of freedom and democracy in resolving issues related to Tibet, Taiwan, and China. Both representatives expressed solidarity in promoting these ideals globally, reinforcing a shared commitment to supporting oppressed communities.Through these interactions, Arya aimed to garner greater international support for Tibet, urging continued advocacy and diplomatic engagement to address the ongoing conflict with China. His visit reaffirmed the importance of collective efforts in the global fight for human rights and autonomy.The Tibetan issue revolves around the political, cultural, and human rights challenges facing Tibet, particularly since its incorporation into the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1950. Following the annexation, the Tibetan government was forced into exile, with the 14th Dalai Lama becoming a symbol of the struggle for Tibetan autonomy and rights.The Chinese government reportedly enforces strict control over the region, leading to widespread allegations of cultural suppression, religious repression, and human rights abuses, including restrictions on language and spiritual practices. While many Tibetans and international advocates seek genuine autonomy or independence, China maintains that Tibet is an inseparable part of the nation. This ongoing conflict not only affects the lives of Tibetans but also has significant implications for global politics, as various countries navigate their diplomatic relationships with China while addressing human rights concerns in Tibet.",

        "title": "Thai court drops case over deaths of Muslim protesters in 2004",
        "text": "BANGKOK: A court in southern Thailand on Monday dropped a case against former state security personnel and officials over the deaths of 85 Muslim protesters in 2004, saying none of the suspects had been apprehended. Families of the victims of what is known as the Tak Bai massacre in April accused seven soldiers and government officials of murder, attempted murder and unlawful detention. The Narathiwat Provincial Court formally accepted the case in August. While there was enough evidence for an indictment, the court said the case was unable to proceed as no suspects were arrested and brought to the court, and as a result, the 20-year statute of limitations expired on Friday. The court's statement noted that its order is not a dismissal of the charges against the suspects, as they \"had never entered the legal proceedings, but fled until the statute of limitations expired\". One of those named is Pisal Wattanawongkiri, commander of the 4th Army Region at the time of the incident. At the time of indictment in August, he was a lawmaker of the ruling Pheu Thai party. The party said he filed a medical leave to seek treatment abroad, and resigned from the party earlier this month. Other suspects were also believed to have left the country after the indictment. The case earned notoriety because of the manner in which the victims died. On October 25, 2004, thousands of protesters gathered at the police station in Narathiwat's Tak Bai district to demand the release of six Muslim men who had been detained several days earlier. The detainees, members of an official village defense force, were accused by police of handing over weapons to Muslim insurgents, but reporting them stolen. Seven of the protesters were shot dead after the demonstration turned violent. Around 1,300 of them were later rounded up, had their hands tied and were loaded onto trucks, stacked like firewood. By the time the vehicles reached an army base where they were taken to be detained, 78 had died of crushing or suffocation. Several others were seriously injured or became disabled due to crushing. The deaths occurred shortly after a Muslim separatist insurgency erupted in Thailand's southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala, the only ones with Muslim majorities in the Buddhist-dominated nation. Muslim residents have long complained of being treated like second-class citizens in Thailand, and separatist movements have been periodically active for decades. Heavy-handed crackdowns have fuelled the discontent. Fighting continues to this day, but at a lower level. Speaking to reporters outside the court, Ratsada Manooratsada, who represents the victims' families, said while the outcome was expected, the legal team will continue to pursue other alternatives, including investigations into whether police officers had purposefully delayed the proceedings until the case had almost expired. \"The statute of limitations in memory of the people will never have an expiration date,\" he said. The UN special rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council issued a statement last week calling for the investigation and the pursuit of justice to continue even after the statute of limitations expired, as \"a failure to investigate and bring perpetrators to justice is itself a violation of Thailand's human rights obligations\". Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra last week said that it wasn't possible to extend the validity of the case. She offered an official apology to those affected, insisting that all relevant agencies had done what they could to provide justice. \"We will do our best to prevent such an incident from happening again,\" she said.",
        "summary": "A court in southern Thailand dropped charges against ex-state security personnel and officials over the 2004 Tak Bai massacre, where 85 Muslim protesters died. The court attributed the decision to the suspects evading arrest, causing the 20-year statute of limitations to expire. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra apologized, vowing to prevent future incidents.",

These platforms are required to promptly remove unlawful content to maintain public order and security.\r\n\r\nInstances of malicious acts, such as hoax bomb threats targeting airlines, pose a potential threat to public order and state security. Such threats, while affecting a large number of citizens, also destabilise the country's economic security.\r\n\r\nThe scale of spread of these hoax bomb threats has been observed to be alarmingly unrestrained, facilitated by social media functions like \"forwarding,\" \"re-sharing,\" \"re-posting,\" and \"re-tweeting.\" This misinformation significantly disrupts public order, airline operations, and the security of air travellers.Government Advisory Mandates MeitY Approval on AI Models: Report\r\n\r\nIn this context, intermediaries, including social media platforms, have a due diligence obligation under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (\"IT Act\") and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (\"IT Rules, 2021\"), to promptly remove misinformation that impacts public order and state security, according to an official release.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry has stressed that intermediaries, including social media platforms, hold key responsibilities. They must swiftly remove misinformation and disable access to unlawful content, such as hoax bomb threats, within specified time limits. Furthermore, intermediaries are required to report any activities that could jeopardise India's unity, integrity, sovereignty, security, or economic stability under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.

Apart from that, one call was made by Lawrence Bishnoi himself. Yadav shared evidence supporting these allegations, including seven voice-recorded calls, four screenshots of WhatsApp call logs with pictures of Lawrence Bishnoi, and a press statement by Mayank Singh, who is also said to be a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang.\n\nYadav claimed that the caller also said that Lawrence Bishnoi called him after getting the jammer of Sabarmati Jail Ahmedabad switched off for 10 minutes but he did not pick up the phone.\n\n\u201cIs it an easy task to get the jammer switched off?

A criminal sitting in jail is challenging the government and killing people and everyone is a silent spectator,\u201d Pappu Yadav said.\n\nHe further said that Bishnoi was instrumental in the murder of Punjabi Singer Sidhu Musewala and chief of Karni Sena and now he was involved in the murder of an industrialist cum politician Baba Siddiqui.\n\n\u201cIf the law allows, I will destroy the entire network of this cheap criminal like Lawrence Bishnoi within 24 hours,\u201d Pappu Yadav said on October 13.\n\nFollowing the threatening call of Lawrence Bishnoi, Pappu Yadav has written a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah seeking enhancement of the security.\n\nPappu Yadav has voiced concerns over his safety, detailing past instances of threats and attacks, which he claims have targeted both him and his family.\n\nHe stated that in 2015, he received threats from the Nepalese Maoist gang and caste-based gangs of Bihar, prompting the Central government to provide him with Y-plus category security. However, in 2019, his security level was downgraded, and since then, he has experienced harassment on social media, with individuals allegedly using Facebook to issue insults and threaten him with dire consequences.\n\nYadav reported that he formally complained to the Chief Minister of Bihar, the Home Secretary, and the Director General of Police, but claims these authorities took no action in response.\n\nHe believes his recent statements criticizing Lawrence Bishnoi have now put him under renewed threat, and he has submitted all related documents to back his complaint. Yadav further criticized both the Bihar and Central Home Ministries for what he describes as their lack of responsiveness to his situation, expressing frustration over the absence of a proactive approach to his security concerns. \u201cIt seems that they will be active in expressing condolences only after my murder,\u201d Yadav writes in his letter.",

He emphasized the need for open discussions that allow the LDP to \"humbly accept individual policies\" from lawmakers outside the coalition.The election results dealt a significant blow to the LDP and its coalition partner, Komeito, which secured only 191 and 24 seats, respectively, falling well below Ishiba's \"victory line\" of a majority and marking a substantial decline from their previous tallies of 259 and 32.Ishiba, who assumed office on October 1 and called the snap election to strengthen his mandate, now faces a divided legislature and the prospect of leading a minority government.The opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, emerged as a major beneficiary of the election, with its seat count increasing from 96 to 148. The CDP positioned itself as a more reliable alternative, taking advantage of the public's frustration with the LDP's management of the funding scandal.The scandal, which involved allegations of LDP officials misappropriating funds from party-sponsored events, played a significant role in influencing voter opinion and ultimately contributed to the ruling coalition's electoral setback.",

        "text": "Tehran: The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has warned Israel it would face \u201cbitter consequences\u201d after its attack on Iranian military sites, local media said on Monday. Guards chief Hossein Salami, quoted by Tasnim news agency, said Israel had \u201cfailed to achieve its ominous goals\u201d with its air raids on Saturday. Israel struck military sites in response to Tehran's October 1 missile attack, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. Salami said the Israeli attack was a sign of \u201cmiscalculation and helplessness\u201d as Israel battles Tehran-aligned militants in Gaza and Lebanon. \u201cIts bitter consequences will be unimaginable\u201d for Israel, Salami warned according to Tasnim. Iranian media have played down the severity of the Israeli operation, signalling what analysts say is the Islamic republic's reluctance to escalate further. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday said that Israel's attack which killed four soldiers \u201cshould neither be exaggerated nor minimised\u201d. He described it as a \u201cmiscalculation\u201d on Israel's part. President Masoud Pezeshkian said: \u201cWe do not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country.\u201dIran \u201cwill give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime,\u201d Pezeshkian added. Also on Sunday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated Iran's \u201cright to respond\u201d, also saying that Tehran had \u201creceived indications\u201d hours before Israel's attack. US news website Axios on Saturday said Israel has \u201csent message to Iran\u201d ahead of its attack and warned it \u201cagainst a response\u201d.",

After the results, our party, the CPI, has appealed to all INDIA bloc parties for serious introspection on working with mutual trust and mutual accommodation at the time of seat sharing.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the expected seat-sharing arrangement did not materialise in Jharkhand, where the CPI and CPM were not accommodated by the Congress-Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) alliance.\n\nIn Maharashtra, however, the CPI leader acknowledged progress, crediting senior leader Sharad Pawar\u2019s role in the allocation process.\n\n\u201cHe took a very accommodative position, and they allotted one seat to the CPI. We hope other parties also receive seats, and we\u2019ll have to wait and see the final outcome,\u201d he remarked.\n\nEmphasising the alliance\u2019s main objective, he concluded, \u201cOur primary objective must be to defeat the BJP and its allies. For that, unity is imperative, it is not just an option, but an imperative. All secular democratic parties under the INDIA banner must work unitedly with a proper seat-sharing arrangement.\u201d\n\nThe INDIA bloc, led by the Congress, is facing internal friction as several regional partners express dissatisfaction with the Congress\u2019 management of the alliance, especially ahead of the Jharkhand and Maharashtra Assembly elections.\n\nThe voters from Maharashtra will be casting their ballots on November 20 in a single phase. The counting of votes is scheduled for November 23.",

Next week, the representatives of Airports Authority of India (AAI) are scheduled to visit the district to inspect the airport location.\n\nThe airport was sanctioned during the regime of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 2014-2019 and land acquisition began. A detailed project report (DPR) had also been prepared, but the works did not begin. SCL-Turbo Consortium Pvt. Ltd. had signed the concession agreement in September 2017 to develop the international airport under Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) mode.

        "text": "As the campaigning for the byelections in Uttar Pradesh gathered momentum in Mainpuri district on Sunday (October 27, 2024), senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Shivpal Yadav said the PDA will \"neither get divided, nor fall.\" He added that one who makes such a remark will have to pay the price later, apparently attacking the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP.) \n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ghiror area of the district while campaigning for party candidate from Karhal seat Tej Pratap Yadav, Shivpal Yadav said the BJP will be defeated on all the nine bypoll-bound seats.\n\nCongress lends \u2018unconditional support\u2019 to SP in bypolls for nine U.P. Assembly seats\n\n He also exuded confidence in Tej Pratap Yadav's victory with a large margin and hoped that the administration ensured a transparent election.\n\n Responding to a question on the \"batenge toh katenge (divided we fall)\" remark of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the senior SP leader said,\"PDA na toh batega, na hi katega (The PDA will neither get divided, nor fall).\" The term PDA, which stands for 'Pichhade' (backward classes), 'Dalit' and 'Alpasankhyak' (minorities), was coined by Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.\n\n Shivpal Yadav's statement on Sunday (October 27, 2024) comes close on the heels of a comment by Lok Sabha MP from Mainpuri Dimple Yadav, who last week said Yogi Adityanath's call to Hindus to stay \"united\" was an attempt to distract the people from their real concerns.\n\n Speaking to reporters in Mainpuri, Dimple Yadav had said, \"People of Uttar Pradesh know it well that such statements are meant to divert their minds and such statements will be aired in future.\" \n\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on September 23 had reiterated his \"batenge toh katenge\" remark, saying it was disunity which led to the \"invaders destroying the Ram temple\" in Ayodhya.\n\n \"Hum bate the, toh kate the (when divided, we fell),\" he had said at an event in Mirzapur, referring to the Ayodhya dispute and urging people to stay united.\n\n Earlier, Mr. Adityanath had made the same remark in reference to the violence in Bangladesh after the fall of Shekh Hasina-led government and alleged atrocities against Hindus. Karhal is just four kilometres from Akhilesh Yadav's native village Saifai in Etawah district. The constituency forms part of Dimple Yadav's Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat.\n\n The Karhal seat has been a stronghold of the SP since 1993. In the 2002 Assembly election, the seat went to the BJP's Sobaran Singh Yadav but he later joined the SP. The bypoll in Karhal was necessitated on the seat after resignation of Akhilesh Yadav on being elected from Kannauj as MP.\n\n Earlier, addressing an election meeting, Shivpal Yadav said, \"We want the instructions of the Election Commission to be followed completely. Elections should be held in a fair and transparent manner. Every voter should get a chance to vote without fear.\" He also said that many complaints are being received related to the byelections.\n\nThe party has demanded immediate transfer of three officials from Moradabad to ensure that the bypoll in Kundarki in the district is held in a free and fair manner without any fear. The SP on Thursday announced candidates for all nine seats for the November 13 Uttar Pradesh Assembly bypolls. The last date for filing nominations was October 25. The counting of votes will take place on November 23.",

        "text": "A video showing Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole talking about a statement purportedly made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, and asking what is wrong with the statement, is being widely shared on social media.The video: The video, which shows Patole talking about Gandhi, \u201cWhat did he say there? That when everyone in our country is on equal footing, we will think about reservations. What is wrong about this?\u201dThe claim: The clip is being shared by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) functionaries, such as IT Cell Head Amit Malviya, who said that Rahul Gandhi said he, or the Congress party, said they \u201cwill remove reservations.\u201dHe added that this statement was endorsed by Patole.(Archived versions of more claims can be seen here and here.)But\u2026?: The claim is false. Rahul Gandhi did not say that he or the Congress party will \u201cremove reservations,\u201d neither did Patole endorse such a statementFact-Check: This Video Doesn\u2019t Show Saudi Sheikh Praising Israel PM NetanyahuHow did we find out the truth?: Using the term \u2018Rahul Gandhi remove reservations\u2019, we ran a keyword search on Google.This led us to a September 2024 report by Livemint, which said that Gandhi had attempted to clarify the \u2018ending reservations\u2019 remark amid backlash from the BJP.The report mentioned that the controversy started over a statement he made during a session at Georgetown University in Washington DC in the USA.Taking a cue from this, we looked for the interview on YouTube, and found an hour long version of it on Rahul Gandhi\u2019s verified YouTube channel.We went through this discussion, which touched upon caste issues, the Uniform Civil Code, and the INDIA bloc, among other issues.Towards the end of the video, Gandhi took questions from the students and faculty in attendance. The viral claim: At the 53:28 mark, one of the students asked him about reservations and the caste system, asking for his and the Congress party\u2019s thoughts on reservations being a permanent solution to issues that \u201cnecessitate\u201d the system.She asked the leader, \u201c At what point would we as a society, but more importantly, you and your party, look at caste-based reservations as a treatment of symptoms and not the actual problem?\u201dIn response, he asked her why she thinks the system is a treatment of symptoms, and she told him that they were initially introduced because of lack of equal access to opportunity, which \u201cis where the lag is.\u201dGandhi told her that despite Dalits, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) making up 73 percent, they only represent a small fraction of the people in positions of power. He elaborated that as per \u201cfinancial numbers, tribals get 10 paise out of 100 rupees; Dalits get 5 rupees out of 100 rupees, and OBCs get a similar number,\u201d factually showing that \u201cthey\u2019re not getting participation.\u201dGandhi adds that the issue is that \u201c90 percent of India is not able to play,\u201d and that if one were to list \u201cevery single business leader\u201d in India, only one out of the top 200 would be one person from the OBC community. \u201cThey\u2019re 50 percent of India, but we\u2019re not treating the symptom.\u201d\u201cNow, it [reservation] is not the only tool. There are other tools,\u201d he said, but added that they \u201cwill think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place. And India is not a fair place.\u201d One can also view the full interview on Georgetown University\u2019s YouTube channel.Conclusion: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi did not say that he, or the Congress party, would \u201cremove reservations.\u201dDid Xi Jinping & Angela Merkel Refuse To Shake Hands With PM Modi?

        "text": "Home NewsIt\u2019s time for Indian Navy to establish its presence and growing reputation in S-E Asia & Indo-Pacific\n\n The Indian Navy explains that naval diplomacy involves using naval forces to support a country\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n (Image courtesy: https://wallpapercave.com) \n\n New Delhi: In May 2024, the Indian Navy\u2019s Eastern Fleet visited Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei as part of a goodwill mission. The visits aimed to strengthen friendship and cooperation between India and these countries, building positive relationships, and promoting mutual understanding.\n\nDuring its operational deployment to the South China Sea, the Indian Navy visited several Southeast Asian nations. This mission highlighted India\u2019s commitment to strengthening maritime partnerships and expanding cooperation with regional countries. \nThese visits have been happening regularly for many years. \nThe Indian Navy explains that naval diplomacy involves using naval forces to support a country\u2019s foreign policy. It helps demonstrate strength and a willingness to discourage potential threats. Along with its military and law-enforcement functions, India leverages its navy as a key instrument to protect national interests and pursue foreign policy goals\u2014both in maritime regions and beyond. \nThe Diplomat quotes Commander PK Ghosh as saying that trips by the Indian Navy to friendly ports are an important part of India\u2019s foreign policy. Even though these visits are mostly ornamental and only happen during times of peace, they are very important for strengthening marine ties and sending strategic messages to both friendly, and potential, enemy countries. \nScholar Barry Blechman says that just deploying a naval force\u2014no matter its size, goals, or actions\u2014in a region is a political strategy, even if there are no specific ongoing diplomatic efforts. A country that positions its navy in an area during peace times is likely to have more control over what happens. India has been sending its naval warships on goodwill missions across the world ever since the country became independent. But, in the past few years, it has mostly been visiting Indo-Pacific ports. \nShips from India\u2019s Eastern Fleet have been going on goodwill trips to friendly countries all over the Indo-Pacific in recent years. In 2023, for instance, the Indian Navy went to bases in Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, and New Zealand. These trips are more than just normal attempts to improve diplomatic ties; they also send subtle strategic messages\u2014most of the time against China. It is important to think about when these missions happen. \nThe Indian Navy\u2019s increased presence in the South China Sea, especially at a time when tensions between China and the Philippines are growing, and its visits to countries in maritime disputes with China are not accidental. \nIndia and China\u2019s relationship worsened after the 2020 border fights. This involved India more in countering China\u2019s power in the Indo-Pacific. Indian ships are more likely to go to the South China Sea because of this change. \nThe Indian Navy did drills in the area with Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam in 2021. In 2023, it drilled in the South China Sea with seven other ASEAN navies. It also put out a statement with the Philippines, asking China to follow international laws of territorial rights. This latest deployment shows how India\u2019s approach is changing all the time. \nAlso, the South Pacific has turned into a place where India and China fight over strategy. China is now a big player in both economic and security issues in the Pacific Island nations having gained a lot more power over them. \nIndia has mostly been a development partner to these countries, but is now trying to get more involved. It was clear that India wanted to improve its ties in the area when two ships from the Indian Navy went to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, after the third Forum for India-Pacific Island Cooperation (FIPIC) Summit. \nThe Indian Navy\u2019s friendly trips to South-East Asia and the wider Indo-Pacific are very important for achieving India\u2019s foreign policy goals through naval diplomacy. These meetings not only improve India\u2019s maritime ties, but are also a smart way for the country to show off its power by working with allies and quietly discouraging rivals, especially China. \nIndia is becoming a major player in the Indo-Pacific by visiting ports and participating in joint exercises. This shows that it is committed to keeping stability in the region and promoting a peaceful, rule-based order in the area. \n(The author of this article is a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

        "title": "And Now, Israel Strikes at Iran. Will There Be Another Reprisal?",
        "text": "The Israeli airstrikes on 26 October, a tit-for-tat response to an Iranian attack in early October, have plunged the troubled West Asian region into yet another spiral of increased tensions between two arch adversaries, with the attendant risk of a potentially dangerous military escalation. The air attack targeted surface-to-air missile sites and related facilities in Iran that, according to Tel Aviv, were used to manufacture the ordnance fired at Israel. It is instructive that Israel did not target Iranian oil facilities or its nuclear installations. This restraint is being interpreted as a case of signalling, i.e., that while the IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) has the requisite trans-border military capability to breach Iranian air defences and attack selected targets with precision and lethality \u2013 they have chosen not to do so. Additionally, this restraint is being attributed to the US. It is evident that the last thing the White House wants when the country is going to vote for a new President is a conflict involving Israel and Iran.Israel is in the Wrong. Period.Iran's Ballistic Missile Attack Changed Nothing. What Will Israel Do Now?Lebanon's Painful History and Israel's War Aims With HezbollahWhile Iran has claimed that the damage caused in Saturday's attack was \u2018limited\u2019, it has confirmed that four of its army soldiers were killed in the Israeli offensive. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the first public comment on Sunday and sought to play down the attack by noting that the event \u201cshould neither be minimised nor exaggerated.\u201d He added that the Iranian military would decide on the next steps to be taken \u2013 an indication that Iran will opt for restraint and not act impulsively.The current spike in Israel-Iran relations goes back to Hamas' 7 October terror attack on Israel last year and the ongoing war of reprisal that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched against Palestine (i.e., Gaza). In the months that followed, Hezbollah in Lebanon joined in support of the beleaguered Palestinians and the footprint of the war expanded.Both Hamas and Hezbollah are armed groups supported by Iran and seen as proxies of Tehran in the regional calculus. The US has designated them as terror groups, but they have considerable domestic support among the local populace given they are seen as a fierce resistance opposing Zionist oppression and the occupation of Palestine.The sequence of attacks and counter-attacks this year began with an Israeli air strike on 1 April against an Iranian embassy building in Syria that killed many officers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the organisation responsible for Iran\u2019s external military activities. On 13 April, Iran retaliated with a missile and drone attack against the military facility that it alleged was used in the Israeli attack. Israel responded in a limited manner, and subsequently, Iran chose to remain passive and not escalate any further. A sullen lull followed.Further, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a mysterious helicopter crash in May this year, adding to the challenges facing the Iranian leadership, not least the domestic unrest over repression of women's rights and rising inflation. Tehran went into a huddle about its approach to Israel and Gaza.Accident or Assassination? On Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s Mysterious DeathLebanon: With Nasrallah Killed, Hezbollah's Leadership is in DisarrayJuly was particularly bloody, with Israel killing Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in an airstrike on Beirut on 30 July. The very next day, in an audacious attack, senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Fingers were pointed at Israel but it did not accept responsibility for the same.It was evident that Israel was increasing its attacks on the leadership of Hezbollah, having degraded Hamas in Gaza. In September, the IDF carried out a major strike on Beirut, which resulted in the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and a senior Iranian military officer. In yet another audacious attack, Israel used pagers as coordinated explosives against Hezbollah cadres. Pressure was mounting on Tehran to respond to what it termed as wanton assassination and aggression by Israel. Consequently, the 1 October missile and drone attacks were launched by Iran.While it was hoped that this would end the cycle of reprisals, Prime Minister Netanyahu saw this as an opportunity to \u2018press the pedal\u2019 and the 26 October strikes were launched amidst calls for restraint. Israel has continued to prosecute its attacks on 27 October against both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. The death toll is mounting.Whether Iran will plan another reprisal against Israel immediately or wait and watch is dependent on multiple factors. Within Iran, there have been reports about the hardliners seeking retribution, denouncing the US for its uncritical support to Netanyahu, while the moderates want a holistic review of Iran\u2019s investment in supporting groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.Israel cannot prosecute the war against its adversaries without unstinted US support. Both Iran and Israel are cognisant about the implications of the outcome of the US presidential election, now merely a week away. The duration between 4 November (when voting commences) to 20 January 2025 (when the new president would officially assume office) is seen as the \u2018lame-duck\u2019 period.The worst-case scenario for Washington is that the Iranian leadership chooses to go nuclear and Israel decides to carry out a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear assets in a preventive strike. This must be avoided.The UN Security Council is likely to meet on 28 October to review the situation. One can only hope that another full-scale war does not explode and further testify to the ineptitude of the global political leadership.(The writer is a leading expert on strategic affairs.

It said another 15 people were wounded and that the death toll could rise.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nIsrael has been waging a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza for the last three weeks, after saying that Hamas militants had regrouped there. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement in the yearlong war.\n\nIsrael is still carrying out daily strikes across Gaza, even as it wages war with the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon.\n\nSaturday, Israeli warplanes attacked Iran \u2014 which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah \u2014 in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month.\n\nThe cascading conflicts have raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which also include the Houthi rebels in Yemen and armed groups in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIsrael says its strikes on Gaza only target militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel\u2019s border wall and stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack October 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead.\n\nIsrael\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the local Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of those killed were women and children.\n\nThe offensive has devastated much of the impoverished coastal territory and displaced around 90 per cent of its population, often multiple times.

However, the railway minister has not taken any steps to solve the problems,\" the Rajya Sabha member charged.Raut also hit out at the NDA government at the Centre over some of the railway accidents in the country during its tenure.\"Since the third term of this new Union government has commenced, at least 25 major railway accidents have taken place,\" he claimed.\"What solution did the government provide to address them?\" Raut asked.Who is responsible for so many people getting injured (referring to stampede at Bandra station)?

        "title": "Opinion: Opinion | Bridging The Rhine And The Ganges: Germany's Renewed 'Focus India'",
        "text": "Following nuclear testing in 1998, the Singh-Talbott talks provided the framework for shifting the Indo-US relationship from \"estranged democracies\" to \"engaged democracies.\" A comparable transition is already ongoing between Germany and India, as seen by Germany's \"Focus on India\" policy. This move is underscored before Chancellor Olaf Scholz's October 2024 visit to New Delhi, indicating a growing realization that India is not just a key regional actor but also an important partner in the global arena. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's 2022 statement, \"Europe must grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world's problems,\" resonates strongly with Germany's stance, which coincides with a more pragmatic and multipolar world order. \n\nChancellor Scholz's Visit and Growing Partnership \n\nChancellor Scholz's visit to India is a significant milestone in the growing Indo-German partnership. His schedule included the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Businesses in Delhi, where he and Prime Minister Modi spoke to senior industry leaders from both countries. With bilateral commerce reaching a record high of Euro 30 billion in 2023 and strong German interest in India's technology and manufacturing sectors, this conference provided an opportunity to transform economic engagement into a long-term industrial collaboration. The visit further channelled the Green and Sustainable Partnership between India and Germany. Furthermore, the two countries began commemoration of the 25th anniversary of their strategic Partnership, providing an appropriate backdrop for Scholz's visit and demonstrating the maturity of the relationship. Scholz emphasized on contribution of the Indian diaspora in the growth of Germany and released India India-specific Skilled Labour Strategy.\n\nA New Realization in the West\n\nThe release of two India-specific documents signals the post-Markel era in the India-German partnership. The tone and content of those two documents indicate a positive alignment towards India. The Scholz administration has appreciated the vitality of Indian democracy and desisted from lecturing India. Germany's strategic focus on India highlights three major themes underscoring India's rising global position. First, the changing geopolitical landscape has led Germany and the West to view India not just as an occasional ally but as a strategic partner with lasting influence. This shift is captured in Germany's recent \"Focus on India\" strategic document, signalling a transformation from episodic cooperation to a committed partnership. The document underlined India as a 'central and active shaper of international politics'. The West increasingly recognises India's ability to contribute strategically, reflecting a maturing relationship that is responsive, rather than reactionary, to shared global challenges. Like the United States' shift in its India policy post-1998, Germany's approach now highlights India's role as a reliable partner in areas such as economic resilience, technology, and sustainable development.\n\nThe Focus on India document's identification of India as a \"stabilizer\" in the Indo-Pacific underscores the second major theme: India's Anchor of Stability, both regionally and on broader global issues. With rising concerns about China's influence, Germany acknowledges India as essential to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Thus, recognizes the Indian commitment to safeguarding maritime security and upholding sovereignty. Chancellor Scholz's recent visit to the German frigate Baden-Wurttemberg in Goa further emphasized this stance, highlighting the alignment between Germany's Indo-Pacific vision and India's security priorities. As India and Germany strengthen their ties in the Indo-Pacific, their partnership is moving beyond transactional goals to shared principles of freedom and mutual respect for sovereignty. This reflects the fundamental shift in Germany's perspective concerning the Indo-Pacific. In 2020, the German government's Indo-Pacific policy guidelines have referred to India as 'another Indo-Pacific partner'.\n\nFinally, India's unique positioning as a pragmatic and reliable bridge in complex conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, is gaining international recognition. Unlike other major powers, India maintains open diplomatic channels with all stakeholders in the conflict, including the U.S., Germany, Russia, and Ukraine. The recently concluded BRICS plus summit in Kazan in Russia signalled India holds the best geopolitical position globally. Germany's acceptance of India's neutral stance highlights an understanding that independence in decision-making and focus on long-term relationships shape Indian foreign policy. Unlike China, whose interests often diverge from Western priorities, India promotes global stability without treating crises as mere transactions. This perception of India as a pragmatic yet empathetic bridge solidifies its credibility on the world stage and demonstrates its value in navigating geopolitical conflicts with sensitivity and reliability. \n\nTogether, these themes reveal a fundamental shift: Germany and the West are moving from viewing India as a regional ally to recognizing it as a strategic partner with a stabilizing and mediating influence essential to today's multipolar world.\n\nLimitations and Conclusion\n\nGermany's \"Focus on India\" policy marks a shift from a distant, episodic relationship with New Delhi to a steady, strategic collaboration grounded in mutual respect for sovereignty and values. However, while Germany acknowledges India's significance, the policy's cover-where Kashmir is subtly obscured on the map-hints at lingering sensitivities. Besides, the Focus on India document refers to the so-called \"Global South\" on three occasions. In the West, this term is often viewed dismissively. In contrast, New Delhi and over 100 capitals worldwide identify with it proudly. The disdainful tone concerning the term underlines the need for jointly traversing along the road of partnership.\n\nYet, this evolution reflects Germany's move from a Eurocentric approach to a realistic embrace of global multipolarity. By viewing India as a true partner, not merely a regional ally, Germany aligns itself with the emerging world order. This alliance offers both nations a historic opportunity to address shared challenges, drive economic growth, and enhance stability amid global shifts.\n\nAbhishek Chaudhari is currently on an academic break to pursue a mid-career degree at Harvard Kennedy School.

The months following the U.S. presidential election will be critical in shaping gold's near-term trajectory. Hereon, the two key factors underpinning this year's rally in precious metals are expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and rising geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East. Overall, the sentiment for this Diwali is projected to be positive, raising optimism for bullion.\"\n\nAccording to the firm, historically, the demand for gold tends to surge during the festive season and this year Diwali coincides with U.S. presidential election and the ultimate Federal Reserve policy meeting of 2024 which will enhance market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it noted that the recent concerns over rising prices could dampen overall demand and domestic demand may experience a slight dip, prices could still find support amid these major events.\n\nAccording to MOFSL analysis of leap years and historical patterns of Gold, since 2011, there have only been two instances (2015 and 2016) where the 30 days leading up to Diwali recorded negative returns.\n\nAside from 2022, pre-Diwali gains have consistently outpaced post-Diwali gains. \"We continue to believe that gold has further upside potential wherein any dips could present buying opportunities. According to our recent quarterly report, a correction of 5-7 per cent is plausible and could serve as an accumulation zone\", added Manav Modi.",

        "title": "Wayanad LS bypoll: Rehabilitation of landslide survivors takes centre stage",
        "text": "Wayanad (Kerala): The issue of rehabilitation of the survivors of the July 30 landslides has taken centre stage in Kerala's Wayanad ahead of next month's Lok Sabha bypoll, with the Congress-led UDF and CPI(M)-headed LDF raising the matter in response to concerns from the affected families.According to the government, the deadly disaster has claimed 231 lives while 47 people are still missing. Bypoll to Wayanad constituency is being held on November 13 and the election was necessitated due to the resignation of local MP and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as he emerged victorious from Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareily as well, in this year's general elections.Local residents have stressed that land acquisition for rehabilitation must be completed promptly, as it has been delayed after estate owners challenged it in the Kerala High Court.The land, meant for new townships under the Disaster Management Act, includes the Harrison Malayalam Estate in Nedumbala, Meppadi grama panchayat, and Elston Estate in Kalpetta, all designated for housing survivors.Besides, demands for loan waivers, immediate relief assistance, and increased rent support for those displaced and living in rented accommodations remain unmet, they added.LDF candidate Sathyan Mokeri visited several landslide survivors in their rented accommodations on Saturday and claimed that the rehabilitation efforts by the ruling Left government in the state were a model for the world.He also blamed the BJP-ruled Centre for not providing any help for rehabilitation of the landslide-affected people of the hill district. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, who is the UDF candidate, in an emotional open letter, recalled her visit to Chooralmala and Mundakkai with her brother and Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi where she saw the devastation wrought by the landslide and the depth of the loss they suffered.Congress MLA from Kalpetta in Wayanad T Siddique, who moved an adjournment motion in the Assembly, said that despite the Prime Minister's assurance not even a single penny was given by the Centre for relief and rehabilitation of the landslide-hit people of Wayanad.According to Navya Haridas, the BJP candidate, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had personally consoled the landslide survivors. She alleged the Kerala government has so far not given even the relief aid granted by the Union Government to the survivors.Kerala Revenue Minister K Rajan expressed disappointment over the Central government's \"negative approach\" towards providing aid for rehabilitation efforts. \"It has been 100 days since the disaster, and we are still waiting for a special relief package,\" he said.The state government has submitted a memorandum to the Centre under the Disaster Management Act, seeking support. Amidst the political blame games and gestures of support from leaders, the survivors are gearing up to stage protests to demand attention from all candidates regarding their rehabilitation.\"We are planning to hold a fast in Kalpetta or Meppadi to bring our issues to the forefront for political parties. We believe it would be more impactful if it coincided with Priyanka Gandhi's campaign visit,\" said Naseer Alakkal, Chairman of the Janasabdham Action Committee told PTI.The committee represents survivors from wards 10, 11, and 12 of the Meppadi grama panchayat, where the devastating landslide occurred. \"The situation is extremely serious. The government announced an immediate relief assistance of Rs 9,000 to Rs 10,000 for survivors in these three wards, but 132 people are yet to receive it. The government has been providing funds to cover monthly rent for the past three months, with the assistance initially promised for six months.\"\"However, it is unlikely that rehabilitation will be completed within this period. So who will cover the rent after that,\" asked Naseer, who currently lives in a rented house in Kalpetta with his family.Another major demand is the release of the official list of those who died and are still missing in the disaster. According to official records, 47 people remain unaccounted for, and locals are urging authorities to issue death certificates to their relatives.There is also a demand for authorities to provide adequate treatment facilities for those still residing in the Chooralmala region, which remains isolated after the catastrophic disaster.JMJ Manoj, another survivor, pointed out that while the government provides Rs 6,000 as monthly rent assistance, many families need more as they are living in houses with higher rent.\"We are demanding that the monthly rent assistance be increased to Rs 10,000,\" said Manoj, who is also the convenor of Janakeeya Samiti. Currently, around 800 displaced families are residing in rented houses following the disaster.The Kerala government sought Rs 2,000 crore in central assistance for compensating and rehabilitating the victims of the Wayanad landslide. However, only Rs 291.2 crore has been received so far, disbursed in two...",

        "text": "Mumbai: Disappointed with the Maha Vikas Aghadi's (MVA) response to the Samajwadi Party\u2019s (SP) seat-sharing demands, SP Maharashtra Chief Abu Azmi announced plans for the party to contest at least 20 seats in the state. Azmi warned that any impact on the alliance due to a vote split would result from the MVA\u2019s neglect of SP\u2019s concerns. SP Chief Akhilesh Yadav emphasised that \"there is no place for sacrifice in politics\" and affirmed that if the MVA does not include the SP in the alliance, the party will run independently in constituencies where it has significant public support. \u201cWe will only contest in seats where we will receive votes or have active support, but we won\u2019t harm the alliance by running in seats that would undermine it,\u201d Yadav clarified. The SP has long demanded five seats within the MVA framework, but the alliance has yet to finalize a decision. This delay has led to increasing frustration within the SP. On Saturday, Azmi told ANI that if their demands are not met, the party will have no choice but to contest alone. \u201cWe discussed our concerns with Sharad Pawar, who promised a decision soon, but we received no follow-up,\u201d Azmi shared. He expressed disappointment over the possibility of being \"betrayed\" for the third time, noting that the seats SP had sought were being distributed without consideration. \u201cWe don\u2019t wish to disrupt the MVA or split votes, but if our needs are ignored, we are prepared to proceed independently. Akhilesh Yadav has given me full authority to act in SP's best interest,\" Azmi stated.",

These personnel engaged in protests both inside the Battalion campus and on the streets, which undermined the integrity and discipline expected of government servants.

Director General of Police (DGP) Dr Jitender urged the personnel to cease their protests, emphasizing the seriousness of indiscipline among uniformed forces. He warned that such actions fall under the Police Forces (Restrictions of Rights) Act and the Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, making them subject to legal penalties. The protests escalated as constables, head constables, and their families raised concerns about long deployments that disrupt family life. They are advocating for a \u201cone state, one police\u201d policy to align their status with district police.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is determined to ensure all-round development in West Bengal.

        "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday addressed the issue of \u201cdigital arrest\u201d in the 115th episode of \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019, labelling it as a fraudulent activity. He urged people to remain vigilant and safe.\n\nThe Prime Minister emphasised that those involved in the crime are enemies of society. \u201c\u2026There is no system like digital arrest in the law, this is just fraud, deceit, lie, a gang of criminals and those who are doing this are enemies of the society\u2026,\u201d the PM cautioned.\n\nAddressing the growing cases and concerns about techno-crime, PM Modi informed listeners that various investigative agencies were collaborating with state governments to combat these fraudulent schemes.\n\nHe said to enhance coordination among these agencies, the National Cyber Coordination Centre has been established. \u201cThis initiative aims to strengthen efforts against cybercrime and protect citizens from such scams, reaffirming the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring public safety in the digital realm,\u201d said the PM.\n\n\u201cBeware of Digital Arrest frauds\u2026No investigative agency will ever contact you by phone or video call for enquiries\u2026The fraudsters of digital arrest phone calls, at times, impersonate police, CBI, and Narcotics; and at times RBI\u2026 using such various labels, they converse as fake officers with a lot of confidence. Many listeners of \u2018#MannKiBaat\u2019 have wished that we must discuss that. Let me tell you, how these fraud gangs work. What is this dangerous game? It is very important for you to understand this and it is equally important for others to understand it as well,\u201d said the PM.\n\nDuring the radio talk, PM Modi played a video to make people understand the gravity of the crime.\n\nWhile making the audience understand the modus operandi, PM Modi said, \u201cThe First Move\u2026 They collect all of your personal information\u2026 \u201cYou went to Goa last month, didn\u2019t you? Your daughter studies in Delhi, right\u201d? They collect so much information about you that you will be surprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second move \u2013 create an atmosphere of fear\u2026 Uniform, government office set-up, legal sections\u2026 they will scare you so much on the phone\u2026 In the midst of the conversation, you will not be able to even think. And then their third move begins \u2013 the time pressure. \u201cYou have to decide now or else you will be arrested\u201d \u2013 these people create so much psychological pressure on the victim that one gets scared. People from every class and age group fall victim to Digital Arrest. People have lost lakhs of rupees earned through their hard work, out of sheer fear. Whenever you receive such a call, don\u2019t be scared. You should be aware that no investigative agency ever inquires like this through a phone call or a video call,\u201d the PM said.\n\nPM Modi enumerated the three steps to Digital Security. These three steps are \u2014 \u2018Stop \u2013 Think \u2013 Take Action.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you get a call, stop\u2026 don\u2019t panic, stay calm, don\u2019t take any hasty steps, don\u2019t give away your personal information to anyone; if possible take a screenshot and record it for sure. After this comes the second step. The first step was \u2018stop\u2019 and the second step was \u2018think\u2019. No government agency threatens you on the phone like this, neither inquires nor demands money on a video call like this. If you feel scared, then know that something is wrong. The first step, the second step and now I spell out the third step. In the first step, I said \u2013 \u2018Stop\u2019\u2026 in the second step I said \u2013 \u2018Think\u2019, and the third step tells you \u2013 \u2018Take action\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe also mentioned the national cyber helpline 1930, or to report on cybercrime.gov.in, or inform family and police, and preserve evidence.\n\n\u201cStop, then think, and then take action, these three steps will become the protector of your digital security,\u201d said the PM.\n\nThe PM said that thousands of such fraudulent video-calling IDs have been blocked by the agencies. Lakhs of SIM cards, mobile phones and bank accounts have also been blocked.\n\n\u201cAgencies are doing their job, but for protection from scams in the name of digital arrest, it is very important that everyone is aware, every citizen is aware. Those who are victims of this kind of cyber fraud should let as many people as possible know about it. You can use #SafeDigitalIndia for awareness,\u201d the PM said.\n\nPM Modi also urged schools and colleges to involve students in the campaign against cyber scams. \u201cWe can fight this challenge only with the collective efforts in society,\u201d he said.",

A strict advisory has also been issued to all the political parties in this regard, said Neha Arora.Union Minister Annapurna Devi remarked that Irfan Ansaris statement reveals the mindset of the Congress party, reported ANI.He (Irfan Ansari) has given a very wrong statement on Sita Soren. This exposes the mentality of the Congress party. The Congress party is anti-women and anti-youth... I condemn this statement... Will Rahul Gandhi take back the tickets given to people with such a low level of thinking? The Congress party should remove such people from the cabinet, Annapurna Devi commented.Sita Soren voiced her confusion over how Ansari felt emboldened to make such remarks.I am unable to understand where he gets the courage to make such statements. Who is giving him the courage to make such statements, because no one has ever made such statements against me in Jharkhand... The party has informed the Election Commission about his statement. We will not forgive him... The entire tribal population is angry, stated the BJP leader.Ragini Singh, another BJP leader, suggested that the Congress party has a policy of disrespecting women.This is his mentality. It is the policy of Congress to comment on a woman, but BJP policy is to respect all the women whether they are from the Congress or the BJP, Singh remarked.Irfan Ansari, the Congress candidate for the Jamtara constituency, sparked controversy with his remarks about Sita Soren, his rival from the same seat.On Friday, Sita Soren posted a video on X, stating that the Congress leader called her rejected and a borrowed player while responding to a journalists question regarding his competition with her in the upcoming election.The BJP leader also demanded an apology from Ansari for his indecent language towards her, asserting that the public would respond.Congress commat;INCIndia candidate Irfan Ansari must apologise for the indecent language he used against me in front of the media immediately after filing his nomination. He has previously made personal comments about me, but this time he has crossed all limits. Irfan ji commat;IrfanAnsariMLA, apologise, or be prepared for fierce opposition, she posted on X.The indecent words you used while holding such a respected position have alarmed women across society. If you can use such words for me, what must poor and vulnerable women face? As long as such leaders remain in power, women will remain unsafe. The time has come to remove them from power. The way you look at women is now before the public, and the public will respond, the BJP leader added.For the upcoming Jharkhand assembly elections, the BJP will ally with the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU), Janata Dal (United), and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).

        "text": "Hyderabad: Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Bandi Sanjay Kumar here on Sunday demanded that the State government take stern action against those who were involved in an illegal liquor party hosted in a farmhouse at Janwada on the city suburbs on Saturday midnight. In a short video released hours after the police and the prohibition and excise department raided the farmhouse, Sanjay said the State government should not spare anyone who attended the party last night where foreign liquor was served illegally and an attendee tested positive for consuming drugs. He said he came to know about the party from media in which it was stated that the party was organized at the farmhouse belonging to the former Minister and BRS working president KT Rama Rao\u2019s (KTR) brother-in-law Raj Pakal. He said the people would revolt if the State government tried to protect the former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao\u2019s (KCR) relatives for allegedly being involved in the drugs party and the Congress government in the State should keep it in mind and act accordingly. \u201cSince we are getting information that KTR\u2019s relatives were involved in it along with those who supplied drugs, the State government must take up the case seriously. The police must first identify tower locations and make CCTV footage public apart from seizing the passports of the key persons involved in the case,\u201d Sanjay said. \u201cWe have faith on Telangana police. But earlier some police officials tried to protect the family members of KCR because of their association with him,\u201d he said, demanding an explanation from KTR as to what answer he would give for his brother-in-law's involvement in it. The people of Telangana would strongly believe that both the Congress and BRS would be the same if the Congress government failed to take stringent action against the persons involved in it. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the government to clear the doubts of the people in the entire episode,\u201d he added.

As preparations for the festivities begin, people are in search of the perfect diyas to light up their houses.\n\nFrom traditional terracotta diyas (hanathe) to floating and electric ones, a variety of options are available in the market. According to Keshavram Patel, a shopkeeper in the central part of the city, floral and hanging diyas, the ones painted in different colours along with glitter and mirrors, and the large ones used for decorating the entrance are being sold the most this year.\n\nSajad Ahmed, who sells handicrafts and decorative items at his store in K.R. Market, stated that floating and scented diyas are the recent innovations. \u201cPeople have also bought decorative brass lamps, candle tea light and electric diyas from my store.\u201d He also shared that battery-operated water diyas are quite popular among the customers this year, adding that most of his sales have been online.\n\nBrick-and-mortar sellers suffer\n\nWith online shopping of diyas becoming more prominent in recent years owing to increased options and easy delivery, traditional store owners say their businesses have taken a hit. \u201cEarlier, the market used to be vibrant and filled with people. After the lockdown, everything has shifted to online shopping,\u201d said Kailash Raj, a store owner in Vasanthnagar.\n\nHe said that while online shopping is easy and cheap, quality remains a concern. \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything about the product\u2019s quality.

Here, at the shop, even if the price is high they can still bargain and we give them a fair price and good quality diyas.\u201d\n\nMix of traditional and decorative purchases\n\nThe prices of diyas vary according to the style. While terracotta diyas are being sold from anywhere between \u20b91 to \u20b920 per unit, the decorative ones cost between \u20b960 and \u20b9200 a piece. While customers prefer the traditional diyas for rituals, they are buying the other varieties for decoration. \n\nPrerna Mimani, a customer, said, \u201cWhile people go for decorative diyas, they still buy the traditional terracota diyas for puja.

Has that proven that she never worked at McDonald's? Well, McDonald's has no information. No, she has no information. She's nobody. The manager said she'd never worked there,\u201d he added. This comes after Trump alleged that Google obscured results for people attempting to find information about him. He has previously said that he reached out to CEO Sundar Pichai to voice his complaints regarding the perceived bias in search results.At an event organised by the Economic Club of Chicago on October 15, Trump told John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, that he had recently contacted the \u201chead of Google\u201d to voice his concerns over the search results associated with his name. \u201cI'm getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don't find them in Google,\u201d Trump said he told Pichai. \u201cI think it's a whole rigged deal. I think Google's rigged just like our government is rigged.\u201d \u201cThey only have bad stories. In other words, if I have 20 good stories and 20 bad stories, and everyone's entitled to that, you'll only see the 20 bad stories,\u201d he told Micklethwait.&nbsp",

        "text": "Citing the popularity of Indian animated series such as Chhota Bheem, Hanuman and Motu-Patlu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday (October 27, 2024) said India is on the way to ushering in a new revolution in the world of animation and urged the people to take the resolve of making the country a global animation powerhouse.\n\nIn his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio broadcast, he said India's animation characters and movies, on account of content and creativity, are being loved all over the world.\n\n\"You must remember the days when Chhota Bheem started airing on TV. Children can never forget that; there was so much excitement about Chhota Bheem! You would be surprised that today Dholakpur ka Dhol attracts children not only in India but also in other countries. Similarly, our other animated serials such as Krishna, Hanuman, Motu-Patlu also have a fan-following all over the world,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\n\"You might have noticed that from the smartphone to the cinema screen, gaming console to virtual reality, animation is omnipresent. India is on the way to ushering in a new revolution in the world of animation,\" Mr. Modi asserted.\n\nHe also pointed out that the gaming space of India is also expanding rapidly and Indian games are also gaining popularity all over the world.\n\nAlso Read | India\u2019s gaming industry sees exponential growth: Meta report\n\n\"When I met leading gamers of India a few months ago... I got an opportunity to know and understand the amazing creativity and quality of Indian games. Indeed, in the country, there's a constant wave of creative energy,\" he said.\n\nIn the world of animation, 'Made in India' and 'Made by Indians' can be noticed everywhere, Mr. Modi said.\n\n\"You will be happy to know that today India's talent is also a significant part of foreign productions. Be it the present day Spider-Man or Transformers, in both these movies, Harinarayan Rajeev's contribution has been highly appreciated by people,\" he said.\n\nAnimation studios of India, are working with world famous production companies such as Disney and Warner Brothers, Mr. Modi noted.\n\n\"Today our youth are creating original Indian content, which reflects glimpses of our culture. These are being watched all over the world,\" he said.\n\nMr. Modi stressed that today, the animation sector has donned the form of an industry that is powering other industries, just as VR Tourism is getting famous these days.\n\n\"Through a virtual tour you can view the Ajanta caves, take a stroll through the Konark temple corridor or enjoy the ghats of Varanasi. All these VR animation marvels have been made by Indian creators. After seeing these places through VR, many people want to visit these tourist places in reality, i.e. virtual tour of a tourist destination has become a medium of creating curiosity in the minds of people,\" he said.\n\nToday in this sector, along with animators, the demand for storytellers, writers, voice-over experts, musicians, game developers, VR and AR experts is also constantly rising, he said .\n\n \"Therefore, I would like to tell the youth of India - expand your creativity. Who knows, the world's next super hit animation might emerge out of your computer! The next viral game could be your creation! Your innovation in educational animations can achieve great success,\" he said.\n\nNoting that the 'World Animation Day' will be celebrated on October 28, he called on the people to take the resolve of making India a global animation powerhouse.\n\nRecalling Swami Vivekananda's mantra of success - 'Take an idea, Make that one idea your life', Modi said the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is also riding on this mantra of success, and noted this campaign has become a part of our collective consciousness.\n\n\"It has become our inspiration at every step. Self-reliance has become not only our policy, but our passion as well. Not that long ago... just 10 years ago, if someone had said then, that some complex technology was to develop in India, many people would not believe it and many would ridicule it - but today the same people are amazed to see the success of the country,\" Mr. Modi said.\n\nBecoming self-reliant, India is doing wonders in every sector, he asserted.\n\n\"Just think, India, which used to import mobile phones once upon a time, is the world's second largest manufacturer today. India, which once was the biggest buyer of defence equipment in the world, is now also exporting to 85 countries. Today, in space technology, India has become the first country to reach the South Pole of the Moon,\" he said.\n\nHe said this campaign of self-reliance is no longer just a government campaign now and the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is becoming a people's campaign with success in every field, the Prime Minister said.\n\n \"Just as this month, we inaugurated Asia's largest 'Imaging Telescope MACE' in Hanle, Ladakh. It is situated at a height of 4300 metres. Do you know what is special about it as well? It is 'Made in India'. Imagine, the place where the cold dips to minus 30 degrees, where there is a shortage of even oxygen, it is there that our scientists have achieved something that no other nation in Asia has done,\" he said.\n\nEven though the Hanle Telescope is watching a distant world, it is also showing us something more - the capabilities of self-reliant India, Mr. Modi said.\n\nHe urged people to share as many examples of India becoming self-reliant as possible.\n\n\"What new innovation have you noticed in your neighbourhood? Which Local Start-up has impressed you the most? Along with hashtag Aatmanirbhar Innovation,write down this information on social media and celebrate Aatmanirbhar Bharat,\" Mr. Modi said.\n\nIn this festive season, Mr. Modi urged people to strengthen this campaign of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and asked them to do their shopping with the mantra of Vocal for Local.\n\n\"This is the new India where the impossible is just a challenge... where Make in India has now turned into Make for the world, where every citizen is an innovator, where every challenge is an opportunity,\" Mr. Modi said.\n\n\"We not only have to make India self-reliant, but also strengthen our country as a global powerhouse of innovation,\" he said.",

        "text": "British parliamentarians have called on the UK\u2019s Foreign Secretary David Lammy MP to intervene in Imran Khan\u2019s release from Adiala Jail and engage with the Pakistan government, Geo reported.The 20 British parliamentarians, representing both the Commons and the Lords, have signed a letter written by Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, at the behest of Imran Khan\u2019s adviser on International Affairs, Zulfi Bukhari.The signatories are Kim Johnson MP, Paula Barker MP, Apsana Begum MP, Liam Byrne MP, Rosie Duffield MP, Gill Furniss MP, Paulette Hamilton MP, Peter Lamb MP, Andy McDonald MP, Abtisam Mohamed MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP, Zarah Sultana MP, Steve Witherden MP, Nadia Whittome MP, Baroness Joan Bakewell, Baroness Christine Blower, Lord Peter Hain, Lord John Hendy and Lord Todoanfel.The letter stated, \u201cWe are writing with grave concern about the continued detention of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. As you will know, Khan was imprisoned in 2023 in a move which the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found had no legal basis and appeared to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office, as per Geo News.\u201cThus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose,\u201d the letter added.In a letter, they expressed concern that Khan\u2019s ongoing detention threatens democracy in Pakistan.The letter cited Amnesty International\u2019s review of Khan\u2019s case, highlighting the \u201cpattern of weaponisation of the legal system\u201d to keep him detained and barred from political activity.Amnesty noted that Khan was denied adequate time and facilities to prepare his defence in at least three trials.\u201cAs a result, Khan\u2019s ongoing detention represents a grave threat to democracy in the country. Indeed, there has been speculation that his fate will likely be decided by a military court, which would represent a worrying and completely illegal escalation. Following a recent review of Khan\u2019s case, Amnesty International has found that there has been a pattern of weaponisation of the legal system to keep Imran Khan under detention and away from all political activity,\u201d the letter to Lammy said.They have also observed that in at least three trials, Khan has not been allowed adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence. It has become apparently clear that the number of cases against the jailed PTI founder is now \u201cconsistent with a pattern of misuse of the justice system in Pakistan to intimidate, harass and target political opposition leaders\u2013while infringing upon the enshrined independence of the judiciary,\u201d the letter added.It further said the recently passed 26th Constitutional Amendment would take powers, such as banning political parties or handling cases involving federal and provincial governments, away from the Supreme Court. \u201cThis would constitute an assault on the principle of a separation of powers codified in the country\u2019s Constitution.\u201dIt adds: \u201cMeanwhile, in recent weeks, there has been further anti-democratic clampdowns on Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Party, which has seen the arrest of parliamentarians and high-profile activists. Despite gaining prior permission to hold a rally in Islamabad, it appears that Pakistani authorities unfairly invoked a new Public Order Act to detain PTI supporters. \u201cParliamentarians across this House will agree that the political precedent this is setting is dangerous. As such, Khan must be immediately released from pre-trial detention. As a country, we have a duty to stand up for human rights, democracy and international law everywhere. We therefore urge you to make representations to the Pakistani government to secure Khan\u2019s safe release.\u201d (ANI)",

        "text": "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refrained from talking about retaliation while addressing Israel\u2019s recent attack on Iranian targets, saying that the incident \u201cshould not be exaggerated nor downplayed.\u201d His remarks come as tensions simmer between the two nations following Saturday\u2019s airstrikes by Israel in response to Iran\u2019s missile barrage earlier this month.\u201cThe evil actions of the Israeli regime two nights ago should neither be exaggerated nor downplayed,\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cThe miscalculations of the Israeli regime must be disrupted. It is essential to make them understand the strength, will, and initiative of the Iranian nation and its youth,\u201d he added.While refraining from a direct call to retaliate, Khamenei highlighted Iran\u2019s capability to assert its influence.Iran\u2019s military and political figures have followed this strategic caution, pointing to regional cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon as priorities over immediate retaliation. State media reported that the airstrikes left four Iranian soldiers dead.On Saturday, Israeli warplanes launched targeted strikes against military sites in Iran, responding to a ballistic missile attack by Iran earlier this month. Israeli officials, speaking anonymously, clarified that the strikes avoided nuclear and oil infrastructure, focusing instead on \"precise strikes on military targets.\"The initial Iranian missile strike was reportedly a retaliatory action against recent Israeli operations against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.The United States, though informed of the Israeli strikes beforehand, has publicly distanced itself from involvement. With Iran\u2019s influence extending to militant allies like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the attack has raised fears over the possibility of a region-wide conflict, escalating into an all-out war involving Israel, the US, and Iran-backed forces.",

        "title": "India should influence Russia to change course on Ukraine: Finland\u2019s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen",
        "text": "India should use its international clout to influence Russia to change its course over Ukraine, Finland has urged. In an exclusive interview to The Hindu, Finland\u2019s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said, \u201cWe would like to see India lend its support to Ukraine\u2019s Peace Formula, which is the only peace plan based on respecting the UN Charter and key principles of international law. The world community needs a just and sustainable peace in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhy India refused to back the Ukraine summit statement?\n\n\u201cWe would prefer to see all parties, including India, use their own international clout to exert influence on Russia to change course and respect the UN Charter. To this end, the European Union (EU) has imposed sanctions against Russia as a means to make Russia stop its aggression. The EU has repeatedly urged all countries not to provide material or other support to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. It is important that as many partners as possible share our stance, enforce sanctions and combat their circumvention,\u201d she said.\n\nFinland, which is a part of the EU, has imposed sanctions on Russia. \u201cRussia has blatantly violated the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the UN Charter. Upholding these principles is clearly in our common interest. Russia\u2019s war has had tragic repercussions well beyond Ukraine and Europe, undermining the rules-based international system and global security as well as causing economic instability and supply chain disruptions on a global scale, the impacts often being felt the most in the developing nations of the Global South,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Sheikh Hasina\r\n\nWhen asked if the country, the largest by land mass in Europe, had received any political asylum request from the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, Ms. Valtonen denied it. \u201cWe have not been approached by the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, nor do we have information regarding her future plans. With respect to any possible asylum requests, all applications are processed according to relevant laws and regulations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIndia is a very important international partner to Finland\u201d\n\nFinland, a leading fintech country, has been wooing international skilled community, particularly from the tech industry to work in Finland. When asked about mobility partnership to attract skilled Indians and to facilitate their entry in the Nordic country, she said, \u201cIndia is a very important international partner to Finland, and India contributes significantly to Finland\u2019s skilled labour force. India is also one of the partner countries in Finland\u2019s Talent Boost programme for 2023\u20132027, which aims to attract foreign workforce to Finland and brings together work-based immigration measures such as effective residence permit processes, follow-up control as well as preventing and combating work-based exploitation.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cSkilled workers from India are coming to work in Finland in many different sectors and thus qualification requirements vary largely depending on the job assignment. This affects the residence permit process,\u201d she said further.\r\n\nElaborating on the procedure for working in Finland while highlighting the importance of ethical employment, Ms. Valtonen said, \u201cBefore arriving in Finland, the employees must have an employment contract, after which they can apply for a work permit online and prove their identity at the service centre in New Delhi. In accordance with the Finnish Government Programme, the aim for experts to receive residence permit is in one week\u2019s time through fast track process and the aim for other work-based residence permits is 30 days. Certain groups, such as specialists and start-up entrepreneurs, can \u2013 in addition to fast-tracking their application \u2013 apply for a D visa at the same time as the residence permit. With the D visa, they can arrive in Finland immediately after the residence permit decision has been made. It is of utmost importance, that employment is conducted ethically, and that Finland\u2019s laws and regulations are complied in recruitment and throughout the employment relationship.\u201d\n\nHappiest country in the world\n\nFinland has been named the happiest country in the world for the seventh year in a row. When asked about the secret behind it, Ms. Valtonen said, \u201cFinnish society is built on equality, trust and personal freedom, contributing to Finnish happiness. You could also say that happiness is a policy goal. Everyone has access to quality education, healthcare, and the freedom to enjoy the outdoors \u2013 all of which contribute to a high quality of life. People are also happier in a well-functioning society, where they feel secure.\u201d\n\nFinland\u2019s digital transformation and EU\u2019s new digital identity wallet\r\n\nFinland has been ranked as one of the leading countries in digital transformation, she said, adding that according to the Global Competitiveness Report, Finland has the best availability of scientists and engineers in the world combined with one of the most digitally oriented and literate population.\r\n\n\u201cWe are also a top performer in digital infrastructure, with almost universal 5G coverage. Finland is also one of the leading countries in digital public services. The next step in this journey is the adoption of a digital identity wallet, where Finland works side by side with other European countries. The new EU eIDAS Regulation regulates cross-border electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, and requires that each Member State must provide a digital identity wallet. In Finland, the Ministry of Finance has set up a project to guide national implementation of the regulation. Security is a priority in the development of the wallets. For example, only the wallet user can trace and control how the wallet is used. Digital wallets will promote the safety of online services, because services that allow the use of digital wallets will be registered and supervised. In addition, the user can block its use in case of misuse. Our priority is to ensure that people can control their own identity and data this way,\u201d Ms Valtonen told The Hindu.",

        "title": "Putin says Moscow will respond if West helps Ukraine to strike deep into Russia",
        "text": "MOSCOW, - President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that Russia's defence ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its Nato allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles. The 2-1/2-year-old Ukraine war has triggered the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the depths of the Cold War, and Russian officials say the war is now entering its most dangerous phase. Russia has been signalling to the United States and its allies for weeks that if they give permission to Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied missiles, then Moscow will consider it a major escalation. Putin said on Sept. 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean \"the direct involvement of Nato countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine\" because Nato military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles. Putin said that it was too early to say exactly how Russia would react to such a move but that Moscow would have to respond accordingly and different options were being examined. \"(The Russian defence ministry) is thinking about how to respond to the possible long-range strikes on Russian territory, it will offer a range of responses,\" Putin told Russian state TV's top Kremlin reporter, Pavel Zarubin. With Russia advancing at the fastest rate in eastern Ukraine since the first months of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading with the West to allow Kyiv to fire deep into Russia with Western missiles. Hitting Russia The United States has not said publicly if it will allow Ukraine to strike Russia, but some US officials are deeply sceptical that doing so would make a significant difference in the war. Ukrainian forces already strike deep into Russia on a regular basis with long-range drones. Putin, who ordered thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine, casts the war as a battle between Russia and the declining West, which he says ignored Russia's interests after the 1991 Soviet collapse. Ukraine and its Western allies say Putin unleashed an imperial-style war against its smaller neighbour and have repeatedly said that if Russia wins the war then autocratic countries across the world will be emboldened. Just weeks before the US presidential election, Putin changed Russia's nuclear doctrine in what the Kremlin said was an attempt to signal Russia's concern over Western discussions about missile strikes from Ukraine. Asked if the West had heard Russia's warnings, Putin told Zarubin: \"I hope they have heard. Because, of course, we will have to make some decisions for ourselves, too.\" Putin said that only Nato officers would be able to fire such weapons into Russia and that they would need to use Western satellite data for targeting the weapons so the question is really \"whether they will allow themselves to strike deep into Russian territory or not. That is the question.\" US officials say the United States is not seeking to escalate the conflict. How a new US president will approach the war is unclear: former US president Donald Trump has said he will end the Ukraine war while Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris says she will continue to support Ukraine.",
        "summary": "President Putin announced that Russia's defence ministry is evaluating responses to potential US and Nato support for Ukrainian strikes deep into Russia using Western missiles. He regards such actions as a significant escalation, possibly involving Nato's direct participation. The Ukraine war has heightened tensions between Russia and the West.",

Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is once again making headlines as a prominent figure in the UK's far-right movement. The rally saw a massive police presence, to prevent clashes with counter-protesters.Robinson has been a polarizing figure in British politics since he founded the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organization, in 2009. Despite organizing the rally, he was unable to attend it due to his arrest on Friday.Photo Credit: AFPRecently, Robinson has been at the centre of unrest in the UK following a mass stabbing incident in Southport that caused the deaths of three children. He allegedly spread misinformation on social media, falsely claiming that the assailant was a Muslim asylum seeker, leading to violent riots across the country, with demonstrators chanting his name and escalating tensions between far-right groups and anti-racism activists.As reported by Reuters, Saturday's demonstration occurred amid rising tensions over immigration, with over 29,578 asylum seekers having crossed the English Channel this year-more than the total for all of 2023. His supporters argue that Britain is under siege from not only immigration but also \"Islamification,\" while critics, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, label the unrest fuelled by them, as racist.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Photo Credit: AFPSaturday's rally saw participants waving British flags and carrying placards which resonated with Robinson's nationalist sentiments. Police were deployed from across the country to monitor both events and ensure public safety. Many were seen carrying banners featuring slogans about former US President Donald Trump, reflecting the influence of a shared right-wing ideology across the globe.Known for his anti-Islam rhetoric, Robinson has previously faced multiple criminal convictions, including assault and contempt of court. His controversial statements and actions have led to bans from major social media platforms as well. However, he regained access to social media platform X (formerly, Twitter) after its acquisition by Elon Musk.He is currently in police custody facing charges related to contempt of court for repeatedly breaching an injunction that prohibits him from making defamatory statements about Syrian refugee Jamal Hijazi.

        "text": "Pakistan cricket team roared in grabbing the limelight for all the right reasons this time. The 1992 World Champions, who were getting criticised for their back-to-back abysmal performances, finally regained form and thrashed England to clinch the three-match Test series 2-1. This is the first time Pakistan have won a three-match Test series after losing the first Test since they beat Zimbabwe in similar fashion in 1995. The hosts rode on the performances of spinners Sajid Khan and Noman Ali and registered a nine-wicket win in the third Test in Rawalpindi.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");After the memorable win, Pakistan skipper Shan Masood interacted with the former PCB chief Ramiz Raja. However, that interaction invited a lot of criticism as the Ramiz tried to mock Masood for winning the series after losing six Tests on trot.\"There are two things that you will see. One is how to play on seaming conditions and the other thing is if it is a one-off. How did you achieve this, six losses in a row?\" asked Raja.\r\nThis is absolute disgusting behavior from Ramiz Raja.What kind of questions he is asking?

The nation needed this win and I am really happy for Pakistan.\"Moments later, Ramiz again mocked Masood over a particular shot, asking if he is planning to get control over it. \"Yes, I will be able to control it Ramiz bhai,\" replied Masood.This interaction went viral on social media as the fans trolled Ramiz was being insensitive towards the Pakistan captain.\r\nRamiz Raja, his own cricket was bullshit like Ijaz Ahmed. They both survived in the team due to strong nepotism roots.

        "title": "No formal proposal to scrap windfall tax on crude oil, says FinMin official",
        "text": "The Finance Ministry is not considering any proposal to do away with windfall tax on domestically produced crude and export-bound petroleum products. As on date, the levy, technically known as Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED), is zero on domestically produced crude and export-bound petroleum products.\n\nThe issue about doing away with the levy came into limelight when Advisor to Prime Minister Tarun Kapoor said recently that there is not much relevance in imposing windfall tax on crude oil. Kapoor, who was earlier the Oil Secretary, said that the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG) has approached the Finance Ministry over the issue.\n\nWhen asked whether there is any proposal to formally end the levy, a senior Finance Ministry official told businessline: \u201cNo\u201d. Imposed in 2022, the levy aims to counterbalance the unusually high profits earned by oil and gas companies from high global crude oil prices. The tax is reviewed every fortnight. The government had slashed windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil to \u2018nil\u2019 per tonne with effect from September 18. The tax is levied in the form of Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) and is notified fortnightly based on average oil prices in two weeks.\n\n Also read: Windfall tax on crude oil cut to zero again as brent prices drop below $70\n\nThough the Ministry official did not give any reason for not doing away with the concept of levy, it is believed that oil prices are still volatile. Last month, Oil Secretary Pankaj Jain had said: \u201cThere is a calculation mechanism for windfall levy and it is from the Revenue Department. We are in continuous discussions with the Revenue Department, which will continue, which will take the final call. The final decision will be with the Revenue Department.\u201d\n\nThe windfall tax has nothing to do with retail price, as there is a separate tax structure comprising a Central levy (Central Excise Duty at a specific rate) and a State levy (VAT/Sales Tax at an ad valorem rate) for petroleum products sold in the market. For export-bound petroleum products and domestically produced goods, as the realisation is directly based on global prices. When prices are high, there is possibility of windfall gains, and the government imposes an additional levy in such cases.\n\nIndia imports about 85 per cent of its crude oil requirements. India also imports LPG and natural gas to the extent of about 55 per cent and 50 per cent of their domestic consumption. India does not export crude oil. The installed refining capacity in the country is more than the domestic needs for petroleum products, and thw export of petroleum products are one of the biggest sources of foreign exchange earnings for the country. The government takes into account all relevant factors while making interventions on the calibration of duties and taxes on petroleum products. Recent steps have also been taken in line with this approach of the government, said the Finance Ministry official quoted above.\n\nLast Friday, oil prices nudged higher and registered a weekly gain of more than 1 per cent, as tensions in the world\u2019s top oil-producing region, the Middle East, and a restart of Gaza ceasefire talks in the coming days kept traders on edge. On Friday, Brent crude futures climbed 18 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $74.56 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $70.34 a barrel, up 15 cents, or 0.2 per cent.",

        "text": "Five days ago, when Sujauddin Sardar contacted the police to follow up on the death certificate for his brother-in-law, Sabir Malik, he was informed of something the family had asserted since the 22-year-olds murder on August 27-that Malik had been lynched by cow vigilantes over false accusations of cooking beef.They confirmed what we have been repeating to the police and government, reported The Indian Express.Nearly two months after Malik, a migrant worker from West Bengal employed as a ragpicker in Haryanas Charkhi Dadri, was killed over suspicions that he had cooked and eaten beef at his shanty, police confirmed on Friday that a lab report showed the meat was not from cattle. Ten individuals have been arrested, with six arrests still pending, police said.On August 27, Malik and his friend, Aseeruddin, were called to a shop by the accused under the guise of selling empty plastic bottles and then attacked.While Aseeruddin managed to escape, the accused allegedly took Malik on a motorbike to another location and assaulted him further, which led to his death. His body was later found near the shanties where he lived, according to police.In fact, just hours before Malik was killed, police were called to the village by a group of youths claiming that beef was being cooked and consumed in the shanties. Although the meat was seized by police and sent for testing, the accused decided to take matters into their own hands and beat Malik to death, officers reported.On Friday, Bharat Bhushan, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Badhra, told: The cooked meat collected from the spot was sent to a molecular lab in Faridabad. It has emerged that the meat was not cattles.Pooja Vasisht, Superintendent of Police, Charkhi Dadri, stated, We have arrested 10 people, and this report will be submitted in the court along with the challan. Bhushan added that six more arrests would follow.The complainant in the case, 21-year-old Sardar, is now back in Kolkata with Maliks widow, his sister Shakeela, and her three-year-old daughter.He stated that they were aware of Haryanas cow protection laws. We had been staying there for five years and never flouted the law. The allegations were levelled against Sabir after a few workers from Assam were questioned by their contractor about what they had cooked. Then cow vigilantes were informed. My brother, father, and I were taken to the police station to ask if we had beef. They said the village was on edge, and we might get into trouble if we went home. When they visited the village to collect the meat, they could have taken Sabir and others with them. Had the police stood guard until things settled down, Sabir would not have been killed, he said.Sardar recounted that from the police station, he rang his sister to check on Sabir, but she said he had gone out. When he didnt return in an hour, we asked the police to check. Around 4.30 pm, we were informed he was in hospital. He had died by then, Sardar said.After his post-mortem, they asked us to bury him there, but we begged them to let us take the body back home.The family shared that Shakeela, Maliks widow, has since been given a job by the West Bengal government.Alauddin Sardar, a relative who also lived in the same shanties, said they are still waiting for the post-mortem report and death certificate.We left all our belongings and possessions, worth Rs 2 lakh, after his death. We have not returned out of fear. The police are yet to arrest a few people, and the group that watched him get assaulted included several individuals, he said.One of the accused, Ravinder, was reportedly the district head of the Haryana Gau Raksha Dal, according to the Bhiwani head of the organisation, Sanjay Parmar.The accused were part of Ravinders team. We have faith in law and order and will let the law take its course, Parmar said.Ravinders friend and social activist, Shivendra Rimpi Phogat, commented, There were repeated tip-offs regarding cow slaughter in the area, and our men had informed the police. It was wrong of them to take the law into their hands, but the police did little to avert the incident.Phogat further alleged that the police had manipulated the sample for the lab report.",

Various investigative agencies are working in collaboration with the state governments to deal with the fraud that is going on in the name of digital arrest. National Cyber Coordination Centre has been established to create coordination among these agencies,\u201d PM Modi said. \u201c\u2026Under digital arrest fraud, callers portray themselves as police, CBI, RBI, or narcotics officials, and they talk with a lot of confidence. People asked me to talk about this in Mann Ki Baat. It is important for you to understand this. The first step is your personal information. They collect all your personal information. 2nd Step is the atmosphere of fear. They will scare you so much that you won\u2019t even be able to think. Step 3- The time pressure\u2026 Victims of digital arrest are from all sections and ages. Many people have lost lakhs of their hard-earned money. If you ever get a call like this, don\u2019t be afraid. You should know that no investigating agency does such an interrogation over the phone or video call. There are 3 steps of digital security- stop, think, and take action. If possible, take a screenshot and do the recording.

        "text": "New Delhi: The health coverage for all citizens aged 70 years and above irrespective of their income status under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) is likely to be rolled out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 29, an official source said. The U-WIN portal developed for maintaining an electronic registry of routine immunisations, which is currently operational on a pilot basis, will also be launched by the prime minister on the same day.Besides the two, some other projects will also be launched on Tuesday, the source said. The U-Win platform, which is a replication of the COVID-19 vaccine management system Co-WIN, has been developed to keep a permanent digital record of vaccination of pregnant women as well as children from birth up to the age of 17 under the Universal Immunization Programme.\"The PM is likely to launch the expanded scheme under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme for those aged 70 years and above. It will benefit an estimated six crore citizens in about 4.5 crore households,\" the source said.Be it poor, middle class, upper middle class or rich, every individual who is 70 years and above is eligible for getting Ayushman card and will receive free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh at any of the AB PMJAY empanelled hospitals once the expanded scheme gets launched.Till September 1, 2024, a total of 29,648 hospitals, including 12,696 private hospitals, have been empanelled under the PMJAY. The scheme is being implemented in 33 states and Union territories currently except for Delhi, Odisha, and West Bengal.Anyone aged 70 or above as per Aadhar card, will be eligible for applying for the scheme, the source said. It is an application-based scheme and people will need to register on the PMJAY portal or on the Ayushman app, official sources said.\"Those already having the Ayushman card will need to again apply for a new card and complete their eKYC again,\" the source said. Senior citizens aged 70 and above belonging to families already covered under AB PM-JAY will get an additional top-up cover up to Rs 5 lakh per year for themselves (which they do not have to share with the other members of the family who are below the age of 70 years).All other senior citizens of the age 70 years and above will get a cover up to Rs 5 lakh per year on a family basis. Senior citizens aged 70 years and above, who are under private health insurance policies or Employees' State Insurance scheme, will be eligible to avail benefits under the scheme, officials had said earlier.However, those already availing benefits of other public health insurance schemes such as the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and Ayushman Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) may either choose their existing scheme or opt for AB PM-JAY.The scheme has covered 7.37 crore hospital admissions, including 49 per cent women beneficiaries. The public has benefited to the extent of over Rs 1 lakh crore under the scheme, the health ministry had said earlier.The AB PM-JAY scheme has witnessed continuous expansion of the beneficiary base, it said, adding that initially, 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families comprising the bottom 40 per cent of India's population were covered under the scheme.In January 2022, the Centre revised the beneficiary base from 10.74 crore to 12 crore families considering India's decadal population growth of 11.7 per cent over the 2011 population. The scheme was further expanded to cover 37 lakh ASHAs/AWWs/AWHs working across the country and their families for free healthcare benefits.",

        "text": "Vote jihad' and fake narratives will not work in the upcoming Maharashtra election and the Mahayuti alliance will return to power after the November 20 polls, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said today.\n\nMr Fadnavis, Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister, spoke at NDTV Marathi's Jahirnama event which saw the biggest newsmakers in Maharashtra politics share their insights on the upcoming election.\n\n\"Vote jihad was the real (factor) in Lok Sabha election. People from a particular community voted against the BJP. The aim was to remove Modi. It will not work this time,\" Mr Fadnavis said.\n\nThe BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP (Ajit Pawar) alliance won just 17 out of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi of Congress, Sena (UBT) and NCP (Sharad Pawar) put up a stellar show.\n\nIn a separate interaction with NDTV's editor-in-chief Sanjay Pugalia, Mr Fadnavis said the Maharashtra voter does not give fragmented verdicts. \"During the Lok Sabha election, Maha Vikas Aghadi created a fake narrative. We have countered it with a straight narrative. Now people know they lied. They said (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji would come and change the Constitution and end reservation. So, people voted for Rahul Gandhi and MVA. And Rahul Gandhi went abroad and said the need for reservation is declining and they will end it. Their lies have died and our truth is out. So we will be elected,\" he said.\n\nThe BJP leader was referring to Mr Gandhi's remark during his recent visit to the US during which he said, \"We will think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place and India is not a fair place.\" The remark sparked a massive row back home, with the BJP slamming the Congress leader and saying it would not allow reservations to be scrapped.\n\nOn the Dalit vote factor in Maharashtra polls, Mr Fadnavis said, \"Dalit voter is important. But, in a large state like Maharashtra, no single community can decide the election. The Dalit voter had gone away from us due to fake narratives in the Lok Sabha election, but they have returned.\"\n\nA 'Roko' Barb At Rivals\n\nTaking a swipe at Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders, Mr Fadnavis said they were just interested in roko -- meaning stop. \"If there is discussion on development, I bet our rivals won't be able to participate. Because they always worked to stop (projects) -- bullet train roko, Metro roko, Mahamarg, Atal Setu roko, airport roko. Our work is thoko - finish work and progress,\" he said.\n\nMr Fadnavis also criticised a section of the media, saying that they are more interested in focusing on political leaders' barbs against each other instead of development initiatives.\n\nOn the Eknath Shinde government's development agenda, Mr Fadnavis said a river-linking project aimed at making Maharashtra drought-free is in the works. \"We will have Vadhavan Port in the next few years. It will put India on the global maritime map. It will not only help Maharashtra in its economic growth but also become a growth engine for India.\"\n\nSanjay Raut's 'Vote Jihad' Swipe\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Raut responded to the BJP's Vote Jihad offensive. \"Fadnavis should explain what is vote jihad. Wasn't it a vote jihad when Muslim votes went to Modi in 2019? When you get Muslim votes, it is not vote jihad and when the same votes come to the Congress or us, it is vote jihad?\" Mr Raut said at the NDTV event.\n\nThe term 'vote jihad' became a talking point during the Lok Sabha polls when Samajwadi Party leader Maria Alam asked Muslim voters to wage \"vote jihad\" against the BJP.\n\nPrime Minister Modi had targeted the INDIA Opposition bloc over the remark and said, \"Terrorists in Pakistan are threatening jihad against India. And here, those in Congress have also announced vote jihad against Modi, which means people of a particular religion are being asked to vote unitedly against Modi. Imagine what level the Congress has stooped to. Do you agree with Vote Jihad? In a democracy, can it be done? Does our constitution allow this kind of Jihad?\" he had said.\n\nTargeting the Mahayuti alliance, Mr Raut said, \"These people have mortgaged the pride of Maharashtra in Delhi. These people have disrespected the Marathi manoos.\"",

Rammohan Naidu has said.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Minister inaugurated two new flights between Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada at Visakhapatnam International Airport, on Sunday (October 27, 2024). He cut a cake and handed over the tickets to the first passengers of the two new services of IndiGo and Air India Express.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Mr. Rammohan Naidu said: \u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan are keen on the development of Andhra Pradesh and as Civil Aviation Minister, I am doing my best for the development of all airports. Visakhapatnam is the biggest city in A.P. and Amaravati is the capital. We plan to make Andhra Pradesh as the most sought after investment destination and connectivity is most important for it.\u201d\n\nHe said that on an average two new flights were being introduced among various destinations every month. New flights were introduced from Vijayawada to Mumbai and Bengaluru and a new flight was introduced from Tirupati to Delhi. A new flight was being introduced from Kadapa to Hyderabad today and another would be operated from Rajahmundry to Delhi from December 1. International connectivity would be increased from A.P.\n\nHe also spoke on the importance of increasing international cargo services from Visakhapatnam International Airport and said that measures would be taken in this regard. On the directions of Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, the Civil Aviation Ministry has taken it as a challenge and has advanced the time for completion of Bhogapuram International Airport.\n\nThe new schedule for completion has been fixed for June 2026. The renovation of Vijayawada Airport would be completed in nine months. New terminals would be constructed for the Rajahmundry and Kadapa Airports and the Tirupati Airport would be renovated so that the design reflects the spirituality of the place.\r\n\nSabarimala pilgrims\r\n\nMr. Rammohan Naidu said that certain changes have been made in the civil aviation rules to allow Ayyappa devotees, going for darshan to Sabarimala, to board the flights by keeping the \u2018Irumudi\u2019 on their heads. This facility would be temporarily available till January 20, 2025.\n\nReplying to queries, he said that the Government of India was serious on the increasing hoax bomb calls, and had taken up the issue with all stakeholders. Two changes were being made by the Civil Aviation Ministry to impose strict penalties on mischief mongers apart imposing a ban on flying by such persons.\n\nRajya Sabha Member Golla Babu Rao, Visakhapatnam West MLA PGVR Naidu, officials of AAI, Air India and IndiGo were present.",

But those uniform pre-selected gifts by HR/admin no longer cut ice with employees who would rather prefer personalised gifts. And India Inc is taking cognisance. A new study by AdvantageClub.ai, an employee engagement platform, shows there has been a 75 per cent rise in digital gift preference among corporates in the last three years. The reasons include technology incorporation, changing demographics, and the need for flexibility in gift selection. With 72 per cent of workplaces using digital platforms for their employee rewards and recognition, it\u2019s natural for them to use those platforms during festivals like Diwali.\n\nOn digital platforms, employees can exchange their vouchers for a huge selection of products and even experiences like scuba diving. According to a study by Technopak, the corporate gifting market in India, estimated at \u20b912,000 crore, is expanding by over 200 per cent annually.\n\nThe missing 145 million women\n\nA new report by Magic Bus India Foundation, an NGO that works in the skilling space, in collaboration with management consultancy Bain & Company outlines a roadmap to double India\u2019s female labour force participation rate from 35-40 per cent to 70 per cent by 2047.\n\nThe report, titled \u2018From Aspiration to Action: Building India\u2019s 400 Million Women Workforce\u2019, says India\u2019s workforce is projected to add only 110 million women to its workforce by 2047, reaching an FLFPR of 45 per cent \u2013 that is 255 million women. To meet the gap of 145 million missing women who need to be integrated into the workforce, the report proposes a couple of livelihood models \u2013the first a self-sustaining entrepreneurship model and the second a targeted skilling initiative that will lead to job readiness.\n\nThe report highlights that the challenges are distinct for rural and urban women. Approximately 70 per cent of the women out of the workforce by 2047 are expected to reside in rural areas, where limited job opportunities and unstable work environments reduce workforce participation. Meanwhile, urban women face challenges such as job-skill mismatches, and undervaluation of domestic work compared to market jobs.",

It plans to enter into agreements with various customers to provide Human Resource-related services, primarily, Manpower Supply services, to customers located outside India who do not have an establishment or presence in India. \n\nThese customers will be availing general staffing services, such as the supply of Contingent labor (Contractual resources) and FTE placements (Permanent resources) at various locations in India in their end- client offices/factories as per the requirement raised by their various Counterparts located in India or outside India. \n\n Also read: Pre-paid vouchers constitute supply of \u2018goods\u2019, taxable at 18%, rules UPAAR\n\nUnder the supply of contingent labor, the applicant will manage their complete payroll life cycle from Joining to Exit and will charge a fixed marked-up fee on the monthly payroll/CTC of contractual resources. \n\nLikewise, a one - time fee will be charged for FTE (Full -time) placements.

During his trip, which coincided with Navratri, PM Modi attended a performance of \"Phalak Phalam,\" the Lao version of the Ramayana. He was struck by the devotion and dedication of local artists to the epic, which mirrored the reverence Indians have for the Ramayana. \"A few weeks ago, I also went to Laos. It was the time of Navratri and there I saw something amazing. Local artists were presenting \"Phalak Phalam\" - 'Ramayana of Laos'. There was the same devotion in their eyes, the same dedication in their voices, that we have for Ramayana,\" PM Modi said. PM Modi visited Laos on October 10 at the invitation of Laos's Prime Minister, Sonexay Siphandone, to attend the 21st ASEAN-India and the 19th East Asia Summits. Upon arrival, he was welcomed by the Minister of Home Affairs of Laos, Vilayvong Bouddakham. PM Modi was also accorded a ceremonial Guard of Honour. Following that, he interacted with the Indian diaspora in Vientiane. He greeted Indian community members as they were excited to meet him outside the hotel in Laos. The Prime Minister also met several world leaders on the sidelines of ASEAN-India, and East Asia summits in Laos. After he addressed the 21st ASEAN-India summit in Vientiane, Prime Minister Modi met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. During his two-day visit, he held meetings with leaders from Laos, Thailand, and New Zealand. He also met with other top leaders like South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and the newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. In his address at the East Asia Summit PM Modi said India has always supported ASEAN unity and centrality and that ASEAN is at the centre of ASEAN's Indo-Pacific vision as well as Quad cooperation. The East Asia Summit refers to the Meeting of Heads of State/Governments of the EAS participating countries, which is convened annually. The EAS process was initiated in 2005 with the convening of the 1st East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At its inception, the East Asia Summit comprised 16 participating countries, namely ASEAN Member States, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. In 2011, the US and Russia joined at the 6th East Asia Summit in Bali.",

        "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday spoke about the cyber crime of \u201cdigital arrests\u201d, noting that it has hit all sections of society and urging people to adopt the mantra of \u201cstop, think and take action\u201d when faced with such a scam. In his \u2018Mann ki Baat\u2019 broadcast, Modi said probe agencies are working with states to deal with the issue but added that awareness is essential in protecting oneself from this crime.

He said, \u201cBeware of Digital Arrest frauds.No investigative agency will ever contact you by phone or video call for such an investigation.\u201d Modi asked people to dial 1930 to connect with national cyber helpline or connect with its portal and also inform police about such a crime. They should record such conversations and also take screenshots, he said touching on the crime which has been frequently reported. In his broadcast, the prime minister also lauded increasing impact Indian talents have been making in the world of animation. He said a wave of creative energy is sweeping India. \u2018Made in India\u2019 and \u2018Made by India\u2019 is shining brightly in the world of animation, he added. The prime minister said Indian animation characters like Chhota Bheem, Krishna and Motu Patlu have become widely popular. Indian content and creativity are being liked across the globe, he added. India is on way to creating revolution in animation, and Indian games are also getting popular, Modi said.

        "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday addressed the issue of \"digital arrest\" in the 115th episode of 'Mann Ki Baat', labelling it as a fraudulent activity. He urged people to remain vigilant and safe.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister emphasised that those involved in the crime are enemies of society. \"There is no system like digital arrest in the law, this is just fraud, deceit, lie, a gang of criminals and those who are doing this are enemies of the society,\" the PM cautioned.\r\n\r\nAddressing the growing cases and concerns about techno-crime, PM Modi informed listeners that various investigative agencies were collaborating with state governments to combat these fraudulent schemes. He said to enhance coordination among these agencies, the National Cyber Coordination Centre has been established.\r\n\r\n\"This initiative aims to strengthen efforts against cybercrime and protect citizens from such scams, reaffirming the government's commitment to ensuring public safety in the digital realm,\" said the PM.\r\n\r\n\"Beware of Digital Arrest frauds...No investigative agency will ever contact you by phone or video call for enquiries...The fraudsters of digital arrest phone calls, at times, impersonate police, CBI, and Narcotics; and at times RBI... using such various labels, they converse as fake officers with a lot of confidence. Many listeners of '#MannKiBaat' have wished that we must discuss that. Let me tell you, how these fraud gangs work. What is this dangerous game? It is very important for you to understand this and it is equally important for others to understand it as well,\" said the PM.\r\n\r\nDuring the radio talk, PM Modi played a video to make people understand the gravity of the crime. While making the audience understand the modus operandi, PM Modi said, \"The First Move... They collect all of your personal information... \"You went to Goa last month, didn't you? Your daughter studies in Delhi, right\u009d? They collect so much information about you that you will be surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"The second move - create an atmosphere of fear... Uniform, government office set-up, legal sections... they will scare you so much on the phone... In the midst of the conversation, you will not be able to even think. And then their third move begins - the time pressure. \"\r\n\r\nYou have to decide now or else you will be arrested these people create so much psychological pressure on the victim that one gets scared. People from every class and age group fall victim to Digital Arrest.\r\n\r\nPeople have lost lakhs of rupees earned through their hard work, out of sheer fear. Whenever you receive such a call, don't be scared. You should be aware that no investigative agency ever inquires like this through a phone call or a video call,\" the PM said.\r\n\r\nPM Modi enumerated the three steps to Digital Security. These three steps are -- 'Stop Think Take Action' As soon as you get a call, stop... don't panic, stay calm, don't take any hasty steps, don't give away your personal information to anyone; if possible take a screenshot and record it for sure.\r\n\r\nAfter this comes the second step. The first step was 'stop' and the second step was 'think'.\r\n\r\nNo government agency threatens you on the phone like this, neither inquires nor demands money on a video call like this. If you feel scared, then know that something is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe first step, the second step and now I spell out the third step. In the first step, I said - 'Stop'... in the second step I said - 'Think', and the third step tells you - 'Take action'.\"\r\n\r\nHe also mentioned the national cyber helpline 1930, or to report on cybercrime.gov.in, or inform family and police, and preserve evidence.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, then think, and then take action, these three steps will become the protector of your digital security,\" said the PM.\r\n\r\nThe PM said that thousands of such fraudulent video-calling IDs have been blocked by the agencies. Lakhs of SIM cards, mobile phones and bank accounts have also been blocked.\r\n\r\n\"Agencies are doing their job, but for protection from scams in the name of digital arrest, it is very important that everyone is aware, every citizen is aware. Those who are victims of this kind of cyber fraud should let as many people as possible know about it. You can use #SafeDigitalIndia for awareness,\" the PM said.\r\n\r\nPM Modi also urged schools and colleges to involve students in the campaign against cyber scams. \"We can fight this challenge only with the collective efforts in society,\" he said.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 27 (IANS) In the recently concluded BRICS Summit in Kazan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted exquisite artworks from Jharkhand and Maharashtra to state heads of Russia, Iran and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe gifts that PM Modi gave to world leaders include Jharkhand\u2019s popular Sohrai Painting to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Mother of Pearl vase to the President of Iran, and a Warli painting to the President of Uzbekistan.\n\nWith PM Modi gifting captivating paintings and exquisite artwork to the world leaders, the artisans and craftsmen of both states saw their products shine on a global platform.\n\nSohrai Painting: A timeless folk art tradition\n\nThe Sohrai painting from Jharkhand\u2019s Hazaribagh district is a beautiful representation of the region\u2019s indigenous artistic traditions and is recognised as an ODOP (One District One Product) item.\n\nSohrai paintings are known for their use of natural pigments and simple tools. Artists often use brushes made from twigs, rice straw, or even fingers to create intricate designs. They have been traditionally created by women, especially during festivals and harvest seasons. The art is a form of gratitude for the harvest and is believed to bring good fortune for the coming year.\n\nMother of Pearl Vase: A masterpiece of coastal craftsmanship\n\nThe Mother of Pearl (MOP) sea shell vase from Maharashtra is a captivating example of fine craftsmanship that combines natural beauty with the rich artisanal tradition of the region.\n\nMother of Pearl, known for its iridescent shimmer, is sourced from the inner layer of certain mollusc shells. It has been prized in many cultures for its symbolic associations with purity, tranquillity, and prosperity.\n\nThe vase features a visually appealing mosaic design, with small, carefully cut pieces of Mother of Pearl in various shades of yellow, black, white, and gray. It represents the perfect blend of nature\u2019s beauty and human craftsmanship. By using sustainable materials from the sea and traditional techniques, artisans create pieces that are as timeless as they are beautiful.\n\nWarli Painting: A traditional art with a modern identity\n\nWarli painting is a tribal art form originating from the Warli tribe primarily located in the Dahanu, Talasari and Palghar regions of Maharashtra, India, renowned for its simplicity and deep connection to nature and daily life. This tribal art form is one of the oldest in India, with roots tracing back to around 3000 BCE.\n\nThe art was traditionally created by Warli women on the walls of their mud homes during special occasions like weddings and harvest festivals. Through their art, they documented their lifestyle, customs, and rituals in a visual storytelling format that transcended language.\n\nWhat makes Warli art distinctive is its monochromatic colour scheme. Traditionally, Warli artists used a white pigment made from rice paste, applied on the earthen, red ochre background of the mud walls. Warli painting is more than just an art form\u2014it is a living narrative of tribal culture, spirituality, and life\u2019s simple yet profound truths.",

        "title": "Israeli strikes on Gaza kill 22, officials say, as truck ramming near Tel Aviv hurts dozens",
        "text": "TEL AVIV (Israel ): Israeli strikes on northern Gaza have killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Sunday, as the Israeli offensive in the hard-hit and isolated north entered a third week and aid groups described a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel said it targeted militants. In a separate development, a truck rammed into a bus stop near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, wounding 35 people, according to Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom rescue service. The circumstances were not immediately clear, but Palestinians have carried out dozens of vehicle-ramming attacks over the years. The attack occurred near the headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency. Iran's supreme leader, meanwhile, said Israeli strikes on the country over the weekend \u201cshould not be exaggerated nor downplayed,\u201d while stopping short of calling for retaliation, suggesting Iran is carefully weighing its response to the attack. On Saturday, Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old leader, who would make the final decision on any response, said \u201cit is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country.\" The exchanges of fire have raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which include Hamas and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion earlier this month after nearly a year of lower-level conflict. Apparent attack near Tel Aviv MDA released footage of a large truck with a mostly empty bed that appeared to have slammed into a bus. In addition to being near the Mossad headquarters, the bus stop is also close to a central highway junction, and the incident came as Israelis were returning to work after a weeklong holiday. Asi Aharoni, an Israeli police spokesperson, told Israeli public broadcaster Kan that the \u201cattacker was neutralized,\u201d indicating police were treating the incident as an attack. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the suspect was stopped or killed. Aharoni said a truck had slammed into a bus and individuals waiting at the stop, and that there were wounded people stuck under the vehicle. MDA Director Eli Bin said six of the wounded were in serious condition. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks over the years. Tensions have soared since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, as Israel has carried out regular military raids into the occupied West Bank that have left hundreds dead. Most appear to have been militants killed during shootouts with Israeli forces, but Palestinians taking part in violent protests and civilian bystanders have also been killed. Red Cross describes \u2018horrific circumstances\u2019 in northern Gaza The Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service said that 11 women and two children were among the 22 killed in the strikes late Saturday on several homes and buildings in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. It said a further 15 people were wounded and that the death toll could rise. It listed the names of those killed, who mostly came from three families. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on militants in a structure in Beit Lahiya and took steps to avoid harming civilians. It disputed what it said were \u201cnumbers published by the media,\u201d without elaborating or providing evidence for its own account. Israel has been waging a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza since Oct. 6, saying that Hamas militants have regrouped there. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement in the yearlong war. Israel says its strikes on Gaza only target militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Aid groups have warned of a catastrophic situation in northern Gaza, which was the first target of Israel's ground offensive and had already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war . Israel has severely limited the entry of basic humanitarian aid in recent weeks, and the three remaining hospitals in the north \u2014 one of which was raided over the weekend \u2014 say they have been overwhelmed by waves of wounded people. The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday said that ongoing Israeli evacuation orders and restrictions on...",

        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 27 (IANS) External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Sunday asserted that India has emerged as a leader in fighting terrorism under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \n\nFurther, amid tense global scenarios and ongoing Iran-Israel and Ukraine-Russia war, he said that India is ready to provide all possible support in the times to come.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Mumbai, Jaishankar said that as far as terrorism is concerned, India has adopted a zero tolerance policy.\n\n\u201cI am in Mumbai which has become a counter terrorism centre for the country and for the world especially after the 26/11 terror attacks. The UNSC\u2019s Counter Terrorism Council summit recently held in Mumbai and in the same hotel which was attacked by the terrorists. We have to be very clear. We say zero tolerance for terrorism and we should not have a repeat about what happened in Mumbai. It cannot be day time doing business and nighttime terrorism\u2026 this will not be accepted. We will expose terrorism and then we will act,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nJaishankar said that after the disengagement agreement between India and China to end the standoff between armies of two countries, India will focus on de-escalation.\n\n\u201cIndia and China on October 21 reached a disengagement agreement whereby soldiers belonging to both the countries will resume patrolling as they did before the 2020 border face-off. The agreement is anticipated to ease patrolling in the Depsang and Demchok areas where patrolling will be restored. However, for implementation of this agreement, it will need some time.\u201d\n\nHe further said, the next level is de-escalation and the third larger issue is how do you manage the border and how do you negotiate the boundary settlement,\u201d he added.\n\nAs far as Kashmir is concerned, he said, \u201cWe have been very clear that there is cross border terrorism\u2026 we have felt that there are many ways to deal with the issue. When Assembly elections were held, voter\u2019s turnout was more than 60 per cent and it was a big statement considering the people\u2019s response. Who wins is a secondary part. India won that day, that many people put their faith on the government\u2019s move to scrap article 370 and remove the hold of separatist policy.\u201d\n\nThe minister said that he went to Pakistan recently with a clear message that India would not compromise on its zero tolerance policy.\n\nOn the issue of entry of illegal migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar, Jaishankar said that the government\u2019s focus is to tighten the border security.\n\nJaishankar made a strong pitch for a double engine government to achieve the Viksit Bharat goal.\n\n\u201cFor Viksit Bharat, Viksit Maharashtra is necessary. Maharashtra is the most industrialised with a long history. There are factories, technology, research, quality of people, environment but there are new possibilities. With the implementation of Centre\u2019s India Middle East Economic Corridor initiative, Maharashtra will benefit a lot with investors investing in ports, logistics, roads and railways. Investors are interested to invest in the state,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nJaishankar however, also called for proper alignment between the Centre and the states to implement slew of development decisions and attract investments.\n\n\u201cInvestors are coming to India and Maharashtra as they look at various factors including governance, alignment between the Centre and the states, smooth implementation of policies on the ground,\u201d he noted.",

Speaking before a packed crowd, Mrs. Obama made an impassioned case that a vote for Donald Trump would directly harm women across the country.\n\nSpecifically addressing male voters, Mrs. Obama described how tighter restrictions on reproductive healthcare could negatively impact women's health in serious ways. With abortion now banned in many states following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, women may find it difficult to access care for conditions like cervical cancer. She warned that Trump's actions go beyond the issue of abortion alone and could ultimately undermine medical progress.\n\nThe former First Lady questioned how the race could be so close given Trump's record. While allies have abandoned the former president, Kamala Harris continues to face high expectations at every turn. Mrs. Obama argued it is unfair for the public to ignore Trump's concerning behaviors and mental state while intensely scrutinizing every word from Harris.\n\nIn making her appeal, Mrs. Obama acknowledged some men may not fully understand women's health experiences. However, she urged all voters to consider the implications of their choice, saying \u201ca vote for him is a vote against us.\u201d She also assured women that their vote is private, emphasizing \u201cyou get to choose.\u201d\n\nThe speech highlighted the high stakes of this election, particularly for women's rights and well-being.

Final results are anticipated by early Monday, reports Kyodo News.\n\nA total of 1,300 candidates are competing for the 465 seats \u2014 289 in single-seat districts and 176 through proportional representation.\n\nIshiba dissolved the lower house on October 9, just eight days after taking office, pledging to restore public trust in politics and advance key policy initiatives.\n\nThe 67-year-old premier has promised to ease the inflationary burden on households, bolster national defence against regional threats, and enhance regional economies and disaster resilience.\n\nHowever, during the 12-day campaign, the LDP faced backlash after reports emerged that the party provided 20 million yen (approximately $132,000) to local branches led by members who lacked official party backing due to a slush funds scandal.\n\nThe scandal has shadowed the LDP since late 2023, eroding public support to levels that ultimately led Ishiba\u2019s predecessor, Fumio Kishida, to step down and clear the way for a leadership change.\n\nThe main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), hopes to leverage public discontent with the LDP, which has governed Japan for most of the postwar period.\n\nPrior to the recent dissolution, the ruling camp controlled the more powerful lower house with 288 seats, comfortably above the majority threshold of 233. The LDP held 256 seats, while the CDPJ had 98.\n\nTo achieve its long-sought goal of amending Japan\u2019s Constitution, the LDP must secure a two-thirds majority, or 310 seats, allowing them to propose a revision ahead of a national referendum.",

People asked me to address this in Mann Ki Baat, as everyone needs to understand. The first step involves collecting your personal information. Step two is creating an atmosphere of fear, instilling so much anxiety that you can\u2019t think clearly. Step three is applying time pressure\u2026 Victims of digital arrest come from all backgrounds and ages. Many have lost substantial sums of their hard-earned money. If you ever receive such a call, don\u2019t be afraid. Be aware that no investigative agency conducts such interrogations over the phone or video call. The three steps to digital security are: stop, think, and act. If possible, take a screenshot or record the call. No government agency issues threats over the phone or demands money,\u201d PM Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat address.He further stated that investigative agencies are working in partnership with state governments to combat the scam being carried out in the name of digital arrest.\u201cThere is no legal system called digital arrest; it\u2019s purely fraud, deceit, a criminal enterprise by those who are enemies of society. Various investigative agencies, in collaboration with state governments, are actively working to address this scam. The National Cyber Coordination Centre has been established to foster coordination among these agencies,\u201d he said.PM Modi also encouraged schools and colleges to engage students in the campaign against cyber scams. \u201cWe can only fight this challenge through collective efforts in society,\u201d he added",

The video dates back to December 2019 and shows a Saudi Arabian blogger Mohammed Saud expressing support for Netanyahu, wishing him luck to win the Likud Party\u2019s leadership elections back then.Did Europe Release a Poster Labelling Israeli PM Netanyahu \u2018Terrorist\u2019? No!How did we find out the truth?: We used InVID, a video verification on extension tool on Google Chrome, and divided the video into multiple keyframes.We ran a reverse image search on Google, which led us to the same video on Lebanese news outlet Al Mayadeen\u2019s verified YouTube channel.The video was uploaded in December 2019 and its description identified the person on the phone as one Mohammed Saud.We also came across an article carrying a screenshot of the viral video on Moroccan news website HowiyaPress, which mentioned that Saud was a blogger from Saudi Arabia who had contacted Netanyahu days after the latter\u2019s political party\u2019s elections for a party leader took place.It also carried a link to a now-deleted X post shared by Saud on his account.We looked for the post on Wayback Machine, an internet archiving platform, and found that Saud had shared it with a caption appreciating Netanyahu.Conclusion: An old video of a Saudi blogger and Netanyahu speaking on a video call is being shared with the false claim that it shows a sheikh supporting Netanyahu\u2019s actions.Did Xi Jinping & Angela Merkel Refuse To Shake Hands With PM Modi?

        "title": "Gold loans: Test by fire",
        "text": "Gold loans are used by many Indian households to meet financial exigencies \u2014 the organised gold loan market is valued at \u20b97.1 lakh crore and expected to cross the \u20b914-lakh-crore mark within four years, according to a recent PWC report.\n\nNevertheless, the segment has its share of problems. Governance and compliance lapses are rising in tandem with the growth in gold-loan assets. This issue came to the fore again recently, after the Reserve Bank of India issued a directive highlighting the irregularities in loan sourcing, appraisal, valuation, auction, end-use monitoring, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio monitoring, and application of risk weights.\n\nSpecifically, the banking regulator cautioned banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) against the practice of rolling over loans at the end of the term, evergreening, non-categorisation of gold loans as non-performing assets (NPAs), multiple gold loans under the same PAN, lower realisation from gold auctions, and closure of loan accounts soon after sanction.\n\nThe RBI also highlighted serious lapses such as gold valuation in the absence of customers, credit appraisal and valuation by fintech firms or business correspondents (BC), gold-keeping in the BC\u2019s custody, delayed transportation of gold to bank branches, outsourcing \u2018know your customer\u2019 (KYC) compliance service to fintech partners, and poor verification of end-use of funds.\n\nUnorganised players\n\nConsidering the popularity of gold loans and its deep impact at the grassroots level, regulating the segment is top priority for the RBI. However, this proves challenging, given the dominance of unorganised players at nearly 63 per cent, according to the PwC report. They provide quick loans with little or nil documentation but at exorbitant interest rate. Customers also risk losing valuable collateral. The silver lining is that specialised gold-loan companies and banks are gaining ground.\n\nNotably, the bigger presence of commercial banks promises to make the gold loan market more transparent, regulated and accountable. Public sector banks offer gold jewellery-backed farm loans at lower interest rates. A recent RBI report shows that gold loans from banks are increasing at 41 per cent year-on-year, as of August this year. \n\nOverall, organised sector gold loans have registered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25 per cent between FY20 and FY24, says an ICRA report. Banks dominated this segment with a higher CAGR of 26 per cent since agri loans were included. Banks also have the advantage of low-cost funds. Gold loans offer a means for diversification and risk mitigation through a secured portfolio. This would help strengthen customer base too, says the PwC report.\n\nNBFCs grew their gold loan business at 18 per cent during the period. They have an edge over banks as they employ innovative ways, including digital and AI tools, to boost business. Moreover, banks appear unable to explore the gold-loan market to the full extent as it doesn\u2019t fall in their core business area.\n\nFintech challenge\n\nWith the emergence of new technology partners such as fintechs, systemic risks are on the rise. The RBI\u2019s observations are aimed at making intermediaries \u2014 third-party service providers and technology partners \u2014 more reliable. It is a stern message for lenders to ensure compliance when partnering with fintech companies and outsourcing core business operations, or risk disastrous outcomes.\n\nThe RBI appears a bit wary about the role of fintechs. Though fintechs are contributing significantly to financial inclusion, digitalisation, \u2018ease of doing business\u2019, and streamlining of loan processing, some do stray from their prescribed roles. The onus is on the lenders and NBFCs to ensure their tech partners follow regulatory guidelines, corporate governance practices, and ethical standards. In fact, regulating fintechs is priority for RBI, as was apparent from the alacrity with which it appointed the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) as the first Self-Regulatory Organisation for Fintech (SRO-FT) in August this year. More SROs may be in the offing as fintech regulation requires cutting-edge technologies and close coordination with other regulators.\n\nThe RBI\u2019s scrutiny and three-month window to address procedural lapses and accounting follies offer gold-loan entities an opportunity to create robust internal mechanisms to avert a systemic collapse.\n\n(The writer is ED and CEO, Indel Money)",

That there was a terror attack and there was no response,\u201d Jaishankar told reporters in Mumbai.\u201cMumbai is a symbol of counter-terrorism for India and the world,\u201d the minister said.When India was a member of the UN Security Council, it was chairing the counter-terrorism committee, Jaishankar said. \u201cWe held the counter-terrorism panel meeting in the same hotel that was hit by the terror attack,\u201d he added.\u201cPeople know that India is standing strong against terrorism. We are today leaders in fighting terrorism,\u201d Jaishankar said.\u201cWhen we talk of zero tolerance against terror, it is clear that when somebody does something, there will be a response,\u201d he said.\u201cWe also have to expose. It is not acceptable that you are doing business during daytime and indulging in terror during the night and I have to pretend that everything is okay.\u201cThis India will not accept it. This is what has changed,\u201d the minister said.\u201cWe will expose terrorism and we will act where we have to act,\u201d he added.Jaishankar also said India and China would soon resume patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, restoring the arrangement as it was in April 2020, before the border standoff began.\u201cWe expect to return to pre-October 31, 2020, patrolling arrangements in areas like Demchok and Depsang.

We treasure a democratic and free way of life, and we cannot, and will not, allow any external force to change the future of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, right?\u201d Lai said.Lai told veterans and family members that the October 1949 Battle of Guningtou, when Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) forces beat off an invasion attempt of Kinmen by the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), \u201crepresents our determination to protect our country.\u201dHe reiterated his commitment to maintaining peace and stability while safeguarding Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, expressing his willingness to engage in dialogue with Beijing. \u201cOur insistence on safeguarding a democratic and free lifestyle for generations to come has not changed and will remain unchanged,\u201d he added.\n\nToday marks the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Guningtou, the first winning battle of the #ROCArmedForces in defending peace in the Taiwan Strait.

This victory was significant for the ROC\u2019s morale, marking one of their last successes before retreating to Taiwan.The battle is frequently referenced in discussions about current cross-strait relations, underscoring its lasting impact on Taiwan\u2019s defence strategies and geopolitical tensions, reported Taipei Times.During the final stages of China\u2019s Civil War, the Kinmen battle represented one of the few victories for Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s forces.This visit marked Lai\u2019s second trip to Kinmen since he took office in May. It followed the Taiwan Defence Command\u2019s inaugural night-time live-fire drills aimed at preparing the military for potential PLA invasions under the cover of darkness.The exercises took place in the Wude area of southern Penghu County and were designed to simulate responses to a surprise night-time assault by the PLA.The drills included media attendance and involved comprehensive aerial, naval, and land simulations conducted in darkness. Land exercises utilised CM-21 armoured vehicles and M60A3 tanks, operated by soldiers equipped with night-vision gear.Live ammunition was discharged along local beaches in preparation for a potential land assault. To address a simulated aerial invasion using drones, the army deployed flares to illuminate the night sky, allowing them to fire 120mm mortars upwards, Taipei Times reported.The army stated that the naval simulations considered the possibility of the PLA Navy infiltrating Taiwan\u2019s waters disguised as fishermen, prompting the firing of ammunition from land to sea. Before the drills commenced, the Coast Guard Administration alerted local fishermen and boaters about the upcoming live-fire exercise near Wude.Overall, the drills took place at 18 locations, with over 32,000 rounds of various types of ammunition discharged, showcasing Taiwan\u2019s commitment to its national defence.",

        "text": "VARANASI: A fast-track court in Varanasi rejected Friday a Hindu plaintiff\u2019s plea for an \u201cadditional\u201d survey by ASI of the Gyanvapi mosque complex, using invasive methods to gain access to purportedly razed remains of an ancient Adi Vishweshwar temple believed to exist beneath the central dome.Civil judge (senior division) Yughul Shambhu cited directives from Supreme Court and Allahabad high court barring any excavation during the previous survey by ASI of \u201cPlot No 9130\u201d within the Gyanvapi complex.\u201cBased on the facts and circumstances, it can be concluded that the report submitted by ASI is yet to be examined. Secondly, the structure where a \u2018Shivling\u2019 is stated to have been found is protected by an order of Supreme Court,\u201d Shambhu said.The fast-track court reserved its order during the previous hearing on Oct 19 after Anjuman Intizamia Masajid, the mosque\u2019s custodian, filed objections to advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi\u2019s petition seeking another survey by ASI.114598385Rastogi, who identifies himself as \u201cnext friend of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar\u201d in the original Dec 2019 plea for a survey to find out if the mosque was built over a demolished shrine, told reporters that he would appeal Friday\u2019s ruling in the high court.Gyanvapi is embroiled in multiple litigations, including the Shringar Gauri case filed in Aug 2021 by five women plaintiffs seeking unrestricted access to the mosque complex for daily worship of \u201cvisible and invisible\u201d Hindu deities there.Two previous surveys of the complex, one by a team constituted by the civil judge\u2019s court and the second by ASI, have yielded purported findings that the Hindu side insists are proof of the existence of a temple.The first court-mandated survey in May 2022 revealed the \u201cShivling\u201d in the middle of the wuzukhana, or ablution pond. The then civil judge ordered that the pond area be sealed, while allowing namaz to continue. The same month, SC ordered status quo on the dispute and steps to protect the pond area. The apex court also transferred the case to the district judge\u2019s court.On July 23 last year, the district judge asked ASI to conduct a scientific survey of Gyanvapi in response to a plea from the plaintiffs in the Shringar Gauri suit. The survey was to cover the entire premises, barring the sealed wuzukhana zone, to \u201cdetermine if the mosque had been constructed over the pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple\u201d.ASI submitted its report in a sealed envelope on Dec 18 last year, but it wasn\u2019t opened until Jan 24. The fast-track court, which was separately hearing Rastogi\u2019s plea for a survey of Gyanvapi, directed him to procure a copy of the ASI report before reworking his plea.In compliance with the Dec 30 order, Rastogi submitted a fresh plea in Feb with references to the ASI report. He sought excavation of a trench to gain access to the purported sanctum sanctorum of the ancient temple that is presumed to have been demolished to build the existing mosque.Rastogi contends that the shrine below the central dome houses a towering \u201cShivling\u201d and an artesian well.AIM and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board filed their objections against Rastogi\u2019s plea on various grounds.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: In a step toward solving long-standing flood issues at Lakdikapul, HYDRAA Commissioner A.V. Ranganath and traffic additional commissioner P. Vishwaprasad, along with officials of the HMWS&SB, conducted an on-site inspection on Friday.The team inspected manholes and pipelines from Dwarka Hotel near Telephone Bhavan to Lucky Restaurant along the route to Mehdipatnam. Despite efforts to clear silt from stormwater pipelines, blockages persist due to the severe deterioration of the decades-old pipes and canals. Officials have decided to replace these damaged pipelines and canals with new ones. Ranganath discussed the plan with the GHMC commissioner Ilambharithi, highlighting the need for a quick solution. The project is set to begin within a week and is expected to be completed in just a few days to minimise traffic disruptions. Ranganath also plans to inspect 30 other flood-prone areas in the city, aiming to have preventative measures in place by the next monsoon season. Local residents and shopkeepers expressed their appreciation for Commissioners Ranganath and Vishwaprasad, acknowledging their prompt follow-up on the water logging issues. Many noted that flooding at Lakdikapul Junction has been a problem for over 20 years, with stormwater often flooding their shops during heavy rains.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: Justice K. Lakshman of Telangana High Court dismissed an election petition challenging the election of Kova Laxmi as MLA from Asifabad last year. The judge was dealing with an election petition filed by Ajmera Shyam, seeking set aside of the election of the respondent and declaration of himself as the duly elected candidate.The judge dismissed the election petition within a period of nine months and 20 days, within timelines mentioned in Section 86 (7) of the legislative intent and principle laid down by the apex court.Shyam, represented by senior counsel C. Raghu, contended that the respondent failed to comply with the provisions with regard to submission of nomination as prescribed under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. The submission of nomination by the respondent along with Form-26 was incomplete as she did not submit five years of income tax returns, he said.It was also alleged that the respondent deliberately suppressed her income for particular years thereby committing a corrupt practice under Section 123(2) of the Act.On the contrary, Laxmi challenged the maintainability of the election petition and contended that the same was filed without compliance with the requirement in Form 25. The respondent represented by senior counsel J. Ramachandra Rao inter alia also contended that the election petition was liable to be dismissed on the grounds of false and frivolous allegations made therein.She denied any suppression of her income or misguiding the people/voters of the subject constituency and contended that the election petitioner did not raise any objection during scrutiny of nominations. Ramachandra Rao contended that there was suppression on the part of the election petitioner in the affidavit filed in Form 26 with regard to subsisting government contract.The judge observed that non-disclosure of income-tax returns was not a ground to declare the election void. The judge also noted that nomination of respondent-returned candidate was accepted and there was no improper acceptance.The judge observed. \u201cat the time of receiving the nomination, returning officer will only verify as to whether candidate filled all the columns or not. He cannot conduct a roving enquiry at the stage of scrutiny of nomination in terms of Section 36 of the Act. Moreover, in the present case, the election petitioner did not raise any objection with regard to non-mentioning of income tax returns for four financial years prior to the financial year 2022-23. Therefore, this Court is of the considered opinion that the contention of the election petitioner that the nomination of respondent No.1 - returned candidate was accepted improperly is unsustainable.\u201dThe judge emphasised the purity of elections and how a free and fair election was the sacrosanct thread that wove the country\u2019s democratic fabric. The judge compared the votes received by the election petitioner and the respondent to highlight that the voters had reposed confidence on her.The judge observed that if the non-mentioning of four years I-T returns by the respondent amounted to non-disclosure which is of substantial in nature, the non-disclosure by the election petitioner of government contracts would also amount to non-disclosure of substantial in nature.",

        "text": "The clamour to reintroduce Fort Queen, a 150-passenger capacity ferry owned by the Kochi Corporation from Fort Kochi to either Vypeen or Bolgatty has gathered momentum, in the wake of worsening traffic snarls on roads leading from the city to West Kochi owing to the month-long closure of the two-km-long Kundannoor bridge by the Public Works department for resurfacing.\n\nMaking matters worse, one of the two roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferries that operated on the Vypeen-Fort Kochi route has been withdrawn from service following technical snag. \n\nThe Vypeen-Fort Kochi Passengers\u2019 Association that has been in the forefront of the agitation demanding the introduction of a third ro-ro ferry in the corridor, demanded that Fort Queen that had been idling for the past several months be deployed on the stretch to lessen the woes of commuters in the corridor. \n\n\u201cThe withdrawal of one of the two ro-ro ferries, that too when the Kundannoor bridge was closed down for repair, has come as a bolt from the blue for commuters in the ever-busy corridor. In this situation, the Corporation must deploy Fort Queen in the corridor. It can call at the jetty in Vypeen which was once used by KSINC ferries, considering the inadequate berthing space near the ro-ro jetty,\u201d said Francis Chammany, president of the association.\n\nCiting the Corporation\u2019s inability to operate Fort Queen owing to the need to carry out extensive repair works on the vessel, sources in the agency said it was withdrawn from service since there was little demand for it when it had been deployed a few times to lessen congestion in the Vypeen-Fort Kochi corridor, until a year ago. In this situation, commuters could make optimal use of ferries operated by the State Water Transport department and the Kochi Water Metro in the Ernakulam-Fort Kochi corridor.\n\nThe Maradu municipality has, in the meantime, invited applications from boat operators to ply ferries in the Netoor-Thevara corridor, to cater for commuters who have been affected by closure of Kundannoor bridge.",

        "title": "War cannot solve problems, says PM Modi as Scholz sounds alarm on Russia",
        "text": "The 7th India-Germany intergovernmental consultations (IGC) co-chaired by PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Olaf Scholz resulted in 8 major outcomes, including a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty that is expected to bolster joint efforts against terrorism and separatist elements. Scholz appreciated India\u2019s support for just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and the readiness to use its ties with all parties to facilitate a political solution, as PM Modi maintained war cannot solve any problem and stressed India stood ready to make every possible contribution towards restoration of peace. With delivered and pledged assistance worth 28 billion euro, Germany is second only to the US in providing military aid to Ukraine.Speaking earlier at the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business, in the presence of PM Modi, the Chancellor warned if Russia succeeded with its \u201cillegal brutal\u201d war against Ukraine, there would be repercussions far beyond Europe's borders. Such an outcome, he added, would endanger global security and prosperity as a whole.Launched in 2011, IGC allows comprehensive review of ties as well as identification of new areas of cooperation at the cabinet level. Another important agreement signed was for exchange of classified information that, PM Modi said, reflected deep mutual trust between the 2 countries amid growing defence and security cooperation.Reaffirming commitment to green and sustainable development, both leaders launched an Indo-German Green Hydrogen Roadmap. Among geopolitical issues, the Russia-Ukraine war, West Asia conflict and Indo-Pacific situation were discussed in detail in the meeting.\u201cThe ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of concern for both countries. India has always maintained that war cannot solve any problem at all and stands ready to make every possible contribution towards the restoration of peace,\u2019\u2019 said PM Modi, at a joint press event after the wide-ranging talks.In a joint statement, India and Germany also delivered a message to Russia that the threat of use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable.In his opening remarks, PM Modi also raised the issue of tensions in the Indo-Pacific saying there are serious concerns about the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the region. \u201cIn such times, the strategic partnership between India and Germany has emerged as a strong anchor,\u2019\u2019 he said. Scholz will travel to Goa on Saturday where the German naval frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg and combat support ship Frankfurt am Main, as announced by the Indian government earlier, will make a port call as part of Germany\u2019s Indo-Pacific deployment.The leaders underlined the need for reforms in multilateral institutions, particularly the UN Security Council, with PM Modi saying global forums created in the twentieth century are not capable of addressing challenges of the 21st century. Both India and Germany are members of the G4, along with Brazil and Japan, that seeks expansion of the Security Council and supports each other\u2019s candidature for permanent membership. Scholz also backed an ambitious India-EU FTA, which remains under discussion, underscoring the \u201cenormous potential\u201d to further build and expand trade and investment between the 2 countries.In his remarks at the media event, Scholz said no one can close their eyes to the Russia-Ukraine war and its effects. \u201cThis war, which has been raging for so long now and is claiming so many victims, must finally come to an end. The integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine must be preserved,\" Scholz said, adding Russia\u2019s aggression had put under strain the international rules-based order. Scholz also said it was significant that India was an anchor of stability in South Asia in these times.On other areas of cooperation PM Modi said that a whole-of-government approach to Critical and Emerging Technologies, Skill Development, and Innovation had also been agreed upon. \u201cThis will strengthen cooperation in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductors, and Clean Energy. It will also help in building secure, trusted, and resilient global supply value chains,\u2019\u2019 he said.Welcoming Germany\u2019s Skilled Labour Strategy released for India, PM Modi said he was confident that India\u2019s young talent pool will get better opportunities to contribute to Germany's development.",

The herd is heading toward Telangana and is currently in the Aheri area of the Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra, approximately 30 km from the Telangana border.Forest officials notified residents of bordering villages, referred to as \u2018Dandora,\u2019 about the elephants' movement and advised forest and revenue officials to remain vigilant if they encounter the elephants.In April this year, a wild elephant entered the Kagaznagar forest division and killed two people.Soyam Chinnanna of Salugupalli in Bejjur mandal said that Maharashtra forest officials have just alerted their Telangana counterparts about the movement of wild elephants. He mentioned that while it is unpredictable whether the elephants will enter Telangana, it is prudent to prepare for the situation.Chinnanna noted that the elephants are expected to cross the Chinnavatra-Peddavatra villages on the other side of Peddavagu or Lakkamedala Gutta. However, he emphasised that controlling wild elephants is a challenging task and that forest officials lack the necessary expertise to manage it effectively.A male sub-adult wild elephant had previously strayed into the Kagaznagar forest division, resulting in the deaths of Karu Pochaiah, 50, from Kondapalli village in Penchikalpet mandal, and Alluri Shankar, 45, from Burepalli village in Chinthalamanepalli mandal. These incidents occurred within a span of just 24 hours.",

Haaland's family members were among the children forced into the boarding schools.From 1819 through the 1970s, the United States implemented policies establishing and supporting hundreds of American Indian boarding schools across the U.S. Their purpose was to culturally assimilate Native Americans by forcibly removing them from their families, communities, religions and cultural beliefs.Like the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have in recent years reviewed past abuse toward Indigenous communities, including children in schools.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Democrats burn through cash while outraising Republicans in final weeks of fight for the Senate",
        "text": "Democratic candidates outspent their republican rivals in during the first two week of October in closely contested Senate race in US.According to a recent Federal Election Commission filings, Democrats spent more than three times as much as their their GOP opponents during this critical period of the election in states like Ohio, Montana and Michigan.According to a report in Politico, Despite facing a challenging Senate map, Democrats have benefited from this financial edge, enabling them to allocate significant resources to defend multiple states.Colin Allred, who is running against GOP Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, raised an impressive $11.3 million in just 16 days, surpassing Cruz's $9.9 million. Cruz, however, was the highest-raising Republican senator and the only GOP candidate in a high-profile race to outspend his rival.Vulnerable Democratic incumbents Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio raised $9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, while their Republican challengers only brought in $2.3 million and $1.9 million. This fundraising advantage allowed the Democratic incumbents to maintain a higher cash balance for the final days of the campaign, even after substantial spending in recent weeks, Politico reported.In Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Democratic Senate candidates also raised at least three times more than their Republican opponents in the first half of October. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, independent candidate Dan Osborn raised just over $3 million compared to incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer's $560,000, making the race unexpectedly competitive and prompting last-minute defensive spending from national Republicans.To counter Democrats' financial advantage, Republicans have depended heavily on outside groups to support their candidates in competitive states. For example, the Senate Leadership Fund, the largest Republican super PAC, recently started spending in Nevada, reflecting growing optimism about Sam Brown's challenge to Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen. Additionally, Republicans have utilized innovative fundraising strategies, such as a joint fundraising committee affiliated with GOP candidate Tim Sheehy in Montana, which spent over $1 million on advertising in early October, exploiting a campaign finance law loophole to reduce Tester's cash advantage.",
        "summary": "Democratic candidates significantly outspent their Republican rivals in the first half of October in key Senate races across states like Ohio, Montana, and Michigan. This financial advantage allowed Democrats to allocate substantial resources to defend multiple states, while Republicans relied heavily on outside groups for support.",

Appreciating the government's present stance against the Justin Trudeau regime, Amarinder Singh said \"I think that Prime Minister Modi has taken a brilliant step by calling back the Indian High Commissioner and also downsizing the Canadian staff in India\". \"India and Canada had very good relations at one point, but Trudeau spoilt everything for his political goals\", he added.\u201cWhen I was the Chief Minister, I knew what Trudeau and company were doing and this is the reason I snubbed him in the past too\", the former Punjab Chief Minister maintained.The diplomatic ties between India and Canada hit a new low earlier this month when the Canadian government called Indian diplomats 'persons of interest' in its probe into the killing of Nijjar.Following Canada's accusations, the government recalled its diplomats in Ottawa and later expelled Canadian diplomats in India.CAPTAIN AMARINDER SINGH ON PADDY PROBLEMCaptain Amarinder Singh held Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann responsible for the issues around paddy crops in Punjab. \"The Punjab government has failed to address the issue and the farmers are suffering\", he said after he visited Khanna Mandi on Friday. Captain Singh also attacked Mann for accusing the Centre of poor procurement and lifting issues, saying \"What was he (Mann) doing earlier?\"This was the job of the state government, and it has failed to do it, he said.BATS FOR AKALI DAL-BJP ALLIANCE IN PUNJAB Sharing his thoughts on the current political situation in Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh said that he strongly feels that a Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance must happen for the betterment of the state.Published By: Vivek Published On: Oct 26, 2024Must Watch",

In a self-made video, BJP Delhi Chief Virendraa Sachdeva said that AAP has only three weapons, \u201cHatasha, Nirasha aur Jhoot ka Prachar\u201d \u201cToday in Vikaspuri, people had gone to Arvind Kejriwal with the complaint of poor quality of drinking water. They asked him and his MLA to drink that water. Arvind Kejriwal was rattled at the request. He (Kejriwal) is no longer used to leaving the \u2018Sheesh Mahal\u2019 and walking on the streets. When people ask him questions, he calls it attacks by the BJP. Kejriwal, you have looted Delhi in the name of electricity, water and roads and the public is asking you questions. His MLAs are looting the people of Delhi,\u201d he said.\u201cAAP ke teen hi hathyar hai- hatasha, nirasha aur Jhut ka prachar,\u201d the BJP Delhi Chief said.BJP MP from West Delhi, Kamaljeet Sehrawat also slammed Kejriwal and accused him of making \u201cfalse allegations\u201d when questioned by the people. \u201cWhen the people of Vikaspuri Assembly, troubled by the corruption of Aam Aadmi Party, questioned Arvind Kejriwal and his MLA, instead of answering, they ran away from there by making false allegations. Due to the corruption of the Aam Aadmi Party, the people of Delhi are crying for help. The people of Delhi are fed up with dirty water, broken roads, air pollution and the poor sanitation system, so they are coming out on the streets to protest against Kejriwal,\u201d Sehrawat said.\u201cAnd yes Atishi ji, for the last 10 years you have been cheating the people of Delhi by telling lies. That formula is not going to work now. The people whom you are calling BJP goons are the ones who brought Kejriwal to power. But the people of Delhi are not going to be fooled anymore\u2026because your false promises have been exposed,\u201d the BJP MP said.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday alleged that former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was attacked during a rally in the national capital by the \u201cgoons\u201d of the Bharatiya Janata Party.Posting a purported picture from the site of the incident, AAP alleged that the man who attacked Kejriwal is associated with the BJP.\u201cThe man who attacked Arvind Kejriwal today is a BJP goon,\u201d AAP stated. \n\nThe man who attacked Arvind Kejriwal today is a BJP goon. #KejriwalAttackedByBJP pic.twitter.com/mgrBdXpp5l\n\u2014 AAP (@AamAadmiParty) October 25, 2024\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Atishi alleged that the Delhi Police didn\u2019t take any action against the miscreants who attacked the AAP chief, while further claiming that the former Delhi CM could have \u201clost his life\u201d in the attack\u201cToday during the padayatra, some BJP workers raised slogans against Arvind Kejriwal and attacked him. Anything could have happened to him in this attack. If they had weapons, Arvind Kejriwal could have also lost his life. This attack has clearly been carried out by the BJP because BJP workers had attacked Arvind Kejriwal earlier as well.

        "text": "A special court in Mumbai on Friday rejected former cop Sachin Waze's plea for turning approver, holding that it was not a case where several offenders may escape due to lack of evidence in the money laundering case against former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and others. Waze is also an accused along with Deshmukh and others who are accused of laundering money that they had allegedly extorted from businessmen in lieu of protection by the state government.Special judge Aditee Kadam noted that the evidence collected by the probe agencies, with the specific provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), is sufficient to show the concern of the applicant and other accused with the alleged offence.The court was hearing a plea for pardon in lieu of turning approver and full disclosure against Deshmukh and other accused that Waze had filed. He had filed a similar application in the CBI case related to corruption against Deshmukh and the CBI had given its nod, after which a special CBI court had granted a pardon to him in lieu of full disclosure.\"By filing an application of such a nature, Waze admits that he was privy to the offence allegedly committed by the accused. In such a background, there is no need to seek evidence from the co-accused with a view to fastening liability against other offenders only\", said Justice Kadam, while pointing out that the ex-Mumbai cop's application was devoid of merits and thus deserved to be rejected.The application was opposed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), who claimed that prosecution under the PMLA is against the proceeds of crime with entirely different motives than the other prosecution agency.\"Therefore, considering the nature of the investigation and evidence collected by the ED, it is not required to grant a pardon to Waze, which amounts to giving him a clean chit, when he is equally liable for the offence committed\", the ED contended.The court further observed that the objective of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) Section 306 is to allow pardon in cases where serious offences have been committed by several people and, with the aid of the pardoned person's evidence, the case may be brought to its logical conclusion.The basis of the tender of pardon is not to the extent of culpability of the pardoned accused, but the principle is to prevent the escape of the offenders from punishment for serious offences for lack of evidence, the special court added.The ED's case is that while serving as Home Minister of Maharashtra, Deshmukh, through the then Assistant Police Inspector, Waze collected Rs 4.70 crore from various bars and restaurants in Mumbai. The money was then laundered and routed to the Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukh family.Waze is also an accused in the 'Antilia' bomb scare and businessman Mansukh Hiran murder case, which is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Waze is currently lodged in Taloja Central Prison in this case.Published By: Vivek Published On: Oct 26, 2024ALSO READ | Elgar Parishad case accused seeks contempt action against Navi Mumbai copMust Watch",

        "title": "Army releases redacted police report on altercation during controversial Trump's Arlington cemetery visit",
        "text": "The US Army on Friday disclosed a almost entirely redacted police report detailing an incident in which a member of Donald Trump's campaign staff allegedly pushed an Arlington National Cemetery employee.The report released under a court order, obscures a crucial word that seems to describe the Trump campaign staffer shoving the cemetery worker aside.According to the visible portions of the report, the Trump staffer used both hands while trying to get past the cemetery employee. The names of both individuals are redacted, and the cemetery worker's sworn statement to the police is entirely blacked out. Officials had previously stated that the former president's staffer pushed the cemetery worker when she was trying to prevent two people from filming and photographing Trump's visit to gravesites in Section 60, a sacred area where US forces killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried.The report indicates that the cemetery worker declined medical treatment and did not wish to press charges. American Oversight, a Washington-based government transparency group, filed a lawsuit demanding the release of the police report, and a federal judge ordered it to be made public by Friday. The group has posted the report on its website.Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is in a close race against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, and the altercation raised concerns about his campaign's politicization of the military. Trump was at the cemetery at the invitation of service members' families and brought staff to document the visit. He later shared a video from the visit on TikTok, which included scenes of him at the cemetery and a voiceover blaming the Biden administration for the \"disaster\" of the Afghanistan withdrawal in August 2021.Chioma Chukwu, interim executive director of American Oversight, expressed satisfaction that the report was released, allowing the public to see \"that there is still an ongoing federal law enforcement investigation into the August incident at Arlington National Cemetery.\" Chukwu emphasized that Trump and his staff's conduct \"aligns with his history of politicizing the military and violating clear ethical boundaries, and it's time for the public to have all the facts.\"In a letter accompanying the report, Army senior counsel Paul DeAgostino explained that the redactions were made to protect personal privacy and information compiled for law enforcement purposes.He said that the records are part of an ongoing investigation and their release \"could reasonably be expected to interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings.\"The Army reiterated DeAgostino's comment, stating that it released the report to comply with the court order and that the police investigation \"remains open and we are therefore unable to provide further information at this time.\"It is unclear what law enforcement proceedings are ongoing, as the employee declined to press charges. Families of three service members killed in a suicide bombing during the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal had invited Trump to a ceremony marking the third anniversary of the attack. They said the former president knew their children's stories and have blamed the Biden administration for their deaths.A defense official had previously stated that the Trump campaign was warned about not taking photographs in Section 60 before their arrival and the altercation. During a campaign event in Michigan several days after the incident, Trump complained that family members had asked to take a photo with him at the cemetery, saying, \"They ask me to have a picture, and they say I was campaigning,\" without addressing the TikTok video.",
        "summary": "The US Army released a heavily redacted report on a Trump campaign staffer allegedly pushing a cemetery employee at Arlington National Cemetery.

The ITMS project, conceptualised about a decade ago, is being jointly implemented by the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and the city police.The traffic junctions, where the intelligent traffic signals will come up at a cost of \u20b93.94 crore include PCR Junction, DCP Bungalow, Benz Circle, Nirmala Junction and Ramesh Hospital Junction.Elaborating on the ITMS project, NTR district commissioner of police (CP) S.V. Raja Sekhara Babu explained that the 17 traffic junctions will be equipped with an IP-based system integrated with a command control centre. This will enable police personnel to monitor and adjust waiting times based on real-time vehicle congestion, unlike the current fixed timers at these junctions.\u201cThere will be primary and secondary signal poles at all the 17 junctions. Commuters jumping the primary signal during a red light will be detected by RLVD and ANPR cameras. The system will automatically generate e-challans for traffic violations,\u201d Raja Sekhara Babu pointed out. He said the need for traffic personnel at these signals will decrease with automation of the system.Each of the 17 junctions will have a dedicated green light for pedestrians to cross the road safelyThe CP underlined that the ITMS project will be expanded subsequently to cover 22 additional junctions.",

They include the ruling Maha Yuti comprising BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar-led NCP as well as the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising Congress, Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP). In several cases, more than one member of the family has been given a ticket, by the same party or the other party.The most prominent case of dynastic politics will be the Baramati constituency due to the battle within the Pawar family. The rule of NCP chief Ajit Pawar, the seven-time MLA and state\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister, has been challenged by his nephew Yugendra Pawar, the son of Ajit\u2019s brother Shriniwas Pawar, who has been fielded by Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP).In addition to this, all eyes will be on the battles of Worli and Mahim constituencies in Mumbai, from where Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s son Aaditya and MNS chief Raj Thackeray\u2019s son Amit will be contesting respectively.In an interesting case, Navi Mumbai strongman Ganesh Naik and his son Sandeep Naik are contesting from different parties in different constituencies.

        "text": "In a relief to former ICICI Bank Managing Director Chanda Kochhar's husband and businessman Deepak Kochhar, the Bombay High Court on Friday ruled that no coercive action should be taken against him by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and that he be questioned only during working hours on any day.The bench of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Rohit Wasudeo Joshi passed this order while hearing Kochhar's plea praying that senior citizens like him should be summoned and questioned during working hours only.Kochhar is being investigated under the Prevention of Corruption Act over a high-value loan of over Rs 3,200 crores given to the Videocon group when she was at the helm. On Friday, Advocates Amit Desai and Ashwin Thool submitted before the court that Deepak Kochhar had been summoned on October 22 by SFIO officials and was detained and questioned late into the night which was in complete violation of his fundamental rights.Kochhar filed this plea through Thool and pointed out that he had been summoned by the SFIO although he is neither a director nor a shareholder nor, in any way, affiliated with any of the companies that SFIO is investigating into.Kochhar's plea further pointed out that transactions which are being enquired into by the SFIO, have already been examined by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).THE CASE IN QUESTIONIt was in 2017 that the CBI had initiated a Preliminary Enquiry against Kochhar and his wife, Chanda Kochhar, former MD and CEO of ICICI in connection with the allegations of a link between sanction of loan by the ICICI Bank to the Videocon Group and the investment of Rs 64 crores by VN Dhoot via his company SEPL into Kochhar's Nupower Renewables Ltd (NRL). In 2019, the ED too began it's probe pertaining to the investment of Rs 64 crores and a flat at CCI Chambers in Mumbai. Deepak Kochhar was arrested in 2020 by the financial probe agency and later by the CBI in 2022. He was then granted bail by the High Court.Now, after more than three years, Kochhar received summons from the SFIO to appear before it on October 18. NRPL and Supreme Energy B, C 28 Pvt. Ltd. (a shareholder of NRPL) also received Notices from SFIO to submit information about financial transactions entered into with Videocon Industries Ltd. and its 12 companies.Pursuant to the summons being sent, Deepak Kochhar reported at the SFIO Office on October 22 at 10.30 am. He claimed that the SFIO officials began questioning him at 10.45 am and concluded only around 10.10 pm. The SFIO summoned him again on October 28 for questioning.Published By: Vivek Published On: Oct 26, 2024ALSO READ | Court seeks details of evidence behind closure of Pune Tik-Tok star death caseMust Watch",

Now the word Dravidian was not used to counter Aryan to pulverize Aryanism, he said.Though 2000 years of domination could not be done away with in 100 years, the Dravidian movement had set the state on a journey towards achieving self-respect and an egalitarian society, Stalin said.Ponmudy\u2019s dissertation compares the Black movement in the US between 1909 and 1941 with the Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu from 1916 to 1949.",

The petitioner, Neeraj Saxena, had moved HC earlier this month when he was denied permission to travel by his employer, saying a departmental inquiry was pending against him. On September 26, Saxena had sought REIL's permission to travel to Singapore for six days. However, when he did not received any response until October 16, Saxena moved HC. \"The court had earlier issued notices to the respondents in the case, including REIL. It was submitted by REIL that a departmental inquiry is pending against Saxena and hence he can't be allowed to travel abroad,\" Saxena's counsel Akhil Simlote said. \"It was also submitted that the petitioner was part of a recruitment board in 2019 and there were allegations of irregularities in two recruitments made by the board. However, as soon as we moved an application, REIL, in its reply, stated that a departmental charge-sheet was given to the petitioner,\" Simlote said. The bench said, \"If the petitioner does not return to India within the fixed time period, the department shall be at liberty to proceed against him in accordance with the law.\"",

However, Vucic declined Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invitation to attend the BRICS summit in Kazan this week.\n\nAfter meeting with von der Leyen, Vucic repeated several times that Serbia was on a European path but also said that it would maintain traditionally good relations with other countries.\n\nVon der Leyen said her presence in Belgrade was a testament to the EU\u2019s wish to see Serbia become a member.\n\n\u201cWhat I see is that the President of the Republic of Serbia is hosting me here today and just has hosted the Prime Minister of Greece and the Prime Minister of Poland. That speaks for itself, I think,\u201d Von der Leyen said at the joint press conference.\n\nShe noted that it was her fourth trip to Serbia since taking office, calling that \u201ca very clear sign that I believe that Serbia\u2019s future is in the European Union\u201d.\n\nVucic said it was possible that the next chapter in Serbia\u2019s accession talks could be opened by the end of the year, saying this would be \u201ca significant signal that Serbia is progressing on the European path\u201d.\n\nVon der Leyen also raised the possibility of Serbia becoming a \u201cleader in the field of electric vehicles\u201d about controversial plans to begin mining lithium in western Serbia.\n\n\u201cIt is the industry of tomorrow and we are here to support you every step of the way. We estimate that our great partnership in the field of critical raw materials will bring 20,000 jobs to Serbia and 6 billion euros to Serbia\u2019s gross domestic product,\u201d she said.\n\nBritish-Australian mining company Rio Tinto plans to create Europe\u2019s biggest lithium mine in Serbia\u2019s Jadar Valley, which could provide about one-fifth of the needs for Europe\u2019s electric-vehicle production, but the plans to open the mine have been met with opposition, largely on environmental grounds.\n\nVon der Leyen said that the people of Serbia can be sure that the project will \u201crespect and preserve nature\u201d in Serbia and that mining operators will \u201calways listen and cooperate with local communities\u201d.\n\nHer meeting with Vucic took place in the Palace of Serbia, where several dozen activists opposed to the lithium-mining project gathered across the street. They blew whistles and held banners saying, \u201cSerbia is not for sale\u201d and \u201cUrsula, we believe in Europe, but Serbia is not a colony\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have a complete violation of European values, the rule of law, democracy, and environmental standards. The EU is effectively betraying Europe itself,\u201d said Savo Manojlovic, campaign director of the Go-Change (Kreni-Promeni) movement that opposes the mine.\n\nVon der Leyen arrived in Belgrade from Sarajevo on a four-day tour of the Western Balkans to discuss the European Union Growth Plan, an effort worth 6 billion euros ($6.4 billion) to double the region\u2019s economy over the next decade and accelerate Balkan countries\u2019 efforts to join the bloc.\n\nFrom Serbia, von der Leyen will travel to Kosovo and Montenegro.",

After attending the Congress\u2019 Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting in Delhi, Chennithala said that Congress\u2019 Balasaheb Thorat will meet Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP-SP Chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday to sort out all the issues.\u201cAll is well in Maharashtra, Maha Vikas Aghadi. We are going to fight the election together. There is no problem in Maha Vikas Aghadi. The problem is in Mahayuti. We are together and we are working out a formula, and by tomorrow all seats will be declared. In Mahayuti, the problem is much more. I have asked Balasaheb Thorat to meet Uddhav ji and Sharad Pawar ji to thrash out all the issues,\u201d he told reporters on Friday.Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole said, \u201cWe are demanding some seats\u2026On the seats we have got, we have tried to do justice to OBC (candidates).\u201dCongress leader Balasaheb Thorat also confirmed that the party\u2019s final list will be declared today.\u201cThe final list is most likely to be released tomorrow\u2026We will see if there is scope in seat adjustment and will hold talks with Uddhav Thackeray tomorrow, in line with both our demands,\u201d Thorat told reporters. The Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting of Congress for the selection of candidates for the Maharashtra Assembly polls was held at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters in Delhi on Friday.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal asserted that there are differences in the Maha Vikas Aghadi but MVA will settle them and fight the Maharashtra Assembly election together to bring back Maharashtra to its old glory.Notably, the MVA is still facing the heat from one of its allies, the Samajwadi Party, who is demanding more seats from the alliance to contest in the polls.Samajwadi Party\u2019s Maharashtra Chief Abu Azmi issued a stern warning to the Maha Vikas Aghadi, saying that if the party is not given five seats, it will be compelled to announce candidates on as many as 25 seats.\u201cI have announced five seats. They should give these five seats to me. I will wait because I don\u2019t want votes to be divided. We don\u2019t want to create a rift in the MVA for the sake of votes. If they do not include us, then I will announce candidates for 25 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress are discussing certain seats every day but nothing is finalised,\u201d SP leader Abu Azmi said.Both the ruling Mahayuti alliance and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) \u2014 comprising the Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress \u2014 have intensified their preparations for the upcoming elections to 288 Assembly seats in the State.The BJP is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance alongside the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) and Ajit Pawar-led NCP.The Maharashtra Assembly elections are scheduled for November 20, with counting for all 288 constituencies set for November 23.In the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, the Shiv Sena 56, and the Congress 44.

        "title": "Kerala ADM death | A farewell, a death, and a political row",
        "text": "Trigger warning: The following article has references to suicide. Please avoid reading if you feel distressed by the subject.\n\nAt 6:15 a.m. on October 15, 2024, M. Shamsudeen, a driver at the Kannur District Collectorate, received an unusual call. The person at the other end was the confidential assistant to the outgoing Additional District Magistrate (ADM), K. Naveen Babu. He asked Shamsudeen to check if Babu was at his official house at Pallikunnu, 15 minutes away from the District Collectorate in northern Kerala.\n\nThe previous evening, the Revenue Staff Council had thrown a farewell party for Babu, 55. He was to then leave Kannur and reach Pathanamthitta, his native district, nearly 400 km away, early on October 15 to take charge as ADM for the remaining seven months of his service. But when Babu\u2019s wife, Manjusha, reached the Chengannur railway station, close to their home, along with their daughters at 4 a.m., they did not find him. They asked the railway police, who informed them that Babu had not boarded the train. Unable to contact him, the anxious family dialled Babu\u2019s confidential assistant.\n\nShamsudeen says the drive to Pallikunnu was probably the longest and the most difficult in his 13 years as a driver. He was filled with a sense of foreboding given the time of the call and the confidential assistant\u2019s strange and urgent ask.\r\n\nOn reaching the house, Shamsudeen found the door slightly ajar. He heard Babu\u2019s phone ringing incessantly inside. Alarmed, he did not enter the house. Instead, he called a neighbour, Ranjith, for assistance. Ranjith was equally scared. The two of them contacted the ADM\u2019s gunman for help. When all of them entered the house, they found Babu dead. He was still dressed in the clothes he had worn for his farewell the previous evening.\n\nA farewell that took an unexpected turn\r\n\nOn October 14, as people milled around and chatted with one another at Babu\u2019s farewell, the District Panchayat President, P.P. Divya, landed at the venue. In an unexpected turn of events, Divya, a district committee member of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), publicly rebuked Babu for allegedly delaying the issuance of a no-objection certificate for a fuel station in Chengalai, a village in Kannur. She announced that she would have more to say on the subject in two days and walked out in a huff.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere in the room shifted dramatically,\u201d recalled M.K. Ashwin, a member of the Revenue Staff Council that had organised the event. \u201cWe had not invited her, but she came and made these allegations. We were taken aback.\u201d\r\n\nThere were some camera persons at the farewell. A journalist, who claimed he had been invited by Divya to the function, said he was shocked. \u201cI was there to cover the farewell. Suddenly, she accused him of corruption,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the event, Shamsudeen said he dropped off Babu at the Muneeswaram temple near the railway station. Instead of waiting for the ADM, who was scheduled to take the 8.30 p.m. train, Shamsudeen left as he was instructed. Babu had allegedly told him that he was going to meet someone from Kasaragod. \u201cHe often did that,\u201d Shamsudeen said. He remembered Babu \u201clooking happy\u201d \u2014 the officer had returned from a family trip to Trichy in Tamil Nadu just days earlier and was excited to be going home to Pathanamthitta. He had packed all his belongings.\r\n\nRanjith, who described Babu as \u201csoft-spoken and approachable\u201d, also said the ADM \u201cwas excited about returning to his native place.\u201d \n\nAccusations of corruption\r\n\nAfter Babu\u2019s death, T.V. Prashanth, a contractual electrician at the Kannur Medical College Hospital, who had sought the no-objection certificate for the petrol pump, also echoed Divya\u2019s allegations. \u201cI had been trying to obtain the no-objection certificate for six months,\u201d said Prashanth. \u201cEach time I visited him, I was told to wait. On October 6, he called me and demanded \u20b91 lakh.\u201d\r\n\nHe claimed that Babu had summoned him to his house and demanded the bribe and had also threatened to cancel the application if Prashanth refused his demand. Prashanth said he managed to finally rustle up \u20b998,500 and received the no-objection certificate. He said he informed Divya about the situation and even sent a complaint to the Chief Minister via WhatsApp.\r\n\n Also read | CPI(M) calls Kannur ADM\u2019s death unfortunate, criticises district panchayat president\u2019s remarks\n\nHowever, his \u201crevelation\u201d raised more questions than answers. His signatures in documents that are in the public domain \u2014 the no-objection certificate he received and his complaint to the Chief Minister \u2014 are significantly different. The Health Department for which he works has initiated an inquiry against him. Meanwhile, the Congress had demanded to know who was funding Prashanth\u2019s proposed fuel station.\n\nThe postmortem results confirmed the cause of Babu\u2019s death as suicide. District Police Chief Ajith Kumar clarified that no note or incriminating evidence had been found at the scene.\r\n\nThe incident sparked outrage across political lines. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have demanded Divya\u2019s resignation and arrest. They have accused her of abetting the suicide. With by-elections to two Assembly segments and a Lok Sabha constituency scheduled to take place in less than a month, the Opposition has converted Babu\u2019s death into an election issue, posing tough questions to the CPI(M).\r\n\nChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled Babu\u2019s death and expressed solidarity with \u201chonest government officials\u201d. The Opposition has questioned the fairness of the probe against Divya, as she is still a district committee member of the CPI(M). Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President, K. Sudhakaran, has accused the Chief Minister\u2019s Office of protecting Divya and has demanded a judicial probe into Babu\u2019s death.\r\n\nPraveen Babu, Naveen Babu\u2019s brother, lodged a complaint with the Kannur town police, demanding action against Divya. While the reasons for suicide are often multi-faceted, influenced by social, cultural, biological, psychological, and environmental factors, Praveen said, \u201cHer accusations have tarnished my brother\u2019s reputation and could have pushed him over the edge.\u201d \n\nOn October 17, at Babu\u2019s funeral, Divya S. Iyer, Managing Director of the Vizhinjam International Seaport, who had collaborated with him when she was District Collector of Pathanamthitta, described him as an \u201chonest and a committed official\u201d who had worked for the welfare of the people. \u201cHe was deeply respected. It is the thought that we couldn\u2019t help him during this crisis that makes it all the more painful,\u201d she said.\n\nA divided CPI(M)\r\n\nOn October 17, the police registered a case against Divya for abetment of suicide under Section 108 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. This is a non-bailable offence that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. The CPI(M) immediately removed Divya from the position of District Panchayat President.\n\nAs violent protests erupted on the streets against her, Divya went into hiding. The next day, she sought anticipatory bail from the District Principal Sessions Court in Thalassery. Her counsel presented her as a crusader against corruption and reiterated her charges against Babu. The court is set to pronounce its order on October 29.\n\nDivya also issued a statement the same day. She wrote, \u201cI am extremely pained at the death of Naveen Babu. I will cooperate with the police probe and will legally prove my innocence. I had made a well-intentioned statement against corruption, and I attest to the party\u2019s stand that certain portions in my comments should have been avoided.\u201d She agreed with the CPI(M)\u2019s decision that she should step down as District Panchayat President during the investigation, and submitted her resignation. On October 25, a special investigation team, led by Ajith Kumar, took over the probe into Babu\u2019s death.\n\nThe incident has revealed the differences in the CPI(M). The party\u2019s Pathanamthitta district committee made terse remarks against Divya. Soon after, M.V. Govindan, CPI(M) State secretary, toed the line. K.P. Udayabhanu, the district secretary said, \u201cShe (Divya) should have avoided making public allegations that might have driven the officer to take such a drastic step.\u201d Soon after this statement, Govindan visited Babu\u2019s family and assured them of the CPI(M)\u2019s support. \u201cWhether it is Kannur, Pathanamthitta, or anywhere else in Kerala, the party stands united with the family. We will fully support whatever actions are necessary for the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the State leadership of the CPI(M)\u2019s youth wing, the Democratic Youth Federation of India, said that there was no reason to doubt the complaint raised by Divya, the CPI(M) leadership in Pathanamthitta, which has stood by Babu\u2019s family throughout the episode, rejected its stance. Complicating the matter further, Malayalapuzha Mohanan, a CPI(M) area committee member and State committee member of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the party\u2019s trade union wing, alleged that there was a conspiracy behind Babu\u2019s farewell. He declared that he would end his public life \u201cif anyone could prove that Naveen Babu accepted even \u20b910 as bribe.\u201d\r\n\nTo quell murmurs in the public that there was anger brewing in the party, Udayabhanu asserted that the CPI(M) had one clear stand. \u201cWe stand with Babu\u2019s family,\u201d he said. \u201cDivya has been removed from her post, and a case for abetment of suicide has been filed against her. The District Collector will not oversee the investigation. Both the government and the party will take appropriate action against Divya.\u201d He also criticised Divya for involving the media in what was meant to be a private function, adding that the CPI(M) State leadership would decide the next step.\r\n\nWho invited Divya?\r\n\nWhile the Revenue Staff Council members, who held the farewell function, maintained that they did not invite Divya, she claimed in her bail application that she had been invited by the District Collector, Arun K. Vijayan.\r\n\nThe Collector, who was present at the farewell, denied this claim. He stressed that he had not communicated with either Divya or Babu after the event. During questioning by the police at his residence on October 22, Vijayan reiterated his stance and denied any wrongdoing on his part.\r\n\n Also read | Kannur ADM death: Collector Arun K. Vijayan denies inviting P.P. Divya to Naveen Babu\u2019s farewell event\n\nThe day after Babu\u2019s death, angry revenue officials across the State wore black badges to work as a sign of protest. The District Collector, Vijayan, was also forced to stay away from some public events for a few days, fearing outrage.\n\nMembers of the Kerala Non-Gazetted Officers Association, affiliated to the Congress, staged a protest march to the District Collector\u2019s office demanding a thorough investigation. \u201cWe asked the Collector the reason for his silence when Divya levelled the allegations and also the reasons for inviting her to the event,\u201d said Rajesh Khanna, State vice president of the association.\r\n\nPraveen Babu said, \u201cIf Divya thought Naveen was corrupt, she should have addressed it before instead of calling a press conference to humiliate him at his farewell. We have our doubts. We need to understand whether there was a conspiracy behind Divya arriving at the event uninvited and making such serious accusations against an officer who had an unblemished record.\u201d \n\nWhile admitting that the family got some relief when Divya stepped down from the post of District Panchyat President, Praveen Babu said it was simply not enough. \u201cWe believe that removing someone in a position of power limits their ability [to influence the investigation], but we will only find peace if a fair inquiry is conducted and those responsible are punished. What we seek is complete truth and justice,\u201d he said.\r\n\nAn inter-departmental inquiry has also been initiated into the circumstances surrounding Babu\u2019s death. The inquiry, by Land Revenue Joint Commissioner A. Geetha, has resulted in a report that has been submitted to the Revenue Department Principal Secretary, Tinku Biswal.\n\n\u201cI have not yet received the report, but I expect it soon along with a note from the Principal Secretary. I will then forward it to the Chief Minister and the criminal investigation team handling the case,\u201d said Revenue Minister K. Rajan.\n\nHelpline numbers: If you are in distress, please reach out to these 24x7 helplines: KIRAN 1800-599-0019.

        "text": "The influential Washington Post newspaper, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, announced Friday it will endorse neither Democrat Kamala Harris nor Republican Donald Trump in the US presidential election.CEO William Lewis said this was a return \"to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.\"However, the Post editorial board has endorsed candidates for much of the last four decades -- all of them Democrats -- before deciding to stay on the sidelines in one of the most polarizing elections in US history.Newspaper editorials have little of their once-powerful political heft. But the Post -- whose slogan is \"Democracy dies in darkness\" -- is one traditional media outlet that retains influence among Washington's elite.Trump's campaign quickly pounced, crowing that \"Harris is so bad, The Washington Post decided to never endorse another presidential candidate again.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The Washington Post Guild, which represents unionized staff at the newspaper, said it was \"deeply concerned.\"\"We are already seeing cancellations from once loyal readers,\" a statement said.US media reported that a senior Post figure, editor at large Robert Kagan, had resigned in protest.- Billionaire owners -The Post's decision follows a similar move by another of the big remaining US newspapers, the Los Angeles Times.The billionaire owner of the Times blocked the editorial board from issuing an endorsement for Harris, according to editorial editor Mariel Garza, who resigned in response on Wednesday.According to a report by The Washington Post on its website, Bezos likewise intervened to block the board from publishing its editorial in favor of Harris. However, a source close to the Post's leadership told AFP that this \"is inaccurate.\"By contrast, The New York Times endorsed Harris in September, calling her \"the only patriotic choice for president\" and warning that \"it is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States\" than Trump.On Friday, Harris also scored the backing of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the biggest newspaper in swing state Pennsylvania, which declared that \"voters face an easy but tectonic choice.\"The Republican got his own boost Friday from the New York Post, the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, which declared that \"America is ready for today's heroic Donald Trump to reclaim the presidency.\"- 'Cowardice'? -In a statement, The Washington Post's Lewis wrote that the paper would not make presidential endorsements again.\"Our job at The Washington Post is to provide through the newsroom non-partisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds,\" he said.The Post has been endorsing Democratic candidates consistently as far back as the 1980s, always making clear that the editorial board works separately to the newsgathering operation -- as is typical in US news organizations.The Post's former executive editor, Marty Baron, lashed out at the daily's \"cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.\"Baron said that Trump would see the decision \"as an invitation to further intimidate\" Bezos.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "KYIV: North Korean troops are poised to be deployed by Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine as early as this weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Friday.Western officials have warned that North Korean units joining the fight would stoke the almost three-year war and bring geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. The possibility has alarmed leaders and deepened diplomatic tensions around the war. Zelensky, in a post on Telegram, said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that \"the first North Korean military will be used by Russia in combat zones\" between Sunday and Monday. He said on Telegram that the deployment was \"an obvious escalating move by Russia\". He didn't provide any further details, including where the North Korean soldiers may be sent.US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, meanwhile, met his South Korean and Japanese counterparts on Friday, and the trio expressed \"grave concern\" over North Korean troop deployments in Russia, the White House said. The trio called on Russia and North Korea to cease arms and ballistic missile transfers, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.Russia has been conducting a ferocious summer campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago. North Korean units were detected on Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR.The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It estimated the number of North Korean soldiers sent by Pyongyang to Russia at around 12,000, including some 500 officers and three generals. GUR provided no evidence for its claims. Dutch defence minister Ruben Brekelmans said Friday on X that intelligence reports indicated the North Korean soldiers \"will probably first be deployed in Kursk\".",

        "text": "Hackers linked to the Chinese government targeted the phone communications of former US President Donald Trump and Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance as part of their cyber-espionage activity aimed at high-level US targets, CNN reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.According to one of the sources, the Chinese hackers also targeted senior Biden administration officials.US officials this week informed the former president\u2019s campaign that Trump and Vance were among a group of people whose phones were targeted by the Chinese hackers, the report stated. In a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung slammed the Harris campaign for allegedly \u2019emboldening\u2019 China. It was, however, not immediately clear what information, if any, the hackers were able to acquire. Phone communications of current and former senior US officials are coveted by foreign spies, as reported by CNN.In a statement on Friday, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said, \u201cThe US Government is investigating the unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201dAfter the FBI identified the hacking targeting telecommunication firms, the CISA and FBI \u201cimmediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,\u201d the statement said, adding the investigation was underway. The New York Times first reported on hackers targeting the phones of Donald Trump and JD Vance. The effort is part of a broader Chinese hacking campaign that has infiltrated multiple US telecommunications companies in the past several months.Investigators believe the hackers are likely trying to access sensitive national security information, including, in some cases, information on wiretap warrant requests made by the US Justice Department, CNN had reported previously.The report further stated citing sources that there is no indication in this case that the hackers searched for data on Donald Trump and JD Vance linked to US law enforcement activity.The hackers\u2019 targets include major US broadband and internet providers AT&T, Verizon and Lumen. The Chinese government has refuted the allegations. The development comes as China, Iran and Russia continue to make efforts to influence or monitor various aspects of the US election, according to CNN. China has not made a concerted effort to influence the presidential election. According to US intelligence agencies, but has targeted at least 10 congressional, state or local election races with covert social media campaigns.",

        "text": "The Union Ministry of Culture is set to \u201crevive and relaunch\u201d the National Mission for Manuscripts (NMM) and is mulling the formation of an autonomous body to help preserve ancient texts in India.\n\nPresently, NMM is a part of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts. The new body, likely to be named the National Manuscripts Authority, will be an autonomous entity under the Ministry, sources told The Hindu.\n\nThe Ministry had held a meeting on October 14 to discuss the way forward. The meeting, chaired by Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, was attended by experts such as former chairperson of the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, and well-known linguist Udaya Narayana Singh, professor K. Ramasubramanian of IIT Bombay, M. A. Alwar of the Samskriti Foundation, Sudha Gopalakrishnan, founder director of NMM, Chamu Krishna Shastry, chairman of the Bhartiya Bhasha Samiti, and Shrinivasa Varakhedi, vice-chancellor of the Central Sanskrit University, Delhi. The expert group also included a programme manager from Google Arts and Culture.\n\nThe meeting took stock of NMM\u2019s achievements since its establishment in 2003, Mr. Singh told The Hindu. The NMM informed that till date a metadata of 52 lakh manuscripts has been prepared and roughly over 3 lakh titles have been digitised, he said. However, only one-third of them have been uploaded.\n\nConcerns were expressed on mismatches between digitised metadata and actual manuscripts which were now being hand-corrected. \u201cIf it has not been properly done, it is a huge task,\u201d Mr. Singh said.\n\nA senior NMM official said that out of the nearly 1.3 lakh manuscripts uploaded, 70,000 were available for viewing because there was no \u201caccess policy\u201d, which means that there is no incentive for private owners to make manuscripts available with them for viewing. Around 80% of manuscripts in India are with private parties.\n\nThe NMM also informed that over the past 21 years, it had undertaken preventive and curative conservation of 9 crore folios.\n\nOn the future roadmap, Mr. Singh said that there was a discussion on setting up of chairs in universities abroad that have departments of ancient Indian studies. The experts opined that these chairs could liaise between the universities and NMM.\n\n\u201cOne of my suggestions was that there should be some intellectual property right and legal expert in this group,\u201d he said. Discussions took place on the need to stop the sale of manuscripts outside India and providing financial help to private owners to preserve the manuscripts as well as their registration. \n\nMr. Singh stressed on the importance of collating information and preservation of non-Brahmi and other lesser-known scripts.",

Additionally, timely allotment of land to entrepreneurs, land subsidies, land use changes, clearances, and the regular updating and monitoring of land banks will also be evaluated. This setup will ensure that officials fulfil their roles responsibly to attract and encourage investment in the districts,\u201d Manoj Kumar Singh said.The Chief Secretary further mentioned that DMs who perform well and attract significant investment will receive higher grading and special recognition.\u201cThis will increase competition and responsibility among officials. Their performance will be assessed based on their efforts to attract investment and improve the credit-deposit (CD) ratio during their tenure. The report will include detailed information about the steps taken, investment efforts, and improvements in the CD ratio. This new arrangement will be implemented in the next 2-3 weeks, which will enhance officials\u2019 accountability and encourage them to expedite development efforts in their areas,\u201d he added.Chief Secretary Singh also highlighted that increased investment in the state will accelerate economic activities and generate employment opportunities for the youth.According to the Chief Secretary, UP\u2019s Credit Deposit (CD) Ratio, which was 47 per cent in 2017, reached an impressive 60.32 per cent in the 2023-24 financial year. \u201cThe government is aiming for a 65 per cent CD ratio target by the end of the current financial year. The increase in this ratio indicates economic stability and a favourable investment environment in the state,\u201d he said.The Chief Secretary noted that districts like Sambhal, Amroha, Budaun, Rampur, Kasganj, Etah, and Moradabad have the highest CD ratios in the state. Conversely, districts like Unnao, Balrampur, and Shravasti have low CD ratios. \u201cSpecial plans will be developed to boost economic activities and improve the CD ratio in these districts. DMs and Commissioners will be informed of their district\u2019s CD ratio every April, allowing them to enhance their efforts to attract investment. He emphasized that the objective of this initiative is not only to attract investment but also to strengthen the significant role of officials in the state\u2019s development,\u201d the Chief Secretary further said",

It\u2019s the first street protest over the \u2018Darbar Move\u2019, which was discontinued in 2020 by the J&K Lieutenant-Governor.\n\n\u201c\u2019Darbar Move\u2018 is a tradition integral to ensuring social integration and good governance across Jammu and Kashmir. People are in chaos and suffering as J&K stands capital-less,\u201d Mr. Rashid said.\n\nCPI(M) MLA M.Y. Tarigami said the restoration of the traditional \u2018Darbar Move\u2019 should be prioritized in the larger interest of both divisions, Jammu as well as Kashmir\u201d. \n\nJ&K Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Choudhary, who addressed a gathering in Jammu on Friday, said, \u201cResumption of the Darbar Move is essential for reviving the economy of Jammu.

A total of 151 government departments would shift capital twice a year in J&K and hundreds of buses and trucks are employed to accomplish the task. Over 10,000 employees moved with it.\n\nIn May 2020, the J&K High Court suggested that the \u2018Darbar Move\u2019 \u201cresults in wastage of tremendous amount of time, efforts, and energy on inefficient and unnecessary activity [say, packing of records]\u201c. \u201cIt\u2019s taxing for security forces too.

The final report issued by them this summer found that at least 973 Native American children died while attending these federal boarding schools.\u201cAs president,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI believe it is important that we do know there were generations of native children stolen, taken away to places they didn\u2019t know, with people they never met, who spoke a language they had never heard.\u201d\u201cNative communities silenced \u2013 their children\u2019s laughter and play were gone.\u201d He said, \u201c\u2026Children abused emotionally, physically and sexually abused, forced into hard labor, some put up for adoption without the consent of their birth parents, some left for dead and unmarked graves,\u201d he further noted.President Biden noted that children who returned home were \u201cwounded in body and spirit.\u201d He made the remarks at the Gila Crossing Community School outside of Phoenix.This was Biden\u2019s first visit to Indian Country as US President and the first time in 10 years a sitting president has visited tribal lands. Earlier in 2014, then-US President Barack Obama had visited the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation, CNN reported.He acknowledged that \u201cno apology can or will make up for what was lost during the darkness of the federal boarding school policy.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re finally moving forward into the light.\u201d (ANI)",

        "text": "Ukrainian President Zelensky has rejected a plan for the UN secretary general to visit Kyiv due to Antonio Guterres's attendance at this week's BRICS summit in Russia, a Ukrainian official said on Friday. Kyiv was enraged by Guterres's appearance at the event in the city of Kazan on Thursday and his handshake with its host, Russian Prez Vladimir Putin. Guterres - who called for a \"just peace\" in Ukraine at the BRICS event and has repeatedly condemned the invasion - discussed a visit to Ukraine with Zelensky when they met in New York in September, deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said. Haq said that since then the UN and Ukraine have been trying to work out a \"mutually convenient time\" for a visit, but that nothing had been decided. The Ukrainian official, who asked not to be named, said Zelensky had now rejected the visit because of the BRICS appearance, without going into further detail. Ukraine's foreign ministry said on Monday that Guterres' acceptance to attend the BRICS summit had damaged the UN's reputation.",

        "title": "Israel targets Iranian military sites, escalating Mideast tensions",
        "text": "DUBAI: Israel launched airstrikes early Saturday on what it described as military targets in Iran in retaliation for a ballistic missile assault Oct. 1, officials said. There was no immediate information on damage in the Islamic Republic. The attack, threatened for weeks by Israel, comes as the Middle East sits on the precipice of a regional war more than a year after an initial attack by the militant group Hamas on Israel. In the time since, Israel has launched a devastating ground offensive in the Gaza Strip and an invasion of neighboring Lebanon, targeting militants long armed and aided by Tehran. Israel's military described the attack Saturday as \u201cprecise strikes on military targets in Iran,\u201d without immediately elaborating. \u201cThe regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since Oct. 7 ... including direct attacks from Iranian soil,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a prerecorded video statement. \u201cLike every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond.\u201d In Tehran, the Iranian capital, the sound of explosions could be heard, with state-run media there initially acknowledging the blasts and saying some of the sounds came from air defense systems around the city. A Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. International flights began diverting around western Iran as news of the strikes broke, flight-tracking data showed. But beyond a brief reference, Iranian state television offered no other details and even began showing what it described as live footage of men loading trucks at a vegetable market in Tehran in an attempt to downplay the assault. Meanwhile, Syrian state news agency SANA, citing an unnamed military official, reported \u201cbarrages of missiles from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories targeted some military sites in the southern and central regions\u201d of Syria early Saturday. It said that Syria\u2019s air defenses had shot some of the missiles down. There was no immediate information on casualties. Iran has launched two ballistic missile attacks on Israel in recent months amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that began with the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That initial attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage back to the seaside enclave. In the time since, more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials who don't delineate between civilians and combatants. The U.N. has said hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped with little food or supplies as Israeli forces close in on the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya, while food and other aid remains scarce in the enclave. Israeli military operations in the West Bank in the time since have killed hundreds more. Israel also has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon and a series of punishing airstrikes that have rattled that country. The strike Saturday happened just as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was arriving back in the U.S. after a tour of the Middle East where he and other U.S. officials had warned Israel to tender a response that would not further escalate the conflict in the region and exclude nuclear sites in Iran. White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement that \u201cwe understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran\u201d and referred reporters to the Israeli government for more details on their operation. Two U.S. officials said the U.S. was notified by Israel in advance of the strikes. They said there was no U.S. involvement in the operation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation. Israel had vowed to hit Iran hard following a massive Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1. Iran said its barrage was in response to deadly Israeli attacks against its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and it has promised to respond to any retaliatory strikes. Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders\u2019 calls for Israel\u2019s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country\u2019s nuclear program. Israel and Iran have been locked in a yearslong shadow war. A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel....",

        "text": "Srinagar, Oct 24 (IANS) Senior BJP leader Ashok Koul said on Thursday that once Gagangir-type attacks stop, only then statehood can be restored to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nTalking to some reporters on the sidelines of a BJP function to pay tribute to the late Prem Nath Dogra, Ashok Koul said, \u201cChief Minister Omar Abdullah has met the Union Home Minister. He will also meet the Prime Minister. There is no harm if Omar has put forth his demand for restoration of statehood. When Gagangir-type attacks stop only then can a final call be taken by the Centre on restoration of statehood to J&K. This decision will be taken only by the Central government,\u201d he said.\n\nKoul said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah are on record about restoration of Statehood to J&K at an appropriate time.\n\n\u201cNow it is the agencies and the Centre that would take a call on whether statehood needs to be restored. Perhaps the timing of the attack at Gagangir was wrong for the terrorists otherwise there would have been casualties of hundreds of workers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that former Chief Minister and National Conference (NC) president Dr Farooq Abdullah has already condemned the incident, and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti has also condemned the attack though guardedly.\n\n\u201cThese incidents need the highest form of condemnation. These are attempts to destabilise the peace and the new government in J&K. Earlier such attacks were carried out in Kathua, Reasi, Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu division, where innocents were targeted and now it is Kashmir. Today also a non-local labourer was injured in Tral which again is highly condemnable,\u201d he said.\n\nReplying to a question whether there should be talks with Pakistan, Koul said no talks can be held with the neighbouring country unless it hands over militant commanders, including Syed Salahuddin to India. \u201cLet Pakistan hand over Salahuddin to India, only then talks can happen,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe BJP leader dismissed any future possibility of restoration of Article 370. He said, \u201cNo power can bring back article 370.\u201d",

        "text": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu announced that the state will become the \u201cDrone Capital of India\u201d during the Amaravati Drone Summit 2024, held in Mangalagiri. As part of his vision to make Andhra Pradesh a leader in drone technology, Naidu revealed plans to allocate 300 acres of land in Orvakal, Kurnool District, for a dedicated drone hub. This initiative aims to make Andhra Pradesh the top destination for drone manufacturing, innovation, and research.In addition to developing the drone hub, Naidu also outlined an ambitious plan to train 35,000 drone pilots to meet the growing demand for skilled professionals in this industry. \u201cDrones will play a crucial role in agriculture, healthcare, traffic management, and even disaster relief,\u201d Naidu said, pointing to the use of drones during the recent floods in Vijayawada, where they delivered food and water to stranded people.During the two-day summit, Naidu promised that within 15 days, the state government would release a comprehensive drone policy designed to attract drone manufacturers and create a business-friendly environment for innovators. This policy will make Andhra Pradesh a testing ground for drone applications, with successful pilot projects set to expand across the state and the country.He assured that drones would be used extensively in police work for surveillance and monitoring, especially to keep an eye on criminal activities.Reflecting on his role in driving India\u2019s IT revolution in the 1990s, Naidu shared how his initiatives, such as launching Hyderabad's HiTech City through a public-private partnership, helped establish the city as a major technology hub. He credited his collaboration with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for opening up India\u2019s telecom sector, which paved the way for the country\u2019s mobile technology boom. \u201cBack then, we brought global tech giants like Microsoft to India, and now, we\u2019re doing the same with drones,\u201d Naidu said.The Chief Minister praised the current leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating, \u201cIndia is on track to becoming the third-largest economy by 2047 under Modi's leadership, and with initiatives like JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) and Ayushman Bharat, we\u2019ve strengthened the country\u2019s digital and healthcare infrastructure.\u201dPublished By: Deepthi Published On: Oct 24, 2024Trending Reel",

        "text": "Padma Shri awardee and former Infosys Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Mohandas Pai has slammed the Karnataka government's \"lack of action\" on traffic and other infrastructure issues in Bengaluru. Andhra Pradesh Minister Nara Lokesh was quick to jump on this, and extended an \"invitation\" to all multinational companies (MNC) in Bengaluru to shift to his state.Nara Lokesh's response came to a tweet by Pai, also known to be a vocal critic of civic issues in Karnataka, in which he claimed that several MNCs in Bengaluru were being forced to consider expanding their operations out of the state capital due to severe infrastructure issues.He said the Karnataka Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister were not fulfilling their promises, leading to a fall in trust among Bengaluru residents.\"Never seen this kind of anger and pain in the last 20 years. Very sad at the misgovernance of the city. False promises, lack of action. Sad day for all of us to have such a non-performing, callous, indifferent govt which treats its own citizens so badly,\" Pai added. Responding to the tweet, Nara Lokesh said on Thursday that he \"would like to extend an invitation to all MNCs to Andhra Pradesh\", where Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has introduced new, business-friendly policies.\"We view industries as vital stakeholders in our state\u2019s welfare and growth. We are ready to offer world-class infrastructure and an exceptional business ecosystem, ensuring both ease and speed of doing business,\" he tweeted. Record-breaking rain in Bengaluru due to the unprecedented has led to flooding in tech parks, forcing companies to adopt work-from-home policies. The heavy downpour has also led to severe traffic jams and water entering offices and homes.In an effort to tackle Bengaluru's infrastructure issues, the Karnataka government on Wednesday announced the formation of a high-level committee to provide long-term solutions to the flooding and traffic issues plaguing the city\u2019s tech hubs.The committee will be chaired by Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar and vice-chaired by state Minister Priyank Kharge.On Wednesday night, thousands of commuters were forced to abandon their vehicles on the Electronic City flyover in Bengaluru due to a massive traffic jam caused by heavy flooding.After being stuck for more than three hours, the commuters chose to walk home. A video doing the rounds on social media captured the chaos, showing people getting off their vehicles and walking.Published By: Karishma Saurabh KalitaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024",

        "text": "The Kerala High Court has reduced the sentence of a rape convict, Iliyas, from seven years to one year, adopting a lenient approach after noting that the convict, who was 19 at the time of the incident, and the minor survivor, were in a consensual relationship.\nThe incident occurred in 2011 when the survivor, aged 13, voluntarily accompanied the convict to Ooty, where the alleged offence took place. The prosecution had alleged that the accused had instigated the survivor, a student of class seven, to accompany him to Ooty, where he subsequently raped her. The accused was arrested after the girl\u2019s family traced her to Ooty and reported her missing. The Sessions Court, in 2016, convicted him under Section 376 IPC, sentencing him to seven years imprisonment. This decision was challenged by the accused before the High Court.\nThe court, presided over by Justice CS Sudha, clarified that the court in no way justifies the act committed by the accused, however, considering the circumstances of the case, it stated that \u201cIn criminal jurisprudence the concept of punishment has evolved from a retributive approach to a reformative approach. The facts and circumstances of the case call for a lenient approach to be taken against A1 (accused), who was just 19 years old at the time of the incident.\u201d\nDuring the trial, it was also revealed that the survivor had admitted to voluntarily accompanying the accused to Ooty with the intention of getting married, despite her father\u2019s opposition to the relationship. The trial court had acquitted the accused under Section 366A IPC, finding no evidence of compulsion or deceit. The High Court, therefore, noted, \u201cThis is not a case where A1, by deceit or fraud, enticed PW2 out of her lawful guardianship.\u201d\nHowever, the court reiterated that the survivor\u2019s age rendered her consent invalid, citing that she was a minor at the time of the incident. The court observed that the survivor, who had turned 17 by the time of her examination before the trial court, had sent letters to the accused expressing her continued desire to be with him. \u201cThere is no case for PW2 that she was forced or seduced into having illicit intercourse with another person. Her testimony shows that she had voluntarily joined A1,\u201d the court remarked.\nThe court invoked the proviso to Section 376(1) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which, prior to its amendment in 2013, allowed courts to impose a lesser sentence than the prescribed minimum of seven years if there were \u201cadequate and special reasons,\u201d highlighting that \u201cThe legislature itself contemplated such a situation and hence the reason why such a proviso was brought into the statute despite a minimum sentence of seven years being prescribed.\u201d\nReferencing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Sukhwinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2000), where it was established that when the survivor herself is a consenting party, proviso to Section 376 of IPC cannot be overlooked. The High Court concluded that \u201cfacts and circumstances of the case made out an adequate and special reason to invoke the proviso,\u201d particularly given the age of the accused and his expression of remorse.\nAs a result, the court modified the sentence imposed by the trial court and reduced it to a period of simple imprisonment for one year.",

This includes placing individuals responsible for such threats on a no-fly list.Meanwhile, the Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) protocols have been modified to effectively handle the ongoing wave of \"random\" online threats targeting various Indian airlines. The BTAC protocol has been adjusted, and a thorough assessment based on a new set of 'red flags' is now being conducted.

        "text": "Pune: Ravichandran Ashwin took his third wicket of the innings while Washington Sundar picked two scalps in the last three overs of an engrossing second session as New Zealand reached 201/5 in 62 overs at tea on day one of the second Test against India at the MCA Stadium here on Thursday.\r\n\r\nResuming from 92/2 in the post-lunch session, Devon Conway started with a cracking cover drive off Jasprit Bumrah to get his fifty. He then capitalised on width from Bumrah\u2019s deliveries by punching off the backfoot and opening the face of the bat late to get back-to-back boundaries.\r\n\r\nFrom the other end, Rachin Ravindra began to find his groove by using Bumrah\u2019s pace to run through the gap between slip and gully for four. Conway continued to be impressive with his drive and reverse sweeps, before poking at a short on a spinning away ball from Ashwin, with the edge caught by Rishabh Pant.\r\n\r\nRavindra took over the run-scoring mantle by lofting Ravindra Jadeja for six, before beautifully flicking Akash Deep for four more. After getting his fifty with a stylish flick going through the hands of short mid-wicket for four, Ravindra had two more boundaries coming off Akash via cut and outside edge.\r\n\r\nThe 59-run stand for the fourth wicket between Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell was brought to a halt by Washington, who turned the tide for India at the fag end of the second session with his dip and drift. Washington got a tossed-up delivery to turn away sharply from the middle stump and hit the top of the off-stump.\r\n\r\nOn outclassing Ravindra with a peach of a delivery, Washington leapt highly in the air. At the stroke of tea, Washington again brought joy to himself and the Indian team by getting a length ball to grip and turn sharply into Tom Blundell, who aimed for a flick but was castled through the gate. Big wickets from Washington in the last 10 minutes of the second session mean India have set themselves a chance to bowl out New Zealand in the final period of the day.\r\n\r\nBrief scores: New Zealand 201/5 in 62 overs (Devon Conway 76, Rachin Ravindra 66; Ravichandran Ashwin 3-48, Washington Sundar 2-34) against India.",

He mentioned the operational multimodal terminal in Varanasi, a logistics hub planned in Gautam Buddha Nagar, and significant expressway projects.\n\n\u201cWe have completed the Purvanchal and Bundelkhand Expressways, and the Ganga Expressway\u2019s main carriageway will be ready by year-end,\u201d he said. Other infrastructure developments include the Delhi-Meerut 12-lane expressway and metro rail projects in six cities.\n\nOn the security front, Adityanath highlighted reforms within the police force, with 1.54 lakh personnel recruited and advanced technologies integrated.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s law enforcement is now equipped to instill fear in wrongdoers, unlike earlier times when criminals had police backing,\u201d he remarked. The creation of the Anti-Land Mafia Task Force has reclaimed 64,000 acres of illegally occupied land.\n\nHe concluded by linking commerce, agriculture, and business growth, drawing on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, and praised central initiatives like the Vishwakarma Yojana for complementing the state\u2019s ODOP scheme in generating employment and attracting investments.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

It also has the MNS headquarters. \n\nThe iconic Shivaji Park ground is also located in nearby Dadar where both the MNS and Sena (UBT) hold their annual Padwa and Dussehra rallies, respectively. \n\nThe constituency has always been with the undivided Shiv Sena or the MNS since 1990. \n\nIn 2009, MNS candidate Nitin Sardesai won from Mahim. \n\nElections to the 288-member State Assembly will be held on November 20 and votes will be counted on November 23.",

In another step towards this goal, the state government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Meta Platforms Inc. to enhance public service delivery through WhatsApp Business and AI technologies. This partnership aims to make government services more accessible, efficient, and citizen-centric by allowing citizens to communicate with the government and access key services through WhatsApp.The initiative will initially focus on sectors like education and skilling, with the potential to expand into other areas. Meta\u2019s generative AI, including its open-source Llama technology, will support the development of e-governance solutions to streamline processes, improve transparency, and reduce document tampering risks.Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh emphasised that this collaboration aligns with the state's vision of making governance user-friendly and accessible to all. Meta India\u2019s Vice President Sandhya Devanathan added that the partnership will democratise access to AI models and facilitate smoother governance through digital innovations.This MoU is part of Andhra Pradesh\u2019s larger digital transformation initiative, aiming to provide 100 key government services through WhatsApp by November 2024. The collaboration hopes to improve public services across multiple domains, including land records, civil supplies, education, and transportation, benefiting millions of citizens.This comes only a few days after Nara Lokesh announced that, within the next 100 days, the state will implement a \u2018digital twin\u2019 for every cabinet minister.

The two-term former US president who has visited India twice before, had also mentioned how Mahatma Gandhi has inspired him and that his fascination with India has also largely been around the Independence icon, his writings, and how his thoughts resonated Obama\u2019s deepest instincts as well.\nIn his book A Promised Land, Obama speaks of Gandhi and how his \u201csuccessful non-violent campaign against British rule became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups\u201d.\nKarnataka minister of law HK Patil said that this special invitation is expected to be sent soon and the state government is hopeful that Obama, who called Mahatma Gandhi the leader of the world, will accept it.\n\u201cThe CM will be writing to Obama this week and the former President\u2019s office has already been informed previously of the Karnataka government\u2019s wish to extend this invitation to him,\u201d confirmed a source in the chief minister\u2019s office.\nThis special celebration was announced by Siddaramaiah in the Budget 2024-25 and an allocation of Rs 2 crore has been set aside for it.\nThe centenary event in Belagavi commemorates Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s leadership at the 39th session of the Indian National Congress in 1924, the only time he presided over a Congress session. It was during this session that Gandhi laid out the strategy for India\u2019s independence from British rule.\nThe session, held from December 26-28, 1924, was organised under the leadership of Gangadhar Rao Deshpande, known as the Lion of Karnataka. Gandhi emphasised non-violence, non-cooperation, satyagraha, and civil disobedience as the key strategies for achieving independence.\nThe event in 1924 was held in an open field on the outskirts of Belagavi, now called Congress Road, and saw over 75,000 participants from across India who landed in this border area between Karnataka and Goa to pledge their unity against the British Raj.\nThe session saw stalwarts of the Indian freedom movement such as Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Morarji Desai, C Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya among others in attendance.\nAs part of the centenary celebrations, minister Patil outlined plans for a series of events, including a photo exhibition, a year-long display of historical artefacts, the installation of a memorial pillar, and several other commemorative programmes.\nPatil also emphasised that the focus will be on rural development and Gandhian Swaraj principles. The celebrations will also feature a comprehensive documentary on the 1924 Congress session, discounts on khadi clothing, the publication and distribution of a mini booklet to raise public awareness, and a photographic exhibition from the historic session. Additionally, a group of Gandhians is organising a Charkha Marathon as part of the celebrations.",

He said that similar information had also been received by the authorities during the previous government,\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s Daily Mirror reported.\n\nHe asserted that the new government didn\u2019t inform the public until the information was confirmed, but took security measures as soon as the information was received.\n\nHerath also urged the public not to fall victim to misleading reports and assured that comprehensive security measures are in place to protect tourists.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States issued a security alert, strongly advising US citizens of a potential attack on tourist locations in a coastal area of Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cThe Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area. Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice. US citizens are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice,\u201d stated the US Embassy in Colombo.\n\nSimilarly, Israel\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) called on Israeli citizens to immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe NSC said that it has raised the travel alert level for Sri Lanka due to \u201ccredible terrorism threats\u201d at the tourist and coastal areas.\n\n\u201cThe travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4. We recommend leaving these areas immediately. For those currently in these areas, we recommend leaving the country or at least traveling to the capital city Colombo, where there is a heavier presence of local security forces,\u201d the NSC alert detailed.\n\n\u201cFor the rest of Sri Lanka, the travel warning has been raised to level 3, and we recommend that Israelis planning to travel to Sri Lanka delay any non-necessary trips to the country. If you do travel to Sri Lanka, avoid the areas for which level-4 travel alerts have been issued,\u201d it added.\n\nAustralia too asked its citizens in Sri Lanka to \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and tourists, including in regional and coastal towns. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions,\u201d it mentioned.\n\nLankan Daily \u2018The Daily Mirror\u2019 revealed that a building in Arugam Bay, which had been converted into a \u2018Chabad House\u2019 by the Israeli nationals could have been a potential target.\n\n\u201cThe elite STF officers had taken control of the security situation and continue to be stationed to date. It was learnt that STF had also kept bomb squads standby for any emergency,\u201d it reported on Wednesday.\n\nSri Lanka remains on high alert even as it continues to investigate the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks carried out by the ISIS-backed suicide bombers that killed 270 people, including 45 foreign nationals and injured over 500.\n\nIn June, former Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe had appointed a Committee of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the actions taken by Lankan intelligence services on the prior information received from their Indian counterparts regarding the Easter Sunday bombings.\n\nWeeks before the coordinated bomb attacks on three churches and several hotels, the Indian intelligence agencies had reportedly alerted their Lankan counterparts about the Islamic State\u2019s plan to carry out such suicide missions.\n\nLast month, the country\u2019s newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had promised to thoroughly investigate the entire episode.",

Operating from the DEO office in Vadodara, the committee oversees fee-related decisions for private schools in seven districts: Vadodara, Anand, Kheda, Dahod, Mahisagar, Panchmahal, and Chhota Udepur. \n\nHowever, the Vadodara Parents\u2019 Association allegations previously claimed that the FRC has been lax in enforcing fee regulations.\n\nIn its recent decision, the FRC approved a 5 per cent increase for 76 schools, which has sparked optimism among school operators still in line for similar fee hikes. \n\nThe approvals are broken down as follows: 25 schools in Vadodara, 0 in Anand, 12 in Kheda, 6 in Dahod, 7 in Mahisagar, 24 in Panchmahal, and 2 in Chhota Udepur, highlighting Vadodara\u2019s position as having the most private schools awaiting fee hike approvals.\n\nLooking ahead, sources indicate that once the provisional fees are determined, school administrators can file appeals before the final fee structure is confirmed. It is common for schools to request increases greater than 5 per cent, leaving it to be seen which institutions will proceed with appeals in the coming days.\n\nGujarat has over 32,000 government primary schools, alongside the establishment of 84 model schools aimed at enhancing educational quality in the state. As of December 2023, only one teacher was staffed 1,606 of these government primary schools. \n\nIn response to the ongoing teacher shortage, the Gujarat government has implemented various measures, including appointing contractual teachers and organising teacher transfer camps to allocate teaching resources better.\n\nInitiated in 2014, the model schools in Gujarat aim to provide high-quality education within the government school system. Currently, 84 model schools across the state cater to upper primary, secondary, and higher secondary classes.",

        "title": "Majority in survey support smoke-free public places in India",
        "text": "New Delhi: Nearly 93 per cent respondents in a survey have favoured making public spaces completely smoke-free while 97 per cent have pitched for declaring airports completely smoke-free, similar to railway stations. A recent poll conducted by the citizen-led initiative \"Tobacco Free India\", which garnered more than 65,000 responses, highlights the growing concern among Indians about the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.The survey has revealed that an astounding 92.72 per cent respondents are in favour of making public spaces completely smoke-free. Conducted in both Hindi and English, the poll included six key questions about smoke-free public places and the health risks associated with second-hand smoke. Across all questions, the majority supported stricter measures to protect women, children and other vulnerable groups from exposure to toxic tobacco smoke in public areas, such as restaurants, hotels and airports.\"While the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003 bans smoking in public places, it still permits designated smoking areas in airports, hotels with 30 or more rooms and restaurants with seating capacities above 30,\" said Dr Uma Kumar, head of the rheumatology department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here.\"This situation continues to pose a significant public health threat. Scientific evidence has unequivocally demonstrated that second-hand smoke can easily penetrate these designated areas, exposing non-smokers to harmful toxins and increasing their risk of various diseases,\" she said.The poll was conducted between October 2 and October 19 on X, involving 65,272 participants. While India has made significant strides in tobacco control -- strictly prohibiting smoking on trains, platforms and station premises as well as banning carrying or sale of tobacco products in railway campuses -- the continued presence of smoking areas in airports remains a concern, said international wrestler Sangram Singh.\"These designated areas, often placed in prominent and attractive locations, seem to invite people to smoke. The presence of smoking zones in places like airports often sends an inviting message to smoke, undermining public health efforts,\" emphasised Singh, a \"Fit India\" brand ambassador.\"The overwhelming support for smoke-free public places demonstrates a growing awareness among Indians about the dangers of second-hand smoke. It is a powerful message that reflects our nation's commitment to protecting public health,\" Kumar said.Dr Colonel Shekhar Kashyap, a renowned cardiologist, said, \"Nicotine is a highly-dangerous and addictive substance that poses serious risks to cardiovascular health and overall well-being. Consumed first hand or second hand, nicotine is equally harmful and can lead to a range of debilitating diseases.\"Launched on October 2, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of India's smoke-free rules, the poll comes at a pivotal time. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has proposed amendments to the COTPA to remove smoking zones altogether -- a move strongly supported by the public, as evidenced by the poll results.These efforts align with the ministry's ongoing countrywide Tobacco-Free Youth Campaign 2.0, which aims at protecting young Indians from the hazards of tobacco. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 13 lakh Indians die each year due to tobacco-related diseases, making it a major public health crisis.The poll also highlighted the particular vulnerability of women and children to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Many respondents expressed concern about the impact of smoke-free environments on the health and well-being of these vulnerable groups.Second-hand smoke imposes a significant economic burden on India. A recent study published in the Journal of Nicotine and Tobacco Research revealed that second-hand smoke causes healthcare costs of Rs 567 billion annually, accounting for 8 per cent of total annual healthcare expenditures.This figure, coupled with the staggering Rs 1,773.4 billion in annual economic losses due to tobacco use, underscores the urgent need for effective tobacco-control measures, including comprehensive smoke-free policies. Beyond cigarette smoking, the use of smokeless tobacco products remains a significant public health challenge in India. These products, which include chewing tobacco, gutkha and pan masala, pose serious health risks and contribute to a range of diseases, including oral cancer, heart diseases and digestive disorders.",

        "title": "Opinion: India At BRICS And The Curious Case Of Iran",
        "text": "All eyes have been on Iran for more than a year. Naturally, the first BRICS summit with Tehran's membership is bound to breed speculation about what the prospective new world order would look like. At home, there needs to be an examination of India's bilateral ties with a country that is seen firmly anti-West in its outlook. \n\nIran and India are sailing in the same boat, at least momentarily: of the West's castigation. The temptation may be high on both sides to form a joint front against Western hegemony in the security space. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held bilateral talks with the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, with a focus on strategic cooperation in and beyond the Middle East.\n\nGlobal Groupings vs Realpolitik\n\nIt can be endlessly debated without inching anywhere close to a resolution whether multilateral global groupings make any difference to realpolitik either domestically or internationally. The signalling, however, remains crucial. To begin with, the West is already perceiving the summit as Russia's show of strength. Headlines like 'Putin Gathers Allies' and 'Putin Hosts Global South Leaders at BRICS Summit Meant to Counterbalance Western Clout' in Western media outlets expose apprehension. \n\nA complex interplay of sectarian interests and regional dynamics shapes Iran's geopolitical strategy. It is in the direct line of fire, thanks to Israel's unchecked belligerence. Already reeling under economic pressure owing to the UN sanctions of 2011, the post-October 7 reality for Tehran is even grimmer. Iran blames the US for almost all of its problems. As such, during the last summit, former president Ebrahim Raisi had anointed Iran's proposed BRICS membership as one of the ways of getting even with the US and the West at large. \u201cIran's membership in the bloc is opposition to American unilateralism.\u201d\n\nIndia Needs To Defines Its Position\n\nRussia and China share this sentiment of BRICS emerging as a counterbalance to the West. But what about India? India has lauded and endorsed Iran's presence in BRICS, but will New Delhi also endorse Tehran's oppressive domestic policies in the name of this cooperative alliance? \n\nIndia has not stopped buying oil from Iran despite the sanctions and disapproving remarks from the West. Yet, bilateral trade between the two countries has dropped by 26% in one year. Geoeconomics informs Iranian perceptions of the bloc as a critical driver. Iran aims to secure increased volumes of oil and non-oil exports to fellow BRICS members, bypassing the dollar. \n\nLike Russia, Iran is engaged in a high-stakes battle with the West. China doesn't particularly enjoy a friendly status, either. New Delhi's balancing act, therefore, is set to be tested on many tricky issues in the near future, including the Israel-Palestine issue. \n\nIndia has been an outlier in a manner. At the last UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for the end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, India was the only founding BRICS country to abstain, along with the newcomer Ethiopia. \n\nDuring the Modi-Pezeshkian bilateral, India was urged to play a more substantial role in the Middle East peace process. But what are New Delhi's realistic options? Calling for peace does not usher in peace; arm-twisting the stakeholders does. \n\nA Sticky Question For New Delhi\n\nAny BRICS decision mandates unanimous agreement. In that sense, it is even trickier than the domestic coalition politics that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has found itself in the midst of after a decade. What will, for example, be India's stand should Iran want a revival of its nuclear plan? India's past tussles with the West over its own nuclear programme may trigger another round of strategic unpleasantness over New Delhi's stance.\n\nIndia has a long-standing policy of strategic autonomy, and the complexity of its relations with the West is par for the course. The question is only of degree. The scope of India's support to its alliance partners in any overtures, real or perceived, against the West needs to be clearly defined, if not announced. While BRICS has achieved precious little in tangible terms in the past 15 years, the symbolism of grouping may have consequences for India as ongoing conflicts stretch into the future and new challenges around them emerge.\n\nOn the other hand, the internal dynamics of the expanded BRICS are going to pose another challenge. BRICS, only a little more than an ad hoc grouping with diverse challenges and interests, has miles to go to emerge as a counterforce to alliances like the G7 or the Five Eyes, where members have been able to thrash out at least a common minimum programme. \n\n(Nishtha Gautam is a Delhi-based author and academic.)\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author",

        "text": "Colombo: Sri Lankan Foreign and Public Security Minister Vijitha Herath revealed on Thursday that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the security threats to Israeli nationals in the Arugam Bay area of the island nation's Eastern Province.\r\n\r\nThe action follows after several countries have issued travel alerts over the past 24 hours considering intelligence information received about a possible terror attack targeting foreigners, especially Israelis, across popular tourist locations in coastal Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nSome reports cited that the intelligence has been provided by India, like it was also reportedly done before the horrific 2019 Easter Sunday bombings which the Lankan security agencies had failed to act on in time.\r\n\r\nThe suspects, all Sri Lankan nationals, caught on Thursday are currently being questioned regarding the incident, Herath said at a special media briefing.\r\n\r\n\"Minister Herath said Sri Lankan authorities received intelligence information from foreign intelligence services about a potential attack on Israeli nationals earlier this month. He said that similar information had also been received by the authorities during the previous government,\" Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror reported.\r\n\r\nHe asserted that the new government didn't inform the public until the information was confirmed, but took security measures as soon as the information was received.\r\n\r\nHerath also urged the public not to fall victim to misleading reports and assured that comprehensive security measures are in place to protect tourists.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the United States issued a security alert, strongly advising US citizens of a potential attack on tourist locations in a coastal area of Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\n\"The Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area. Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice. US citizens are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice,\" stated the US Embassy in Colombo.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Israel's National Security Council (NSC) called on Israeli citizens to immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nThe NSC said that it has raised the travel alert level for Sri Lanka due to \"credible terrorism threats\" at the tourist and coastal areas.\r\n\r\n\"The travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4. We recommend leaving these areas immediately. For those currently in these areas, we recommend leaving the country or at least traveling to the capital city Colombo, where there is a heavier presence of local security forces,\" the NSC alert detailed.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest of Sri Lanka, the travel warning has been raised to level 3, and we recommend that Israelis planning to travel to Sri Lanka delay any non-necessary trips to the country. If you do travel to Sri Lanka, avoid the areas for which level-4 travel alerts have been issued,\" it added.\r\n\r\nAustralia too asked its citizens in Sri Lanka to \"exercise a high degree of caution\".\r\n\r\n\"There is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and tourists, including in regional and coastal towns. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions,\" it mentioned.\r\n\r\nLankan Daily 'The Daily Mirror' revealed that a building in Arugam Bay, which had been converted into a 'Chabad House' by the Israeli nationals could have been a potential target.\r\n\r\n\"The elite STF officers had taken control of the security situation and continue to be stationed to date. It was learnt that STF had also kept bomb squads standby for any emergency,\" it reported on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nSri Lanka remains on high alert even as it continues to investigate the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks carried out by the ISIS-backed suicide bombers that killed 270 people, including 45 foreign nationals and injured over 500.\r\n\r\nIn June, former Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe had appointed a Committee of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the actions taken by Lankan intelligence services on the prior information received from their Indian counterparts regarding the Easter Sunday bombings.\r\n\r\nWeeks before the coordinated bomb attacks on three churches and several hotels, the Indian intelligence agencies had reportedly alerted their Lankan counterparts about the Islamic State's plan to carry out such suicide missions.\r\n\r\nLast month, the country's newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had promised to thoroughly investigate the entire episode.",

        "text": "BMW-owned Mini has unveiled the updated version of the performance-oriented Cooper JCW (John Cooper Works) hatchback. It is available in both hatchback and convertible forms. This JCW version is based on the same Cooper that was launched in India earlier this year in July. The British brand also revealed the JCW Electric with 258 hp and the JCW Aceman at the Paris Motor Show, which took place a few weeks ago.\n\nMechanical Updates\n\nThe petrol-powered JCW versions are equipped with the same potent 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder turbo petrol engine that delivers 228 hp and 380 Nm of peak torque. This offers 27 hp more power and 80 Nm higher torque than the Cooper S sold in India. All this power is sent to the front wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nThe John Cooper Works claims a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 6.1 seconds for the hatchback, while the heavier convertible variant achieves it in 6.4 seconds. The top speed for the hatchback is rated at 250 km/h, with the convertible capable of 245 km/h.\n\nVisual Updates\n\nCosmetic updates to the Mini John Cooper Works include JCW badging on the grille, centrally mounted exhaust unit, a blacked-out rear diffuser, JCW-branded red brake callipers, and 17-inch JCW alloy wheels. There are also optional 18-inch two-tone spoke alloy wheels available.\n\nThe interior features black synthetic leather upholstery with knitted red accents. The dashboard has a knitted surface with a chequered flag pattern. The pedals are finished in stainless steel, and the steering wheel features JCW branding with bespoke fabric trim.\n\nIt is priced between Rs 42.43 lakh and Rs 49.5 lakh (converted from Euro) in Europe. Mini India has not yet made an official statement regarding its India launch, but it is expected to arrive soon.",

Nataraj, representing the UP government, said that demolition was carried out to remove encroachments on footpaths and the plea was filed by a third-party organisation on the basis of newspaper reports.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in an interim order passed on September 17, directed that no demolition will take place anywhere across the country except without its permission after several petitions were filed before the apex court alleging that bulldozer action was taken by various state authorities without sufficient notice. However, the top court clarified that its \u201corder would not be applicable if there is an unauthorised structure in any public place such as road, street, footpath, abutting railway line or any river body or water bodies and also to cases where there is an order for demolition made by a court\u201d.\n\nLast week, the top court refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking direction to recover from administrative authorities the costs of bulldozed houses of individuals accused of criminal activities, riots, or other offences. The Justice Gavai-led Bench said that it could not reopen the issue as it had already reserved its decision on laying down pan-India directives governing demolitions.\n\n\u201cEither you withdraw it, or we will reject it,\u201d it told the PIL litigant.\n\nSensing the disclination of the top court to entertain the matter, the petitioner\u2019s counsel chose to withdraw the plea. The PIL sought direction to make it mandatory to obtain permission from the jurisdictional District Judge before the start of the demolition process of any house, jhuggi or colony, apart from serving notice on the alleged unauthorised or illegal occupant. Further, it sought direction to publish a list of demolished houses district- and state-wise, along with names of DM, SDM, and SP/DCP concerned.",

He emphasised that agreements, once reached, should be followed to the letter. \u201cPrime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception,\u201d Jaishankar said.The minister\u2019s remark comes just days after India and China made a major breakthrough over the border row and reached an agreement to end a four-year-long military standoff in eastern Ladakh. The deal marks a return to patrolling agreements that were in place before the 2020 Galwan clash. The disengagement agreement came after 17 rounds of working mechanism meetings and 21 rounds of military dialogue. The agreement also set the stage for the first bilateral talks between PM Modi and China\u2019s Xi Jinping in five years. PM Modi welcomed the border agreement and said that India-China ties were important for global peace and stability. \u201cMutual trust, respect and sensitivity will guide bilateral relations,\u201d PM Modi said during the delegation-level talks on the sidelines of Brics Summit.At the Brics Summit, PM Modi reiterated India's stance on resolving global conflicts, emphasising that this is not an era of war. The Prime Minister\u2019s peace message came at a time when Russia is at war with Ukraine while Isreal has declared war on Hamas and is in conflict with Iran-backed proxies. Addressing the Brics Outreach session, Jaishankar stressed that there should be zero tolerance for terrorism. He also discussed the escalating situation in West Asia and expressed concern over the potential for the conflict to spread further in the region. \u201cThe situation in the Middle East, West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected. The human and material consequences of further escalation are truly serious.

        "text": "A day after facing flak over its defeat in the Haryana elections - a loss partly attributed to not sharing seats with its state allies - Congress has decided not to contest any of the nine Uttar Pradesh Assembly bypolls scheduled for next month.The party had initially requested to contest at least five seats, including Milkipur in Ayodhya district, which it hasnt won since 1989.Instead, the Samajwadi Party (SP), a member of the Congress-led INDIA bloc, will field candidates for all nine seats, with each candidate standing against the ruling BJP as INDIA bloc nominees.We have decided to save the Constitution... reservation... and harmony. We have decided to build the country as envisioned by Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi) - Babasaheb (Ambedkar) - Lohia (Ram Manohar, an iconic freedom fighter and socialist leader), Akhilesh Yadav posted on X.In his Hindi post, the former UP Chief Minister also shared a photograph of himself standing alongside Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, their hands clasped and raised in victory.Yadav said that the alliance was not based on seat-sharing calculations but on the necessity of cutting into BJPs lead in the UP Assembly.With this unprecedented cooperation, every worker of the INDIA bloc is filled with new energy and the resolve to win all nine Assembly seats, he said.SP-Congress AgreementNews of this Congress-SP alliance followed a prolonged disagreement between the two parties, as the Congress was reportedly pushing to contest at least five seats, while the SP was hesitant to concede more than two, given Congress poor performance in recent Assembly and general elections in the state.In the 2022 Assembly elections, the BJP won 255 seats, while the Samajwadi Party secured 111.The Congress only managed to win two seats - Rampur Khas and Pharenda.The SP also won in the April-June general election in the state, taking 37 of the 80 seats, with the BJP winning 33 and the Congress reclaiming six, including their traditional stronghold of Amethi from Smriti Irani.The Congress position was further weakened after the Haryana and Jammu Kashmir election results, where the party faced criticism from its INDIA bloc partners for failing to cooperate with the SP in Haryana. A day after the election results, the SP announced candidates for six of the nine seats, effectively denying the Congress its request for five.Congress Strategy in Maharashtra?According to sources, standing down in Uttar Pradesh was not what the Congress wanted, but the backlash after the Haryana defeat left the party with limited options.There are suggestions that by conceding in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress could be positioning itself strategically to resist the Samajwadi Partys demand for 12 seats in the upcoming Maharashtra elections.The Congress, reluctant to oblige the SP in Maharashtra, believes that allowing the SP to dominate in Uttar Pradesh could strengthen its argument against conceding seats in Maharashtra, particularly since the Congress performed well there in the general elections, winning 13 seats to become the largest single party.In Maharashtra, the Congress has now reached a seat-sharing agreement with the Shiv Sena and NCP factions led by Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Each party will contest 85 seats.The remaining 33 seats will be allocated to smaller parties, with the SP expected to be among them.Symbol Not Important: CongressSurendra Rajput, a senior Congress leader, told ANI that the decision to step aside in Uttar Pradesh was driven by the need to defeat the BJP.INDIA is contesting all nine seats. For us, the symbol is not important... for us, ending the BJPs misgovernance is important... he said.He also referenced Akhilesh Yadavs big-heartedness in Haryana - a nod to the SP leader not, at least publicly, pressing for a seat-sharing deal in that election.Yadav rounded off the joint appeal by saying that his partys strength had increased manifold with the support of the Congress top leadership and booth-level workers.BJPs ResponseRakesh Tripathi, a spokesperson for the BJPs state unit, claimed that the Samajwadi Party was exacting revenge for the Haryana and Madhya Pradesh elections, where the Congress ignored its allys requests for seat-sharing; the Congress was soundly defeated by the BJP in both states.Tripathi also used a wrestling analogy, saying the Congress had been thrown and pinned to the mat.He further claimed that the INDIA alliance has been broken into pieces and that the SP is making the BJPs Congress-mukt Bharat (Congress-free India) slogan a reality.Uttar Pradesh By-election DatesVoting for the nine by-elections will take place on 13 November, with the results announced on 23 November.A by-election for a tenth seat - Milkipur in Ayodhya district - will be held at a later date.",

        "text": "Washington Sundar's inclusion in the second Test against New Zealand was termed as an \"inspired selection\" by former captain Sunil Gavaskar. Sundar replaced Kuldeep Yadav for the crucial match at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. Despite initial criticism, Sundar delivered an impressive performance, taking his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket and achieving his best figures in the format.During the Test, Sundar dismissed key New Zealand batters including Rachin Ravindra, Tom Blundell, and Glenn Phillips. He took his fifth wicket by bowling out Tim Southee. At this point, Gavaskar, who was commentating, said, \"What an inspired selection. He is picked in the XI because he can bat a little bit, bowl a little bit.\u201dIncidentally, Gavaskar and Anil Kumble had questioned Sundar's selection, suggesting Kuldeep Yadav would have been a better choice. Gavaskar had commented, \"The selection of Washington Sundar tells me that the Indian team was worried about their batting. He is in not just because of his off-spin but because he can get more runs at the lower order.\" Sundar's performance proved vital as he helped India bundle out New Zealand for 259 in their first innings, taking seven wickets for 59 runs in 23.1 overs. This reduced New Zealand from 179/3 to 259 all out.India made three changes for this Test, including Akash Deep, Shubman Gill, and Sundar, replacing Mohammed Siraj, KL Rahul, and Kuldeep Yadav. New Zealand made one change, with Mitchell Santner replacing the injured Matt Henry. New Zealand had won the first Test by eight-wickets at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.",

When asked about how he reacts to people's opinions about his divorce, Jayam Ravi said, \"We are in a public medium. Anything I do gets elevated, even if it's just me drinking tea. It is a mass medium; we are mass stars. So, be it good sense or bad sense, everything is highlighted, and we cannot avoid that. People like cinema, people like actors...talking about actors. So, I don't judge them for it.

        "text": "SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch skipped a Parliament's Public Accounts Committee meeting on Thursday, prompting panel head KC Venugopal to postpone the sitting, with NDA members accusing him of taking unilateral decisions and lodging a protest with the Lok Sabha Speaker.\n\nMr Venugopal told reporters that the committee received a communication from Ms Buch at 9.30 am that she and her team will not be able to appear before the panel due to \"exigencies\".\n\nHe indicated his disapproval of her decision noting that Ms Buch had confirmed her presence after her earlier request for an exemption was denied.\n\n\"Considering a woman's request, we thought it better to postpone today's meeting for another day,\" Mr Venugopal said as he along with other Opposition members left the venue minutes after the meeting began amid sharp exchanges between the ruling alliance and INDIA bloc MPs.\n\nAn Opposition member alleged that Ms Buch informing the committee about her decision with less than two hours to go for the meeting to begin virtually amounts to contempt of the parliamentary panel.\n\nBJP members accused Mr Venugopal, a senior Congress leader, of not letting them put across their views. They later charged him with acting in a \"suo motu\" manner, suggesting that his decision to summon Ms Buch and even some other regulatory bodies established by the acts of parliament was his own and guided by partisan politics.\n\nPAC member and BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters that many standing committees review the performance of various bodies e.g. the panel on finance scrutinises the work of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe Communication and Information Technology panel scrutinises the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, he added.\n\n\"Your (Mr Venugopal) own words are suo motu. How did you decide? The PAC's job is to consider CAG reports. We have this information from reliable sources that the CAG has made no mention of SEBI. This entire conduct is unparliamentary. The conduct of the chairperson in the way he adjourned, did not allow us to speak. And (he) walked out (which) shows he has extraneous political considerations,\" Mr Prasad said.\n\nThe former Union law minister said the ruling National Democratic Alliance was in a majority.\n\n\"Our main objection was how did he (Mr Venugopal) make suo motu selection of subjects without consulting other members? Nobody had an inkling of the list that was prepared,\" said Mr Prasad, flanked by other NDA members of the panel.\n\nHe also objected to the PAC secretariat officials leaving the venue after Mr Venugopal adjourned the meeting when many other members remained inside. The NDA members met Speaker Om Birla later to register their protest against Mr Venugopal.\n\nUS short seller Hindenburg Research's accusation of conflict of interest against Ms Buch over the SEBI's probe into the short-seller's allegations against the Adani Group was seized upon by the Congress to seek her ouster and to attack the government, giving political dimensions to the panel's missive to her to appear before it.\n\nPAC member and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to Speaker Om Birla last month against Mr Venugopal, accusing the Congress leader of raking up \"non-existent\" issues to defame the central government and allegedly destabilise the country's financial structure and economy.\n\nAccusing Mr Venugopal of \"unconstitutional and disdainful\" conduct, Mr Dubey said the committee's chairperson actions are guided by political motivations after the Congress was \"compelled\" by voters to sit in the opposition benches following the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nClaiming that unverified allegations by a foreign company like Hindenburg against Ms Buch were part of such a campaign, he alleged that the \"India Chapter\" of this toolkit has become active.",

        "text": "New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has refused to grant permission to the state to challenge the acquittal of three accused persons in a 1984 Sikh riots case after a delay of more than 27 years. A bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma on October 21 noted it was conscious of the large-scale loss of human lives and property but it couldn't condone the \"long delay\" in filing of the appeal by the prosecution.The prosecution, while seeking the \"leave to appeal\", urged the court to condone the delay of 10,165 days in filing the appeal against the trial court's order of acquittal passed on July 29, 1995 in the murder and rioting case.Dismissing the plea, the bench held, \"Considering the long delay and the decisions of the coordinate bench in similar cases, upheld by the Supreme Court, the delay is not liable to be condoned. Thus, leave (to appeal) is not liable to be granted.\"The prosecution, on the other hand, had said the Justice S N Dhingra Committee was constituted in December 2018 to look into the cases in relation to violence and after its report came out in April 2019, internal reviews were conducted and the matters were processed for filing of appeals.Large-scale violence against the members of the Sikh community erupted in Delhi following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her Sikh security guards.",

        "text": "The Press Council of India has adopted a report on the arrests and wrongful detention of journalists in the country, albeit with a dissent note from its chairperson, former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai.\n\nThe report \u2013 Arrests, Wrongful Detentions and Intimidation of Media Personnel \u2013 has been authored by Press Council member Gurbir Singh. It was adopted by the council on September 27 and a copy was shared with Scroll on Thursday.\n\nThe Press Council is a statutory, adjudicating body established in 1966 and operates as per the provisions of the Press Council Act, 1978.\n\n\u201cFive journalists were killed and 226 others were targeted by state agencies, non-state political actors, anti-social elements and criminals across India during 2023,\u201d the report says, citing data from the India Press Freedom Annual Report released on May 3, the World Press Freedom Day.\n\nSingh also points out that, according to private surveys, the Indian news organisations are functioning under \u201csevere constraints\u201d. India was ranked 159 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index 2024, it points out.\n\n\u201cGiving a breakdown of the numbers, the report, released by the India Freedom of Expression Initiative, an alliance of press freedom NGOs, said while 148 journalists were targeted by state actors, 78 journalists were targeted by the non-state actors including political leaders, activists and criminals,\u201d it notes.\n\nThe report also details several cases and complaints that have been placed before the press body for examination, such as the Newsclick case in which the Delhi Police on October 3, 2023, raided the homes of 86 persons associated with the news portal. Of these, 61 persons were journalists. The portal\u2019s founder and editor Prabir Purkayastha and its human resources head Amit Chakraborty were arrested in the raids.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, journalists of The Caravan magazine who were covering the Delhi riots in August 2020 were charged with \u2018inciting communal violence\u2019,\u201d the report points out.\n\nThe report makes three broad recommendations to the Union government, the foremost being \u201cthe need to promulgate a national law for the security and protection of journalists\u201d.\n\nIt also asks that \u201cmore teeth\u201d be given to the Press Council of India Act \u201cso that the watchdog body is better equipped to meet the increasing challenges and threats faced by the Fourth Estate\u201d.\n\nThe Press Council currently can only issue advisory orders that are not enforceable. These do not work as deterrents for unscrupulous elements who may want to browbeat or intimidate press persons, Singh said in the report.\n\nThe report also calls for \u201csensitising police personnel and codifying norms of behaviour for law enforcement agencies towards the Fourth Estate\u201d.\n\nFor instance, before detaining or arresting a journalist, a law enforcement agency should be mandated to verify with the editor or publication if the concerned journalist is on assignment, the report suggests.\n\nSingh has called for \u201ca serious training programme for government personnel from the most senior level down to the junior-most constable to sensitise and generate respect for the constitutional rights and obligations of news networks, agencies and news persons\u201d.\n\nWhile the report has been adopted by the council, its Chairperson Ranjana Prakash Desai recorded a note of dissent.\n\nIn it, Desai questioned the methodology of the French non-governmental organisation Reporters Sans Frontiers, which publishes the World Press Freedom Index.\n\n\u201cThe ranking methodology is questionable and the Press Council of India, in past, has raised its concern about the authenticity and credibility of such reports prepared and published by RSF,\u201d Desai\u2019s dissenting note reads.\n\nShe said that \u201cthe authenticity and reliability of the India Press Freedom Annual Report\u2026by the India Freedom of Expression Initiative, an alliance of press freedom NGOs needs to be looked into\u201d.\n\nDesai said that since the Press Council has contested the ranking of India on the World Press Freedom Index 2024, \u201cthis portion of Shri Gurbir Singh\u2019s communication is not acceptable as it contradicts Press Council\u2019s stand\u201d.\n\nDesai also objected to several cases detailed in Singh\u2019s report as they did not contain the view of the law enforcement authorities.",

        "text": "Chip behemoth Nvidia expanded tie-ups on Thursday with India's big firms, such as Reliance Industries, and launched a lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) model for the widely-used Hindi language, as it looks to tap a growing market.The company NVDA.O is hosting an AI summit in the business capital of Mumbai, at which Chief Executive Jensen Huang chatted with the chairman of conglomerate Reliance RELI.NS, Mukesh Ambani, who is also Asia's richest man.\"Nvidia is AI in India,\" Huang said. \"In just one year's time, by the end of this year, we will have nearly 20 times more compute here in India than just a little over a year ago,\" he added, referring to the infrastructure for computing.From large companies to startups, businesses in India have focused on building AI models based on its diverse languages to grow consumer appeal and drive activities such as customer service AI assistants and content translation.Nvidia said it was rolling out the new small language model, dubbed Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi-4B, with 4 billion parameters, for firms to use in developing their own AI models.\"The model was pruned, distilled and trained with a combination of real-world Hindi data, synthetic Hindi data and an equal amount of English data,\" it said in a statement.Indian IT services firm Tech Mahindra TEML.NS is the first to use the Nvidia offering to develop a custom AI model called Indus 2.0, focused on Hindi and dozens of its dialects, the U.S. company said.Just a tenth of the population of 1.4 billion speaks English in India, where the constitution recognises 22 languages, it added.Besides Tech Mahindra, Nvidia is partnering with India's other IT giants Infosys INFY.NS, TCS TCS.NS and Wipro WIPR.NS, to train about half a million developers to design and deploy AI agents using its software.Reliance and Ola Electric OLAE.NS were among the companies that would use its \"Omniverse\" simulation technology, allowing them to test factory plans in a virtual world.Crowd at eventThursday's event was delayed more than half-an-hour, which managers blamed on the large crowd that gathered to see Huang, the face of the AI chip boom, a number an Nvidia NVDA.O employee described as \"easily a few thousand\".Unlike large-language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, used to power ChatGPT, small language models are trained on much smaller and more specific datasets. Typically cheaper as well, they are more attractive for companies with scarce resources.Global chip firms are investing and setting up facilities in India as it races to build up the semiconductor industry and compete with major hubs such as Taiwan, though analysts say the effort could take years.Since first setting up shop nearly two decades ago, Nvidia has engineering and design centers in India, as well as offices in key cities such as the southern tech hub of Bengaluru and neighbouring Hyderabad.In September last year, Reliance and Nvidia vowed to develop AI supercomputers in India and build large language models trained on its languages. Later that year, Nvidia unveiled a similar partnership with Tata Group.",

A letter signed by more than 20 Liberal lawmakers urges Trudeau to step aside.

However, cracks are forming, with MPs like Charles Sousa saying Trudeau is \"reflecting\" on his future.\u2014 SassyBullfrog (@SassyBullfrog) Conservatives gain groundWith elections looming between now and October 2025, the Liberal Party's future seems uncertain. Recent losses in key special elections in Toronto and Montreal, combined with polling numbers that show the Conservatives leading by 13 points, spell trouble for Trudeau.

        "text": "Indian cricket team skipper Rohit Sharma had to pay the price of ignoring Virat Kohli's advice regarding a DRS review on Day 1 of the second Test match against New Zealand in Pune on Thursday. Rohit and Virat had contrasting views regarding a DRS decision involving New Zealand batter Devon Conway and it resulted in India losing a review. During the 25th over of the New Zealand innings, a delivery from Ravindra Jadeja crashed into Conway's pads and the Indian fielders went for a loud appeal. The umpire did not rule in their favour and although almost everyone seemed convinced that Rohit should go for a DRS, Kohli walked up to Rohit and insisted that the ball was going to miss the leg stump. However, Rohit eventually did go for the review and replays showed that Virat was correct in his assessment.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Off-spin all-rounder Washington Sundar ran through the New Zealand batting order to pick career-best figures of 7-59 as the visitors' were bowled out for 259 by India on day one of second Test at the MCA Stadium on Thursday.Electing to bat first, New Zealand were 197/3 at one stage and it felt like they would go past 300. But Washington displayed an exhibition of drift and dip, while varying his pace well and turned the game on its head for India and keep New Zealand to one below 260.His senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin chipped in with 3-64 as the innings marked the first-ever instance of all ten wickets taken by India's right-arm off-spinners in a Test match. Before the game, Washington being drafted in ahead of Kuldeep Yadav raised eyebrows, but his sensational bowling performance on a slow black-soil pitch shut down all those questions.In the morning, Devon Conway and captain Tom Latham hit five boundaries between themselves, before the latter fell early to Ashwin, who got the length ball to straighten after pitching on leg-stump and trapped the left-handed batter lbw for 15 off 22 balls.Conway and Will Young got some easy singles on offer, while hitting boundaries occasionally to stitch a 44-run stand for the second wicket, with India's spinners bowling quicker through the air. Ashwin then strangled Young down leg, and Sarfaraz Khan, stationed at short leg, prodded captain Rohit Sharma to take a review.Replays justified Sarfaraz's conviction as there was a spike detected on the ultra-edge when the ball passed off the gloves, before being pouched by Rishabh Pant, as Young was dismissed for 18. Conway was solid like a rock, especially in his sweeps, while Rachin Ravindra surviving a few close brushes till lunch came.Resuming from 92/2 in the post-lunch session, Conway started with a cracking cover drive off Jasprit Bumrah to get his fifty. He then capitalised on width from Bumrah's deliveries by punching off the backfoot and opening the face of the bat late to get back-to-back boundaries.From the other end, Ravindra began to find his groove by using Bumrah's pace to run through the gap between slip and gully for four. Conway continued to be impressive with his drive and reverse-sweeps, before poking at a short and spinning away ball from Ashwin, with the edge caught by Rishabh Pant.Ravindra took over the run-scoring mantle by lofting Jadeja for six, before beautifully flicking Akash Deep for four more. After getting his fifty with a stylish flick going through the hands of short mid-wicket for four, Ravindra had two more boundaries coming off Akash via cut and outside edge.The 59-run stand for the fourth wicket between Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell was brought to a halt by Washington, who turned the tide for India in the fag end of the second session with his dip and drift. Washington got a tossed-up delivery to turn away sharply from the middle stump and hit top of the off-stump with a peach of a delivery.At the stroke of tea, Washington again brought joy to himself and Indian team by getting a length ball to grip and turn sharply into Blundell, who aimed for a flick, but was castled through the gate.Post-tea, Washington asked for a review after rapping Daryl Mitchell on the pads with a sharp turning delivery, which proved to be a good review as replays showed ball going on to clip leg-stump. Mitchell Santner tried upping the ante by hitting boundaries, but Washington continued to hurt New Zealand.Glenn Phillips holed out to long-off off him, while Tim Southee and Ajaz Patel were castled by the young all-rounder, and Washington wrapped up the New Zealand innings in style by ratting Santner with grip and turn to take out the off-stump, as the visitors' lost their last seven wickets for 62 runs.(With IANS inputs)",

This is also regarding the role of Congress in the by-elections to be held there.\u201d\u201cThe Election Commission has announced by-elections in 9 out of 10 seats in UP. The BJP has been pursuing its political agenda for the last 10 years to weaken the constitution in the country and to serve its political interests, and to divide and break the brotherhood in the society,\u201d claimed Pandey. He further said, \u201cIn the recent Lok Sabha elections, the people of UP gave a befitting reply to them. Today, with values to protect and save the Constitution, Rahul Gandhi is touring the country and working to give justice to every section of the society.\u201d\u201cKeeping the same values in mind, as per the suggestion of the President of the UP Congress Committee and all the senior leaders there and after taking consent from the Congress President, we have decided that the Congress Party will not field its candidates in UP,\u201d announced Avinash Pandey.\u201cAll the candidates of the INDIA bloc will remain united, strong and support Samajwadi Party (SP) in UP,\u201d said the State Congress in-charge.Recently, under the leadership of UP Congress commitee the Congress held \u201cSamvidhan Bachao Sankalp Sammelan\u201d (save Constitution conferences) on all 10 seats.Avinash Pandey said that these conferences were successfully organised in all the 10 Assembly seats of UP and were attended by thousands of people and workers.\u201cAfter the success of these conferences, we have realized that if we do not stop BJP and NDA today, then in the coming times the constitution and brotherhood will weaken in the country,\u201d stated Avinash Pandey.Meanwhile, after announcing that INDIA bloc candidates would be contesting the Uttar Pradesh bypolls on the Samajwadi Party\u2019s \u2018cycle\u2019 symbol, party president Akhilesh Yadav said on Thursday \u2018humne yeh thana hai, \u2018samvidhan, arshan, sohardh (We have decided to save Constitution, Reservation, Harmony).

Congress and Samajwadi Party are united and standing shoulder to shoulder for a big victory. India Alliance is going to write a new chapter of victory in this by-election,\u201d read the post on X.Congress leader Surendra Rajput further confirmed that the main aim of the alliance will be to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instead of choosing the symbol.\u201cINDIA Alliance is contesting all 9 seats. For us, symbol is not important. For us, the end of BJP\u2019s misgovernance is important. For us, the end of Bahraich riot perpetrators is important. For us, it is important that there be security, peace and safeguarding of Constitution.

        "text": "In what promises to be a thriller in the bypolls, Channapatna Assembly constituency will witness a mega battle as Nikhil Kumaraswamy has been named the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate to take on C.P. Yogeshwar, who filed his nomination on a Congress ticket on October 24. \n\nMr. Nikhil\u2019s candidature as Janata Dal (Secular) candidate was announced by his grandfather and former Prime Minister H.D. Devegowda in Bengaluru after consultations with JD(S) party workers from Channapatna. Soon after, BJP strongman and former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa officially announced Mr. Nikhil as the NDA candidate. \n\nThis will be Mr Nikhil\u2019s third foray into electoral politics. In 2023, he lost in Ramanagara constituency during the Assembly elections in Karnataka. Earlier in 2019, he lost the Mandya Lok Sabha constituency to independent candidate Sumalatha. At that time, Mr. Nikhil had contested in Mandya as the Janata Dal Secular-Congress alliance candidate when the alliance was in power and the government was headed by his father H.D. Kumaraswamy. \n\nMr. Yogeshwar is seen as a turncoat in politics, but has won five times from Channapatna Assembly constituency. Interestingly, he lost the last two elections (2018 and 2023) to H.D. Kumaraswamy. \n\nIn 2020, BJP had got Mr Yogeshwar elected to the legislative Council. Earlier this week, Mr Yogeshwar resigned from the Council and the BJP.\n\nMr. Gowda announced that Mr. Nikhil will contest from Channapatna and will be filing his nomination on October 25. The former Prime Minister said he, along with BJP leaders, would be with Mr. Nikhil during filing of nomination papers at Channapatna. Besides, he would campaign for his grandson for the by-election. \n\nThe party had been wary of fielding him in the Channapatna by-poll, which was necessitated by the resignation of H.D. Kumaraswamy after he won the Mandya Lok Sabha seat. Mr. Kumaraswamy is now the Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel. \n\nWhile Mr. Nikhil was seen as a front-runner to contest on the NDA ticket and represent JD(S), Mr. Yogeshwar a five-time former MLA and former MLC was adamant on contesting from the BJP ticket. As there was no agreement on the issue, though JD S offered Mr Yogeshwar to contest on its symbol, he chose to join Congress on Wednesday. This development had put the JD S on the backdoor as it feared all forces opposed to it will align in this by polls. The Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh, who lost to Mr. Nikhil\u2019s uncle from Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha constituency, are looking to avenge the defeat. JD S leaders are also wary of support from certain Vokkaliga leaders in BJP though the central leaders are completely backing the JDS. \n\nMeanwhile, though Mr. Gowda announced Mr. Nikhil\u2019s name earlier, Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Nikhil along with several party leaders and BJP leaders met former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to discuss the developments before formally announcing Mr. Nikhil as the NDA candidate. Leader of Opposition in Legislative Assembly R. Ashok and Leader of Opposition in Legislative Council were among those present in the NDA meeting. \n\nThe Channapatna by poll promises to be a cracker of contest given the high political stakes involved.

Jaishankar on Thursday said that there remains a \u201cwidespread anxiety\u201d that the ongoing conflict would spread further in the region.\n\n\u201cThe situation in the Middle East, West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected. The human and material consequences of further escalation are truly serious. Any approach has to be fair and durable, leading to a two-state solution,\u201d the EAM said at the BRICS Outreach session in Kazan.\n\nRepresenting Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the segment, Jaishankar emphasised that conflicts and tensions have to be handled effectively.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception. And there should be zero tolerance for terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting that as the old order changes while inequities of the past continue, the EAM mentioned that BRICS is a statement in itself and can make a real difference.\n\nHe made five key points to ensure that the benefits of change reach those who are currently left behind and a more equitable global order is created.\n\nIt included strengthening and expanding platforms of an independent nature to widen choices and avoid being leveraged; Reforming established institutions and mechanisms, especially the UN Security Council in the permanent and non-permanent categories; Democratizing the global economy through creating more production hubs to build resilient, redundant and shorter supply chains; Correct distortions in global infrastructure through connectivity options that enhance logistics and mitigate risks; and, sharing experiences and new initiatives that hold relevance and are of common interest.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s Digital Public Infrastructure, its Unified Payments Interface and the Gati Shakti infrastructure, all hold a larger relevance. The International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, the Global Biofuel Alliance, Mission LiFE and the International Big Cat Alliance are similarly initiatives of common interest. As a First Responder, be it for natural calamities, health emergencies or economic crises, we seek to do our fair share,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nThe plenary session of the 16th BRICS summit in the outreach/BRICS-plus format on Friday was attended by leaders of the CIS countries, delegations from Asian, African, Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, as well as heads of executive bodies of a number of international organisations.",

        "text": "The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) has urgently called on Chinese authorities to reveal the whereabouts of four Tibetans subjected to incommunicado detention in Ngaba (Aba), located in the Ngaba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province.In early September, Chinese officials arbitrarily detained four individuals, including two monks from Kirti Monastery, Lobsang Samten and Lobsang Trinley, alongside Tsering Tashi and Wangkyi. Since their arrest, no information has been provided regarding their location or the specific charges against them.Lobsang Samten, 53, has been a monk at Kirti Monastery since childhood and is currently a student in the Karampa (Geshe) class. As a junior chant master at the monastery\u2019s Prayer College, he is known for his commitment to monastic studies and previously faced detention in 2011 alongside 300 other monks. Lobsang Trinley, also known as Drenpo, is a monk in his 40s from Rongkhangsar town and plays a significant role in organising ritual ceremonies at Kirti Monastery.Wangkyi, 43, and Tsering Tashi, 41, are siblings from the Haritsang family in Rongkharsar. Wangkyi is married and has four daughters. Reports suggest that members of the Haritsang family may have been arrested for maintaining contacts in India, although details remain unclear.According to a source who spoke with TCHRD, \u201cThere have been reports of members of the Haritsang family being arrested for maintaining contacts in India, though specific details remain elusive. In recent months, repression in the Ngaba region has intensified, with increased restrictions particularly aimed at Kirti Monastery and nearby villages.Arbitrary detentions and secret sentencing of Tibetans have become alarmingly frequent. Local Tibetans are being silenced through intimidation, making it increasingly difficult for information to surface. Even those who are released from detention are prohibited from revealing the charges against them or where they were held, further obscuring the truth from the community.\u201dThis incident comes on the heels of China\u2019s closure of two prominent Buddhist monastery schools in July, which forced approximately 1,600 novice monks to enrol in government-run boarding schools. This move is part of a broader campaign aimed at assimilating Tibetan cultural and religious identity and promoting assimilation into the dominant Han Chinese culture.TCHRD calls on Chinese authorities to immediately cease these arbitrary detentions and to provide accurate information regarding the status and whereabouts of the four detained Tibetans. The organisation urges the international community to raise awareness of the situation and advocate for the rights of the Tibetan people.",

Cheating cases should be registered against those who duped the farmers and the public, he said, adding that illegal cases would not be tolerated.\r\n\r\nRama Rao also asked the public to warn people in Maharashtra about the Congress, since the State was going for polls soon, and inform them what was happening in Telangana, especially with regard to poll promises.

We took the matter very seriously and we discovered an angle of inter-gang rivalry in the matter.\u201d\u201cOur officials worked swiftly and identified two of the accused. As soon as our intelligence-based operation reached to nab them one criminal was injured in retaliatory firing. Both of them have been arrested,\u201d said the official.\u201cTwo pistols were recovered from them, one of them was a sophisticated Glock 9mm and .32 bore pistol with 13 rounds. It seems to be a case of inter-gang rivalry. We will soon nab another two accused of the same gang,\u201d added Bhullar.On Monday, Punjab Border Security Force (BSF) and the state police arrested one person for allegedly trying to smuggle narcotics near the border area of Amritsar, a statement by BSF said.The BSF seized 530 grams of suspected heroin and one broken mobile phone worth Rs 750 from the accused.\u201cActing on the information developed and shared by BSF intelligence wing about a smuggling activity at the border area of district Amritsar, BSF placed a joint ambush in collaboration with Punjab Police in the suspected area,\u201d read a statement by BSF.The alleged smuggler was subsequently interrogated by the local police to find out whether there were any links with Pakistan-based narco-smugglers.The accused, a resident of Kaholi village in the Amritsar district was chased and caught by the ambush party around 2:10 PM on Monday",

Addressing media persons later here on Thursday, he said the turncoats MLAs and leaders were dominating party affairs and calling the shots in different constituencies.\r\n\r\n\"At this juncture, what is our position in the party?\" he asked, also alleging that former Minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy was the leader of the turncoats. He had held a meeting with turncoat MLAs and leaders and directed them to dominate the Congress leaders in the constituencies, he alleged, stating that the high command was against defections into the party. The Congress had got a clear majority in the Assembly and did not need support of any turncoats, he said.\r\n\u201cWill the Congress government not survive without support of turncoat MLAs? Is this the democratic governance Rahul Gandhi promised?\" Jeevan Reddy asked.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, TPCC president Mahesh Kumar Goud has been claiming that defections into the party were as per the high command's instructions. But Jeevan Reddy took strong objection to the defections into the party reminding that it was the Congress which was fighting against defections by elected public representatives. Defections were not only against the party's policy but also creating lot of unrest among loyal leaders. Still, Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy openly welcomed BRS MLA Dr Sanjay into the party.\r\n\u201cWhen his entry was opposed by the cadre in Jagtial, I was personally summoned to New Delhi after Ministers Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and D Sridhar Babu tried to pacify me.

        "title": "Rajnath Singh on border breakthrough with China: Power of continuous dialogue",
        "text": "Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hailed the breakthrough in resolving the longstanding border tensions between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue 2024 in New Delhi, Singh said that months of diplomatic and military talks have led to both nations achieving a consensus to resume patrolling and grazing rights in traditional areas.\u201cIndia and China have been involved in talks at both diplomatic and military levels to resolve differences along the LAC. Following these efforts, we have reached a broad consensus to restore the ground situation based on principles of equal and mutual security,\u201d Singh stated, marking his first public remarks on the issue.The border agreement between the two nations follows several intense high-level negotiations since the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes, which marked a significant downturn in India-China relations. The new agreement allows Indian forces to resume patrolling in key areas such as Depsang and Demchok, long-standing flashpoints in the standoff. The resumption of these activities is viewed as a confidence-building measure and a signal of both countries' willingness to reduce military tensions.Rajnath Singh emphasised that this breakthrough underscores the power of persistent dialogue. \u201cThe consensus includes patrolling and grazing in traditional areas. This is the power of continuous dialogue \u2014 sooner or later, solutions emerge,\u201d he remarked, highlighting India\u2019s commitment to diplomacy while ensuring national security.The agreement is seen as a critical step towards normalising ties between the two countries, with disputes in areas like Pangong Lake, Gogra-Hot Springs, and Galwan Valley already settled. However, Rajnath Singh was quick to remind that India remains vigilant. \u201cOur pursuit of peace does not mean compromising on security. India will always stand firm in protecting its borders,\u201d he asserted.This pact represents a diplomatic victory for India, particularly given China\u2019s earlier resistance to reverting to the status quo that existed prior to the 2020 clashes. The breakthrough comes after 21 rounds of military talks and 17 working mechanism meetings. With the resumption of patrolling in Depsang and Demchok, where Chinese forces had intruded up to 15 km into Indian-patrolled areas, the new agreement offers hope for easing broader Sino-India territorial disputes.India and China, sharing a 3,488 km long border, have differing perceptions of the LAC, which divides physical control rather than territorial claims. This latest step forward may offer a path towards further reconciliation in the complex territorial disputes that have long strained relations between the two Asian giants.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024Must Watch",

        "text": "Former Union Minister and Former Chief of Army Staff General VK Singh on Thursday heaped praise on the India-China border agreement and said that the modalities of the decision have to be worked out by people on the ground.\u201cIt is a very positive step that has happened and especially I would like to say that it is great success where our diplomats are concerned and in diplomacy they have been able to achieve something which was pending for quite some time. Having said this, what we must understand is that it\u2019s an agreement for disengagement and patrolling. The modalities will take time. The modalities have to be worked out by people on the ground. So far a decision has been taken which is very good. Now this decision, the nuts and bolts of this as to how it will happen will be done by people on the ground,\u201d Former Chief of Army Staff General VK Singh said while speaking to ANI. \n\nGeneral Singh stated that a very positive atmosphere has been created with the India-China agreement and the leaders engaged in talks will be able to come to a conclusion that is mutually beneficial to both of them. \u201cVarious meetings will take place and then only we will see the outcome of it. But with this, I think also a very positive atmosphere has been created where both the leaders who are meeting would meet in a positive environment in something which they would be able to talk about things which are mutually beneficial to both of them,\u201d General VK Singh added. \n\nIn a major development in the 10-month-long military standoff on the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh, India and China have reached an agreement to disengage their troops from the northern and southern banks of the contentious Pangong Lake where the Chinese troops would move back to east of the Finger 8 while the Indian side would go to its Dhan Singh Thapa post near Finger 3, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced on Thursday in Rajya Sabha\n\nIn a statement in Rajya Sabha, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that as per the agreement reached between the two sides, both countries will cease their forward deployments on the Pangong Lake in a \u201ccoordinated, phased and verified\u201d manner where they would restore the situation to the April 2020 status.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform the House today that as a result of our well thought out approach and sustained talks with the Chinese side, we have now been able to reach an agreement on disengagement in the North and South Bank of the Pangong Lake. It has also been agreed to convene the next meeting of the Senior Commanders within 48 hours after the complete disengagement in the Pangong Lake area so as to address and resolve all other remaining issues,\u201d the Minister announced. \n\nThe agreement reached between India and China on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh \u201cessentially pertains\u201d to the areas of Depsang and Demchok, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said.\n\n\u201cInsofar as Depsang and Demchok is concerned, if you see the statements that I have made over the last 48 to 72 hours, I think the answer should be quite clear. I have made the point that the last time we had an agreement on the several issues that had arisen in the India-China border areas since 2020, the last agreement was in 2022 in September,\u201d Misri said at a media briefing here on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for BRICS Summit.\n\n\u201cSince then, we had been involved in trying to find a resolution of the pending issues in the balance areas along the Line of Actual Control, which pertain to these areas that you have mentioned. The agreement that has been arrived at essentially pertains to these areas,\u201d he added",

        "title": "Use 'clock' symbol in Maharashtra assembly elections with disclaimer: SC to Ajit Pawar",
        "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to use the \"clock\" symbol in its publicity material in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections with a disclaimer that the matter was sub-judice before it. Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan passed the order on a plea filed by the rival Sharad Pawar-led NCP faction as it issued a notice to the Ajit Pawar-led faction.The top court on March 19 and April 4 had directed the Ajit Pawar-led faction to issue a public notice in the newspapers in English, Hindi and Marathi editions notifying that the allocation of \"clock\" symbol was sub-judice. The apex court had further said the Ajit faction was permitted to use the symbol subject to the case's final outcome.During the proceedings on Thursday, the bench took note of the submissions of senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the Sharad Pawar faction. Singhvi submitted the opponent group should be restrained from using the \"clock\" symbol as it didn't use the disclaimer in their campaign materials and \"misled\" voters.\"They have been blatantly not using the disclaimer. They want to piggyback on me. Nobody should enjoy the goodwill of the symbol which is sub-judice,\" submitted Singhvi. The top court directed Ajit Pawar to file a fresh undertaking over its March 19 and April 4 directions to issue a public notice -- \"NCP's 'clock' symbol is sub-judice\" -- was being meticulously complied with even during the process of the state assembly elections.\"File a fresh undertaking as well that you have not violated our directions in the past and till the end of elections. If there is any violation, we will take note of it. We expect both sides to comply with our directions. Please don't create an embarrassing situation,\" the bench said.Singhvi said the Ajit Pawar group should be allocated a new symbol for the assembly elections. Senior advocate Balbir Singh, appearing for Ajit Pawar, opposed Singhvi's submissions and said all pamphlets and campaign materials contained the disclaimers as directed by the apex court.\"They are showing false documents. We have given disclaimers in our publicity material. They came up with the same allegations during the Lok Sabha polls which was rejected. I am willing to file all documents and pamphlets,\" Singh said.The matter has been posted for hearing on November 6. Sharad Pawar moved the apex court against a February 6 order of the Election Commission of India (ECI) recognising Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.The ECI had allotted the NCP's \"clock\" symbol to the group led by Ajit Pawar. The NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar, had the \"clock\" as its election symbol before its split. On March 19, the top court allowed the Sharad Pawar faction to use \"Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar\" as its name along with the symbol of a man blowing \"turha\" ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in the country.It had passed the order on a plea by the Sharad Pawar group seeking to restrain the Ajit Pawar faction from using the \"clock\" symbol for the polls, as allotted by the ECI, on the ground that it was disrupting the level playing field.The top court had observed the name and photographs of Sharad Pawar could not be used by the Ajit Pawar faction for political gains. On February 19, the top court directed for the continuation of the ECI order allotting \"Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar\" as the party name for the Sharad Pawar faction.Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar had on February 15 held the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar to be the real NCP and said the anti-defection provisions in the Constitution couldn't be used to stifle internal dissent. Sharad Pawar had founded the NCP with former Lok Sabha speaker Purno Sangma and Tariq Anwar in 1999 after their expulsion from the Congress.Ajit Pawar had walked away with a majority of the NCP MLAs in July, 2023, and supported the BJP-Shiv Sena government led by Eknath Shinde.",

Notably, HD Kumaraswamy (HDK) defeated Yogeeshwara in the 2018 and 2023 assembly polls from the seat. The seat fell vacant after HDK won from the Mandya parliamentary segment in the last Lok Sabha polls.The announcement was made by former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa during a press conference.

        "text": "Telangana Government is apparently saddled with the burden of interest payment due to the huge loans obtained from the financial institutions in the past 10 years.\n\nTelangana likely to pay interests higher than projection\n\nThe interest payments over the past few years are on the rise and surpassing the quantum projected in the budget estimates of the respective financial years. For instance, during the current fiscal, the State has incurred expenditure of Rs. 13,187 crore on account of interest payments by the end of September - second quarter. This is 74.38 per cent of the Rs. 17,729 crore interest payments projected in the budget estimates for the entire year. \n\nWith two more quarters still remaining, the State is likely to end up paying interests much higher than the amount projected in the budget estimates. \n\nInterest payment in the previous FYs\n\nThis is not an isolated case, the State Government remitted Rs. 23,337 crore interest in the previous financial year 2023-24, 104% of the Rs. 22,407 crore of the budget estimates.\n\nThe same was the case with the interest payment in 2022-23 when the State ended up paying Rs. 20,952 crore, 110% of the Rs. 18,911 crore projected for the fiscal. And, in 2021-22, the State had to pay Rs. 18,688 crore which is 105% of the projected Rs. 17,854 crore in the budget estimates. \n\nChief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has been expressing concern over the legacy of high interest loans handed over by the previous Government. The Congress Government had estimated that the State is saddled with borrowings of Rs. 6.85 lakh crore in the White Paper on State finances tabled in the assembly. \n\nThe Chief Minister accordingly made strong pitch with the XVI Finance Commission to allow Telangana Government to restructure its debt so that it could mitigate the burden of interest payment. Irrigation Minister N. Uttam Kumar Reddy visited the national capital more than once seeking the Union Finance Ministry\u2019s consent for rescheduling of loans so that the State could withstand the pressure on its finances.",

        "text": "In recent times, traffic violations of various kinds have reached a peak, making it difficult for law-abiding citizens to travel on the roads.\n\nSome common violations include riding without helmets by both rider and pillion, using mobile phones while driving, triple or quadruple riding, jumping traffic signals without restraint, driving on the wrong side and in no-entry zones at reckless speeds, drunk driving, overtaking from the left, and more. This menace can be curbed through the following measures:\n\n1. Imposing heavy fines on traffic violators in line with the penalties set by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (Government of India).\n\n2. Establishing a Traffic Violations Monitoring Cell (TVMC) equipped with advanced infrastructure, including PCs, laptops, and servers, by the Police Department in every district of Karnataka. TVMC should collaborate with the relevant RTOs to share vehicle databases.\n\n3. The TVMC should employ personnel with the necessary qualifications and computer skills, hired either on a contract or regular basis.\n\n4. Hiring physically capable personnel on contract or piecework, equipped with HD button cameras or mobile devices. These devices must feature tamper-proof software to ensure the integrity of videos/photos. The authority to alter footage should only lie with officials of SP rank or higher.\n\n5. Deploying personnel in special uniforms to patrol the roads and capture traffic violations on video or photo. Any attempt to assault these personnel should be treated seriously and prosecuted under relevant laws. Insurance must be provided to ensure compensation in the event of injury or loss of life.\n\n6. Developing software that automatically uploads captured videos / photos to the TVMC servers.\n\n7. TVMC personnel should immediately notify traffic offenders via WhatsApp or email, specifying the fine amount and due date. For those without access to these platforms, notices should be sent by mail.\n\nFailure to pay fines within the due date should result in doubled or tripled penalties until a final deadline. If payment is still not made, the Police should seize the vehicle, which can be traced using advanced TVMC software.\n\nIf these suggestions are implemented effectively, traffic violations could be reduced by 75-80 percent within 5-10 years, similar to the situation in the USA.\n\nHowever, the real question is whether the Government or Police Department will truly adopt these measures. It\u2019s doubtful, as enforcing these rules could reduce the illicit flow of money into both Government coffers and Police pockets, as more people would comply with traffic regulations.\n\nThe world rests on hope, as do the innocent citizens. Only time will reveal the outcome of these suggestions. These recommendations are based on over 46 years of driving experience and 40 years of dedicated service in a Central Government organisation.\n\n\u2013 N.

        "title": "Will be best ambassador for drone industry, says Chandrababu Naidu",
        "text": "Amaravati: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday promised that he will be the best ambassador for the drone industry to promote its ecosystem and transform the state into a drone hub. The chief minister called on drone players to use the southern state as a pilot or testing ground for producing use cases and proof of concepts. \"Andhra Pradesh will be a testing bed for drone applications. Give us your use cases and we will test them,\" said Naidu, addressing a two-day national drone summit at Mangalagiri in Guntur district. The chief minister inaugurated the summit accompanied by Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu. Naidu noted that the state government is keen on adopting at least 150 drone use cases during the two-day summit on October 22 and 23. Calling on drone ecosystem players, the CM requested them to put their data and use cases in a sandbox for further validation and enhancement. Highlighting that the drone industry is the \"game changer\" of the future, he said these unmanned aerial vehicles have multiple use cases, such as identifying traffic violations, criminals and in farming, among several others. The TD supremo observed that the state government aims to hand over 20,000 drone pilot certificates and achieve 80 per cent indigenisation in drone manufacturing. Promising to allot 300 acres to the Civil Aviation Ministry, Government of India, Naidu requested the Centre to set up a drone certification hub at Orvakal in Kurnool district, which is near to Hyderabad, Chennai and Amaravati. Further, the CM appealed to drone players to keep their costs reasonable and refrain from being \"greedy\" to enable wider adoption of this technology. On the occasion, the Andhra Pradesh government inked an agreement with the Quality Council of India (QCI) for certifying drone startups in the state. There was also an agreement between IIT-Tirupati and Technology Innovative Hub for collaboration in drone technology development, startups and skill initiatives. Later, Naidu released a concept note on drone policy and also inaugurated a drone expo at the venue. Earlier, Union Aviation Minister K Ram Mohan Naidu said that the government does not want to import drones as it envisages the people of the country to manufacture them. The aviation minister highlighted that the Centre has liberalised rules for the drone ecosystem and enabled 27 companies to benefit from the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Noting that India has emerged as a drone hub in the past few years, the union minister said the government wants to push the industry further. \"Looking at a drone hub in Andhra Pradesh in the future... want to ensure that Andhra Pradesh grows to the best of its ability,\" he said, adding that the government wants to ensure that the southern state will emerge as the drone hub of the world. The mega-drone summit will feature drone hackathons, exhibitions and participation from industry experts. As many as 1,711 delegates and 1,306 visitors are expected to attend the summit. Likewise, over 8,000 people are also expected to attend the summit, which will be followed by a drone show at Punnami Ghat in Vijayawada on Tuesday evening.",

        "title": "AI\u2019s sweet spot lies between hype and criticism: OpenText India MD",
        "text": "penText has transformed from on-premises content management (1.0) to information management in hybrid cloud (2.0). Now, OpenText 3.0 focuses on \u2018Information Reimagined\u2019, combining cloud-based information management with AI, security, and compliance.\n\nOpenText\u2019s 3.0 journey has been a transformative experience for us. We are building a new AI platform that will help in the automation of product development internally. It is around \u2018Information Re-imagined\u2019 which is basically an Information Management Cloud with AI and with full security and compliance. \n\nThe 3.0 journey pushed us to embrace a cloud-first, AI-driven mindset, and to focus on delivering innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. OpenText 3.0 is all about security, AI, and information management cloud. We are going to be fully on the cloud, but we keep in mind the local regulatory requirements and data sovereignty requirements of certain countries, which means we\u2019ll bring the hyperscaler cloud into the country. \n\n This is a platform that we intend to use internally for auto-generating the application codes for product development and automating testing. The application code generation will help our developers and especially testers. We can imagine a world in the future where there are some user stories, the business use case stories on which the product development has to happen. You feed into this platform and say that your core language to develop this is Python. It\u2019ll read the user stories and suggest a Python code which the developer can then edit and refine further and then move to the next step of unit testing. Once the developer is happy, then the platform will suggest a test plan or test script for that. The platform itself will help you to test it. Once you approve the test plan and test script. This is not for sale to a customer. This is in pilot with over 2,000 developers testing it. \n\nThe majority of AI and Automation initiatives are being fully developed in India. That\u2019s one of the key elements of India OpenText 3.0, which our CEO entrusted us with. It started like 9-10 months back and we are heavily invested in that. The Indian team played a pivotal role in the development of this platform. India is going to play a very pivotal role in OpenText 3.0. Security is a key focus area in our 3.0 strategy and as an example of the role of India in the security the managed security operations centre under our cybersecurity practice in India will grow significantly and most likely going to double in size. \n\nWill AI be fully successful? The answer is no. Can it replace everything perfectly? The answer is no. It\u2019s a simple common example. I can say critics and admirers are sitting on the left-hand, and right-hand side of the fence. But the answer is in the middle. You will not leave everything with AI, but you will leave a lot of things with AI. It just depends on how everybody is experimenting maybe the AI might fail in one area \u2013 let\u2019s say product development. Maybe it produces a code, then we have to put more effort into correcting it. The efficiency gain is 30 per cent but to rework is another 20 per cent, eventually, a 10 per cent gain is not worth it, but AI-assisted automated testing is most likely 100 per cent guaranteed that it will work well. Therefore in some areas, it will succeed, it will fail. That\u2019s my view.\n\n Price-wise, the Indian market is definitely challenging. The price point that customers expect here is different; North American pricing or other models won\u2019t work. So, we\u2019ve defined specific packages, solutions, and price points tailored for the Indian market. \n\nWe\u2019ve learned these lessons over time, and we\u2019re now seeing significant success. For example, just three months ago, we secured a multi-million dollar deal with a large telecom customer in India. This is a yearly renewable project, highlighting the growing demand for our products and services in the domestic market. This particular customer needed our solutions to streamline their business processes, and we were able to meet their needs effectively. A few other customers in India where we had success in last few years are L&T Technology Services with whom we are partnering to serve strategic Govt institutions, ITC, GAIL, IOCL, and ONGC. \n\nPreviously, we had success stories with only multinational companies that are rolling out in India. But the true India stories have started coming up in the last 24 months or so.\n\n We have a strong internship program that originated in Hyderabad. We hire close to 300 interns every year. Of those interns, 40 per cent get converted to full-time employees. We started with product development, then we replicated to other units as well - now professional services, customer success, and technical support. It is working very well. And in that process, we have a good affiliation with campuses both in Hyderabad and Bangalore and all India level as well. We have identified, certain universities we work with.",

        "text": "Berhampur (Odisha): Even though winter is yet to set in the state, winged guests have started to arrive at Odisha's Chilika lake, the biggest waterfowl habitat in the country, an official said. The migratory birds have already started to arrive in the lake from the first week of the current month, as the usual time of their arrival, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Chilika Wildlife Division, Amlan Nayak said on Tuesday. Their arrival was continuing daily, he said. Migratory birds of different species like northern pintail, Eurasian wigeon, gadwall, black-tailed gadwall, northern shoveller, greater flamingo, common sandpiper, common coot, mongolian plover, common snipe, black winged stilt, etc, have already swooped down in the lake, Nayak said. The DFO said the arrival of migratory birds to the lake is as usual, even though the day temperature in and around the blue lagoon was hovering at 32 to 35 degrees Celsius at present. The onset of winter and some other causes in their native places might have forced the birds to fly to Chilika, he added. Several birds are also seen to fly in the sky near Chilika without settling on the lake. They might land once the water level recedes in the lake, Nayak said, adding, \"We expected their number might be in large by the end of the current month.\" The winged guests mostly from beyond the Himalayas in Northern Eurasia, Caspian region, Siberia, Kazakh, Lake Baikal and remote areas of Russia and neighbouring countries visit the Chilika lake every winter and start their homeward journey before the onset of summer in the second week of March. In the last winter, a total of 11,37,759 birds of 187 species visited Chilika and the majority of them settled in the Nalabana sanctuary area inside the lake. To prevent bird poaching in the lake during the period, the wildlife division has set up 21 temporary camps in the lake. They have also hired around a dozen boats for patrolling in the lake. Besides, they have decided to make surveillance through drones like the previous year. The camps have already started functioning from October 1 and will continue till the end of March. With the setting up of the camps, patrolling was also intensified in the lake. The drive to create awareness among the people to prevent bird poaching was also launched in the vulnerable areas, said the forest official.",

Their arrival was continuing daily, he added.\n\nMigratory birds of different species like northern pintail, Eurasian wigeon, gadwall, black-tailed gadwall, northern shoveller, greater flamingo, common sandpiper, common coot, mongolian plover, common snipe, black-winged stilt, etc, have already swooped down in the lake, Nayak said.\n\nThe DFO said the arrival of migratory birds to the lake is as usual, even though the day temperature in and around the blue lagoon was hovering at 32 to 35 degree Celsius at present.\n\nThe onset of winter and some other causes in their native places might have forced the birds to fly to Chilika, he added.\n\nSeveral birds are also seen to fly in the sky near Chilika without settling on the lake.

They have also hired around a dozen boats for patrolling in the lake. Besides, they have decided to make surveillance through drones like the previous year.\n\nThe camps have already started functioning from October 1 and will continue till the end of March.

        "text": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Tuesday took a dig at the INDIA alliance and Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance over the seat share troubles in Jharkhand and Maharashtra, respectively. He said that the political families in these MVA and INDIA only want to come to power, asserting that Congress can\u2019t walk together with its allies. Naqvi further attacked the Congress and said that the opposition party didn\u2019t give importance to small and regional parties. He suggested that Congress should learn from BJP and Narendra Modi in handling the allies. While speaking on the seat-sharing tussle of INDIA Alliance in Jharkhand and MVA in Maharashtra, Naqvi said, \u201cBe it Jharkhand or Maharashtra, there is more of \u2018siyasi khurpench\u2019 than \u2018seats ka pench\u2019. Be it Aghadi or alliance, their \u2018khaandani khiladi\u2019 have the same aspiration \u2013 to come into power. Today, whichever alliance will be led by Congress party will have \u2018pench\u2019 as well as \u2018khurpench\u2019 because Congress has no DNA or mindset to walk ahead together with all allies. Congress thinks that small parties and regional parties have no importance. They should learn from the BJP and Narendra Modi.\u201dMeanwhile, Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat met Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) chief Sharad Pawar today ahead of the MVA\u2019s meeting to discuss seat sharing for the upcoming elections in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut informed that Thorat met Pawar in Delhi and will visit Matoshree in Mumbai to meet Uddhav Thackeray. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had earlier announced that elections in Maharashtra are to be held on November 20 and the counting for all 288 assembly constituencies will be held on November 23. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, while Shiv Sena won 56 seats and the Congress won 44 seats. In 2014, the BJP won 122 seats, while Shiv Sena won 63 and Congress left its mark on 42 seats. (ANI)",

The victim's father wrote an email to Amit Shah on his birthday and sought time from him to get guidance on the ways to get the case expedited and get justice for his daughter. In the letter, the victim's father said that the family were \"under tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless\". \"After that heinous unforeseen incident happened to our daughter, we have been going through tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless. I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you and gain your insights on the issue, as I believe your experience and guidance would be invaluable,\" the victim's father wrote in the email. Massive protests broke out after the rape-murder of the trainee doctor in Kolkata. Doctors went on strike demanding better working conditions and guarantees of safety. Doctors all over the country took to the streets demanding action against the accused. Sanjay Roy, believed to be the main accused in the case, was arrested, and the case was handed over to the CBI. The CBI, in its investigation, refuted claims of a gangrape and stated that Sanjay Roy committed the crime alone. Over 45 senior doctors and faculty members of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital collectively resigned in solidarity with their junior colleagues, who were protesting against the murder of the trainee doctor. In their resignation letters, the senior doctors stated that the demands of the junior doctors had not been addressed and that there had been \"no progress\" in the investigation of the trainee doctor\u2019s rape and murder.Furthermore, junior doctors, who sat on a hunger strike in protest against the government ended their strike on Monday after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The doctors, who had been demanding better working conditions and infrastructure improvements in the healthcare sector, also announced the withdrawal of the general medical strike they had earlier called.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

        "text": "In a dramatic turn of events, just weeks before the crucial November 20 Maharashtra Assembly elections, an electrifying scene unfolded late Monday night on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway. \n\nPune Rural police made a stunning seizure of \u20b95 crore in unaccounted cash at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza near Pune during a high-stakes nakabandi (on-road checking). The incident has sent shockwaves across the state, especially with the model code of conduct in force since October 15.\n\nWhile the police investigate, the political battlefield has erupted in accusations and counterclaims. Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) leader Sanjay Raut dropped a bombshell, alleging that the cash was part of a massive \u20b975 crore fund being distributed by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to his party candidates. Raut claimed the seized \u20b95 crore was just the tip of the iceberg, insisting that \u20b915 crore was in transit, but only \u20b95 crore was officially accounted for. According to Raut, the cash was on its way to Shinde\u2019s loyal MLA, Shahjibapu Patil, in Sangola, Solapur district.\n\nHowever, MLA Patil vehemently denied any involvement, branding the accusations as slanderous. \u201cEver since we broke away from Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s Shiv Sena, they\u2019ve been targeting us. I have no knowledge of the cash or the people carrying it,\u201d Patil said, calling Raut\u2019s claims an act of political vendetta. The car carrying the money has been impounded, and four individuals are now being grilled by police at the Rajgad police station.\n\nCash in Stream\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2014this explosive cash drama takes an even more bizarre twist. Far from the police checkpoints, in the sleepy town of Atpadi in Sangli, a different kind of treasure hunt was unfolding. Just before Diwali, the quiet banks of a local stream near the Ambabai temple transformed into a chaotic scene as rumors spread of cash notes flowing in the water. \n\nShocked villagers rushed to the site, scooping up thousands of rupees as they fished currency notes from the stream, unsure where the sudden windfall came from. Videos of the surreal event went viral, adding to the mounting mystery. As locals scramble for answers, police are now investigating the source of this aquatic cash flow.\n\nMeanwhile, in the midst of the frenzy, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MLA Rohit Pawar fired yet another salvo at the ruling BJP-led alliance, accusing them of resorting to cash-for-votes tactics. \u201cLike in the Lok Sabha elections, they are trying to buy votes with dirty money, but the people of Maharashtra won\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Pawar declared. He confidently asserted that this \u201ccorruption money\u201d wouldn\u2019t be enough to secure power for the ruling coalition.",

This is an old tactic of the BJP. The country has been waiting for a long time. There has been a nationwide demand for Priyanka to enter full-time politics and contest elections. We are happy that she is going to fight from Wayanad. Today is the nomination day, and I wish her all the best. I am confident she will win there with record votes,\u201d she said. The senior Congress leader added, \u201cThe Minister said that machines should not overpower humanity. The Election Commission must pay attention to this. The issue of EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) has been raised repeatedly, and it is their responsibility to ensure that there should be no doubt anywhere in the country. Everything must be completely fair.\u201d Earlier, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met party chief Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi on Monday to discuss campaign strategies as she prepares to file her nomination for the by-elections in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Wayanad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23. After the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Wayanad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also be present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. After being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. The election commission also announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. If Priyanka Gandhi wins from Wayanad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. Gandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation councillor. Rahul Gandhi had said both Rae Bareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Rae Bareli before entering active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party.

        "text": "The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday assured the Supreme Court that authorities won\u2019t take any action till tomorrow on demolition notices issued against the buildings belonging to persons allegedly involved in the October 13 Bahraich violence in the state.A bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan said it will hear the application tomorrow seeking protection against the proposed demolitions.Senior advocate CU Singh mentioned the application before the bench today for an early hearing.The bench said it will take up the application tomorrow for hearing and asked the Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj to defer action, to which ASG said that no action will be taken till tomorrow.ASG also informed the top court that the Allahabad High Court is also seized of the matter. On urgent hearing, the High Court on Sunday granted 15 more days to the affected persons to respond to the notices issued by the UP authorities.\u201cIf they (UP authorities) want to take the risk of flouting our order, it\u2019s their choice,\u201d the bench also remarked.An application was filed in the apex court against the demolition notices issued by the Uttar Pradesh authorities to some people including the accused in the Bahraich violence case Abdul Hameed over the illegal construction of his residence.Three people have jointly filed the petition against the demolition notice and urged the top court to quash the notices issued on October 17, 2024, which was pasted on the night of October 18.The petitioners also sought interim relief for staying the proposed demolition and status quo as of the date of issuance of notice on October 17.Earlier on September 17 the apex court passed an interim order on similar petitions that no construction should be bulldozed without prior permission from it, except those that are encroachments on public spaces. The top court has recently reserved its judgement on a batch of petitions seeking directions against demolition actions by various state authorities, whereby houses of persons accused of crimes are demolished as a punitive action",

They accused revenue officials of forcibly taking their lands and urged the minister to help them.

        "title": "India-China Agreement Explained: After 4 Years Eastern Ladakh Border Standoff Resolves - Key Details",
        "text": "In a significant development that could mark a turning point in India-China relations, China officially confirmed on October 22, 2024, that it had reached a resolution with India to resolve the prolonged border standoff in eastern Ladakh. This breakthrough comes after years of military tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which escalated in 2020 and has remained a source of concern in regional geopolitics.Diplomatic and Military Dialogue Yields ResultsChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced the resolution at a press briefing in Beijing, stating that China and India had been in close communication through both diplomatic and military channels to address the border issues.Over a recent period, China and India have been in close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues related to the China-India border, Lin Jian stated. Now the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters, which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions.While the Chinese government did not provide specifics of the agreement, the news comes as a positive step towards resolving one of the most tense and dangerous flashpoints in the region.Indias Announcement of DisengagementIndia, too, confirmed that the disengagement process with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh had been completed. On October 21, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that an agreement had been reached on restoring patrolling rights along the LAC, a key aspect of the border tension that had been unresolved since the violent clashes in 2020.Jaishankar said, We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed... We will be able to resume the patrolling that we were doing in 2020. I think its a good development.The disengagement likely covers the critical areas of Depsang and Demchok, regions that had been points of contention since the military standoff began over four years ago. These areas hold strategic importance due to their proximity to supply routes and military outposts.The Four-Year-Long Standoff: A Brief OverviewThe border dispute between India and China reached its peak in June 2020, when both nations troops engaged in violent clashes in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops. The skirmish, fought with sticks, stones, and improvised weapons, was the deadliest confrontation between the two countries in over four decades and marked a major escalation in a border conflict that had simmered for decades.Since then, both sides have maintained a heightened military presence along the disputed areas, particularly in eastern Ladakh. While rounds of diplomatic and military talks followed, they failed to produce any tangible results until now. The lack of a clear demarcation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and competing territorial claims have made the situation highly volatile.BRICS Summit and Potential for Improved Bilateral TiesThe announcement of the agreement coincides with the ongoing 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping were expected to discuss bilateral issues on the sidelines of the summit. While the specific details of their conversation are yet to be disclosed, the confirmation of the border agreement points to a broader effort to improve relations between the two Asian giants.When asked about the bilateral meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, We will keep you updated if anything comes up, indicating the possibility of further developments in the India-China relationship.This agreement could serve as a catalyst for broader discussions aimed at stabilizing bilateral ties, which have been strained since the Galwan Valley clashes. Both sides appear keen to avoid further military confrontations and work towards peaceful coexistence, at least in the immediate future.Historical Context of the India-China Border DisputeThe India-China border dispute dates back to the early years of post-colonial India. The two nations share a 3,488-kilometer-long border, much of which is not clearly demarcated, leading to frequent skirmishes and confrontations. The most significant conflict between the two nations occurred in 1962, when China defeated India in a brief but decisive war over disputed territories in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.Since then, tensions have flared periodically, with both sides accusing the other of transgressing into their territory. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash was a stark reminder of how quickly such tensions can escalate into violence, even in an era of nuclear deterrence.The recent standoff in eastern Ladakh added another layer of complexity to the border issue, as both nations were forced to divert military resources to maintain an uneasy peace in the region.Implications of the AgreementThe successful resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff could have far-reaching implications for regional stability. Here are some of the key takeaways:Resumption of Patrolling: India will now be able to resume patrolling in areas along the LAC, particularly in Depsang and Demchok, where both sides had fortified their positions.Easing of Military Tensions: With the disengagement process complete, both India and China can now focus on reducing their military presence in the region, potentially lowering the risk of accidental escalations or clashes.Bilateral Cooperation: The agreement signals a willingness on both sides to resolve disputes through dialogue rather than military force. This could pave the way for broader discussions on trade, security, and regional cooperation.Geopolitical Impact: With both India and China being key players in regional and global politics, their ability to manage bilateral relations peacefully will have a stabilizing effect on South Asia and beyond.Strategic Positioning: The resolution allows India to focus more on other security concerns, such as its borders with Pakistan and internal issues, while China can turn its attention to other geopolitical interests, such as its ambitions in the South China Sea.Future ChallengesWhile the agreement marks a major step forward, several challenges remain. The border between India and China is still not clearly defined, and periodic confrontations could arise in the future. Additionally, the resolution does not address broader territorial claims, such as Chinas claims over Arunachal Pradesh, which remains a contentious issue.The effectiveness of this agreement will depend largely on how both nations implement the disengagement process and manage future disagreements along the LAC. Continued dialogue and trust-building measures will be critical in preventing future flare-ups.Conclusion: A New Chapter in India-China Relations?The resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff is being hailed as a diplomatic victory for both India and China. It marks the end of one of the most tense periods in their bilateral relationship in recent history. While challenges remain, the agreement offers hope that both nations can move towards a more stable and cooperative future.As the world watches closely, the successful implementation of this agreement could set a precedent for resolving other contentious issues between the two countries and contribute to broader regional peace and security.",

        "title": "PCOS: Watch Out For These Common Myths",
        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age, causing a variety of symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, excessive levels of androgens (male hormones), and the presence of small cysts on the ovaries. The exact cause of PCOS is unclear, but it is often linked to insulin resistance, genetics, and inflammation. Symptoms may include weight gain, acne, hair thinning, and difficulty in conceiving. While PCOS can lead to complications like infertility and metabolic issues, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medical treatments. There are various myths surrounding PCOS, read on to find out the most common ones.\n\nCommon myths about PCOS\n\n1. Myth: PCOS always causes infertility\n\nMany women with PCOS worry that they won't be able to have children. However, PCOS doesn't make pregnancy impossible. It can make conception more difficult due to irregular ovulation, but with proper medical treatment and lifestyle changes, many women with PCOS can conceive.\n\n2. Myth: You need to have cysts on your ovaries to have PCOS\n\nDespite its name, not all women with PCOS have ovarian cysts. The term \"polycystic\" refers to the appearance of the ovaries in some women, but PCOS is primarily a hormonal imbalance and doesn't necessarily require the presence of cysts.\n\n3. Myth: PCOS only affects overweight women\n\nWhile weight gain is a common symptom, PCOS can affect women of all body types. Lean women can also suffer from PCOS and may face challenges related to hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, and insulin resistance.\n\n4. Myth: Weight loss can cure PCOS\n\nWeight loss can help alleviate some symptoms of PCOS, particularly for those who are overweight, but it is not a cure. PCOS is a chronic condition that can be managed but not entirely eliminated. Even women at a healthy weight can have PCOS.\n\n5. Myth: Irregular periods are the only symptom of PCOS\n\nPCOS is more than just irregular periods. It can also cause symptoms such as acne, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), hair thinning, and insulin resistance. The condition affects multiple systems in the body, not just the reproductive system.\n\n6. Myth: PCOS goes away after menopause\n\nPCOS does not disappear after menopause. While some symptoms, like irregular periods, may no longer be an issue, other symptoms such as insulin resistance, metabolic issues, and an increased risk of heart disease can continue into later life.\n\n7. Myth: Birth control pills cure PCOS\n\nBirth control pills are often used to manage PCOS symptoms, such as regulating periods and reducing acne, but they do not cure the condition. They help manage symptoms temporarily, and stopping them usually leads to the return of symptoms.\n\n8. Myth: PCOS is a rare condition\n\nPCOS is actually quite common, affecting about 1 in 10 women worldwide. Many women go undiagnosed because symptoms can vary widely and mimic other conditions, leading to a lack of proper diagnosis and awareness.\n\n9. Myth: Diet alone can fix PCOS\n\nWhile a healthy diet is essential for managing PCOS symptoms, it is not always enough on its own. PCOS often requires a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, hormonal treatments. A balanced diet can improve insulin sensitivity and help with weight management, but it may not resolve all symptoms.\n\nKeep these points in mind if you have or might have PCOS.\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Beirut: Lebanon\u2019s state media reported Israeli airstrikes near the southern city of Tyre on Tuesday, shortly after Israel's military issued an evacuation warning. Video footage showed smoke rising after Israel warned residents of Al-Hawsh, just south of Tyre, to evacuate. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that \"enemy aircraft launched a series of strikes\" on the area. This escalation comes after Lebanon's health ministry revised the death toll from an Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Beirut on Monday night, stating that 13 people, including a child, were killed. The previous estimate had been four. The strike, which took place near the Rafik Hariri Hospital, Lebanon\u2019s largest public health facility, also left 57 people injured and flattened four buildings in the area, according to reports. Rescuers were still searching for survivors under the rubble on Tuesday, as locals described hearing a cell phone ringing beneath the debris. Monday night\u2019s strike followed Israel's evacuation warnings and targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The Ouzai neighborhood, minutes away from the Jnah area, was hit for the first time in the conflict, sparking an exodus of residents. No warnings were issued for the densely populated area around Rafik Hariri Hospital, which has seen an influx of displaced people from southern Lebanon. Lebanese authorities report that nearly a month of war between Israel and Hezbollah has claimed at least 1,489 lives in Lebanon, with more than a million people displaced, many of whom have fled to neighboring Syria. The ongoing conflict has heavily strained shelters and relief efforts. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel to push for a ceasefire, as diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza and Lebanon conflicts continue.",

The awards were presented to 38 winners in nine categories, including Best State, Best District, Best Village Panchayat, Best Urban Local Body, Best Water User Association and Best Civil Society. \n\nSpeaking on the occasion, President Murmu said that the government has provided tap water connections to over 78 per cent of rural households across the country under the Jal Jeevan Mission.\n\nShe highlighted the significant improvement in the lives of people, particularly in rural areas, after the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission and said that when the flagship programme was launched in 2019, only 17 per cent of rural households had access to safe drinking water.\n\nThe National Water Awards are aimed at creating awareness among the people about the importance of water and to motivate them to adopt the best water usage practices.\n\nPresident Murmu also underlined the role of state governments in water conservation and expressed concern over the depletion of the groundwater situation of the country.\n\nShe said that water is a basic necessity and a fundamental human right for every individual.\n\n\u201cA clean and prosperous society cannot be built without ensuring access to clean water. The unavailability of water and poor sanitation have a greater impact on the health, food security and livelihood of the underprivileged,\u201d she said.\n\nThe President further noted that water conservation has been part of our tradition and underlined the need to retain the wisdom of ancestors.\n\n\u201cOur ancestors used to build ponds near villages. They used to build reservoirs in or near temples so that the stored water could be used in case of water shortage. Unfortunately, we are forgetting the wisdom of our ancestors. Some people have encroached upon reservoirs for personal gain.

She was barely a child of 3.5 years of age, however, instead of showing any love, affection and protection to the victim, the convict, on the contrary, made her a victim of lust,\" it noted.The court found it a \"clear case\" of betrayal.Apart from Pocso law, the man was convicted under Section 376 AB (punishment for committing rape on a woman under 12 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code.In addition to the 20-year RI, the court saddled the convict with Rs 50,000 fine and awarded Rs 1.2 lakh compensation to the minor survivor.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

A single bench of Justice R N Laddha, in the order dated October 18, refused anticipatory bail to Akash Avhad, while noting that the elderly man was \"mercilessly assaulted\".The high court said that his custodial interrogation may be required as the investigation in the case was at an initial stage.\"The informant (victim), a senior citizen aged about 71 years, was assaulted mercilessly. The investigation is at a nascent stage. Thus, to facilitate further investigation, custodial interrogation of the applicant (Avhad) would be necessary,\" the court was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The court further added that giving relief to Avhad in the form of pre-arrest bail could \"jeopardise the course of effective investigation\".The accused moved court fearing that he may be arrested again as the cops invoked fresh charges against him under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita. The charges included sections mandating punishment if someone intentionally hurts the religious feelings of another person through words, gestures, or objects and dacoity and causes grievous hurt.What is the case?On August 28, the 71-year-old man was travelling from Chalisgaon to Kalyan on the Dhule-CSMT (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) express. Upon the train reaching the Kalyan railway station, when he picked up his bag to alight, a few passengers suspected him of carrying beef and stopped him.Despite explaining what he carried was buffalo meat, which is not banned in Maharashtra, the men abused and thrashed him.The police have claimed that Avhad recorded the assault on his mobile phone.The bench, in its order, noted that the victim was assaulted by five to six unknown men, including Avhad, over a jar of alleged beef.After the incident, the man registered a case at Thane police station. The accused, however, were later released on bail.\"The applicant (Avhad) and the others restrained the informant (victim) from alighting at Kalyan railway station and assaulted and threatened to kill him. Prima facie, there is material to indicate that the applicant assaulted the informant and recorded the assault on his mobile phone,\" the court said.",

Siddique, a close aide of actor Salman Khan and Nationalist Congress Party (Ajit Pawar faction) leader was shot and killed by people allegedly with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang on 12 October. What does the man say?: Speaking to the press, the man said that Siddique was not a good man. He added that there were charges against him under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). It is said that he was associated with Dawood Ibrahim, the man behind the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts. He also added details about the number of members in Bishnoi's gang, how they are contacted and how he became a part of this nexus. (Archives of similar claims can be found here and here.)Fact-Check: Old Clip of Pappu Yadav Crying Falsely Linked to Baba Siddique CaseIs this true?: The person in the video is Yogesh alias Raju, who is allegedly a part of the Bishnoi gang. He was arrested on 16 October in connection to the murder of Nadir Shah, a gym owner in Delhi. Mumbai Police have arrested around 10 individuals in Siddique's case. Yogesh is not named as one of the suspects.Devendra Fadnavis\u2019 Poster With Gun Falsely Linked to Baba Siddique MurderWhat we found: At first, we ran a Google reverse image search on one of the frames of the video and came across the clip on the official X page of News24 from 18 October. We, then, ran a relevant keyword search and came across multiple news reports about an arrest related to a murder case in Delhi. An Indian Express report from 18 October stated that Delhi police arrested the second suspect in the shooting of gym owner Nadir Shah in Greater Kailash-1. The report noted the suspect's name as Yogesh alias Raju, who was apprehended during a short confrontation on the Mathura highway. They mentioned that he suffered a gunshot wound to his left leg during the gun battle and was treated at a facility in the city. The Indian Express quoting police officials stated that Yogesh was part of Bishnoi's nexus. Seven suspects - Akash Yadav, Nitalesh Tiwari, Vishal Verma, Naveen Baliyan, Mohammed Sajid, Pankaj Kumar, and Sachin Yadav had already been arrested. Old Video of Vivek Oberoi Praising Bishnoi Community Viral as RecentDelhi police comments: Taking to its official X page, the capital's police stated that it had arrested the main shooter in the GK gym murder case, with the help of Mathura police. The Special Cell of Delhi Police also posted on its X page, stating. \"Yogesh Raju, a sharp shooter of Lawrence Bishnoi & Hasim Baba gang arrested by Special Cell (SR) in a joint operation with Mathura Police. He was involved in the murder of Nadir Shah of South Delhi. 01 pistol, 07 live cartridges & a stolen bike recovered.\" (sic) Baba Siddique case: Mumbai police have arrested the two alleged shooters Gurmail Baljit Singh (23) and Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap (19), Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23) and Pravin Lonkar. Five other arrests of the following - Nitin Gautam Sapre (32), Sambhaji Kisan Pardhi (44), Pradeep Dattu Thombre (37), Chetan Dilip Pardhi (27), and Ram Fulchand Kanoujia (43) - have been made in the case. However, the alleged primary shooter, Shivkumar Gautam, along with conspirators Shubham Lonkar and Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar, remain at large. Mumbai police has not named Yogesh as one of the suspects. A report by India Today from 19 October stated that he did not have links with Siddique's murder. The Quint has reached out to Delhi police to confirm the same. Conclusion: The person in the video is not related to the murder of Siddique, but the killing of Nadir Shah.

Twenty of them are Muslims.\n\nThey were asked to vacate their properties in three days as per provisions of the Road Control Act, 1964.\n\nOne of the shops that received an eviction notice belongs to 62-year-old jeweller Abdul Hameed, who was allegedly involved in the killing of a 22-year-old named Ram Gopal Mishra last Sunday.\n\nThe incident led to riots in Bahraich. A total of 104 people have been arrested in connection with the violence.\n\nIn response to a petition challenging the notices, the Supreme Court cautioned the state\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party government against carrying out any demolition works in violation of its past orders.\n\nOn September 17, the Supreme Court stayed all demolitions in the country until further notice without its permission. In a subsequent hearing, the court said: \u201cWe will clarify demolition can\u2019t be carried out merely because someone is an accused or convict.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they [Uttar Pradesh government] want to take risk of flouting our order, it\u2019s their choice,\u201d said the bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan on Tuesday.\n\nThe Allahabad High Court on Sunday granted 15 days to the 23 residents to respond to the demolition notices. The High Court is scheduled to hear a plea filed in connection with the demolition notices on Wednesday.\n\nThere are no provisions in Indian law that allow for the demolition of property as a punitive measure. Nevertheless, the practice has become commonplace mainly in states ruled by the BJP.\n\nAuthorities in four BJP-ruled states and one Aam Aadmi Party-governed state punitively bulldozed 128 structures, mostly belonging to Muslims, between April 2022 and June 2022, human rights group Amnesty International said in a report in February.\n\nAnother FIR filed based on complaint by BJP MLA\n\nThe police in Bahraich have registered another FIR related to the communal violence, bringing the number of cases to 12, officials said on Monday.\n\nThe latest case, based on a complaint by Sureshwar Singh, the BJP MLA from Mahasi. The FIR names seven individuals including the Hindutva party\u2019s city youth wing chief Arpit Srivastava, for rioting and other charges.\n\nSingh has alleged that Srivastava led a mob that attacked his group on October 13 when Mishra\u2019s body was being taken to a mortuary. This led to clashes in which stones were thrown and guns fired.\n\nSingh urged the police to review security camera footage to identify more rioters involved in the clashes.\n\nThe FIR, registered on October 18, names Srivastava, Anuj Singh Raikwar, Shubham Mishra, Kushmendra Chaudhary, Manish Chandra Shukla, Pundrik Pandey and Sudhanshu Singh Rana.",

        "text": "With a semifinal spot already secured, India will look to reaffirm their dominance when they take on Bangladesh in their final Group A match of the SAFF Women's Championship in Kathmandu on Wednesday. For Bangladesh, this is a do-or-die clash. A win would crown them group champions, while a defeat would see Pakistan advance to the semifinals, with a superior goal difference. Pakistan, also on four points, would join India in the semifinals if the Blue Tigresses triumph. A draw would leave Bangladesh as group runners-up with four points, but they need a victory to top the group.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The Blue Tigresses clinched their place in the semifinals with a commanding 5-2 victory over Pakistan but now their focus shifts to topping the group and avenging a painful memory of 2022.In that edition, Bangladesh dealt a shocking blow on India by ending their unbeaten streak in the championship with a decisive 3-0 win in the group stage.It marked the first time India had lost to their South Asian rivals in SAFF history, and the Blue Tigresses will be eager to set the record straight.\"We have faced Bangladesh before, and we watched their last game against Pakistan. Our sole focus now is to win this match,\" skipper Bala Devi said.\"We have both senior and young players and we are prepared to push for a win. We have had productive training sessions, and I hope we can put what we have practiced into action.\" \"As the captain, I aim to lead by example and support the team in every way. Bangladesh has some fast and youthful players, but I believe our mental strength gives us an edge, which will be crucial in tomorrow's game,\" added the 34-year-old from Manipur.Head coach Santosh Kashyap has led the team through five days of training in Kathmandu, preparing for the challenges that lie ahead against Bangladesh.He has carefully assessed all the potential threats posed by the opposition.\"Tomorrow's match will be challenging, as Bangladesh are a strong side with a foreign coach and have solid tactical plans. Although we have already booked a spot in the semi-finals, we are taking it one game at a time, aiming to win every match.\"I prefer playing attacking football because it's not only effective but also entertaining for everyone. It's a style that I, as well as the players, enjoy, and we will try to maintain that momentum,\" Kashyap said.Defender Dalima Chhibber, who was named the Most Valuable Player in the 2019 SAFF Women's Championship, is making her return to the tournament after missing the 2022 edition.She was absent last time due to playing three seasons in Canada, but now she's back and ready to compete in the SAFF Championship once again.Bangladesh and Pakistan are currently tied on one point each after a 1-1 draw in their group-stage match.For Bangladesh, the absence of coach Golam Rabbani Choton, along with key players like defender Akhi Khatun and Anai Mogini, will be felt.However, the team have brought in fresh talents, including young players such as Afeida Khandakar, Matsushima Sumaya, and Airin Khatun.\"We are coming up against an Indian team, who, in my opinion, are probably the best team in the tournament,\" Bangladesh head coach Peter Butler said.\"They are very disciplined and organised in their manner and their demeanour of actually how they walk around the hotel. I think it'll be quite an attacking game. The most important thing is to try and share out the workload with all our players.\"It's a do or die game. It's a game we don't want to lose. India's already booked their semi-final berth and I'm quietly optimistic,\" he added.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The company claims it will provide customers with high-speed internet access at BSNL hotspots, minimising their data cost. It is also expanding TV services with the rollout of a fibre-based intranet TV service offering over 500 live channels and a Pay TV facility. BSNL says that the data used for TV streaming will not be deducted from the FTTH pack.\r\n\r\nThe telecom provider is also making it easy to get new connections or upgrade them, courtesy of new Any Time SIM (ATM) kiosks.

This facility is said to become useful for enabling UPI payments in emergencies and isolated regions. It is also rolling out an encrypted communications platform for government and relief agencies which may come in use in times of crisis. This service will leverage balloon-based and drone-based systems to widen the coverage in disaster-struck areas.\r\n\r\nThe telecom provider has also announced a partnership with C-DAC for the introduction of a private 5G network for mining services. It will enable artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT applications in underground and opencast mines. The high-speed, low latency connectivity is claimed to benefit safety analytics, real-time control of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), remote maintenance courtesy of augmented reality (AR), and fleet tracking and optimisation.\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

In just the first three quarters of 2024, close to 70 companies have already gone public on Indian stock exchanges.\n\nOne of the main motivations for returning is the ability to gain crucial analyst coverage locally. While Indian tech \u201cunicorns\u201d establishing themselves abroad was a common strategy in the past decade, being domiciled within the country provides better access to institutional investors that follow businesses valued under $2 billion more closely.\n\nAfter over a decade of expansion internationally, India's booming tech sector is coming back in a big way.

        "text": "Eight students from Balochistan have reportedly gone missing from their shared residence in Gulistan-i-Jauhar in Pakistan\u2019s biggest city Karachi, according to a report by Dawn. Family members allege that law enforcement agencies \u201ctook away\u201d the students, but police have declined to comment on these allegations.According to reports, the missing students\u2013Shoaib Ali, Haneef, Ishfaq , Shahzad, Bebarg Ameer, Zubair, Qambar Ali, and Saeedullah disappeared on October 16. Three of them are enrolled at Karachi University, three attend a seminary, one is an intermediate student, and another studies at Urdu University. Families maintain that the students were picked up by law enforcement from their residence in Rustam Zikri Goth.Talking to Dawn, Wazir Ahmed, the elder brother of missing student Qambar Ali, stated, \u201cQambar is an intermediate student in Mashkey, Awaran, but he was taking coaching classes at a tuition academy near Nipa.\u201d He, along with the families of other missing students, approached the police on October 17, but the SHO refused to file their report. Ahmed emphasised that they have no political affiliations or involvement in any suspicious activities, demanding the immediate release of the students.In response to the situation, Riaz Ahmed, a member of the Karachi University syndicate, condemned the disappearances, stating, \u201cIt is horrifying that students are apprehended and made to disappear without charges. Young students should not be subjected to the harsh realities of state actions.\u201dThe issue of enforced appearances is a significant human rights concern that reflects the broader challenges facing the region. In Balochistan, enforced disappearances have been reported extensively, with individuals, often activists, political leaders, and students, going missing under mysterious circumstances, frequently attributed to state security forces or non-state actors.These disappearances create a climate of fear and insecurity, impacting the social fabric of communities. Families of the disappeared face immense challenges, including emotional distress and a lack of access to justice. The government has been criticized for its insufficient response to these cases, with many families left without answers about the fate of their loved ones.",

Kar Hospital.\n\nThey withdrew their hunger strike on the 17th day after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday.\n\nThe medics also called off their proposed shutdown in the State\u2019s health sector scheduled to be initiated from Tuesday till an indefinite period.",

While 293.81 kg of heroin was seized from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port (Navi Mumbai) by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Delhi police Special Cell had impounded 352.71 kg of drugs from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana.\n\nAccording to the ED, the arrested people coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. \n\n\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder. The accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED uncovered a highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions and operational expenses by the accused has been made, said the agency. \n\nThe accused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. \n\n\u201cThe syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local market. Further, the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles...from second-hand market for supplying the drugs from the storage hubs to other points of distribution,\u201d said an official. \n\nThe agency said cash was used for purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities. \n\n\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via Nava Sheva port, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri (Madhya Pradesh) and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. The transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED has attached a property in Jandoli village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of the accused and fixed deposits.",

Sivasankar had recently announced that the Department would operate private buses by hiring them at \u20b951.25 per kilometre on a rental basis for the Deepavali festival. Operating private buses on behalf of the State government under the guise of people\u2019s convenience cannot be allowed,\u201d Mr. Anbumani said.\n\n\u201cThough the State government had said it would operate only a limited number of private buses, the reasons given by it are false. The private buses will be operated on a Gross Cost Contract basis. Initially, this system will be implemented only on additional buses. But in the future, it is likely that when there is a need to replace old buses operated by transport corporations, they will be replaced by private buses without purchasing new buses,\u201d he alleged.\n\nHe further said: \u201cLack of buses has been created only to impose private buses onto transport corporations. After the DMK came to power, it ordered 8,182 buses but procured only 1,088 buses. Why is there a delay in purchasing new buses?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the State government has any real intention to develop the transport corporations, it should allocate sufficient funds to purchase buses and recruit drivers and conductors,\u201d he said.",

The capital city of Havana has been largely paralyzed for several days as residents and business struggle without power. Other regions are now bracing for a fourth night without lights as repair efforts continue.\n\nHurricane Oscar made landfall on Cuba's eastern coast over the weekend as a tropical storm, bringing strong winds and heavy rains. In its wake, preliminary reports indicate at least six deaths have occurred. Beyond loss of life, the hurricane has exacerbated an existing energy crisis on the island. A massive outage first hit on Thursday and remains unresolved, halting daily activities across Cuba. The prolonged lack of power has renewed frustrations among some in the population.\n\nIn a handful of neighborhoods in Havana, small protests have emerged. Demonstrators have been heard banging pots and pans in the streets or staging demonstrations from their balconies. One group blocked a road using garbage in an apparent expression of discontent. The demonstrations come amidst a time of deep economic troubles in Cuba, which some partially attribute to a long-standing US embargo. Though small so far, any unrest is being closely monitored by authorities.\n\nCuba's Energy Minister stated hopes that reliable electricity may return in the next couple days. However, damage from both the hurricane and pre-existing infrastructure problems could prolong the blackout. Schools and many workplaces will also stay closed through mid-week. Officials are asking the public to conserve power however possible until full restoration is achieved. Meanwhile, residents do what they can to cope with the aftermath of the deadly storm and resulting drawn out period in the dark.",

        "title": "'Sexually Abused Minors Most Vulnerable; Statutory Rights Key to Empowerment': Allahabad HC Denies Bail to Man Accused of Trafficking Daughter",
        "text": "The Allahabad High Court recently emphasised the critical importance of ensuring statutory rights for child victims under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, stating that realisation of these rights is the key to empowering them to engage with the legal process on a fair footing.\nWhile hearing a bail plea in a child abuse case, the court expressed concern that the victim, despite being a minor entitled to multiple protections under the POCSO Act, had not been made aware of her rights. The case records revealed that no support person or legal aid was provided, and the State failed to ensure the victim had access to government schemes, medical care, or counselling services.\nThe bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot remarked that child victims of sexual abuse belong to the most vulnerable class of citizens. They are often hindered in their pursuit of justice by circumstances such as trauma, social marginalisation, poverty, and a lack of legal awareness, it added.\nThe court observed that without the support systems guaranteed by the POCSO Act, child victims are unable to prosecute their cases effectively.\nEmpowering these victims, the court stressed, is vital to dismantling the barriers that impede their search for justice, and this can only be achieved by ensuring the enforcement of their statutory rights, the single-judge bench emphasised.\nThe court further emphasised that authorities\u2014including the police, Child Welfare Committees (CWC), District Legal Services Authorities, and medical and administrative bodies\u2014are obligated under the POCSO Act to provide victims with essential support services, such as legal aid, medical specialists, and access to government welfare schemes.\nThe court also noted that the responsibility is cast on the courts/magistrates considering the bail applications in POCSO offences to ensure that entitlements of the victims are provided and the rights conferred by the said enactment are enforced.\nJustice Bhanot pointed out that the rights and entitlements of victims under the POCSO Act must be safeguarded not only during bail proceedings but throughout the trial process.\nHe stressed that Child Welfare Committees, medical authorities, and police officials must be brought under the jurisdiction of the trial courts to ensure they fulfil their statutory duties.\nThese bodies must submit reports detailing the support provided to victims, and trial courts are legally bound to review these reports and ensure compliance with the POCSO Act, the court stressed.\n\u201cThe above mandate of the POCSO Act has to be rigorously followed and meticulously implemented,\u201d the court said.\nThe court warned that the current implementation is inadequate and risks frustrating the legislative intent behind the law. \u201cLegislation cannot be reduced to a dead letter by the apathy of the statutory authorities\u201d, it said.\nAccordingly, the court directed the Uttar Pradesh Secretary of the Department of Women and Child Development to create standardised formats for the reports that Child Welfare Committees must submit during bail hearings.\nThese reports should detail the support extended to victims, including counselling, legal aid, and access to government schemes. The court also ordered that regular training programs be conducted for CWC members to ensure compliance with the Act.\nIn the case at hand, the court denied bail to Rajendra Prasad, who is accused of trafficking his 14-year-old daughter for sexual exploitation.\nPrasad, who had been in custody since November 2022, had applied for bail on charges under Sections 376 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 16 and 17 of the POCSO Act.\nThe court rejected his bail application, citing the victim\u2019s vulnerability and the fact that she had identified Prasad as the principal offender who trafficked her for money.",

        "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday had a light-hearted moment when a lawyer accidentally referred to Justice Hrishikesh Roy as Justice Hrishikesh Mukherjee, mixing up the judge\u2019s name with that of the legendary filmmaker. Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud immediately corrected the lawyer, reminding him that it's essential for an advocate to know the names of the judges. While referring a previous case, the lawyer said, \"This matter was before Justice Hrishikesh Mukherjee.\" Chandrachud, quick to step in, humorously responded, \u201cHrishikesh Mukherjee or Justice Hrishikesh Roy? If you make Roy into Mukherjee, then... you must know your judges. This is the limit. Please go and check the website.\u201d The mix-up was particularly amusing because Hrishikesh Mukherjee is one of Indian cinema's most beloved filmmakers, known for his timeless films like Anand, Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Guddi, Bawarchi, and Abhimaan. His movies, which blended humor, emotion, and subtle social commentary, continue to be adored across generations. Justice Hrishikesh Roy, who took oath as a Supreme Court judge in September 2019, has had a distinguished career. Before his Supreme Court appointment, he served as the Chief Justice of Kerala High Court and as a judge in the Gauhati High Court. Prior to his judicial role, he was a senior lawyer. Despite the amusing slip-up, the Chief Justice's light correction ensured the moment ended with a smile, adding a touch of humor to the court proceedings.",

The parody account mocks Sitharaman's role as the finance minister and there was mixed reaction towards it from the netizens. The fake profile claims the finance minister as a 24-year-old lady with a bemusing job designation as \"Chief Tax Slayer at ministry\". The bio reads: \"\u201cI don\u2019t believe in love at first sight, but I do believe in GST on everything you own. I\u2019ve raised more taxes than your ex raised red flags. Swipe right if you're into women who can deduct happiness, itemize suffering, and maximize your stress. I'm not your girlfriend; I'm your liability.\" The profile has more quirky description. When asked to share a \"humble brag\", Sitharaman of the parody account responds: \"I can drain your bank account without breaking a sweat.\u201d Under the My dream is to, the description goes: \"Create a tax system so strict that it makes everyone wish they'd never crossed me.\" Under the description of \"one thing one need to know about her\", the response reads: \"I'll tax your salary, your sanity, and your soul. No exemptions, no mercy -- just fiscal domination\" While the satirical profile garnered a riot of laughter, there was mixed reaction on social media platforms like X. At the same time, a few netizens felt the fake account was belittling a serious political leader's work. They questioned the rhetoric behind using public figures in such light-hearted, and disrespectful way. One another user termed the creation of the fake profile as \"disgusting abomination.

        "text": "Uncertainty shocks for India tend to mimic aggregate supply shocks, with heightened uncertainty leading to slower growth but higher inflation, said RBI Deputy Governor Michael D Patra, even as he emphasised that this presents a dilemma for monetary policy -- tighten to control high inflation or ease to respond to lower growth.\n\n Applying a one standard deviation shock to the (text mining-based policy uncertainty) index in a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework on quarterly data for India produces an interesting result. In the case of advanced economies such as the US, research suggests that uncertainty shocks lead to lower output and lower prices.\n\nAlso read: RBI imposes restrictions on Asirvad Micro Finance, Arohan Financial Services, DMI Finance and Navi Finserv\n\n \u201cIn the Indian context, however, uncertainty shocks tend to mimic aggregate supply shocks such that heightened uncertainty leads to slower growth but higher inflation\u201d Patra said in his inaugural address at the New York Fed Central Banking Seminar organised by the Federal Reserve Bank, New York, USA.\n\nIndia\u2019s time has come\n\nThe Deputy Governor emphasised that he does believe with all the strength of his conviction that India\u2019s time has come. \n\n \u201cIndia heads into its future with the youngest population in the world with a median age of 28 years. Unlike in many parts of the world, the working age population is growing \u2013 every sixth working age person is an Indian,\u201d he said. \n\nPatra noted that since independence in 1947, India\u2019s growth path has undergone three structural shifts with trend growth, having risen to 7 per cent during 2002-2019. \n\nAlso read: India\u2019s overall growth outlook remains strong despite temporary dip in momentum: RBI Bulletin\n\n After the severe contraction in the pandemic, a new growth trajectory averaging 8 per cent seems to be forming during 2021-24, he added. \n\nGrowth to revert to 8% trend\n\n \u201cIndia is now regarded as the fastest growing major economy in the world. Already the fifth largest economy in terms of market exchange rates, it is poised to become the third largest economy by 2030.\n\n \u201cIt is already the third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. Our projections show that India\u2019s real GDP growth will be 7.2 per cent in 2024-25 and around 7.0 per cent in 2025-26 in a cyclical correction to the rebound from the pandemic. Thereafter, there is a strong likelihood that India\u2019s growth will revert to the 8 per cent trend,\u201d he said.\n\nPrice pressures\n\n Patra observed that the front-loaded monetary policy tightening with a cumulative 250 basis points (bps) increase in the policy rate and a stance of withdrawal of accommodation guided inflation down to an average of 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 -- back into the tolerance band (2-6 per cent). \n\n \u201cIt is projected to average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 and 4.1 per cent in 2025-26. Inflation fell below (4 pe per cent) target during July-August but rose to 5.5 per cent in September on the back of a pickup in price momentum in some food items and adverse base effects inherent in year-on-year measurement. \n\nAlso read: MPC keeps repo rate unchanged; changes stance to neutral\n\n \u201cOur projection indicates that these price pressures will persist in October and November before headline inflation realigns with the target from December 2024 and remains aligned in 2025-26,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Former California first lady and journalist Maria Shriver recently disclosed that only pre-arranged questions were allowed to be posed to Vice President Kamala Harris during a town hall event held in Michigan on Monday.At the Oakland County event, a woman in the audience inquired if it would be possible to ask a question, just before Harris was set to appear alongside former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, according to the Daily Mail. Shriver responded by informing her that audience members would not be allowed to ask questions, as there were already pre-determined questions. Shriver added that she hoped to raise some questions that might be on the audience's minds.A video clip of Shriver\u2019s exchange soon went viral on social media, leading to widespread criticism. Many users remarked that the event appeared more like a staged production rather than a genuine town hall, where candidates typically engage with unscripted questions from voters. Comments on X (formerly Twitter) were filled with scepticism, with one user remarking that the event resembled a \"stage production\" rather than an authentic town hall, claiming that Harris was unable to handle spontaneous interactions.\u2014 TimMurtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) Fox News political analyst Brit Hume similarly criticised the format, while other users referred to the event as a \u201cprepped answer show,\u201d indicating their frustration at the lack of genuine interaction. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even went so far as to say the event was no longer pretending to hide its scripted nature.During the hour-long event, Harris took just three questions from the audience, while Shriver praised Cheney as a courageous public servant. Shriver later took to social media, expressing her view that the event embodied what prioritising the country over party politics looked like.Harris held a similar town hall with Cheney in Wisconsin, moderated by anti-Trump commentator Charlie Sykes, although it remains unclear if the questions in that forum were also pre-determined. Harris's campaign has not responded to requests for comment on the matter.The criticism surrounding this town hall ties into the broader challenge Harris has faced during media appearances. Venture capitalist David Sacks predicted a \u201cdoom loop\u201d scenario for Harris, suggesting that if she falls behind in the polls, she will be forced to give more media interviews, which could, in turn, lead to further declines in her polling numbers due to her difficulty in handling interviews. He pointed out that this could exacerbate her already existing issues with public perception.Harris\u2019s recent media engagements, including an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, have been particularly challenging. In this interview, Harris appeared unprepared on key issues such as immigration and President Biden\u2019s mental fitness. Critics argued that her inability to address these concerns effectively and her tendency to deflect difficult questions highlighted the difficulties she faces when under media scrutiny. As this cycle continues, it has become increasingly evident that engaging with the press could further harm her standing unless she manages to deliver a strong, confident performance.",

I will not bow down to their games, nor will I step back from the cause of social justice,\u201d said the Chief Minister.\n\nHe added that he has been blessed by the people of Varuna Constituency to become the Chief Minister twice.\n\n\u201cVaruna is a stronghold of the Congress. Even in the Lok Sabha elections, you gave more votes to the Congress than to the BJP. I am immensely grateful to the voters of this constituency for their special support,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further stated that continuous funding has been provided for the development of the Varuna constituency.\n\nHe claimed that whenever the Congress government has been in power, they have implemented programmes to empower the poor across the state, not just in Varuna.\n\n\u201cAlong with introducing many welfare schemes, we have waived off loans from several corporations. In line with Ambedkar\u2019s vision, we have created and implemented programmes to provide economic empowerment to the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe claimed that even after becoming the Chief Minister for the second time, we have introduced five guarantee schemes designed to support the poor and middle class of all castes and religions.\n\n\u201cThrough these guarantees, we are directly transferring Rs 56,000 crores into the accounts of the people every year. Our party, the Congress, is a party that does what it says,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nLashing out at the BJP, Siddaramaiah said that whether it\u2019s the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government at the Centre or former Chief Ministers B.S. Yediyurappa, Basavaraj Bommai, or Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, they looted without contributing to the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is an opponent of social justice and the poor. Can you point to a single instance where the Central government, which has come to power three times, has followed through on its promises? In all his years as Prime Minister, has the union government implemented a single scheme that benefits the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that Karnataka contributes the highest taxes to the Central government.\n\n\u201cShould we beg to receive our rightful share? Recently, the central government gave Uttar Pradesh and Bihar the largest share of taxes but only gave our state a paltry Rs 6,000 crores, which is a gross injustice. This cannot be tolerated,\u201d he said.\n\nSiddaramaiah also criticised Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, saying that she had recommended Rs 5,495 crores for irrigation projects and special grants for the state but didn\u2019t release the funds.\n\n\u201cShe also announced Rs 3,000 crores for peripheral road development and lake improvement in the state but has not released a single rupee. Is it wrong for the people of the state to speak out against this injustice? Is it wrong for us to protest,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Multiple Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) schools nationwide received hoax bomb threats late on Monday night, sources said. The schools affected by the hoax threats include two in Delhi--one in Rohini and another in Dwarka--as well as one in Hyderabad. Sources indicate that the threats were communicated through email to the management of these institutions. Authorities are investigating the incident, with the matter being reviewed by higher officials from various organizations, including the CRPF, Intelligence Bureau, and Delhi Police. The threat email specified a potential bomb blast in the classrooms of these schools at 11 am on Tuesday. However, the threat has since been determined to be a hoax. The hoax threat was received a day after the blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi's Rohini on Sunday for which a pro-Khalistani group claimed responsibility that sent shockwaves through the national capital. Delhi Police reached out to social media platforms and the messaging app Telegram, requesting details about the channel where the post was made, and the matter is being investigated. The Sunday blast in the Prashant Vihar school was so powerful that it tore through the wall of the school. No injuries were reported in the incident however some of the nearby buildings and vehicles were damaged. Such hoax bomb threats on domestic and international flights have been received for several days. So far this week, more than 90 flights have received bomb threats and most of them have turned out to be hoaxes. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) Director General Zulfiqar Hasan on Monday met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan and apprised him about the recent hoax bomb threats in domestic and international flights. In the nearly half-an-hour meeting with the Home Ministry, both the DGs informed the Home Secretary about a series of recent hoax calls threatening domestic and international flights that has created panic situations on many occasions forcing the officials in the Indian aviation sector, intelligence wing, and other departments to go through rigorous security check process. Sources said that the officials discussed the potential implications for aviation security and measures being taken to address the situation, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and coordination among security agencies.",

PM Modi arrived in Kazan earlier in the day and was welcomed at the airport by Rustam Minnikhanov, the head of the Republic of Tatarstan. The summit brings together leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa to discuss important global issues under the theme \"Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security.\" During the meeting, PM Modi emphasized the need for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. He reiterated India's stance on promoting dialogue and diplomacy as the path to resolving the war, which has been ongoing for two years. \u201cI have been in constant touch with you regarding the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As I have said earlier, we believe that the problems should be resolved in a peaceful manner. We fully support the early establishment of peace and stability. All our efforts give priority to humanity,\u201d PM Modi stated, adding that India is ready to provide any possible cooperation for peace efforts. #WATCH | Russia: Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets and holds a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Kazan on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS Summit. (Source: Host Broadcaster) pic.twitter.com/FARmZH7T0U \u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 22, 2024 The Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Kazan aims to strengthen India-Russia relations further, building on the \"Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership\" shared between the two nations. The bilateral meeting also follows last month's acknowledgment by Putin, who called Modi a \"friend\" and expressed gratitude for India's support in seeking a peaceful end to the war. The invitation to attend the BRICS Summit was extended during this time, and it comes after PM Modi had urged Putin to work towards a resolution in a call two months ago. In August, Modi had also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, underlining India's balanced diplomatic efforts to foster peace. In addition to meeting Putin, PM Modi is expected to hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other BRICS leaders during the summit. The summit offers a crucial platform to discuss global developmental issues, climate change, economic cooperation, supply chain resilience, and cultural exchanges among member nations. A significant development occurred just before the summit when India and China agreed to resume patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, marking a breakthrough in their strained diplomatic relations. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri indicated that efforts were underway to arrange a meeting between PM Modi and President Xi during the summit. This visit to Russia marks Modi's second trip to the country this year. In July, he attended the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit in Moscow, where he not only engaged in bilateral talks but was also awarded Russia's highest civilian honor, the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle. The two-day BRICS Summit provides a valuable opportunity for leaders to evaluate the progress of initiatives and explore future collaboration, especially amid ongoing global unrest, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East crisis.

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Enforcement Directorate (ED) regarding its handling of the arrest of retired IAS officer Anil Tuteja, who is accused in connection with an alleged liquor scam in Chhattisgarh. The court expressed concern over the speed and manner in which Tuteja was summoned and arrested.During the hearing, the Supreme Court asked the ED to clarify the process it followed in summoning Tuteja, particularly why there was an apparent rush in serving the summons and taking him into custody. The court was responding to Tuteja\u2019s plea challenging the Chhattisgarh High Court's refusal to quash the corruption and money laundering charges against him.The court noted that Tuteja was already being questioned by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) when the ED issued its summons. The first summons was served at noon, and another followed just a few hours later. \u201cPlease explain to us this procedure. He is in the ACB office, ED issues summons at 12.00 pm and then 5.30 pm. What is this hurry?\u201d the bench questioned.The justices further asked why the ED insisted on summoning Tuteja at a specific time, despite knowing he was being interrogated by ACB officers. The court sought an explanation from the probe agency regarding why officers from the ACB escorted Tuteja to the ED\u2019s office and whether he appeared voluntarily.Tuteja\u2019s counsel informed the court that his client was questioned by the ED throughout the night. Expressing disapproval, the court remarked, \u201cWhat kind of practice is this? Full night the person is interrogated. This is unpardonable.\u201dThe Supreme Court stressed the importance of following due process, reminding the ED of the constitutional rights enshrined in Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.\u201cThey should remember there\u2019s something called Article 21,\u201d the bench observed.The Supreme Court has directed the ED to file an additional affidavit detailing the manner in which the summons were served under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), and the circumstances leading to Tuteja\u2019s arrest in the early hours of the morning.The court will resume hearing the case on November 5.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024",

        "text": "Sudhakar Adapa, founder and CEO of BIA Brands, explained the difference between e-commerce and quick commerce and how quick commerce will have to be 'not so quick' to become sustainable. \"E-commerce is thriving these days while quick commerce or q commerce is probably the new version of e-commerce. The fundamentals of business are going to be the same, it's just about how we are going to deliver, that is going to change,\" Mr Adapa said at the NDTV World Summit 2024.He also said the definition of quick will have to change for the model to be sustainable.\"Is quick commerce going to be a sustainable thing? I would say yes and no. Yes, because it will be another kind of commerce which will survive but I think the definition of quick will change. Right now the consumer wants everything to be delivered in under 10 minutes and if you say 20 minutes, the consumer will say I can't wait for 10 more minutes. India has a huge population density which is why it is one of the few countries where quick commerce worked. But, I think the definition of quick will change from 10 minutes to 60 minutes because not everything can be delivered in 10 minutes time. If this model has to be sustainable it will become not-so-quick commerce,\" he said.Mr Adapa said that in today's day and age social media has become a potent weapon for brands: \"The use of social media is across all the sectors. As brands, if we have to survive then social media has become a potent weapon and the advantage of private labels is such that it is actually giving space to smaller brands to compete with Unilever and P&Gs of the world. For example, if I had to launch a cosmetics brand 10 years ago, you need to own a brand, you need to formulate yourself, you need to have a manufacturing plant, a quality control department, you need to control R&D, the whole ecosystem has huge costs and it's not feasible for a small entrepreneur to launch a company. Now today if you want to launch a beauty brand, all you need to do is maybe go to a contract manufacturer, make some sampling, get some 1,000 pieces up, put it up online and boom you have a brand. It has become so easy these days.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");He, however, also stressed that \"everything has its own advantages and disadvantages\".\"The advantage is that you could pull your company with no capital, if you have a great product, you could build a company with almost next to nothing. The flip side is the kind of competition is there in the market. Differentiation has become really difficult for us. But the good thing is that the customers are spoilt for choice. they have great products and great prices there. Customers are making merry at the time, enjoying the great discounts,\" Mr Adapa said.",

The team management will be closely examining the optimal squad composition to ensure a competitive performance.With spin all-rounder Washington Sundar being added to the squad, and Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant have been declared fit for the Pune game, the spotlight will be on the playing eleven selected for this crucial encounter, as Team India aims to level the three-match series.Young Sarfaraz Khan, who replaced injured Gill, scored a brilliant 150 in the second-innings of the first Test, while KL Rahul remained off-colour in both the innings.Will Gill is all set to return in the Pune Test, India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate categorically stated that it is a battle between Sarfaraz and Rahul as both are fighting for a place in the XI.\"Yeah, there's no point in sugarcoating it, there's a fight for a spot,\" Ten Doeschate said at the presser, ahead of India's training session, when asked if Rahul and Sarfaraz were battling for a place in the team.\"Sarfaraz was obviously brilliant in the last Test. I went to KL after the last Test (and) said how many balls do you play at (and) miss at? He didn't play at (and) miss at one ball and that's what tends to happen when you're not getting runs.\"There's certainly no concerns about KL, he's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space. But we are certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team,\" he said.Admitting that it's difficult to exclude Rahul from the Test format equation, ten Doeschate revealed that head coach Gautam Gambhir is \"eager\" to give him an extended run.\"It's not like we're worried about his form. If you go on just the past three months since Gauti has been in here, he's keen to give him (Rahul) as much rope as we can. We have a lot of faith in him,\" Ten Doeschate said.\"But at the same time, it's a very competitive environment, with Sarfaraz getting 150 plus runs (222 not out) in the Irani Trophy final. The decision will be what's best for the team, but we'll certainly back all the guys in,\" he added.",

He had already spoken thrice and wanted to get a chance again during the presentation. But BJP MP Abhijit Gangopadhyay objected. This ensued a heated exchange between them, where sources said both used abusive language. \nMeanwhile, Kalyan Banerjee picked up a glass water bottle, hit it on the table and hurt himself. After this, he threw the broken bottle towards the chairman. Due to the incident, the meeting adjourned for some time. Soon after, Banerjee was taken for medical aid, wherein he received four stitches in his hand. \nIn today\u2019s meeting, the committee is hearing views and suggestions from representatives of Justice in Reality and Panchasakha Prachar, both based in Cuttack, Odisha. \nA delegation of five MPs from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is also presenting their perspectives on the bill. \nThe committee met on Monday, inviting officials from the Ministry of Minority Affairs to provide oral evidence regarding the bill. This meeting is part of a larger national initiative to address long-standing issues related to the management of waqf properties.On Monday, discussions during the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) meeting became heated as opposition members questioned the consultative process behind the legislation. \nThey accused the government of introducing the bill for political reasons, alleging it targeted the Muslim community. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi presented a nearly one-hour critique of the bill, raising concerns about its implications. Trinamool Congress leader Kalyan Banerjee even asked whether Waqf, which exists in the name of Allah, is legally recognized by the state. Despite the tensions, BJP members defended the bill, arguing that it is necessary for reforming Waqf property management and ensuring transparency. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to bring significant reforms, including digitization of records, stricter audits, increased transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied waqf properties. \n(Note: Only the headline has been reworked by the India.com staff; the rest of the content has been taken from ANI.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "Samsung India Electronics Private Limited (SIEPL) on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) claimed it had suffered a loss to the tune of around $100 million due to the recent strike by a section of employees, who wanted their trade union \u2014 Samsung India Thozhilalar Sangam, affiliated with the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) \u2014 to be registered. \n\nAppearing before Justice R.N. Manjula, who was seized of a writ petition filed by P. Ellan, general secretary of the new trade union, senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing SIEPL, contended that trade unions could not be allowed to use the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their name since their activities would affect the company\u2019s reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, advocate N.G.R. Prasad, representing the writ petitioner, contended it was not a trademark dispute for the company to raise objections over the use of its name by a trade union. He said SIEPL was not a necessary party to the writ petition and hence, its impleading petition must be dismissed.\n\nMr. Prasad also told the court that Samsung was a South Korea-based multinational manufacturing conglomerate and that even over there, its trade unions had been using the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their names. He argued the present writ petition was only between the trade union and the Registrar of Trade Unions.\n\nHowever, Mr. Rajagopalan said SIEPL must necessarily be impleaded as a respondent to the writ petition, seeking a direction to the Registrar to register the trade union, and permitted to file a detailed counter-affidavit explaining as to why trade unions could not use the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their names.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, the judge allowed the impleading application filed by SIEPL and granted it time till November 11 to file its counter-affidavit to the writ petition. She observed that the company must be given an opportunity to make its submissions to the plea for registering the trade union.",

        "text": "Srinagar: The Counter-Intelligence Wing (CIK) of the Jammu and Kashmir police on Tuesday carried out multiple raids in seven districts of the Kashmir Valley to dismantle a newly formed militant outfit believed to be an offshoot of the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Officials said that during the searches at ten places, mainly the residential houses of the outfit\u2019s suspected members, 14 mobile phones, one laptop and other incriminating materials were seized and seven persons detained for questioning. Formal arrests will be made after the scrutiny of seized material and other investigations, they added. During weeks of undercover investigation, the CIK officials found that a new militant outfit in the name \u2018Tehreek Labaik Ya Muslim (Oh Muslim, here I\u2019m at Your Service Movement) has been former and is probably an offshoot of LeT and being operated by a Pakistani terrorist handler known by his alias \u2018Baba Hamas\u2019. Its sleuths early Tuesday raided places in the Valley\u2019s Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kulgam, Budgam, Anantnag, and Pulwama districts to dismantle a recruitment module of a newly formed terrorist organisation. \u201cDuring these raids a recruitment network of the newly formed terrorist organization TLM, believed to be an offshoot of the LeT was dismantled. The CIK\u2019s swift action aims to neutralize any further growth of the group and disrupt their operations in the region,\u201d an official said. He said that the TLM was suspected of attempting to expand its base in J&K through the recruitment of local youth. He added that the successful operation marks a significant step towards curbing terrorism in the Valley. \u201cWe are investigating the outfit\u2019s connections, funding sources and the larger objectives in J&K and beyond and the data in the mobile phones and other electronic devices in the use of its suspected members are likely to be helpful,\u201d said the official.",

In Karnal, two farmers were arrested for illegal burning of stubble, officials said.\n\nAn order issued by Haryana\u2019s Director of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Rajnarayan Kaushik, said, \u201cThe 24 officials/officers are hereby suspended on the administrative ground. Terms and conditions of the suspension will be circulated later.\u201d\n\nThose who faced action included three supervisors from Kaithal, two from Sonipat and two from Jind. Two inspectors from Ambala and one from Fatehabad were also suspended.\n\nMeanwhile, FIRs were registered against three farmers in Sirsa district for stubble burning and five agriculturalists were slapped with a penalty of Rs 20,000 each.\n\nDeputy Director, of Agriculture, Sukhdev Kamboj, said 16 incidents of stubble burning had been reported in the district.\n\n\u201cThree farmers have been booked and five farmers have been penalised Rs 20,000 each. The Revenue Department has also made a red entry in its records against the defaulters due to which their crop would not be bought by the government for two seasons,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told IANS that the state government is also offering monetary benefits to farmers at the rate of Rs 1,000 per acre if they don\u2019t burn the stubble and mix it with soil.\n\nIn Karnal district, the administration confirmed receiving information related to 68 incidents of stubble burning.\n\nStation House Officer, Sadar Police Station, Rajpal Singh confirmed that three FIRs had been registered. \u201cTwo accused have been arrested while one is still to be taken into custody,\u201d he told IANS.\n\nIn a related development, farmers at Karnal mandi voiced their concerns over the government\u2019s failure to provide an alternative to stubble burning.\n\n\u201cThere is a shortage of machines to discard crop residue, leaving farmers with little option but to burn stubble,\u201d said Shiv Kumar, a farmer.\n\nAnother agriculturist, Satpal, urged the government to come up with a solution soon to save them from monetary loss. \n\n\u201cIf a farmer does not burn stubble, he ends up incurring a loss of up to Rs 7,000,\u201d he said. \n\nThe punitive action against Haryana officials for failure to check stubble burning comes close to Delhi Chief Minister Atishi\u2019s attack on the BJP-ruled state for failure to check stubble burning that was adding to air pollution in the national capital.\n\nCiting data from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Atishi highlighted that between October 1 and 15, 2023, Punjab recorded only 811 farm fires, down 27 per cent from the previous year\u2019s 1,105. In contrast, she pointed out, Haryana saw a 23 per cent increase in farm fires during the same period, rising from 341 in 2022 to 400 in 2023.\n\nAtishi questioned why the BJP governments in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh couldn\u2019t replicate the success of Punjab in reducing stubble burning, accusing them of playing \u201cdirty politics\u201d at the expense of Delhi\u2019s residents.\n\n\u201cIf AAP\u2019s Punjab government can reduce stubble burning, why can\u2019t the BJP governments in Haryana and UP do the same?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe Delhi Chief Minister highlighted the success of AAP-ruled Punjab, stating that in 2021, before the AAP government was formed, Punjab recorded 71,300 stubble-burning incidents. However, by 2023, this number was halved to 36,600. She attributed this reduction to the AAP\u2019s sustained efforts over two years.",

        "text": "Kazan [Russia]: Indian students in Kazan, Russia, are happy and excited about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrival at Hotel Korston, as he attends the 16th BRICS Summit. Notably, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday touched down in Kazan city of Russia to participate in the 16th BRICS Summit and received a warm welcome.

Mr. Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, to attend the 16th BRICS Summit.\" \"India values the close cooperation within BRICS which has emerged as an important platform for dialogue and discussion on issues concerning the global developmental agenda, reformed multilateralism, climate change, economic cooperation, building resilient supply chains, promoting cultural and people to people connect, among others,\" PM Modi said.

        "title": "Video forensics uncover loopholes in terror group's propaganda footage",
        "text": "A video circulated by the banned terror outfit, The Resistance Front (TRF)\u2014a self-proclaimed Kashmiri militant group\u2014following the gruesome attack that killed seven in Kashmir, reveals the propaganda machinery behind such terror incidents. The footage, shared widely on social media after Sunday evening\u2019s attack at the Z-Morh tunnel on the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway, bears TRF's text, \u201cWe were here,\u201d implying it was shot during the attack.However, forensic analysis conducted by India Today\u2019s Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) team reveals that the footage was originally filmed at least a month earlier. A version of the same video, without the TRF text and logo, was initially posted by a local Instagram account on September 21, who often shares travel photos and videos from that locality. It appears that the terror outfit repurposed this footage for its propaganda. The original video was likely filmed by someone driving a white SUV with an antenna on the bonnet. While the cropped TRF version doesn\u2019t show the vehicle, a brief glimpse of the antenna is visible as the footage approaches the tunnel\u2019s exit. (The video footage released by TRF was likely sourced from an earlier video posted on Instagram) SUV bonnet mounted antenna can be seen in both videos Another intriguing aspect is the software used to edit the footage. The video appears to have been edited using CapCut, a popular mobile application, though it is banned in India due to its Chinese origin. Following the June 2020 clashes in Galwan Valley between Indian and Chinese forces, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology banned over 100 Chinese apps under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. The ban was based on concerns that these apps were involved in activities prejudicial to India\u2019s sovereignty, defense, security, and public order.While it\u2019s still possible to use a VPN to access CapCut in India, the associated lag and slowness, along with the availability of alternative apps, make it an impractical choice for local users. This raises the likelihood that the video was edited outside India using a non-Indian internet service provider (ISP) to manipulate the footage and provide a different context.According to Indian intelligence assessments, TRF is a proxy for the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, providing a cosmetic local identity for the organization. An earlier India Today investigation highlighted how TRF's debunked propaganda was once shared and later deleted by Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Imran Khan. TRF emerged in the cyberspace in 2019 amid a communications blackout in the Kashmir Valley following the abrogation of Article 370 and was designated a terrorist organization by the Indian government under the UAPA in 2023.On Monday, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha confirmed that two foreign terrorists, believed to have infiltrated from North Kashmir's Bandipora area, were involved in the attack that claimed seven lives in Ganderbal district. \"According to an initial investigation, two masked individuals\u2014likely foreign terrorists\u2014entered the mess hall of the company constructing the Z-Morh tunnel and opened indiscriminate fire. Seven people were killed, and four were injured,\" he stated.The victims included a doctor and six labourers who were attacked at the tunnel-construction site along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited the home of Dr. Shahnawaz Dar on Tuesday, one of the victims of the Ganderbal attack.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024ALSO READ | Pak-based Lashkar front claims J&K attack that killed doctor, 6 others: Sources",

        "text": "In Wayanad's 3-way electoral contest, BJP's Navya Haridas is banking on her political experience to take on Congress' Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the November 13 bypoll, which also will be the AICC general secretary's maiden electoral fight.\n\nA software engineer with international experience in Singapore and the Netherlands, and a decade as a councillor in Kozhikode, Ms. Haridas is confident her background equips her to challenge Ms. Vadra, who is keen to extend the Congress' winning streak in this hilly Lok Sabha segment vacated by her brother Rahul Gandhi.\n\nMs. Haridas told PTI in an interview on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) that although Ms. Vadra holds a position in the AICC, she lacks experience as a people's representative.\n\nAlso Read: U.P. Congress welcomes Rahul Gandhi\u2019s decision to retain Rae Bareli \n\n\"Priyanka Gandhi is a national figure due to her Nehru family background, but this is her first election. I, on the other hand, have served as a councillor in the Kozhikode Corporation for two consecutive terms and contested the 2021 Assembly elections.\" \n\n\"I have been representing the people for many years, so contesting against Priyanka Gandhi doesn't feel any different to me. I believe I have more experience than she does,\" the BJP candidate said, a day ahead of the Congress leader's entry into Wayanad, where she is seeking votes with a roadshow in Kalpetta.\n\nThe by-election for the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency was necessitated after Rahul Gandhi vacated it following his victory in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\n\nEminent CPI leader and former MLA, Sathyan Mokeri, is contesting on the CPIM-led ruling LDF ticket.\n\n\"The fight is only between Congress and BJP. See, this election was necessitated due to the irresponsibility of Congress. In many parts of Wayanad, you still see flex boards asking for votes for Rahul Gandhi. However, he chose to keep the Rae Bareli seat and handed Wayanad over to his sister. This is an example of family dominance, and the BJP will highlight this issue before the voters,\" Ms. Haridas said.\n\nNavya, who is also the State general secretary of the Mahila Morcha, BJP's women's wing, believes PM Narendra Modi's development agenda will work in favour of the party in Wayanad.\n\n\"BJP always puts forward the agenda of development. There has been no intervention from the people's representatives in the issues demanded by the people here for the past several years.\" \n\nShe said Wayanad is not a constituency where the BJP has a strong organisational foothold but pointed out at its electoral gains.\n\n\"However, the party's vote share doubled compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Moreover, we saw that people voted for the BJP in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, and it showed that people want the BJP in power. We expect that kind of change will happen here also,\" she said.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, the BJP saw its vote share in Wayanad rise to 5.75 per cent, when its state president K Surendran took on Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe NDA candidate secured 1,41,045 votes, a significant increase from the 78,816 votes in 2019 when the seat was contested by BDJS, an NDA ally.\n\nMeanwhile, Rahul Gandhi's victory margin decreased to 3,64,422, down from the 4,31,770 votes polled in 2019.\n\nMs. Haridas, an engineering graduate, entered politics almost by accident.\n\nAfter earning her B.Tech degree, she worked as a software professional. In 2009, she married marine engineer Shobin Shyam and moved to Singapore, where she worked for four years.\n\nShe also worked in the Netherlands and Azerbaijan. Then, during a vacation trip to Kozhikode in 2015, she was unexpectedly nominated as a candidate in Kerala's local body elections, thanks to her family's RSS connect.\n\n\"Politics was never on my mind, and my entry into it was purely accidental. The BJP approached me with a ticket, considering my family's political background. I was fielded from Karaparamba, a ward where the BJP traditionally finishes third in Kozhikode Corporation. However, I won and have been representing the ward for the past 10 years,\" she explained.\n\nReflecting on her campaign for Wayanad, Ms. Haridas mentioned the challenges of travelling through the region.\n\n\"It takes hours to reach Kalpetta, especially crossing the Thamarassery Ghat Road, where traffic jams last for several hours. The traffic problems and the backwardness in the health sector here must be addressed immediately. Wayanad still lacks a fully equipped medical college. Currently, a district hospital has been upgraded as a medical college,\" she said.\n\n\"Another pressing issue is the upliftment of the tribal communities. The tribal people are still suffering. The funds allocated for them by the Central Government are not reaching their hands due to the lapses of the people's representatives. Besides, there are no plans for the educational facilities for the tribal students,\" she added.\n\nThe Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency consists of seven Assembly segments \u2014 Mananthavady (ST), Sulthan Bathery (ST) and Kalpetta in Wayanad district, Thiruvambady in Kozhikode district and Eranad, Nilambur, and Wandoor in Malappuram district.\n\nOf these Wandoor, Kalpetta abd Sulthan Bathery are represented by the Congress The Eranad seat is held by P K Basheer of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), an ally of the Congress-led UDF.\n\nIndependent Nilambur MLA P V Anwar, who recently parted ways with the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF, has already expressed support for Vadra.\n\nThiruvambady and Mananthavady have CPI(M) MLAs.

        "text": "Kazan, Oct 22 (IANS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday reiterated to Russian President Vladimir Putin that India is ready to provide any possible assistance in the future to resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe are in regular contact regarding the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As I have said before, we believe that problems should be resolved peacefully. We fully support the earliest possible establishment of peace and stability. In all our efforts, we give priority to humanity, and we are ready to provide any possible assistance in the future,\u201d said PM Modi in his opening remarks at the bilateral meeting with Putin at the Governor\u2019s Palace in Kazan.\n\nThe meeting took place just a few hours after PM Modi landed in the Russian city to participate in the 16th BRICS Summit, at the invitation of the Russian President.\n\nThanking Putin for his friendship, warm and welcoming hospitality, PM Modi cited India\u2019s deep historical ties with \u201cbeautiful\u201d Kazan, emphasising that after the opening of the Consulate General of India in the city, the relations between the two countries will become even stronger.\n\n\u201cThis is my second visit to Russia in the last three months, and it demonstrates the close coordination and strong friendship between our countries. In July, in Moscow, we held a bilateral summit. And thanks to our discussions, our cooperation in all areas has strengthened,\u201d said Prime Minister Modi.\n\nThe Prime Minister also lauded Putin and Russia for successfully leading the BRICS association since the beginning of the year.\n\n\u201cOver the last 15 years of its existence, our BRICS association has created a special identity for itself, and today many countries around the world want to join our association. I look forward to our discussions within BRICS tomorrow,\u201d he remarked.\n\nEarlier in the day, PM Modi had mentioned that his visit to Kazan will further reinforce the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia.\n\nThe BRICS summit, themed \u2018Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security\u2019, will also provide an important platform for world leaders to discuss key global issues.\n\n\u201cIndia values the close cooperation within BRICS which has emerged as an important platform for dialogue and discussion on issues concerning the global developmental agenda, reformed multilateralism, climate change, economic cooperation, building resilient supply chains, promoting cultural and people to people connect, among others. The expansion of BRICS with the addition of new members last year has added to its inclusivity and agenda for the global good,\u201d PM Modi said in his departure statement on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn the meetings in narrow and expanded formats, the BRICS leaders are expected to exchange views on current issues on the global and regional agenda, and discuss the three main areas of cooperation outlined by the Russian chairmanship \u2013 politics and security, economics and finance, and cultural and humanitarian contacts.\n\nThe results of the discussion will be summarised in the Kazan Summit Declaration.",

        "text": "On the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) at Anand in Gujarat on Tuesday, Union minister of Home Affairs and Cooperation Amit Shah laid the foundation stone for a new \u20b9210 crore \u201cvegetable and fruit processing plant\u201d which will be set up by Mother Dairy near Vadodara.\n\nThe new plant at Itola will process five metric tonnes of fruit pulp per hour. It will also produce two metric tonnes of french fries per hour and the produce will be sold under the \u201cSafal\u201d brand of Mother Dairy. \n\n\u201cIn one of the NDDB board meetings, I had asked them not to limit themselves to milk and expand NDDB\u2019s scope. I am happy that they have extended themselves to processing vegetables and fruits. The farmers who grow vegetables and fruits do not get proper remuneration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey end up getting exploited after the market gets flooded with their produce. If these vegetables are processed, then farmers produce will go across the world and the profits will percolate down through the cooperative model.\u201d said Shah while speaking at the event held at Anand.\n\nAlso read: Gujarat 8th state to seek larger share from 16th Finance Commission: Dr Panagariya\n\nSimilarly, Shah also laid the foundation stone for a \u20b974 crore polyfilm plant at Narela, New Delhi. This plant with a capacity of 8400 metric tonne per annum will provide packing needs for milk, curd and ghee. It will provide employment for 100 persons and is expected to be commissioned by 2026.\n\n\u201cToday we are the biggest milk producer of the world. With a cumulative milk production of 231 million tonnes, we have left the United States behind. We will maintain the number one position for long as we are growing at six percent per annum, while the rest of the world is growing at two percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are 8 crore milk producing families in rural India. However, only 1.5 crore are within the cooperative framework, while the remaining 6.5 crore are in the unorganised sector and are being exploited. NDDB should try and see that the all the 8 crore families are included within the cooperative framework,\u201d Shah added.\n\nPointing out that a number of states have inked MoUs with NDDB, Shah said, \u201cGood work is happening, but it needs to be fast tracked.\u201d \n\nShah also laid the foundation stone for a new NDDB office building at Anand. At Anand, Shah also launched Gir Ghee from Mother Dairy and Badri Ghee from Uttarakhand Cooperative Dairy Federation. Several MoUs were also signed to highlight NDDB\u2019s continued efforts in advancing the dairy sector. \n\nKey agreements included a collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to conduct cutting-edge research in One-Health, focusing on innovation in animal health and sustainability; a partnership between National Cooperative Organics Limited, Mother Dairy and NDDB Mrida Limited to promote organic farming practices; NDDB, Suzuki R&D Center India (SRDI) and Amul/Mehsana Milk Union to establish a compressed biogas plant, enhancing sustainable energy production. \n\nFurther partnerships comprise an MoU between NDDB and the Space Applications Centre (SAC), ISRO, which will use remote sensing technology to assess fodder resources, facilitating improved resource management.\n\nAlso read: New textile policy will help attract \u20b930,000 cr investments to Gujarat: CM",

The state is positioned as a critical engine in driving India\u2019s overall economic performance.\n\nAn initial projection from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) anticipated a modest growth rate of just 4 percent for Karnataka, a figure that was later revised to a robust 13.1 percent.\n\nThe CMO noted this drastic revision as indicative of an early measurement error, underscoring the underestimated potential of Karnataka\u2019s economy.\n\nWith the final GSDP growth of 10.2 percent, Karnataka has not only surpassed the national average growth rate of 8.2 percent but also set the stage for a promising outlook.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the NSE forecasts a GSDP growth rate of 9.4 percent for Karnataka, while the Ministry of Finance has provided an even more optimistic projection of 14 percent.\n\nFurther supporting this growth narrative are strong economic indicators, including a year-on-year growth of 10 percent in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections and a notable 24 percent increase in stamp duty revenue as of September 2024. These figures reinforce the perception of Karnataka as a state in dynamic economic expansion.\n\nKarnataka's GSDP per capita remains among the highest in India, aligning closely with Telangana, both states led by Congress and showcasing robust economic performances.\n\nThe CMO emphasised that Karnataka\u2019s pro-people policies, including various welfare guarantees, ensure that the benefits of economic growth are distributed equitably among its citizens, promoting inclusive development.\n\nDespite these achievements, Karnataka faces significant challenges. The state has endured its worst drought in a decade, severely affecting agricultural productivity and contributing to negative growth in that sector.\n\nAdditionally, Karnataka\u2019s reliance on the IT and hardware sectors, which account for 28 percent of its Gross State Value Added (GSVA), has exposed it to the impacts of a global economic slowdown.\n\nIn conclusion, Karnataka\u2019s impressive GSDP growth is not only a testament to its economic strategy but also a beacon of resilience amid adversity, positioning the state as a vital player in India's economic landscape.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

Similar orders were subsequently issued against other individuals allegedly involved in the Bahraich incident.In response, three petitioners, including Hameed, filed a petition with the Supreme Court through their advocate Mrigank Prabhakar, challenging the demolition notices. They argued that the action was not about unauthorized construction but rather \"a punitive measure disguised as a legal step.\"The petitioners claimed, \"The defence of \"unauthorized construction\" is being used as a ruse to carry out punitive demolition and also to illegally overcome the interim protective orders passed by this Court on 17-09-2024.\"The petitioners further alleged that the swift initiation of the demolition process reflected malice and was directly linked to the communal violence. They said in their plea, \"The trigger for the proposed demolition notices is the close proximity of the communal flare-up and violent incident and the impugned notice, based on the perception of OR the alleged involvement of the owners/ residents/occupants in that alleged criminal activity.\"The Supreme Court has not yet made a ruling on the petition.

        "title": "BJP Demonising Rohingyas for Political Gains Harms India's International Stature",
        "text": "Amidst the ongoing assembly elections in Jharkhand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to have accused the government led by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) of promoting the \u2018infiltration\u2019 of Rohingya refugees. Even though many BJP workers have been running hate campaigns for a long time against the Rohingyas, this is the first time the Prime Minister himself has used the issue in an election campaign to garner votes. Home Minster Amit Shah and BJP President JP Nadda have done the same.India hosts many refugee communities who have arrived not only from our neighbourhood but also from other parts of Asia and far-off countries in Africa. At present, India hosts more than 92,000 Sri Lankan and 73,000 Tibetan refugees. There are more than 30,000 from Myanmar and 12,000 Afghan refugees in the country. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), about 22,000 Rohingya refugees are registered with them, while the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has claimed there are more than 40,000 of them in the country. BJP's Demographic Fear-mongering in Jharkhand Ahead of Elections25 Days On, 160 Rohingya Refugees on Boat Still Stranded, Still StarvingWhatever the number, even 40,000 Rohingyas, as claimed by the MHA, is much less than some of the other refugee communities in the country. The number is a mere fraction of not only India\u2019s population but also of Jharkhand's, which is estimated to be around\u202f40.6 million in 2023. Moreover, in none of the registries that maintain data on the presence of Rohingya in India, is Jharkhand mentioned as a major location. In the last few years, minor BJP functionaries and party workers have indulged in attacks and hate campaigns targeting the Rohingya refugees in India. Why is Prime Minister Modi singling out one just refugee community, that too in a manner bordering on xenophobia?This kind of exclusion and hate is not the only way the Rohingya refugees are being treated differently from other refugee communities. They also face mass detention and threats of being deported back to Myanmar. According to several informal sources, more than 1000 Rohingyas including about 200 children are in detention across different states of India. Most of them were charged with \u2018illegal entry\u2019 under the Foreigners Act of 1946 and the Passport Act of 1967. A majority have served the sentences they got from the local courts, and yet, they continue to be held indefinitely. Jammu, West Bengal, and Assam hold the maximum number of these refugees in indefinite detention. Though the continued detention of refugees, even after serving their sentences, is ostensibly to deport them back to Myanmar, not more than 40 Rohingyas have been sent back since 2017, while the number of detainees exceeds 1000. Some of them have been in detention for more than 12 years. While the non-refoulement of refugees back to their country where they face persecution is a part of international law, India has been bent upon sending these Rohingyas back to Myanmar where they indeed face persecution and death.A more pertinent question is \u2014 why is India unable to deport the Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar? It is simply because Myanmar refuses to accept the Rohingya as its citizens. In such a situation, what purpose is served by keeping more than 1000 Rohingyas in detention?Rohingya Refugees & Their Deaths at Sea: What Can Neighboring Countries Do?\u2018Chained Like an Animal\u2019: Rohingya Mother Brought to Baby\u2019s Funeral in HandcuffsRohingya refugees have been in India since the early 2000s. Their status determination, as persons requiring international protection, is done by the UNHCR as per the mandate under the UN Refugee Convention, 1951. The refugees are mostly concentrated in Hyderabad, Delhi, Jammu, Rajasthan and Haryana. Most of them live in shanties and eke out a living by collecting urban recyclable waste and engaging in daily wage labour. They have very little access to public health care and education facilities despite a 2018 Supreme Court interim order in Jaffar Ullah vs the Union of India in which the government gave assurances that the refugees would get the same services as Indian citizens. India being an important country in the Asia Pacific region, its treatment of the Rohingya refugees has been an issue of concern for the international community. It has remained aloof to their arrival in the country during the period between 2012 and 2015 but its treatment of the Rohingyas began to change in 2017 when the then Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said the government was planning to deport Rohingyas from India because they are \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. Since then, India has incarcerated more than a thousand Rohingyas and deported about not more than 40.India\u2019s singling out of the Rohingya refugees (on the basis of harsh treatment) was noted by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\u202f(CERD) in 2018 when it said that it was \u201cconcerned that the manifestations of racial discrimination against the Rohingya in India and [that] their return to Myanmar will infringe their rights protected under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\" In July this year, the committee again called on India \u201cto end the arbitrary detention of the Rohingyas who fled Myanmar to India and refrain from forcible deportation and returns to Myanmar, where they would risk being subjected to serious human rights violations and abuses.\u201dIt was also \u201cdeeply concerned about reports regarding the spread of racist hate speech and the dissemination of negative stereotypes against Rohingya\u201d and the \u201cracist hate speech by politicians and public figures, and the lack of information on investigations, prosecutions and convictions of public figures and politicians for hate speech.\u201d None of this bodes well for India in its quest to become a world leader. No country will accept the leadership of another country that engages in fomenting hate against a community like the Rohingyas whose situation is a major international concern.

The arrested accused are identified as Lovejit Singh alias Labba, Manjeet Singh alias Manna, Prabhjit Singh, Gurjot Singh, Ramandeep Singh, and Gurpreet Singh.\u201cA major drug trafficking operation involving smuggling of heroin from Afghanistan into India was unearthed during investigation,\u201d said the ED in a statement.The PMLA investigation was initiated on the basis of seizure of 293.81 kg of heroin from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and seizure of 352.71 kg of heroin from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana, by the Delhi Police Special Cell.Thus, a total of 646.52 kg of heroin has been seized so far. ED investigation revealed that the arrested persons, Lovejit Singh, Manjeet Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Gurjot Singh, Gurpreet Singh and Prabhjit Singh, coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi.\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran, concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder,\u201d said the ED.Accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs, informed the federal agency.ED uncovered the highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions, and operational expenses by the accused has been made. \u201cAccused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. It was also revealed that the syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local markets.\u201dFurther, the agency said the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles including Toyota Fortuner, Etios and Hyundai Verna etc in second hand market for trafficking from the storage Hubs to further distribution. The ED investigation revealed that cash was used for the purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities.\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via the Nava Sheva port in Mumbai, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. Transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies.Earlier, a property in Jandoli Village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of accused persons, and fixed deposits have been attached by ED,\u201d added the agency",

Sources indicate that the threats were communicated through email to the management of these institutions.Authorities are investigating the incident, with the matter being reviewed by higher officials from various organizations, including the CRPF, Intelligence Bureau, and Delhi Police. The threat email specified a potential bomb blast in the classrooms of these schools at 11 am on Tuesday. However, the threat has since been determined to be a hoax.The hoax threat was received a day after the blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi\u2019s Rohini on Sunday for which a pro-Khalistani group claimed responsibility that sent shockwaves through the national capital. Delhi Police reached out to social media platforms and the messaging app Telegram, requesting details about the channel where the post was made, and the matter is being investigated. The Sunday blast in the Prashant Vihar school was so powerful that it tore through the wall of the school. No injuries were reported in the incident however some of the nearby buildings and vehicles were damaged.Such hoax bomb threats on domestic and international flights have been received for several days. So far this week, more than 90 flights have received bomb threats and most of them have turned out to be hoaxes. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) Director General Zulfiqar Hasan on Monday met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan and apprised him about the recent hoax bomb threats in domestic and international flights.In the nearly half-an-hour meeting with the Home Ministry, both the DGs informed the Home Secretary about a series of recent hoax calls threatening domestic and international flights that has created panic situations on many occasions forcing the officials in the Indian aviation sector, intelligence wing, and other departments to go through rigorous security check process.Sources said that the officials discussed the potential implications for aviation security and measures being taken to address the situation, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and coordination among security agencies",

        "text": "A pro-Russia Telegram account has posted a photo showing the Russian and North Korean flags side by side on a Ukrainian battlefield, indicating that North Korea has likely sent troops to support Russia in its prolonged war with Ukraine.The image, shared by a blogger named @rvvoenkor_bot on Monday, showed the two flags raised together over a mine in Pokrovsk, one of the strongholds on Ukraine's eastern front, Yonhap news agency reported.The blogger said that the North Korean flag has recently been raised on a hill at the mine near the city, which is one of the suspected locations where North Korean soldiers are believed to be stationed.On Friday, South Korea's National Intelligence Service announced that North Korea had decided to send approximately 12,000 special forces to support Russia in its prolonged war with Ukraine, with about 1,500 already deployed to Russia's Far East.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The deployment marks the first time North Korea has sent ground troops on such a large scale, though it has previously dispatched smaller groups of soldiers overseas to earn foreign currency.So far, North Korea's state media has not made any official statements regarding its troop deployment to Russia.A North Korean envoy to the United Nations on Monday dismissed the accusations from South Korea and Ukraine that it is sending soldiers to fight alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as \"groundless rumours,\" arguing its relations with Moscow are \"legitimate and cooperative.\"On Monday, Russian Ambassador to South Korea Georgy Zinoviev told First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong-kyun that the cooperation with North Korea is \"not directed against South Korea's security interests\" and claimed that the cooperation is \"carried out within the framework of international law,\" the Russian Embassy in Seoul said in a Facebook post.A South Korean unification ministry official said North Korea has never acknowledged the deployment of its soldiers, as it would be considered an illegal act.\"When the North engages in illegal activities, it does not explicitly acknowledge them,\" the official said on condition of anonymity, citing the 2010 sinking of the Cheonan warship that killed 46 South Korean sailors.A team of multinational investigators concluded in 2010 that a North Korean torpedo was responsible for the sinking. However, the North still adamantly denies its involvement.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "President Droupadi Murmu on Tuesday stressed the need for collective responsibility in water conservation and urged the citizens of the country to actively participate in building a water-secure India.Addressing the gathering at the 5th National Water Awards ceremony in the national capital, President Murmu said, \u201cWe must remember that conservation of water resources is a collective responsibility and building a water-secure India is not possible without our active participation.\u201d\u201cAlmost all civilizations have developed around rivers. It can be said that this relationship between water and humans has given direction to human history. But it also seems that we deliberately forget the importance of water,\u201d she said. President Murmu expressed concern over the contamination of freshwater resources. \u201cDespite it being known that freshwater resources are available in limited quantities on earth, we ignore water conservation and management. Due to man-made reasons these resources are getting contaminated and are also getting exhausted,\u201d she said. The per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. Based on the study titled \u201cReassessment of Water Availability in India using Space Inputs, 2019\u201d conducted by Central Water Commission, the average annual per capita water availability for year 2021 and 2031 has been assessed as 1486 cubic meter and 1367 cubic meter respectively. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meter is considered as water stressed condition whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition.The Centre has taken several initiatives to conserve water and provide people with safe drinking water. It is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024.The central government launched AMRUT 2.0 on October 1, 2021, covering all the statutory towns of the country to ensure universal coverage of water supply and make cities \u2018water secure\u2019.To ensure optimum utilization of water, the Centre has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) from 2015-16. Under PMKSY-Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), 99 ongoing major/medium irrigation projects and 7 phases were prioritized during 2016-17, in consultation with states.The Centre has approved the extension of PMKSY till 2025-26 with an overall outlay of Rs. 93,068.56 crore.The Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM) Programme has been brought under PMKSY \u2013 Har Khet Ko Pani from 2015-16. The Bureau of Water Use Efficiency (BWUE) has been set up for promotion, regulation and control of efficient use of water in irrigation, industrial and domestic sector. \u201cSahi Fasal\u201d campaign was launched to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which are not water intensive.The Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched on National Panchayati Raj Day in 2022 with an objective to conserve water for future. The Mission is aimed at developing and rejuvenating 75 water bodies in each district of the country",

For more relief opt for lozenges containing soothing ingredients such as honey or menthol.\n\nInhale Steam: Steam inhalation can also offer relief for a sore throat by adding moisture to the sore throat\u2019s dry or irritated tissues. You can take a hot shower, or you can fill a bowl with hot water, lean over it with a towel over your head, and breathe in the steam. It can loosen mucus and provide relief from throat pain.\n\nGargling with Antiseptic Solutions: One of the most effective remedies for a sore throat is using a gargle liquid. Betadine Gargle is an antiseptic gargle liquid that can help alleviate throat discomfort. With its active ingredient, povidone-iodine, it helps reduce bacteria in the throat, promoting healing and providing instant relief from pain.

        "text": "Beijing, Oct 22 (IANS) China on Tuesday confirmed the agreement that has been reached between New Delhi and Beijing on the patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas.\n\n\u201cOver the past few weeks, China and India have been in close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues related to the China-India border. Now, the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters during a daily media briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had reflected on the longstanding issue, with a nearly identical statement.\n\n\u201cI can share with you that over the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums. And as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020. And we will be taking the next steps on this,\u201d Misri had told reporters in New Delhi.\n\nThe Indian Foreign Secretary had neither confirmed nor denied any possibility of both leaders holding bilateral discussions in Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting.\n\n\u201cThis is a multilateral event, though of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall programme of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve as soon as feasible,\u201d stated Misri, who was India\u2019s Ambassador to China during the violent Galwan Valley face-off between the soldiers of the two countries at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in June 2020.\n\nAs the Chinese side attempted to transgress the LAC in other areas of the Western Sector of the India-China border areas, the two sides have been engaged in discussions through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation.\n\nOn Monday, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar said that the latest agreement creates the basis for peace and tranquillity which should be there in the border areas and existed before 2020 \u2013 something which had been India\u2019s major concern over the past few years for the bilateral relationship to turn normal.\n\n\u201cAt various points of time, people almost gave up. We have always maintained that on the one hand, we had to obviously do the counter deployments\u2026 But, side by side, we have been negotiating since September 2020 when I met my Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow. It has been a very patient process, maybe more complicated than what it could and should have been. The fact is that if we are able to, as we now have, reach an understanding regarding patrolling and observing the sanctity of the LAC, then, I think, it creates the basis for peace and tranquillity which there should be in border areas and existed there before 2020,\u201d remarked Jaishankar while speaking at the NDTV World Summit.\n\nBeijing\u2019s confirmation on the border patrolling agreement came just after Chinese President Xi Jinping left for Kazan to attend the 16th BRICS Leaders\u2019 Meeting which is also being attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAccompanying Xi Jinping on the visit are Cai Qi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also the member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.",

        "text": "The price of vegetables including potato and onion has increased in Odisha markets as consumers resorted to panic buying amid IMD's prediction of a cyclone hitting the Odisha coast, traders said on Tuesday.At Chhatra Bazaar in Cuttack, the price of potato has increased from Rs 30 to Rs 50 per kg on Tuesday. The price of onion has also increased to Rs 60 per kg from Rs 40 in the market, which is one of the largest vegetable markets in Odisha.Tomatoes are being sold for Rs 80 to 100 in the local markets in Bhubaneswar, traders said.The price of other vegetables like bins, brinjal, ladyfinger, cauliflower has also increased by Rs 10 to 20 per kilogramme.There was a huge rush in the vegetable markets as consumers wanted to store sufficient amounts of vegetables, especially potato and onion in view of the cyclone, which is expected to hit the Odisha coast by October 25.\"We don't know how the market will be after the cyclone hits the state. If the supply chain is disrupted, it may lead to a further increase in price. So, I bought a sufficient amount of potato and onion for my family,\" said Nibedita Behera, a housewife from Cuttack.Local vendors have attributed the price hike to the scarcity of potato-laden trucks and the anticipation of further disruptions if the cyclone makes landfall.\"We bought potatoes at a hiked price from the wholesale market... There is a shortfall in the supply compared to the demand, so the price has gone up,\" a trader from Chhatra Bazaar said.Meanwhile, Odisha Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare minister Krushna Chandra Patra warned that strong action will be taken against traders who will indulge in black marketing and illegal hoarding of essential consumable items.\"I have directed our departmental officials to conduct raids on markets to check illegal hoarding of vegetables,\" he said.Patra said he has called a meeting with traders this afternoon to appeal to them to cooperate with the government during this period.The minister also appealed to the people not to resort to panic buying as the state has a sufficient amount of vegetables and food items.On Monday, while holding a cyclone preparedness meeting, Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi had instructed concerned officials to check the black marketing of essential goods.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024",

        "text": "India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said on Tuesday that middle-order batters KL Rahul and Sarfaraz Khan are locked in a selection battle for the second Test against New Zealand here even though head coach Gautam Gambhir is keen to give the former, a long rope. With India looking to bounce back from the eight-wicket thrashing at Bengaluru in the opening Test, focus will be on the team combination with Washington Sundar being added to the squad. Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant are both aiming to shake off injury concerns for the match starting Thursday.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"Yeah, there's no point in sugarcoating it, there's a fight for a spot,\" ten Doeschate told the media when asked if Rahul and Sarfaraz were battling for a place in the team, here at the MCA Stadium ahead of India's training session.\"Sarfaraz was obviously brilliant in the last Test. I went to KL after the last Test (and) said how many balls do you play at (and) miss at? He didn't play at (and) miss at one ball and that's what tends to happen when you're not getting runs.\"There's certainly no concerns about KL, he's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space. But we are certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team,\" he said.Sarfaraz scored a second-innings 150 in the Bengaluru game, while Rahul remained off-colour in both essays.While admitting that it is difficult to keep Rahul out of the equation in the Test format, ten Doeschate said head coach Gautam Gambhir is \"keen to\" give him a long rope.\"It's not like we're worried about his form. If you go on just the past three months since Gauti has been in here, he's keen to give him (Rahul) as much rope as we can. We have a lot of faith in him,\" he said.\"But at the same time, it's a very competitive environment, with Sarfaraz getting 150 plus runs (222 not out) in the Irani Trophy final. The decision will be what's best for the team, but we'll certainly back all the guys in,\" he added.Pant, who did not keep wickets for a significant part of the opening Test, and Shubman Gill, who missed the match due to stiffness in his neck, are close to attaining their full fitness.\"Rishabh is pretty good. I think Rohit (Sharmna) touched on it the other day. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee. But fingers crossed, he'll be good to keep in the Test as well,\" he said.\"He (Gill) looks so (available for this Test). He has batted last week in Bangalore, he had a few nets, he's got a little bit of discomfort, but I think he'll be good to go for the Test,\" he added.",

At FedEx, as a global corporation operating across multiple international markets, we recognise the power of building a global culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Currently, 36 per cent of our board is made up of women, and we have 26 per cent women in management globally. Our approach is quite structured, and we recently added more focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, rededicating ourselves to inclusive hiring, promotions, and supporting career paths,\u201d she remarked.\n\nSwaminath emphasised the challenge of increasing women\u2019s representation in logistics and supply chain sectors and said, \u201cA key area of focus is middle management, where there is often a drop-off in women\u2019s participation due to societal expectations around childcare, elder care, and other responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cFedEx is a people-centric culture, and much of our effort is aimed at building an environment where DEI thrives. Our senior team members are specifically working on being more inclusive. There is a lot more to be done, and it is an ongoing journey for us\u2014especially in bringing more women into senior management and increasing their representation,\u201d she said.\n\nOn India\u2019s expanding economy, Swaminath commented, \u201cWe see tremendous growth opportunities in India with its expanding economy. As a global connector, FedEx is focusing on optimising supply chains to better serve our customers.\u201d\n\nPreeti Bajaj, CEO and MD of Luminous Power Technologies, spoke about the importance of women in senior management. She informed that 33 per cent of Luminous\u2019 senior team consists of women.\n\nShe described the work needed in the energy sector in three stages: \u201cFirst, there is equity of access to opportunities, which is critical. Second is ambition\u2014women must aspire to reach senior-level roles and fuel their own desire to pioneer such positions. Finally, there is attainment, which involves creating supportive environments and policies that can address these challenges. My call to action for women in the energy sector is that this is an evolutionary time, and we are part of the Viksit Bharat 2047 initiative.\u201d\n\nPadmaja Ruparel, Co-Founder of the Indian Angel Network, shared her experience as an early-stage investor, saying, \u201cWhen I started, there were no women in this field, and I went through many evolutions myself. I can\u2019t be an investor if there are no entrepreneurs. In 2022, only 14.7 per cent of funding went to women, which is not encouraging. The number of women investors is also very low, and growth capital is much less for women partners. We need to create a \u2018BlackRock of India\u2019 led by women.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report, only 38 of India\u2019s 100 leading publicly listed corporations have more than 20 per cent women employees in their workforce, underscoring the need for faster inclusion to achieve gender equality in business and other sectors.",

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday attended the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and the launch of farmer welfare activities on the birth anniversary of Tribhuvan Patel.Tribhuvan Patel was the founder of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers\u2019 Union in 1946 and later the Amul co-operative movement in Anand, Gujarat, India.The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was founded in 1965 as a cooperative diary.Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended greetings to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the occasion of his birthday and called him a hard-working leader.Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, and Goa CM Pramod Sawant also extended greetings to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the occasion of his 60th birth anniversary and called him an influential administrator, a hard-working person, and a strong personality",

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 22 (IANS) Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad, while commenting on the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s petition in a defamation case, said that the former Delhi Chief Minister, who once promised to transform the country, has now become an expert on seeking apology (maafi expert). \n\nPrasad pointed out that Kejriwal has strayed far from the ideals he championed during the Anna Hazare movement.\n\nSpeaking to media persons at the BJP\u2019s national headquarters here on Tuesday, Prasad referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision, which rejected Kejriwal\u2019s plea to stay a defamation case related to comments he made about Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s educational qualifications.\n\nThe defamation case was initiated by Gujarat University, following Kejriwal\u2019s public remarks questioning the PM\u2019s degree, which led to an RTI being filed. The Sessions Court and the Gujarat High Court have already dismissed Kejriwal\u2019s petition, and now, the Supreme Court has upheld those decisions.\n\nPrasad claimed that Kejriwal had even hinted during the court proceedings that he might apologise for his remarks, but the Supreme Court noted that such an apology should have been made earlier. Now, with his petition withdrawn, the criminal defamation case against him will proceed in Gujarat.\n\nHighlighting Kejriwal\u2019s pattern of making accusations and later apologising, Prasad listed several instances where the Delhi CM issued apologies, including to late Arun Jaitley, to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, to Punjab leader Vikram Majithia, to Kapil Sibal and others.\n\nPrasad argued that while criticism is a fundamental right in politics, making false and defamatory allegations is not.\n\n\u201cThe true face of Arvind Kejriwal, who lectures the world on honesty and anti-corruption, has been revealed,\u201d Prasad remarked, adding, \u201cKejriwal has apologised on 10 separate occasions for various remarks.\u201d\n\nHe also drew a parallel between Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, suggesting that both have displayed similar carelessness in their public conduct.\n\nPrasad also addressed questions on the BJP\u2019s stance on population control and the challenges in Wayanad where Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is contesting. He dismissed concerns about Priyanka\u2019s chances of electoral success, saying the BJP and its leaders do not fear competition.\n\nHe also touched upon India-China relations, noting that sensitive diplomatic matters should be handled by experienced officials and questioned the understanding of diplomacy among some opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal.\n\nResponding to Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav\u2019s controversial remarks about the Chief Justice of India, Prasad reaffirmed the importance of respecting the judiciary, which he described as vital to the country\u2019s democracy and constitutional traditions.",

He said that whether the smoke due to stubble burning goes to Delhi is a matter of debate, but the major concern is that it is affecting common people who breathe the same air. \n\n\u201cWe all have to breathe the same air. Whether or not (air) pollution goes to Delhi is a matter of debate. But the farmer who is burning stubble is the first one to get affected,\u201d said Singh.

Singh said that the issue of grain weight loss due to moisture loss is also a concern for the Centre while maintaining that the Punjab government remains committed to farmer\u2019s interests. \n\n\u201cIt is the time when the Union government should stand with the farmers. The negligence is from the Union Govt\u2019s side. The Punjab government is committed to farmers. Punjab govt, Arhtiyas, farmers will have to work together on this. Issue of grain weight loss due to moisture loss is also concerns the Centre. The CM has flagged all the issues with the Union Agriculture Minister.\u201d Singh said. \n\nEarlier, the Delhi government also blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for the rising air pollution in Delhi due to stubble burning. Delhi Chief Minister Atishi Marlena on Sunday said that Delhi\u2019s Air Quality Index (AQI) was worsening due to the failure to control stubble burning",

        "text": "China on Tuesday said that it has reached a resolution with India on resolving their border conflict and will work to implement solutions, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular press briefing,\"We have reached a resolution on the relevant matter, will work with the Indian side to implement the solution. We are in close communication through diplomatic and military channels.\" On October 21, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that an agreement has been reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border area. The announcement came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kazan, Russia, for the 16th BRICS summit that begins today and is scheduled to run till October 24. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media, stating, \"This agreement is the outcome of extensive discussions over the past several weeks with Chinese interlocutors at both diplomatic and military levels.\" He noted that military commanders have been involved in negotiations aimed at addressing the tensions that have persisted since 2020. Misri explained that the agreement signifies a path toward disengagement and a potential resolution of the issues that arose during the significant confrontations in 2020. Misri recalled the clashes between the People's Liberation Army of China and the Indian Army, particularly highlighting the violent encounters in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. He added that this agreement marks a critical step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations seek to manage their border disputes and prevent further military confrontations. Misri said,\"On several areas along the Line of Actual Control, we held discussions with Chinese interlocutors both at the diplomatic as well as military levels through meetings with military commanders at various levels. These discussions had in the past resulted in the resolution of standoffs at various locations. There are some locations and areas where stand-offs had not been resolved.\" \"Now, as a result of the discussions over the last several weeks, an agreement has been reached on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas. This is leading to disengagement and eventually a resolution of the issues that arose in these areas in 2020,\" he said. Earlier today, Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi addressing an event in Delhi said that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo. \"We are working to rebuild trust, and restoring that trust will take time,\" he said, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations. He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions. \"This normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that as well,\" the COAS said. The agreement marks a crucial step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations work to manage their border disputes and avoid further military confrontations.In early May 2020, troops from China's People's Liberation Army and the Indian Army clashed at locations along the LAC, the disputed boundary between China and India. The situation escalated on June 15-16, 2020, resulting in casualties on both sides. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)",

        "text": "Donald Trump recently appeared on \"Six Feet Under,\" the podcast of retired wrestling legend The Undertaker, real name Mark Calaway, where the former president revealed his fascination with professional wrestling. Over the course of the interview, Trump also quizzed the legendary wrestler on the realities of the ring, showcasing his curiosity and deep interest in the world of sports entertainment.During their exchange, Trump bombarded Calaway with rapid-fire questions, ranging from how wrestling rings absorb impact to the physical toll on wrestlers. \"Does that ring take great absorption?\" Trump asked, diving into specifics that highlighted his intrigue. \u2014 AutismCapital (@AutismCapital) Calaway responded by explaining the harshness of earlier rings and how wrestlers had to condition themselves to take the physical punishment.The conversation also took a humorous turn, with Trump recalling his involvement in WrestleMania, notably his appearance in the \"Battle of the Billionaires\" at WrestleMania 23, where he and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon squared off in a match represented by wrestlers, leading to McMahon getting his head shaved. Trump reminisced about the event, noting it drew record pay-per-view buys, and praised The Undertaker's iconic slow entrance, calling him one of the greatest sports entertainers.As the two delved deeper, Trump inquired about behind-the-scenes tensions in the wrestling world. \"How often did someone get really angry?\" Trump asked, curious about real fights in the scripted entertainment world. Calaway likened the professional relationships in wrestling to politics, stating that while wrestlers might not always like each other, they had to maintain professionalism\u2014a sentiment Trump found relatable.The interview also saw Trump praising Calaway\u2019s endurance in the ring, with the former president questioning whether the wrestler ever had to be carried out due to injury. \"What most people don\u2019t realise, Mr President, is that although we\u2019re entertainment, in any given match, you\u2019re two inches away from something really catastrophic happening,\u201d Calaway explained, making the former US President aware of the dangers of pro wrestling despite its scripted nature.Trump\u2019s passion for wrestling, along with his personal connections to WWE through longtime friend Vince McMahon, was evident throughout the interview. He praised the athleticism of the wrestlers and fondly recalled his role in several WWE events, even expressing awe at the intensity of their performances. As the interview drew to a close, Calaway commented on Trump's persona, noting that his podcast appearance showed a side of the former president that people don't often see\u2014his humour and genuine interest in sports and entertainment.",

        "title": "Babita Phogat used protests to pursue WFI leadership, alleges Sakshi",
        "text": "New Delhi: Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik has revealed the controversial role of wrestler-turned-politician Babita Phogat in last year's wrestlers' agitation, alleging that Phogat encouraged the protests to position herself as the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president. Malik, a key figure in the protest, stated in a recent interview that Phogat called a meeting with several wrestlers, urging them to speak out against the alleged misconduct of former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and others in the federation. \u201cBabita Phogat approached us with the idea of protesting against Brij Bhushan Singh because she had her own agenda \u2014 she wanted to become the WFI president. There are rumors that Congress supported our protest, but that\u2019s false. In fact, two BJP leaders helped us secure permission to protest in Haryana \u2014 Babita Phogat and Tirath Rana,\u201d Malik said. Despite Phogat's initiation of the movement, Malik clarified that the wrestlers did not \u201cblindly follow her.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that we blindly followed her; we were aware of serious issues like sexual harassment and molestation within the federation. We believed that having a woman in charge, especially someone like Babita Phogat, who is also a sportsperson, would bring positive change. We trusted that she would understand our struggles. But we never anticipated that she would play such a big game with us. We thought she would stand with us in the protest and raise her voice against the wrongdoing as a fellow wrestler,\u201d Malik revealed. Malik also made striking claims regarding fellow wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, both prominent figures in the movement. In her memoir, Witness, Malik alleged that those close to Punia and Vinesh began to influence their decisions, leading to a troubling shift in focus. Their acceptance of exemption from the 2023 Asian Wrestling Championships trials, according to Malik, damaged the integrity of the protest that had sparked at Delhi\u2019s Jantar Mantar and spread throughout the country. \u201cThe old way of thinking selfishly was taking over again. The people close to Bajrang and Vinesh had started filling their minds with greed. Now they were discussing exemptions from trials for the Games. Nothing good came of Bajrang and Vinesh\u2019s decision to take the exemption. Their choice hurt the image of our protest, leading many supporters to think we were in it for selfish reasons,\u201d Malik wrote. Malik emphasised that claims of Congress party supporting their protest were unfounded, highlighting the assistance from BJP leaders like Phogat and Tirath Rana in securing permission for their protests in Haryana. The movement emerged as a powerful symbol against alleged misconduct within the federation, led by Malik, Vinesh Phogat, and Bajrang Punia, but unity began to fracture as external influences led to conflicting priorities. Brij Bhushan faced allegations of sexually harassing several female athletes and financial misconduct. The six-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Kaiserganj constituency stepped down as WFI chief, along with the entire Executive Committee, shortly after protests resumed in April following earlier demonstrations in January 2023.",

        "text": "Dubai: Former England captain Alastair Cook feels Joe Root has the potential to surpass the legendary Sachin Tendulkar as the leading run-getter in Test cricket thanks to his insatiable hunger and incredible talent.The 33-year-old Root currently has 12716 Test runs and is 3205 short of the Indian icon (15921).Root occupies the fifth spot in the leading run-getter's chart at the moment with Rahul Dravid (13,288), Jacques Kallis (13,289) and Ricky Ponting (13,378) and Tendulkar ahead of him.\"I think Joe Root could set a mark, certainly on an English side, that'll be very hard to beat. But, you just never know,\" Cook was quoted as saying by the ICC.\"I hope he can get very close, if not be the first person who scores 16,000 Test runs. It'd be a great achievement.\"Root overtook Cook as England's leading run-scorer in the longest format during the Multan Test against Pakistan earlier this month.Having watched his compatriot go past him to become England's most decorated batter, the 39-year-old Cook struggled to express his feelings and called up Root to congratulate him for his massive feat.\"I watched the moment, then I rang him after the end of the play. I couldn't think of the right words to write in a text message,\" Coon said.\"So, I thought I'd just ring him, see what he was up to, and make sure he had a beer in his hand, which I think he did.\"Root's remarkable form over the past four years has seen him score more than half of his total 35 Test centuries in that period, averaging close to 60.Cook believes that he is currently the best batter in the world with New Zealand's Kane Williamson coming close to matching him.\"I think at this precise moment in time, I find it hard to see anyone playing as well as Joe Root. Over the last year or so, of the so-called 'Big Four', I think Williamson and him are probably in the best form at the moment.\"They're all wonderful, wonderful players, all very different, actually, in their methods and ways of playing. But one thing, which kind of unites them is that hunger and desire to keep improving and keep churning out the runs,\" Cook said.Root will look to continue to amass big scores and add to his tally during the third Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, beginning on Thursday.Moving to another topic, Cook has expressed his support for England's 'Bazball' style of play in Test cricket.\"I think the game has certainly made a big jump forward in what is now deemed possible in Test cricket.\"I think the jump happened in one day cricket first, probably. The fundamental change, certainly from the English point of view, is when Owen Morgan took the side forward in 2015. And obviously the Ben Stokes era has changed the mentality of what was possible.\"",

        "title": "Locker-room politics: What's behind Trump's lewd story about Arnold Palmer",
        "text": "As the 2024 presidential election enters its final weeks, Donald Trump is ramping up his use of vulgar and inflammatory language at campaign rallies. During a Pennsylvania event this weekend, the former president opened with a shocking anecdote about the late golf legend Arnold Palmer's genitalia. Trump\u2019s crude remarks about Palmer's masculinity were followed by insults directed at his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. These outbursts have stirred controversy but also energized his core supporters, raising questions about whether this unfiltered approach is an intentional election strategy to galvanize his base, particularly younger male voters.Why it mattersAs per a Politico report, Trump\u2019s use of foul language and crude humor is nothing new, but the frequency and intensity of his remarks in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign are noteworthy. The former president, who has long embraced controversial rhetoric, seems to be doubling down on hypermasculine, inflammatory comments, a tactic that appears designed to appeal to male voters, especially those disillusioned with traditional political correctness. At the same time, his behavior could alienate key demographics, particularly suburban women and moderate Republicans, who might be turned off by his lack of decorum.As Trump faces off against Kamala Harris, who could become the first female president of the US, the contrast in tone and demeanor between the two candidates is stark. Harris has largely avoided engaging directly with Trump's personal attacks, instead focusing on portraying him as unfit for office. Trump\u2019s supporters, however, often praise his directness and authenticity, seeing his crude humor as a refreshing alternative to what they view as the sanitized language of traditional politicians.The big pictureTrump\u2019s controversial remarks this weekend highlight a broader theme in his campaign: an emphasis on hypermasculinity and populism. During his Pennsylvania rally, Trump shared a 12-minute story about Palmer that included graphic details about the golf legend\u2019s body, eliciting laughs from the crowd.\u201cArnold Palmer was all man...This man was strong and tough, and I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros they came out of there, they said \u2018Oh, my God. That\u2019s unbelievable,\u2019\u201d Trump said.He followed this with a vulgar insult aimed at Kamala Harris, calling her a \"shit vice president,\" to the delight of his audience. This pattern of using locker-room talk to energize his base has become a hallmark of Trump\u2019s rallies, particularly in battleground states like Pennsylvania, where he is courting working-class voters and younger men.In a podcast last week, Trump made similarly crude remarks, using a slang term for male genitalia to describe the downfall of disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein. These moments are not accidental; they are part of a broader strategy to appeal to male voters who may feel disillusioned by political correctness and progressive movements. By positioning himself as an outsider who \"tells it like it is,\" Trump is tapping into frustrations among voters who feel left behind by cultural shifts in the country, the Politico report said.However, while these comments may energize his base, they also risk deepening the gender gap in the 2024 election. Polls suggest that Trump\u2019s aggressive, masculine rhetoric appeals more to male voters, while Harris is performing strongly with female voters, particularly in suburban areas. The result is shaping up to be one of the largest gender divides in modern political history, with both campaigns focusing heavily on turnout from these key groups.What they are sayingKamala Harris and other Democratic leaders have seized on Trump\u2019s vulgar remarks to argue that he is unfit for the presidency. Harris responded to Trump\u2019s attacks by saying, \u201cI do believe that Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences of him ever getting back into the White House are brutally serious.\u201d Harris has framed Trump\u2019s behavior as emblematic of a broader pattern of instability and recklessness, suggesting that his return to power would be dangerous for the country.Arnold Palmer\u2019s daughter, Peg Palmer Wears, also reacted to Trump\u2019s comments about her late father. In an interview with the Associated Press, she expressed disappointment but not outrage, saying, \u201cI think it was a poor choice of approaches to remembering my father, but what are you going to do?\u201d Wears added that while she wasn\u2019t upset, she felt Trump\u2019s comments didn\u2019t honor her father\u2019s legacy appropriately. She noted that her father, who passed away in 2016, had believed strongly in the Republican Party, but stopped short of saying whether she would vote for Trump in the upcoming election.On the Republican side, reactions have been mixed. Some party leaders, like House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La), have avoided directly condemning Trump\u2019s remarks, with Johnson telling CNN, \u201cHe says things that are off-the-cuff.\u201d Other Republicans, including Gov. Chris Sununu (R-N H), have been more critical, saying Trump\u2019s language, particularly his profanity-laced attacks on Kamala Harris, is unhelpful and distracting. However, Sununu also noted that such remarks are unlikely to sway voters one way or the other, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just par for the course.\u201dBetween the linesTrump\u2019s frequent use of locker-room talk and crude humor may be a calculated move to solidify his support among male voters, particularly young men who have become a key demographic for the Republican Party. Over the past few years, Republicans have made a concerted effort to court younger male voters, many of whom feel alienated by progressive social movements and the perceived political correctness of the left. Trump\u2019s crass language and unapologetic style resonate with these voters, who see him as a \"real\" candidate willing to say what others won\u2019t.For Trump, his emphasis on masculinity and strength is not new. In the 2016 election, he used similar tactics to portray himself as the alpha male candidate, contrasting himself with Hillary Clinton, whom he frequently belittled with sexist and derogatory remarks. His latest comments about Arnold Palmer and Kamala Harris are a continuation of this strategy, positioning himself as a strong, decisive leader who isn\u2019t afraid to break the rules.This strategy could be effective in energizing Trump\u2019s core supporters, but it also risks alienating moderate Republicans and undecided voters, especially women. The gender gap in this election is expected to be historic, with polls showing a significant divide between male and female voters. Harris, who has focused on presenting herself as a competent and serious leader, may benefit from Trump\u2019s controversial remarks, particularly among women who find his behavior off-putting.What\u2019s nextAs the November 5 election approaches, both candidates will continue to sharpen their closing arguments. For Trump, this likely means more rallies filled with unfiltered language and humor aimed at energizing his base. His team hopes that by appealing to male voters, particularly in swing states like Pennsylvania, he can overcome the deficits he faces with women and suburban voters.Harris, meanwhile, will likely continue her strategy of focusing on Trump\u2019s character and fitness for office, hoping to persuade undecided voters that his behavior makes him unfit for a second term. She will also seek to turn out women and moderate voters, who are critical to her path to victory.The final weeks of the campaign are set to be a battle of contrasting styles: Trump\u2019s brash, masculine rhetoric versus Harris\u2019s more reserved, policy-focused approach. The outcome could hinge on which message resonates more with voters in key battleground states.(With inputs from agencies)",
        "summary": "Donald Trump intensifies vulgar language and hypermasculine rhetoric in the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, targeting male voters disillusioned by political correctness. This approach energizes his base but risks alienating suburban women and moderates, potentially widening the gender divide against Kamala Harris.",

        "text": "As the 2024 presidential election approaches, many US Jews like Rona Kaufman, observe signs that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump. Jewish voters form a small segment of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u2014key states for Democrats. Any shift could have substantial implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes have determined past elections. Many Jewish voters consider the upcoming election unprecedented, especially in light of Hamas\u2019 recent attacks on Israelis.As per the news agency AP, she notes discomfort at a recent Democratic campaign event in Pittsburgh and reflects on her family\u2019s changing political views. \u201cThe family that is my generation and older generations, I don\u2019t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we\u2019ve never voted Republican, ever,\u201d 49-year-old Kaufman said, highlighting her sister's Trump sign as a significant shift.Surveys indicate most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, although Kaufman acknowledges her viewpoint is unusual. In a close election, their votes can be pivotal, prompting campaigns from both Harris and Trump to recognise the risk of losing support. This dynamic has led Harris to navigate complex sentiments among traditional Democratic constituencies regarding the Gaza conflict, trying to balance support for Israel with concerns about civilian casualties.Trump has aimed to exploit this situation, suggesting that Harris \u201cdoesn't like\u201d Jewish people and claiming he\u2019ll be the \u201cbest friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\u201dHistorically, Jewish voters have largely supported the Democratic Party; a recent Pew Research Center poll showed about two-thirds back Harris.However, rising antisemitism in the US and anti-Israel protests have made many feel unsafe. The 2018 massacre of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh remains a painful reminder. This election, campaigns have reported unprecedented outreach to Jewish voters, with Republicans emphasising divisions within the Democratic Party regarding Israel.Many Jewish voters, like Jeremy Kazzaz, feel scared and uncertain. Kaufman, a progressive, never imagined considering Trump but now sees him as a defender against threats posed by Iran.Conversely, Harris\u2019 supporters view Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to his past comments and actions, including praise for Hezbollah and criticism of Israeli leadership.",
        "summary": "As the 2024 election nears, some US Jewish voters in key states feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may shift to Trump due to recent Hamas attacks. While most still support Democrats, the uncertainty and recent antisemitism may sway crucial votes, with both campaigns intensifying their outreach efforts.",

We are in close communication through diplomatic and military channels.\u201dOn October 21, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that an agreement has been reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border area.The announcement came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Kazan, Russia, for the 16th BRICS summit that begins today and is scheduled to run till October 24.Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media, stating, \u201cThis agreement is the outcome of extensive discussions over the past several weeks with Chinese interlocutors at both diplomatic and military levels.\u201d He noted that military commanders have been involved in negotiations aimed at addressing the tensions that have persisted since 2020.Misri explained that the agreement signifies a path toward disengagement and a potential resolution of the issues that arose during the significant confrontations in 2020. Misri recalled the clashes between the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China and the Indian Army, particularly highlighting the violent encounters in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. He added that this agreement marks a critical step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations seek to manage their border disputes and prevent further military confrontations.Misri said,\u201dOn several areas along the Line of Actual Control, we held discussions with Chinese interlocutors both at the diplomatic as well as military levels through meetings with military commanders at various levels.

There are phases in that as well,\u201d the COAS said.The agreement marks a crucial step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations work to manage their border disputes and avoid further military confrontations.In early May 2020, troops from China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and the Indian Army clashed at locations along the LAC, the disputed boundary between China and India.

        "text": "Amaravati: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday promised that he will be the best ambassador for the drone industry to promote its ecosystem and transform the state into a drone hub. The chief minister called on drone players to use the southern state as a pilot or testing ground for producing use cases and proof of concepts. \"Andhra Pradesh will be a testing bed for drone applications. Give us your use cases and we will test them,\" said Naidu, addressing a two-day national drone summit at Mangalagiri in Guntur district. The chief minister inaugurated the summit accompanied by Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu. Naidu noted that the state government is keen on adopting at least 150 drone use cases during the two-day summit on October 22 and 23. Calling on drone ecosystem players, the CM requested them to put their data and use cases in a sandbox for further validation and enhancement. Highlighting that the drone industry is the \"game changer\" of the future, he said these unmanned aerial vehicles have multiple use cases, such as identifying traffic violations, criminals and in farming, among several others. The TD supremo observed that the state government aims to hand over 20,000 drone pilot certificates and achieve 80 per cent indigenisation in drone manufacturing. Promising to allot 300 acres to the Civil Aviation Ministry, Government of India, Naidu requested the Centre to set up a drone certification hub at Orvakal in Kurnool district, which is near to Hyderabad, Chennai and Amaravati. Further, the CM appealed to drone players to keep their costs reasonable and refrain from being \"greedy\" to enable wider adoption of this technology. On the occasion, the Andhra Pradesh government inked an agreement with the Quality Council of India (QCI) for certifying drone startups in the state. There was also an agreement between IIT-Tirupati and Technology Innovative Hub for collaboration in drone technology development, startups and skill initiatives. Later, Naidu released a concept note on drone policy and also inaugurated a drone expo at the venue. Earlier, Union Aviation Minister K Ram Mohan Naidu said that the government does not want to import drones as it envisages the people of the country to manufacture them. The aviation minister highlighted that the Centre has liberalised rules for the drone ecosystem and enabled 27 companies to benefit from the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Noting that India has emerged as a drone hub in the past few years, the union minister said the government wants to push the industry further. \"Looking at a drone hub in Andhra Pradesh in the future... want to ensure that Andhra Pradesh grows to the best of its ability,\" he said, adding that the government wants to ensure that the southern state will emerge as the drone hub of the world. The mega-drone summit will feature drone hackathons, exhibitions and participation from industry experts. As many as 1,711 delegates and 1,306 visitors are expected to attend the summit. Likewise, over 8,000 people are also expected to attend the summit, which will be followed by a drone show at Punnami Ghat in Vijayawada on Tuesday evening.",

        "title": "AI\u2019s sweet spot lies between hype and criticism: OpenText India MD",
        "text": "penText has transformed from on-premises content management (1.0) to information management in hybrid cloud (2.0). Now, OpenText 3.0 focuses on \u2018Information Reimagined\u2019, combining cloud-based information management with AI, security, and compliance.\n\nOpenText\u2019s 3.0 journey has been a transformative experience for us. We are building a new AI platform that will help in the automation of product development internally. It is around \u2018Information Re-imagined\u2019 which is basically an Information Management Cloud with AI and with full security and compliance. \n\nThe 3.0 journey pushed us to embrace a cloud-first, AI-driven mindset, and to focus on delivering innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. OpenText 3.0 is all about security, AI, and information management cloud. We are going to be fully on the cloud, but we keep in mind the local regulatory requirements and data sovereignty requirements of certain countries, which means we\u2019ll bring the hyperscaler cloud into the country. \n\n This is a platform that we intend to use internally for auto-generating the application codes for product development and automating testing. The application code generation will help our developers and especially testers. We can imagine a world in the future where there are some user stories, the business use case stories on which the product development has to happen. You feed into this platform and say that your core language to develop this is Python. It\u2019ll read the user stories and suggest a Python code which the developer can then edit and refine further and then move to the next step of unit testing. Once the developer is happy, then the platform will suggest a test plan or test script for that. The platform itself will help you to test it. Once you approve the test plan and test script. This is not for sale to a customer. This is in pilot with over 2,000 developers testing it. \n\nThe majority of AI and Automation initiatives are being fully developed in India. That\u2019s one of the key elements of India OpenText 3.0, which our CEO entrusted us with. It started like 9-10 months back and we are heavily invested in that. The Indian team played a pivotal role in the development of this platform. India is going to play a very pivotal role in OpenText 3.0. Security is a key focus area in our 3.0 strategy and as an example of the role of India in the security the managed security operations centre under our cybersecurity practice in India will grow significantly and most likely going to double in size. \n\nWill AI be fully successful? The answer is no. Can it replace everything perfectly? The answer is no. It\u2019s a simple common example. I can say critics and admirers are sitting on the left-hand, and right-hand side of the fence. But the answer is in the middle. You will not leave everything with AI, but you will leave a lot of things with AI. It just depends on how everybody is experimenting maybe the AI might fail in one area \u2013 let\u2019s say product development. Maybe it produces a code, then we have to put more effort into correcting it. The efficiency gain is 30 per cent but to rework is another 20 per cent, eventually, a 10 per cent gain is not worth it, but AI-assisted automated testing is most likely 100 per cent guaranteed that it will work well. Therefore in some areas, it will succeed, it will fail. That\u2019s my view.\n\n Price-wise, the Indian market is definitely challenging. The price point that customers expect here is different; North American pricing or other models won\u2019t work. So, we\u2019ve defined specific packages, solutions, and price points tailored for the Indian market. \n\nWe\u2019ve learned these lessons over time, and we\u2019re now seeing significant success. For example, just three months ago, we secured a multi-million dollar deal with a large telecom customer in India. This is a yearly renewable project, highlighting the growing demand for our products and services in the domestic market. This particular customer needed our solutions to streamline their business processes, and we were able to meet their needs effectively. A few other customers in India where we had success in last few years are L&T Technology Services with whom we are partnering to serve strategic Govt institutions, ITC, GAIL, IOCL, and ONGC. \n\nPreviously, we had success stories with only multinational companies that are rolling out in India. But the true India stories have started coming up in the last 24 months or so.\n\n We have a strong internship program that originated in Hyderabad. We hire close to 300 interns every year. Of those interns, 40 per cent get converted to full-time employees. We started with product development, then we replicated to other units as well - now professional services, customer success, and technical support. It is working very well. And in that process, we have a good affiliation with campuses both in Hyderabad and Bangalore and all India level as well. We have identified, certain universities we work with.",

        "text": "Berhampur (Odisha): Even though winter is yet to set in the state, winged guests have started to arrive at Odisha's Chilika lake, the biggest waterfowl habitat in the country, an official said. The migratory birds have already started to arrive in the lake from the first week of the current month, as the usual time of their arrival, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Chilika Wildlife Division, Amlan Nayak said on Tuesday. Their arrival was continuing daily, he said. Migratory birds of different species like northern pintail, Eurasian wigeon, gadwall, black-tailed gadwall, northern shoveller, greater flamingo, common sandpiper, common coot, mongolian plover, common snipe, black winged stilt, etc, have already swooped down in the lake, Nayak said. The DFO said the arrival of migratory birds to the lake is as usual, even though the day temperature in and around the blue lagoon was hovering at 32 to 35 degrees Celsius at present. The onset of winter and some other causes in their native places might have forced the birds to fly to Chilika, he added. Several birds are also seen to fly in the sky near Chilika without settling on the lake. They might land once the water level recedes in the lake, Nayak said, adding, \"We expected their number might be in large by the end of the current month.\" The winged guests mostly from beyond the Himalayas in Northern Eurasia, Caspian region, Siberia, Kazakh, Lake Baikal and remote areas of Russia and neighbouring countries visit the Chilika lake every winter and start their homeward journey before the onset of summer in the second week of March. In the last winter, a total of 11,37,759 birds of 187 species visited Chilika and the majority of them settled in the Nalabana sanctuary area inside the lake. To prevent bird poaching in the lake during the period, the wildlife division has set up 21 temporary camps in the lake. They have also hired around a dozen boats for patrolling in the lake. Besides, they have decided to make surveillance through drones like the previous year. The camps have already started functioning from October 1 and will continue till the end of March. With the setting up of the camps, patrolling was also intensified in the lake. The drive to create awareness among the people to prevent bird poaching was also launched in the vulnerable areas, said the forest official.",

        "text": "The State Industries Minister P Rajeeve has launched seaweed-based nutraceutical product developed by ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute\u2019s (CMFRI) for liver health. \n\nThe product named GreenRexTM is the commercial brand of the technology developed by CMFRI and is commercially produced and marketed by Emineotech, Private Limited, said a press release. \n\nA unique blend of 100 per cent natural bioactive ingredients extracted from select seaweeds, the product is made of an eco-friendly green technology to improve liver health. \n\nThe Minister hailed the research initiatives of CMFRI on developing a series of nutraceuticals from seaweeds to combat lifestyle diseases. He pointed out that Kerala is highly prospective for the development of nutraceuticals and emphasised the need for creating a connection between the research institutes and the industry. \n\nCMFRI Director Grinson George said nutraceuticals of marine origin plays a major role in the healthcare sector, providing essential nutrients and potential disease-fighting compounds to support overall well-being. CMFRI\u2019s nutraceutical products receive an overwhelming response from the public which indicates a surge in demand for products developed from marine organisms, he said. \n\nCMFRI has identified 342 suitable farming sites for its cultivation in the country sprawling over 24167 ha with a production potential of 9.7 million tonnes (wet weight) per year, he added.\n\nThe nutraceutical product promises to offer a natural and effective solution for individuals struggling with liver health issues. With its unique formulation derived from seaweed, it helps improve cholesterol levels and other factors that can lead to liver diseases, said Kajal Chakraborty, Head of Marine Biotechnology, Fish Nutrition and Health Division of CMFRI who developed the product.\n\nCMFRI has already commercialised nutraceuticals to combat lifestyle diseases such as type-2 diabetes, arthritis, cholesterol, hypertension, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis besides an immunity booster.",

They have also hired around a dozen boats for patrolling in the lake. Besides, they have decided to make surveillance through drones like the previous year.\n\nThe camps have already started functioning from October 1 and will continue till the end of March.

        "text": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Tuesday took a dig at the INDIA alliance and Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance over the seat share troubles in Jharkhand and Maharashtra, respectively. He said that the political families in these MVA and INDIA only want to come to power, asserting that Congress can\u2019t walk together with its allies. Naqvi further attacked the Congress and said that the opposition party didn\u2019t give importance to small and regional parties. He suggested that Congress should learn from BJP and Narendra Modi in handling the allies. While speaking on the seat-sharing tussle of INDIA Alliance in Jharkhand and MVA in Maharashtra, Naqvi said, \u201cBe it Jharkhand or Maharashtra, there is more of \u2018siyasi khurpench\u2019 than \u2018seats ka pench\u2019. Be it Aghadi or alliance, their \u2018khaandani khiladi\u2019 have the same aspiration \u2013 to come into power. Today, whichever alliance will be led by Congress party will have \u2018pench\u2019 as well as \u2018khurpench\u2019 because Congress has no DNA or mindset to walk ahead together with all allies. Congress thinks that small parties and regional parties have no importance. They should learn from the BJP and Narendra Modi.\u201dMeanwhile, Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat met Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) chief Sharad Pawar today ahead of the MVA\u2019s meeting to discuss seat sharing for the upcoming elections in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut informed that Thorat met Pawar in Delhi and will visit Matoshree in Mumbai to meet Uddhav Thackeray. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had earlier announced that elections in Maharashtra are to be held on November 20 and the counting for all 288 assembly constituencies will be held on November 23. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, while Shiv Sena won 56 seats and the Congress won 44 seats. In 2014, the BJP won 122 seats, while Shiv Sena won 63 and Congress left its mark on 42 seats. (ANI)",

The victim's father wrote an email to Amit Shah on his birthday and sought time from him to get guidance on the ways to get the case expedited and get justice for his daughter. In the letter, the victim's father said that the family were \"under tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless\". \"After that heinous unforeseen incident happened to our daughter, we have been going through tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless. I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you and gain your insights on the issue, as I believe your experience and guidance would be invaluable,\" the victim's father wrote in the email. Massive protests broke out after the rape-murder of the trainee doctor in Kolkata. Doctors went on strike demanding better working conditions and guarantees of safety. Doctors all over the country took to the streets demanding action against the accused. Sanjay Roy, believed to be the main accused in the case, was arrested, and the case was handed over to the CBI. The CBI, in its investigation, refuted claims of a gangrape and stated that Sanjay Roy committed the crime alone. Over 45 senior doctors and faculty members of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital collectively resigned in solidarity with their junior colleagues, who were protesting against the murder of the trainee doctor. In their resignation letters, the senior doctors stated that the demands of the junior doctors had not been addressed and that there had been \"no progress\" in the investigation of the trainee doctor\u2019s rape and murder.Furthermore, junior doctors, who sat on a hunger strike in protest against the government ended their strike on Monday after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The doctors, who had been demanding better working conditions and infrastructure improvements in the healthcare sector, also announced the withdrawal of the general medical strike they had earlier called.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

        "text": "In a dramatic turn of events, just weeks before the crucial November 20 Maharashtra Assembly elections, an electrifying scene unfolded late Monday night on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway. \n\nPune Rural police made a stunning seizure of \u20b95 crore in unaccounted cash at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza near Pune during a high-stakes nakabandi (on-road checking). The incident has sent shockwaves across the state, especially with the model code of conduct in force since October 15.\n\nWhile the police investigate, the political battlefield has erupted in accusations and counterclaims. Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) leader Sanjay Raut dropped a bombshell, alleging that the cash was part of a massive \u20b975 crore fund being distributed by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to his party candidates. Raut claimed the seized \u20b95 crore was just the tip of the iceberg, insisting that \u20b915 crore was in transit, but only \u20b95 crore was officially accounted for. According to Raut, the cash was on its way to Shinde\u2019s loyal MLA, Shahjibapu Patil, in Sangola, Solapur district.\n\nHowever, MLA Patil vehemently denied any involvement, branding the accusations as slanderous. \u201cEver since we broke away from Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s Shiv Sena, they\u2019ve been targeting us. I have no knowledge of the cash or the people carrying it,\u201d Patil said, calling Raut\u2019s claims an act of political vendetta. The car carrying the money has been impounded, and four individuals are now being grilled by police at the Rajgad police station.\n\nCash in Stream\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2014this explosive cash drama takes an even more bizarre twist. Far from the police checkpoints, in the sleepy town of Atpadi in Sangli, a different kind of treasure hunt was unfolding. Just before Diwali, the quiet banks of a local stream near the Ambabai temple transformed into a chaotic scene as rumors spread of cash notes flowing in the water. \n\nShocked villagers rushed to the site, scooping up thousands of rupees as they fished currency notes from the stream, unsure where the sudden windfall came from. Videos of the surreal event went viral, adding to the mounting mystery. As locals scramble for answers, police are now investigating the source of this aquatic cash flow.\n\nMeanwhile, in the midst of the frenzy, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MLA Rohit Pawar fired yet another salvo at the ruling BJP-led alliance, accusing them of resorting to cash-for-votes tactics. \u201cLike in the Lok Sabha elections, they are trying to buy votes with dirty money, but the people of Maharashtra won\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Pawar declared. He confidently asserted that this \u201ccorruption money\u201d wouldn\u2019t be enough to secure power for the ruling coalition.",

Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Wayanad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23. After the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Wayanad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also be present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. After being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. The election commission also announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. If Priyanka Gandhi wins from Wayanad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. Gandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation councillor. Rahul Gandhi had said both Rae Bareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Rae Bareli before entering active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party. Meanwhile, Congress appointed Saral Patel as the media coordinator for Wayanad ahead of the by-election with immediate effect",

        "text": "The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday assured the Supreme Court that authorities won\u2019t take any action till tomorrow on demolition notices issued against the buildings belonging to persons allegedly involved in the October 13 Bahraich violence in the state.A bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan said it will hear the application tomorrow seeking protection against the proposed demolitions.Senior advocate CU Singh mentioned the application before the bench today for an early hearing.The bench said it will take up the application tomorrow for hearing and asked the Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj to defer action, to which ASG said that no action will be taken till tomorrow.ASG also informed the top court that the Allahabad High Court is also seized of the matter. On urgent hearing, the High Court on Sunday granted 15 more days to the affected persons to respond to the notices issued by the UP authorities.\u201cIf they (UP authorities) want to take the risk of flouting our order, it\u2019s their choice,\u201d the bench also remarked.An application was filed in the apex court against the demolition notices issued by the Uttar Pradesh authorities to some people including the accused in the Bahraich violence case Abdul Hameed over the illegal construction of his residence.Three people have jointly filed the petition against the demolition notice and urged the top court to quash the notices issued on October 17, 2024, which was pasted on the night of October 18.The petitioners also sought interim relief for staying the proposed demolition and status quo as of the date of issuance of notice on October 17.Earlier on September 17 the apex court passed an interim order on similar petitions that no construction should be bulldozed without prior permission from it, except those that are encroachments on public spaces. The top court has recently reserved its judgement on a batch of petitions seeking directions against demolition actions by various state authorities, whereby houses of persons accused of crimes are demolished as a punitive action",

        "title": "India-China Agreement Explained: After 4 Years Eastern Ladakh Border Standoff Resolves - Key Details",
        "text": "In a significant development that could mark a turning point in India-China relations, China officially confirmed on October 22, 2024, that it had reached a resolution with India to resolve the prolonged border standoff in eastern Ladakh. This breakthrough comes after years of military tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which escalated in 2020 and has remained a source of concern in regional geopolitics.Diplomatic and Military Dialogue Yields ResultsChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced the resolution at a press briefing in Beijing, stating that China and India had been in close communication through both diplomatic and military channels to address the border issues.Over a recent period, China and India have been in close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues related to the China-India border, Lin Jian stated. Now the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters, which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions.While the Chinese government did not provide specifics of the agreement, the news comes as a positive step towards resolving one of the most tense and dangerous flashpoints in the region.Indias Announcement of DisengagementIndia, too, confirmed that the disengagement process with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh had been completed. On October 21, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that an agreement had been reached on restoring patrolling rights along the LAC, a key aspect of the border tension that had been unresolved since the violent clashes in 2020.Jaishankar said, We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed... We will be able to resume the patrolling that we were doing in 2020. I think its a good development.The disengagement likely covers the critical areas of Depsang and Demchok, regions that had been points of contention since the military standoff began over four years ago. These areas hold strategic importance due to their proximity to supply routes and military outposts.The Four-Year-Long Standoff: A Brief OverviewThe border dispute between India and China reached its peak in June 2020, when both nations troops engaged in violent clashes in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops. The skirmish, fought with sticks, stones, and improvised weapons, was the deadliest confrontation between the two countries in over four decades and marked a major escalation in a border conflict that had simmered for decades.Since then, both sides have maintained a heightened military presence along the disputed areas, particularly in eastern Ladakh. While rounds of diplomatic and military talks followed, they failed to produce any tangible results until now. The lack of a clear demarcation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and competing territorial claims have made the situation highly volatile.BRICS Summit and Potential for Improved Bilateral TiesThe announcement of the agreement coincides with the ongoing 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping were expected to discuss bilateral issues on the sidelines of the summit. While the specific details of their conversation are yet to be disclosed, the confirmation of the border agreement points to a broader effort to improve relations between the two Asian giants.When asked about the bilateral meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, We will keep you updated if anything comes up, indicating the possibility of further developments in the India-China relationship.This agreement could serve as a catalyst for broader discussions aimed at stabilizing bilateral ties, which have been strained since the Galwan Valley clashes. Both sides appear keen to avoid further military confrontations and work towards peaceful coexistence, at least in the immediate future.Historical Context of the India-China Border DisputeThe India-China border dispute dates back to the early years of post-colonial India. The two nations share a 3,488-kilometer-long border, much of which is not clearly demarcated, leading to frequent skirmishes and confrontations. The most significant conflict between the two nations occurred in 1962, when China defeated India in a brief but decisive war over disputed territories in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.Since then, tensions have flared periodically, with both sides accusing the other of transgressing into their territory. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash was a stark reminder of how quickly such tensions can escalate into violence, even in an era of nuclear deterrence.The recent standoff in eastern Ladakh added another layer of complexity to the border issue, as both nations were forced to divert military resources to maintain an uneasy peace in the region.Implications of the AgreementThe successful resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff could have far-reaching implications for regional stability. Here are some of the key takeaways:Resumption of Patrolling: India will now be able to resume patrolling in areas along the LAC, particularly in Depsang and Demchok, where both sides had fortified their positions.Easing of Military Tensions: With the disengagement process complete, both India and China can now focus on reducing their military presence in the region, potentially lowering the risk of accidental escalations or clashes.Bilateral Cooperation: The agreement signals a willingness on both sides to resolve disputes through dialogue rather than military force. This could pave the way for broader discussions on trade, security, and regional cooperation.Geopolitical Impact: With both India and China being key players in regional and global politics, their ability to manage bilateral relations peacefully will have a stabilizing effect on South Asia and beyond.Strategic Positioning: The resolution allows India to focus more on other security concerns, such as its borders with Pakistan and internal issues, while China can turn its attention to other geopolitical interests, such as its ambitions in the South China Sea.Future ChallengesWhile the agreement marks a major step forward, several challenges remain. The border between India and China is still not clearly defined, and periodic confrontations could arise in the future. Additionally, the resolution does not address broader territorial claims, such as Chinas claims over Arunachal Pradesh, which remains a contentious issue.The effectiveness of this agreement will depend largely on how both nations implement the disengagement process and manage future disagreements along the LAC. Continued dialogue and trust-building measures will be critical in preventing future flare-ups.Conclusion: A New Chapter in India-China Relations?The resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff is being hailed as a diplomatic victory for both India and China. It marks the end of one of the most tense periods in their bilateral relationship in recent history. While challenges remain, the agreement offers hope that both nations can move towards a more stable and cooperative future.As the world watches closely, the successful implementation of this agreement could set a precedent for resolving other contentious issues between the two countries and contribute to broader regional peace and security.",

        "title": "PCOS: Watch Out For These Common Myths",
        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age, causing a variety of symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, excessive levels of androgens (male hormones), and the presence of small cysts on the ovaries. The exact cause of PCOS is unclear, but it is often linked to insulin resistance, genetics, and inflammation. Symptoms may include weight gain, acne, hair thinning, and difficulty in conceiving. While PCOS can lead to complications like infertility and metabolic issues, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medical treatments. There are various myths surrounding PCOS, read on to find out the most common ones.\n\nCommon myths about PCOS\n\n1. Myth: PCOS always causes infertility\n\nMany women with PCOS worry that they won't be able to have children. However, PCOS doesn't make pregnancy impossible. It can make conception more difficult due to irregular ovulation, but with proper medical treatment and lifestyle changes, many women with PCOS can conceive.\n\n2. Myth: You need to have cysts on your ovaries to have PCOS\n\nDespite its name, not all women with PCOS have ovarian cysts. The term \"polycystic\" refers to the appearance of the ovaries in some women, but PCOS is primarily a hormonal imbalance and doesn't necessarily require the presence of cysts.\n\n3. Myth: PCOS only affects overweight women\n\nWhile weight gain is a common symptom, PCOS can affect women of all body types. Lean women can also suffer from PCOS and may face challenges related to hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, and insulin resistance.\n\n4. Myth: Weight loss can cure PCOS\n\nWeight loss can help alleviate some symptoms of PCOS, particularly for those who are overweight, but it is not a cure. PCOS is a chronic condition that can be managed but not entirely eliminated. Even women at a healthy weight can have PCOS.\n\n5. Myth: Irregular periods are the only symptom of PCOS\n\nPCOS is more than just irregular periods. It can also cause symptoms such as acne, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), hair thinning, and insulin resistance. The condition affects multiple systems in the body, not just the reproductive system.\n\n6. Myth: PCOS goes away after menopause\n\nPCOS does not disappear after menopause. While some symptoms, like irregular periods, may no longer be an issue, other symptoms such as insulin resistance, metabolic issues, and an increased risk of heart disease can continue into later life.\n\n7. Myth: Birth control pills cure PCOS\n\nBirth control pills are often used to manage PCOS symptoms, such as regulating periods and reducing acne, but they do not cure the condition. They help manage symptoms temporarily, and stopping them usually leads to the return of symptoms.\n\n8. Myth: PCOS is a rare condition\n\nPCOS is actually quite common, affecting about 1 in 10 women worldwide. Many women go undiagnosed because symptoms can vary widely and mimic other conditions, leading to a lack of proper diagnosis and awareness.\n\n9. Myth: Diet alone can fix PCOS\n\nWhile a healthy diet is essential for managing PCOS symptoms, it is not always enough on its own. PCOS often requires a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, hormonal treatments. A balanced diet can improve insulin sensitivity and help with weight management, but it may not resolve all symptoms.\n\nKeep these points in mind if you have or might have PCOS.\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Beirut: Lebanon\u2019s state media reported Israeli airstrikes near the southern city of Tyre on Tuesday, shortly after Israel's military issued an evacuation warning. Video footage showed smoke rising after Israel warned residents of Al-Hawsh, just south of Tyre, to evacuate. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that \"enemy aircraft launched a series of strikes\" on the area. This escalation comes after Lebanon's health ministry revised the death toll from an Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Beirut on Monday night, stating that 13 people, including a child, were killed. The previous estimate had been four. The strike, which took place near the Rafik Hariri Hospital, Lebanon\u2019s largest public health facility, also left 57 people injured and flattened four buildings in the area, according to reports. Rescuers were still searching for survivors under the rubble on Tuesday, as locals described hearing a cell phone ringing beneath the debris. Monday night\u2019s strike followed Israel's evacuation warnings and targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The Ouzai neighborhood, minutes away from the Jnah area, was hit for the first time in the conflict, sparking an exodus of residents. No warnings were issued for the densely populated area around Rafik Hariri Hospital, which has seen an influx of displaced people from southern Lebanon. Lebanese authorities report that nearly a month of war between Israel and Hezbollah has claimed at least 1,489 lives in Lebanon, with more than a million people displaced, many of whom have fled to neighboring Syria. The ongoing conflict has heavily strained shelters and relief efforts. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel to push for a ceasefire, as diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza and Lebanon conflicts continue.",

The awards were presented to 38 winners in nine categories, including Best State, Best District, Best Village Panchayat, Best Urban Local Body, Best Water User Association and Best Civil Society. \n\nSpeaking on the occasion, President Murmu said that the government has provided tap water connections to over 78 per cent of rural households across the country under the Jal Jeevan Mission.\n\nShe highlighted the significant improvement in the lives of people, particularly in rural areas, after the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission and said that when the flagship programme was launched in 2019, only 17 per cent of rural households had access to safe drinking water.\n\nThe National Water Awards are aimed at creating awareness among the people about the importance of water and to motivate them to adopt the best water usage practices.\n\nPresident Murmu also underlined the role of state governments in water conservation and expressed concern over the depletion of the groundwater situation of the country.\n\nShe said that water is a basic necessity and a fundamental human right for every individual.\n\n\u201cA clean and prosperous society cannot be built without ensuring access to clean water. The unavailability of water and poor sanitation have a greater impact on the health, food security and livelihood of the underprivileged,\u201d she said.\n\nThe President further noted that water conservation has been part of our tradition and underlined the need to retain the wisdom of ancestors.\n\n\u201cOur ancestors used to build ponds near villages. They used to build reservoirs in or near temples so that the stored water could be used in case of water shortage. Unfortunately, we are forgetting the wisdom of our ancestors. Some people have encroached upon reservoirs for personal gain. This not only affects the availability of water during drought but also creates flood-like situations when there is excessive rainfall,\u201d she said.\n\nThe President said that the conservation and enhancement of water resources is the collective responsibility of all and added that without everyone\u2019s active participation, it is not possible to build a water-secure India.\n\nPresident Murmu further said that the National Water Awards is a commendable step towards promoting relevant approaches and actions towards water resources.\n\nShe expressed confidence that the \u201cBest Practices\u201d of the awardees would reach the masses through this event.",

She was barely a child of 3.5 years of age, however, instead of showing any love, affection and protection to the victim, the convict, on the contrary, made her a victim of lust,\" it noted.The court found it a \"clear case\" of betrayal.Apart from Pocso law, the man was convicted under Section 376 AB (punishment for committing rape on a woman under 12 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code.In addition to the 20-year RI, the court saddled the convict with Rs 50,000 fine and awarded Rs 1.2 lakh compensation to the minor survivor.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

In just the first three quarters of 2024, close to 70 companies have already gone public on Indian stock exchanges.\n\nOne of the main motivations for returning is the ability to gain crucial analyst coverage locally. While Indian tech \u201cunicorns\u201d establishing themselves abroad was a common strategy in the past decade, being domiciled within the country provides better access to institutional investors that follow businesses valued under $2 billion more closely.\n\nAfter over a decade of expansion internationally, India's booming tech sector is coming back in a big way.

        "text": "Eight students from Balochistan have reportedly gone missing from their shared residence in Gulistan-i-Jauhar in Pakistan\u2019s biggest city Karachi, according to a report by Dawn. Family members allege that law enforcement agencies \u201ctook away\u201d the students, but police have declined to comment on these allegations.According to reports, the missing students\u2013Shoaib Ali, Haneef, Ishfaq , Shahzad, Bebarg Ameer, Zubair, Qambar Ali, and Saeedullah disappeared on October 16. Three of them are enrolled at Karachi University, three attend a seminary, one is an intermediate student, and another studies at Urdu University. Families maintain that the students were picked up by law enforcement from their residence in Rustam Zikri Goth.Talking to Dawn, Wazir Ahmed, the elder brother of missing student Qambar Ali, stated, \u201cQambar is an intermediate student in Mashkey, Awaran, but he was taking coaching classes at a tuition academy near Nipa.\u201d He, along with the families of other missing students, approached the police on October 17, but the SHO refused to file their report. Ahmed emphasised that they have no political affiliations or involvement in any suspicious activities, demanding the immediate release of the students.In response to the situation, Riaz Ahmed, a member of the Karachi University syndicate, condemned the disappearances, stating, \u201cIt is horrifying that students are apprehended and made to disappear without charges. Young students should not be subjected to the harsh realities of state actions.\u201dThe issue of enforced appearances is a significant human rights concern that reflects the broader challenges facing the region. In Balochistan, enforced disappearances have been reported extensively, with individuals, often activists, political leaders, and students, going missing under mysterious circumstances, frequently attributed to state security forces or non-state actors.These disappearances create a climate of fear and insecurity, impacting the social fabric of communities. Families of the disappeared face immense challenges, including emotional distress and a lack of access to justice. The government has been criticized for its insufficient response to these cases, with many families left without answers about the fate of their loved ones.",

I will tell him the mental agony we have been going through because our daughter is yet to get justice,\" the mother told PTI.\n\nOn August 9, the semi-nude body of an on-duty woman medic was recovered from the seminar hall of the RG Kar Hospital following which the junior doctors went on a 'cease-work' across West Bengal demanding justice for the victim.\n\nThey also demanded increased police protection in hospitals, recruitment of permanent women police personnel, and swift filling of vacant positions for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers.\n\nThey ended their stir after 42 days on September 21 following assurances from the State government to look into their demands.\n\nThe Kolkata Police, which was investigating the crime initially, had arrested one civic volunteer before the CBI took over the investigation following an order of the Calcutta High Court.\n\nThe CBI later arrested the former principal of the RG Kar Medical College Sandip Ghosh and now suspended officer-in-charge of Tala Police Station Abhijit Mondal in connection with their investigation of the rape-murder of the woman doctor.\n\nJunior medics on October 5 night started fast-unto-death following the West Bengal government missing their 24-hour-deadline to fulfil their demands in the wake of the rape-murder of a woman medic at the R.G. Kar Hospital.\n\nThey withdrew their hunger strike on the 17th day after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday.\n\nThe medics also called off their proposed shutdown in the State\u2019s health sector scheduled to be initiated from Tuesday till an indefinite period.",

While 293.81 kg of heroin was seized from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port (Navi Mumbai) by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Delhi police Special Cell had impounded 352.71 kg of drugs from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana.\n\nAccording to the ED, the arrested people coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. \n\n\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder. The accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED uncovered a highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions and operational expenses by the accused has been made, said the agency. \n\nThe accused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. \n\n\u201cThe syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local market. Further, the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles...from second-hand market for supplying the drugs from the storage hubs to other points of distribution,\u201d said an official. \n\nThe agency said cash was used for purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities. \n\n\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via Nava Sheva port, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri (Madhya Pradesh) and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. The transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED has attached a property in Jandoli village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of the accused and fixed deposits.",

        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 21 (IANS) Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar says the Mahayuti-led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) remains unified with a clear and mutually-agreed seat sharing formula, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Congress, Shiv Sena(UBT) and NCP(SP) is facing internal squabbles over constituency allocation.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with IANS, Shelar claims that the Mahayuti government will come back to power after the elections. Here are some excerpts:\n\nIANS: Although the BJP has announced the first list, talks for seat sharing among the Mahayuti are not yet concluded. Is it due to differences? The MVA is also struggling to arrive at an understanding. What is your take?\n\nShelar: There is remarkable unity and discipline within the Mahayuti alliance. We have finalised our seat-sharing proportions and accordingly our list of candidates has also been declared. There is also clarity that the elections will be contested under the leadership of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. However, within the MVA, there is no consensus, no balanced seat-sharing arrangement and all their allied partners are embroiled in internal debates. Either before arriving at a consensus over seat sharing or immediately after the results, the MVA is sure to be in tatters after November 23. The MVA\u2019s expiry date is arriving soon.\n\nIANS: How confident are you about the Mahayuti forming the government once again in Maharashtra?\n\nShelar: Absolutely confident. Every election is different in terms of the prevailing issues, subjects, developments and the overall ecosystem. We, as the Mahayuti, are confident of winning the elections as we have only focussed on working for the development of the state. We have decided to go out to the people of Maharashtra with the list of development works and initiatives undertaken.\n\nIANS: Do you fear fake narratives will impact the results like during the Lok Sabha elections?\n\nShelar: Fake narratives were spread during the Lok Sabha elections which had impacted us. Today, once again, conspiracies to spread lies and fake narratives are being made. It is our job to stop the fake narrative and to speak in the interest of the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray alleged that 1,000-odd acres of land has been transferred in the name of Adani. I challenged him to give evidence to prove his statement. If Aaditya Thackeray has the courage, he should come forward for an open discussion and counter our questions. He is behaving like a spokesperson of urban Naxals and deliberately trying to spread lies, disturbance and unrest and create an image that there is anarchy in the state.\n\nIANS: You have been targeting the MVA over \u2018Vote Jihad\u2019. What is your comment?\n\nShelar: The MVA leaders are resorting to doing politics of appeasement. We have always believed in \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019. Our Hindutva also revolves around development of all elements of society. We believe in taking everybody together in our march of progress. Why should Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya get worried about it? The Mahayuti government is working towards ensuring homes for the poor in Dharavi. But they are making attempts to incite Dharavikars and spread fear in the minds of the poor Marathi, Muslim, Dalits making them believe that they will never get their rightful homes in Dharavi.\n\nIANS: What is the Mahayuti\u2019s agenda for the forthcoming Assembly elections?\n\nShelar: Our agenda is development. The Mahayuti government believes in delivering on its promises. The government launched the Coastal Road, the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg, the Mumbai-Delhi corridor, bullet train and much more. Through schemes like the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, the government started transferring money in the bank accounts of women, made ST travel free, deposited money in the bank accounts of senior citizens, and gave waivers to farmers over electricity bills. Today, the common citizen is concerned about the development of his city, state and the nation and we believe in favour of development.\n\n(Sanjay Jog can be reached at sanjay.j@ians.in)",

The clash led to the tragic death of Ram Gopal Mishra, a 22-year-old who succumbed to gunshot injuries.Following the incident, the area descended into chaos, with mobs engaging in widespread vandalism and arson, targeting homes, shops, showrooms, hospitals, and vehicles.Local authorities have responded by registering multiple FIRs against both unidentified rioters and some named individuals. As of now, the police have detained 55 suspects and increased security measures in the town, which has a mixed population.This marks the third major communal incident in Bahraich, following previous outbreaks in 2009 and 2014.In October 2009, violence erupted in the same area after rumors circulated about objectionable materials being thrown at a religious site, leading to arson and destruction.

        "text": "The Cyber Crime Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police has busted a six-member gang reportedly involved in running an online share trading scam and duping a person of \u20b914 crore. \n\nAdditional Director General of Police, Cyber Crime, Sandeep Mittal, said the online trading scam involved \u201cfraudulent individuals misleading victims into investing in fake share trading opportunities, promising high returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cCybercriminals, forming a group via WhatsApp, have created share investment apps, misleading people into believing they can earn up to 500 times their investment by trading shares online. They have circulated false information suggesting that many people are making significant profits through these apps, thereby cheating the public under the guise of online share trading,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\nThe police said the complainant in this case was contacted via WhatsApp by a member of the gang in April, introducing himself as someone who represented an institution called Black Rock Asset Management Business School. He falsely claimed that investing in Black Rock would yield a 500% profit within two months, while also stating that the company was SEBI-approved. \n\nThe man convinced the complainant to invest with a stipulation that he must pay a 20% service charge on the profits generated from the investment. The complainant was then persuaded to download a mobile app through a link and subsequently invested \u20b914 crore into various bank accounts, the police said. \n\nWhen the complainant realised that the invested money was not being returned, he filed a complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. Based on this, an FIR was registered at Cyber Crime Wing Headquarters, Chennai \u2013 SCCIC (State Cyber Crime Investigation Centre), and the police retrieved the money from 13 bank accounts. \n\nAfter analysing the call records and money trail, the special team of police arrested V. Subramanian, 39, from Chengalpattu, who is the first-layer beneficiary ICICI Bank account holder of the fraudulent transaction of \u20b921.5 lakh. \n\nBased on his confession, the other suspects were arrested. They are: M. Madan, 43, from Neelankarai, who owns a chit company in T. Nagar; R. Saravanapriyan, 34, from Thiruvallur, who is an associate producer in the film industry; Sathish Singh, 46, from Avadi, who is an associate of Saravanapriyan; Shafahed, 38, from Pulianthope, who owns a shop that converts currency; and D. Manikandan, 30, from Madurai, who previously worked at a cine producer\u2019s office in Chennai.\n\nAdditionally, two cryptocurrency wallet accounts were frozen. Action is being taken to arrest a gang based in north India that allegedly masterminded these cybercrimes and recover the defrauded money, said Mr. Mittal.",

Similar to earlier reports, the House findings do not pinpoint any specific individuals responsible for the failures.The preliminary findings are based on thousands of pages of documents, nearly twenty transcribed interviews with state and local officials, and a range of briefings\u2014both classified and unclassified\u2014from senior officials at the Secret Service and FBI.Meanwhile, the task force has initiated an investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump from last month, involving an individual with a rifle who was found camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.",
        "summary": "A House panel report has determined that the assassination attempt on former President Trump at a Pennsylvania rally was \"preventable\" due to significant security failures. It noted that law enforcement could have engaged the suspect, Thomas Matthew Crooks, at several critical moments but failed to communicate effectively. The report reiterates previous findings about the Secret Service's shortcomings and does not identify specific individuals responsible. Meanwhile, an investigation is underway into a second assassination attempt involving a man with a rifle outside one of Trump's golf courses in Florida.",

Opposition parties, the BRS and the BJP had backed their demand.\n\nAfter the apex court refused to pass interim orders to stop the exam, the TGSPSC went ahead with the conduct of the exam to fill 563 Group-I posts in various departments of the state government.\n\nCandidates, who had reached the exam centres much before the scheduled time of 2 p.m., were anxiously waiting for the Supreme Court orders. Once it became clear that the Supreme Court dismissed the petitions, the authorities went ahead with the conduct of the exams at all 46 centres in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, and Medchal Malkajgiri districts.\n\nA total of 31,383 candidates have applied for the exams, which will continue till October 27.\n\nThese candidates qualified for the Group-1 Mains examination out of around 3.02 lakh who appeared for the preliminary examination held in June.\n\nPolice made elaborate arrangements at the exam centres to prevent any protest or untoward incident. Officials were checking the hall tickets of the candidates before allowing them into designated centres.\n\nOn the first day, the candidates appeared for the General English exam. The exam will continue till 5 p.m. Authorities closed the gates an hour before the exam was scheduled to begin. Those coming late were not allowed.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has conveyed his best wishes to the candidates writing the Group-I exam. He advised the candidates to write the exams with full concentration without any worries. The Chief Minister wished that the candidates pass the exam and become partners in the reconstruction of Telangana.\n\nThis is the first time after the formation of Telangana that Group-I Mains exams are being held. The last time the exams were held was in 2011.\n\nThe Group-1 prelims have been marred by controversies over paper leaks and legal battles for not following the norms and irregularities in 2022 and 2023. Keeping this in view, the TGSPSC has made fool-proof arrangements. Chief Secretary Santhi Kumari has asked all officials to leave no room for any irregularities.",

This arrangement could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started back in May 2020 and moving towards peace.\n\n BREAKING: India, China agree on patrolling along LAC, leading to disengagement ahead of BRICS meet in Russia \n\n New Delhi: In a major development, India and China have agreed on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas of the Himalayas, informed Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday. This development has come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia to attend the crucial BRICS summit. The patrolling arrangement between both countries can lead to disengagement and could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started in May 2020.\n\nWhile addressing the media during a special MEA briefing, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that diplomatic and military officials from both countries were in talks with each other. \u201cOver the last few weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums and as a result of these discussions, an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border area, leading to disengagement and resolution,\u201d he stated. \nResponding to a media question on possible meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS in Russia, Misri stated that there are chances of a bilateral meeting between both the leaders. \n\u201cAs far as the question on the bilateral meetings is concerned, this is a multilateral event, though there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking over the overall program of the prime minister. There are a lot of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update on the bilaterals as they evolve,\u201d Misri stated. \nPM Modi, will attend the BRICS summit in Kazan this week. Starting from Tuesday, his short, two-day journey comes as a response to the invitation extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a recent statement on Friday, Denis Alipov, who represents Russia as its ambassador to India, teased the possibility of welcoming new entrants into the BRICS assembly. Such an addition could hugely amplify the group\u2019s capacity as an influential frontier, upholding the interests of the Global South. \nAt an online \u2018BRICS 2.0 meet: New Members, New Horizons\u2019, this comment was made looking forward to the soon-to-be-held BRICS convention in Kazan, next week. At the moment, the holding of BRICS\u2019 chair position is in Russia\u2019s hands. This significant alliance brings together the advanced developing economies of the world. Initially, the four original countries were Brazil, Russia, India, and China, hence the name BRIC. South Africa hopped on board in 2010, sparking the change to the currently known name, BRICS. \n(Note: This is a developing story and further details will be added.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Friday rejected the bail and anticipatory bail applications filed by suspended Janata Dal (S) leader Prajwal Revanna, who is accused of rape and sexual assault. The HC also dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking legal action against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged comments against former Hassan MP Prajwal during a Lok Sabha campaign speech in Karnataka earlier this year.\nThe All India Dalit Action Committee had filed the PIL, requesting the court to direct Gandhi to issue an unconditional apology to women for his statements, and disrespecting the Constitution. The petition claimed that Gandhi made the remarks on May 2 during election rallies in Shivamogga and Raichur, just prior to the polls on May 7, 2024.\nThe bench stated that the court must uphold a standard when determining whether a matter qualifies as a public interest issue, noting that not every grievance can be raised in court via a PIL. They acknowledged that Gandhi\u2019s remarks, while potentially controversial, do not meet the criteria for a PIL.\nIn dismissing the case, the court reiterated the importance of careful consideration regarding what constitutes a public interest issue, affirming its discretion in handling such petitions.\nAdditionally, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on the petitioner while dismissing the case.\nThe counsel representing the All India Dalit Action Committee argued that Gandhi\u2019s statements outraged the modesty of women and constituted fabricated accusations against Revanna. They contended that such speeches were damaging in a small town like Hassan, creating mistrust among households.\nThey sought the court to impose a token fine on Gandhi for the supposed misuse of his public position, breach of public trust, and violations of various legal provisions, including the Model Code of Conduct for the 2024 Parliamentary elections and the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\nDuring the hearing, the bench, consisting of Chief Justice N V Anjaria and Justice K V Aravind, indicated that the case did not qualify as a public interest litigation. The court stated, \u201cWe have not said anything on the merits; we are not saying anything on the merits of the speech. We have only said this cannot be the subject matter under public interest litigation,\u201d according to Live Law.",

        "text": "A budget of Rs 10 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Baoli Sahib temple in the Punjab province to address the long-standing demands of the Hindu community in Pakistan. This marks the first phase of reconstruction, 64 years after the temple was rendered dysfunctional.The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a federal body responsible for overseeing minority worship sites in Pakistan, has commenced work on restoring the Baoli Sahib temple, located in Zafarwal town in Narowal, a city along the western bank of the Ravi River. The temple has been out of service since 1960, according to Dawn News.Currently, there is no functional Hindu temple in the entire Narowal district, forcing the local Hindu population to either conduct religious ceremonies at home or travel to temples in Sialkot and Lahore. Ratan Lal Arya, the former president of the Pak Dharamsthan Committee, explained that the temple became non-functional after the ETPB took control of it. The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time. The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million. The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population resides in Sindh province, where they share cultural and linguistic ties with their Muslim neighbors.",

The patrolling arrangement agreement extends beyond the areas along the LAC where there has already been a disengagement of military personnel over the past few years, and include the so far unresolved areas of Demchok and Depsang, sources told The Hindu, indicating that the India-China standoff since April 2020 is now expected to be resolved.\n\nWhile the MEA did not give further details of the agreement, and whether there would be a reversion to the status quo pre-2020, and whether the \u201cbuffer zones\u201d more recently created would continue to exist for patrolling purposes\u201d, Mr. Misri said that the two sides had \u201creached an agreement on the issues that were being discussed\u201d\n\nThe announcement, by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, came amidst a media briefing on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit on Tuesday which he will attend along with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cOver the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums, and as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the line of actual control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists adding that the two sides would now take the \u201cnext steps\u201d on this.\n\nThe timing of the India-China agreement announcement, just a day before the BRICS Summit indicates that a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi on the side-lines, that has been speculated about is now expected to take place. Although the two leaders met as many as 18 times prior to the Galwan clashes in June 2020 , where 20 Indian soldiers were killed, they have spoken only twice since then, on the side-lines of the G-20 summit in Indonesia in 2022, and the BRICS summit in South Africa in 2023.\n\n Mr. Misri did not confirm a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi , he said that government is discussing the scheduling of a number of bilateral meetings in Kazan, the venue of the BRICS summit.\n\n\u201c[BRICS] is a multilateral event, though, of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall program of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings, and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve, as soon as feasible,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists when asked, not denying that a meeting with the Chinese leader was among those.\n\nMr. Misri, who was previously India\u2019s Ambassador to China, and was no doubt, a key part of the recent negotiations, did not give further details of the agreement between both sides. He referred to recent meetings that had led to the breakthrough, which include two meetings between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Chinese FM Wang Yi in June-July, two meetings of the WMCC mechanism of diplomatic and military officials in July-August, followed by a meeting between NSA Ajit Doval and Mr. Wang, who is also the Special Representative on border talks in September. These were followed by intense negotiations of military commanders and MEA officials in the last few weeks. With Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi\u2019s travels to Russia for the BRICS confirmed, a deadline appeared to have emerged for the negotiations to conclude with a result.",

He said the diplomatic and military negotiators from both sides had been in close touch in recent weeks.

The case relates to Kejriwal's remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification.A bench comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy and SVN Bhatti stated that the court was not inclined to interfere with the matter, especially since a similar plea by co-accused AAP leader Sanjay Singh was dismissed on April 8, 2024.Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s counsel argued that the defamation case lacked merit, claiming that the complaint was filed by the Gujarat University registrar, who was not directly mentioned in Kejriwal\u2019s remarks.

        "title": "Remarks on PM's degree: Kejriwal faces defamation trial in Gujarat as SC upholds summons",
        "text": "New Delhi: Former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal is facing criminal proceedings in a defamation case over his alleged remarks over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification after the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed his plea to quash summons. A Gujarat Metropolitan court had summoned Kejriwal and AAP's Sanjay Singh in the defamation case over their alleged \"sarcastic\" and \"derogatory\" statements related to PM Modi's educational degrees. Gujarat University Registrar Piyush Patel had filed the defamation case against the politicians over their alleged comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the chief information commissioner (CIC) for providing information about Modi's degrees under the Right to Information Act. A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S V N Bhatti noted that a separate bench of the apex court had junked the plea filed by AAP leader Sanjay Singh on April 8 in the same case, who is a co-accused in the case. \"We must have a consistent approach. Having regard to that view, we would not like to entertain the present plea. The same is dismissed,\" said the bench. The top court, however, said all contentions were left open to be decided in the trial and it was expressing no opinion on the merits of the case. Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, submitted Patel was not an aggrieved party in the matter. \"If at all the statement was defamatory, it is for Modi to file a criminal defamation case and not for the Gujarat University registrar,\" he said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the University, said a separate bench of the apex court had already dismissed Singh's petition on April 8. Mehta said the degree had been uploaded on the university website and referred to the dismissal of the CIC order by the Gujarat High Court. Arguing that no case of defamation was made out, Singhvi stated that Kejriwal merely asked why the university was not publishing Modi's degree. The bench, however, rejected Kejriwal's plea. The high court had on February 16 dismissed the pleas by Singh and Kejriwal seeking quashing of the summons issued against them in the defamation case. Both had challenged in the high court the summons issued by a trial court in the case filed by the Gujarat University and the subsequent order of the sessions court dismissing their revision pleas against the summons. According to the complainant, the two politicians made \"defamatory\" statements at press conferences and on microblogging platform X, targeting the university over Modi's degrees. Their comments against the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the institution, which has established its name among the public, he alleged. \"Their statements were sarcastic and intentionally made to hurt the prestige of the university,\" he added. On March 31, 2023, the high court quashed the 2016 order of the CIC asking Gujarat University to provide information on Modi's degrees to Kejriwal, and observed the AAP chief's RTI plea appeared to be \"politically vexatious and motivated\" instead of being based on \"sound public interest considerations\".",

We have concluded that there are two areas we can explore - 1) Amendment to Aircraft Security Rules... one of the ideas we wish to implement through these rule changes is that once we apprehend the perpetrator behind these threats, we aim to place them on the no-fly list... 2) Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Civil Aviation Act... Naidu explained.Bomb threats cripples Indian aviationOn Sunday alone, more than 20 flights from IndiGo, Akasa Air, and Vistara were disrupted by bomb threats.This led to a meeting between BCAS officials and airline CEOs, as the threats continue to cause alarm and necessitate extensive security checks.Additionally, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and BCAS Director General Zulfiquar Hasan met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan on Monday to discuss the recent surge in hoax calls.During the half-hour meeting at the Home Ministry, both director generals briefed the home secretary on the recent wave of hoax bomb threats, which have caused widespread panic and prompted exhaustive security measures by Indian aviation authorities, intelligence agencies, and other departments.",

The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary by-election.\n\n\"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.\n\nCongress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said.\n\nWith the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.\n\nSoon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate for the seat in Kerala.\n\nWith the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.\n\nDays after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.\n\nIf elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.\n\nThe EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies.\n\nThe bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.\n\nSince her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.\n\nHowever, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nShe emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year.\n\nAfter her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both constituencies.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

But this would not suffice. The veil of morality has been lifted just for the election time. After polls, such goons will be inducted again,\" Sule tweeted on X.Lankesh was shot dead outside her home in Bengaluru on September 5, 2017.A probe by police in Karnataka with assistance from agencies in Maharashtra led to the arrest of several persons.Pangarkar, a Jalna municipal councilor of the undivided Shiv Sena between 2001 and 2006, was arrested in August 2018. The Karnataka High Court granted him bail on September 4 this year.Maharashtra assembly polls will be held on November 20 and votes will be counted on November 23.",

        "text": "Tata Consumer Products, one of the leading FMCG majors in India, witnessed its share prices tumble nearly 10% in yesterday's trading after reporting lackluster financial results for the second quarter of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe company's revenues from operations grew by a modest 13% to Rs. 4,214.5 crores compared to the same period last year. However, operating margins declined by 30 basis points to 14.9% due to rising input costs. Net profits increased by 6% to Rs. 359 crores year-on-year, but fell short of street expectations.\n\nWeak demand, especially in the urban markets, impacted the volume growth for Tata Consumer during the quarter. The tea business, which contributes over half of total revenues, registered muted sales. Rising inflation has also constrained discretionary spending by consumers.\n\nCommenting on the results, analysts at Elara Securities highlighted the competitive pressures in the FMCG sector and slowing demand trends in urban regions as near-term headwinds. Although they remain optimistic about the company's diverse portfolio and broader growth prospects, earnings estimates for the next two fiscal years have been cut to factor in the pressure on revenues and margins.\n\nWhile Tata Consumer looks well-positioned in the long run with its brands and distribution expansion plans, investors seem concerned about the soft demand environment squeezing profits in the immediate quarters. The company will need to efficiently manage costs and urgently revive volume growth in key categories to allay such concerns. For now, uncertainty over the macroeconomic outlook continues to impact sentiment around fast moving consumer goods players.",

With that we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia.\n\n\"There are areas which for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020,\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nThe External Affairs Minister said the LAC breakthrough is a good development that happened due to \"patient and persevering diplomacy\".\n\nREAD | India To Resume Patrolling In Ladakh After Big Breakthrough With China\n\n\"... At various points of time people almost gave up. We have always maintained on the one hand we obviously had to do counter deployment, and we have been negotiating since September 2020. It has been a very patient process, though more complicated than how it should have been,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV.\n\n\"The important thing is if we have reached an understanding, I think what it does is it creates a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border, which were there before 2020. That was a major concern. If there is no peace and tranquillity, how can other areas of bilateral ties improve?\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nWhile he agreed people may speculate on the LAC development, the External Affairs Minister said he would use \"caution\" in responding on whether this positive development would spread to trade ties.\n\n\"It (LAC breakthrough) has just happened. I would not go so fast at the moment,\" Mr Jaishankar said, referring to trade.\n\nThe last meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs was held on August 29 in Beijing. The two sides then had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the LAC to narrow down differences and find early resolution of outstanding issues.\n\nIt was agreed that restoration of peace and tranquillity, and respect for the LAC are the essential basis for restoration of normalcy in bilateral relations.\n\nEarlier this month, Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had said the two sides have resolved the \"low-hanging fruits\" and now need to address difficult situations, adding there was \"positive signalling\" from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries.\n\nIndian and Chinese military commanders too had been meeting regularly seeking complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh as an essential basis for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.\n\nSome areas still remained to be de-escalated after Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from Gogra-Hot Springs in Ladakh in September 2022. The Chinese forces in this area had returned to pre-2020 positions. Even then, Chinese soldiers were still believed to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north in the Depsang plains.\n\nFierce clashes between soldiers of both sides took place in eastern Ladakh's Galwan in June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action. Over 40 Chinese soldiers were killed or injured.",

The most recent meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs took place on August 29 in Beijing. Both sides engaged in a frank and constructive exchange of views regarding the situation along the LAC. The purpose was to bridge differences and expedite the resolution of outstanding issues. It was agreed that restoring peace and tranquillity, as well as respecting the LAC, are essential for normalising bilateral relations. Indian and Chinese military leaders have been meeting regularly to pursue complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, viewing this as crucial for restoring peace and tranquillity in the border regions.\n\nIndia and China relations became tense following the violent border clashes in 2020 in Eastern Ladakh, resulting in the death of about 20 Indian soldiers and more than 20 fatalities in the Chinese PLA. Despite several rounds of talks at the military and diplomatic levels, a solution had remained elusive so far.",

Shivakumar said on Monday that about 80 per cent of the workers are demanding the candidacy of former MP and his younger brother D.K.

Manjunath by more than two lakh votes. Manjunath had contested Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket. Suresh worked hard but we still lost by a huge margin. Had we lost by a smaller margin, we could have improved our performance. We lost the Lok Sabha badly,\u201d said the Deputy Chief Minister. \n\nHe added that if we start to think that JD-S is weak, then \u201cwe will be the biggest fools\u201d. \n\n\u201cWe have discussed and gathered opinions of the ministers. Instead of a meeting of the election committee, we have discussed with the election in-charges. The decision on the party\u2019s candidates has been made. We will submit the proposal to Delhi, and they will make the final decision.\u201d \n\nCommenting on allegations by Union Minister Kumaraswamy that Congress leaders were in contact with BJP MLC and ticket aspirant for Channapatna, C.P. Yogeshwar, he said, \u201cI have not met or spoken to Yogeshwar. There has been no meeting or discussion between us.\u201d\n\nHe added that Yogeshwar is a sitting member of the Legislative Council and since the MLA position from Channapatna became vacant, Congress has been working to organise the workers. \n\nOn the alleged rift between BJP and JD-S, the Deputy Chief Minister said that he is not aware of any conflicts between them and the media has not reported anything about it.\n\n\u201cChannapatna is naturally a JD-S stronghold. Kumaraswamy was the sitting member. But media reports suggest he is surrendering the segment to the BJP. If he gives up this area, it will lead to the party losing its existence,\u201d the Deputy Chief Minister claimed. \n\nHe added that Suresh has worked hard and the Congress is confident of winning the Channapatna Assembly seat. \n\nOn heavy rains in Bengaluru, the Deputy Chief Minister said that many people have built houses in low-lying areas, and when heavy rain occurs, water inundates those houses. \n\n\u201cWe need to find long-term solutions for the areas where water stagnates and problems arise. We are moving towards forming a committee for this,\u201d the Deputy Chief Minister claimed.\n\nHe added that the citizens should also provide information about which areas are facing such problems. \n\n\u201cI have discussed this with the chief engineer and have been in touch with the BBMP control room since last night and received information. I was planning to visit some areas this morning, but the BBMP officials are currently engaged in relief work in some areas, so we should not obstruct their efforts,\u201d he claimed.",

One star who is most likely to be not picked for the Tour of Australia is Cheteshwar Pujara. The veteran batter, known for his dogged resistance in the face of strong challenge, has a proven record in Australia. The 36-year old has been overlooked from international matches, and the last match he played for India was in June, 2023.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Pujara has now surpassed the great Brian Lara's tally of 65 first-clas tons with a century for Saurashtra against Chhattisgarh in a Ranjji Trophy match. Pujara has 66 tons now. He also went past the 21000-mark in first-class run tally. Regarding his absence, Australia star Pat Cummins said: \"It comes down to who wants to outlast each other, which I quite like that aspect of Test cricket. It's going to be a shame that he is not there, but I'm sure they'll pick someone else who's in a similar kind of style.\"\"It was always great playing (against) Pujara. He was one of those guys who never really felt like he was getting away from you. But then he would (just) bat, bat, bat and bat. I really enjoyed the contest against him. Some days he won, other days I won. It's going to have a bit of a different feel without him. Pujara is a great player.\" He also said that the India vs Australia rivalry is now at par with Ashes. I do think it is. Particularly, after the Indian team won the last couple of series at (our) home. We've had more success against England over the past decade. I think it's right up there,\" he said.\"You know when you play against India, you've got a few Indian fans that are watching. It's a slightly different rivalry to England-Australia rivalry. But again, now having a five-Test match series, it does mirror the Ashes series very closely,\" he said.",

The cabinet, dubbed the \u201cRed and White Cabinet\u201d after Indonesia's national colors, dwarfs the 34-member team under predecessor Joko Widodo.\n\nSubianto, who was sworn in as Indonesia's eighth president last week, stated the cabinet's large size was necessary to create a \u201cstrong government\u201d that could unite the diverse nation and represent its many political voices. Analysts noted it allows him to reward the seven-party coalition that backed his election victory in February. Several ministers from Widodo's cabinet were also retained.\n\nA key reason for the cabinet's enormity appears to be Subianto's stated goal of accelerating Indonesia's economic growth to 8% annually through ambitious spending plans. These include salary hikes for civil servants, free school meals for 83 million children, and defense budget increases. To implement such broad programs, a huge team of ministers will be required.\n\nSome familiar faces staying on include respected Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the first person to hold the post under three separate presidencies. Other returnees are the ministers of trade, energy, state firms and interior. Indrawati's stewardship of the economy through various crises has made her a key stabilizing presence.\n\nInterestingly, Subianto had been a political rival of Widodo for years but did not contest his 2019 reelection defeat, even serving as his defense chief later. This paved the way for the unlikely alliance that saw Widodo tacitly endorse Subianto's recent candidacy. With his new giant cabinet, Indonesia's new leader is clearly ambitious in scale \u2013 whether this gamble to leverage broad coalition support pays off remains to be seen.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea of Arvind Kejriwal challenging the Gujarat High Court order refusing to quash summons sent to him in a criminal defamation case by Gujarat University over his comments in connection with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s degree.A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and SVN Bhatti said that a similar plea filed by AAP leader Sanjay Singh had been dismissed by the apex court earlier.\u201cWe must have a consistent approach,\u201d the bench said while refusing to entertain Kejriwal\u2019s plea.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the former Delhi Chief Minister, told the bench that there was no statement made against the University and hence, it could not have filed any defamation complaint.Seeking disclosure of the degree of persons in public life cannot lead to a defamation action, he added.Gujarat University Registrar Piyush Patel had filed a defamation case against Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh over their alleged comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the Chief Information Commissioner for providing information about the Prime Minister\u2019s degrees to them under the RTI Act.Earlier this year, the High Court had declined to quash the summons issued to Kejriwal in the defamation case.Challenging the order, Kejriwal approached the apex court seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings.A Gujarat Metropolitan court had summoned Kejriwal and Singh in the defamation case over their \u201csarcastic and derogatory\u201d statements in connection with Modi\u2019s degree. Later, they filed a revision application in the Sessions court challenging the Metropolitan court\u2019s summons in the case. However, the Sessions court had declined their plea for an interim stay on trial, after which they approached the Gujarat High Court. According to the University, AAP leaders\u2019 comments targeting the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the university which has established its name among the public.Earlier, the Gujarat High Court had quashed a 2016 order of the Central Information Commission which directed the Gujarat University to provide information on Modi\u2019s degree to Kejriwal",

        "text": "Early results from Sunday\u2019s referendum in Moldova show that citizens are backing the country\u2019s aspirations to integrate with the European Union. With nearly all votes counted, around 50% of Moldovans voted \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether to amend the constitution to state that the nation\u2019s strategic goal is to join the EU.\n\nThis positive outcome puts Moldova on a path towards eventually applying for EU membership, a significant step considering the country\u2019s complex geopolitical situation. Nestled between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova has faced political influence from neighboring Russia for decades. However, the referendum results indicate that many Moldovans now favor deeper links with the West instead.\n\nThe referendum took place alongside a tightly contested presidential election, where pro-EU incumbent Maia Sandu claimed victory in the first round over her main challenger. Sandu had strongly advocated for the \u201cyes\u201d vote, and her continued presidency will help maintain Moldova\u2019s westward direction. However, the referendum passed with only a narrow margin, highlighting the country\u2019s internal divisions on this challenging foreign policy issue.\n\nAllegations of electoral meddling and voter intimidation marred the democratic process. Fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor was accused of trying to \u201cbuy\u201d hundreds of thousands of votes against the referendum through social media propaganda and illicit payments. The close call in favor of integration with the EU suggests Moldova\u2019s path towards the bloc will be long and difficult, requiring ongoing commitment to democratic reforms and weakening of Russian influence.",

Will take decisions in phases to cooperate with the police department and will clear all those bills, said Naidu during his speech as part of the Police Commemoration Day.Noting that investing in the police department is akin to investing in the state, the CM said he always gave importance to and cooperated with it.According to Naidu, the state government has already cleared pending bills worth Rs 100 crore of the department within 125 days of coming to power.Emphasising on the need for providing latest technologies to the police department, Naidu said policemen cannot fight criminals with old fashioned technological tools.Only when we have an upper hand over criminals in terms of surveillance and technology, can we control them, said Naidu, promising to improve and bring advanced technology.He accused the previous YSRCP government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of using the police department as a tool for political harassment.Slamming Reddy, the TDP supremo said the former could not release Rs 700 crore to the police department but allegedly splurged Rs 700 crore on survey stones, which bore the former CM's images.Assuring importance to police welfare, the CM promised to commit at least Rs 20 crore every year and also build a facility at Amaravati to observe the next Police Commemoration Day from there.I pay my tributes to police who died on duty. I assure you that I will always stand by the police who do justice and respect officials, Naidu added.",

The All India Dalit Action Committee has filed a petition against Rahul Gandhi.\n\n\"We are not talking about the merit and eligibility of Rahul Gandhi's speech. The subject should not be a matter under the Public Interest Litigation,\" the bench opined while passing the order dismissing the petition.\n\nRahul Gandhi during the Lok Sabha election campaign while delivering the speech made alleged objectionable remarks. Addressing a huge gathering referring to the sensational sex video scam, he stated that \"Prajwal Revanna is a mass rapist\" and further alleged that \"Prajwal Revanna has raped 400 women\".\n\nThe Dalit Action Committee has filed a petition against Rahul Gandhi that he had humiliated and hurt the dignity of women from the Hassan district. The committee had also claimed that the statement was unconstitutional.\n\nIt was alleged that the speeches were made by Rahul Gandhi at Shivamogga and Raichur on May 2 which went to polls on May 7.\n\nChi Na Ramu, who is national president of the All India Dalit Action Committee, alleged that until now no proof of any rape had been found, nor were any complaints made by the women about what Rahul Gandhi had claimed.\n\nChi Na Ramu asked for action to be taken against Rahul Gandhi as per law and demanded that Rahul Gandhi should apologise for making the statement about 400 mass rapes.\n\nThe counsel had argued that Hassan was a small city and people were affected by the \"hate speech\".\n\n\"Every household is doubting the other household now,' the counsel observed.\n\nThe PIL sought legal action against Rahul Gandhi for alleged \"hate speech\" resulting in outraging the modesty of women and showing \"disrespect\" to the Constitution.\n\nThe petition also sought Rahul Gandhi to issue an unconditional apology to the women of Hassan for issuing unconstitutional remarks and also it demanded that token costs on Rahul Gandhi for gross misuse of public post breach of public trust and Constitutional provisions.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The people of Delhi want to know the reason behind this, and I tell them, the real reason is the dirty politics of the BJP. Everyone is aware that stubble burning is a major contributor to rising pollution levels in Delhi during winter. The AAP government in Punjab has significantly reduced stubble burning over the past two years. According to the Centre's statistics, incidents of stubble burning have been halved since the AAP took charge in Punjab. In contrast, if you look at Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, stubble burning has increased,\" she told the media.\n\n\"If the Punjab government can reduce stubble burning, why can't the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana do the same? In Delhi, we have only CNG and electric buses, whereas 100% of the interstate buses coming from UP and Haryana are diesel-powered. Why can't the governments of Haryana and UP introduce electric buses? It's because they want to play dirty politics with the people of Delhi. While Delhi has no brick kilns, there are 3,800 brick kilns in the NCR region, contributing significantly to pollution levels in the capital,\" the Chief Minister added.\n\nOn the water pollution in Yamuna, she said, \"BJP leaders have been visiting Kalindi Kunj for photoshoots, but the real cause of the toxic foam in the Yamuna is industrial waste being dumped into the river by factories in Haryana. The UP government also contributes to the problem by releasing polluted water into the Yamuna.\"\n\nOver the past several winters, Delhiites have gasped for breath as stubble burning in neighbouring states, among other causes, has pushed up air pollution in the capital. With election in the city due in February, air pollution has now emerged as a key talking point.\n\nIn power for 10 years, AAP is pushing hard for a third term. AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, now out on bail after he was arrested in a corruption case linked to Delhi's now-scrapped liquor policy, stepped down as Chief Minister last month and said he would return to the top office only after the \"people's court\" elects him again. Senior party leader Atishi took over the job after Mr Kejriwal's exit.",

        "text": "Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court on Monday rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) petition demanding that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi apologise for allegedly tarnishing the dignity of Indian women.The PIL stemmed from a claim that Gandhi had falsely accused former Janata Dal (Secular) MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of rape and sexual abuse, of \u201craping 400 women and filming the act,\u201d describing it as \u201cmass rape\u201d and not a sex scandal.A bench comprising Chief Justice NV Anjaria and Justice K Aravind dismissed the petition, stating that it was a waste of judicial time.The Court also imposed a Rs 25,000 fine on the petitioner, the All India Dalit Action Committee, for filing the plea.The petitioner's counsel argued that Gandhi's remarks, made during a public speech, were highly irresponsible and offensive, particularly to the women of Hassan. He pleaded the Court to issue a notice to Gandhi, compelling him to respond to the allegations.\u201cGandhi is a serial offender,\u201d the counsel contended, referencing past statements made by Gandhi, including comments regarding individuals with the surname Modi.'The petitioner also cited Gandhi's alleged citizenship issues, which are pending before the Delhi High Court, as further evidence of his misconduct.However, the Karnataka HC found no merit in the petition and dismissed it along with a fine.The petitioner's counsel sought waiver of the fine and argued that he should not be penalized for taking rightful action.The PIL highlighted that Gandhi's allegations, made without evidence, misled the public and disrespected the modesty of Indian women, particularly in light of the provisions under the new Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita.The plea argued that Gandhi's statement amounted to hate speech and promoted gender-based hatred. It also sought a directive from the court requiring Gandhi to issue a public apology and called for the National Commission for Women to take appropriate action against him.Despite the petitioner's appeal, the Court concluded that the matter did not warrant further consideration.",

However, some of the party leaders in the district unit of the AGP revolted against the decision while the district president also resigned from his post.\n\nThese developments caused the AGP leadership to delay the announcement of the name of Choudhury as the party candidate. However, according to sources, Phani Bhusan Choudhury was insistent on his wife getting a ticket for the Assembly bypolls and the top leaders decided to field Diptimoy Choudhury in Bongaigaon.\n\nMeanwhile, the Barpeta Lok Sabha MP said that the people of Bongaigaon wanted his wife to contest the elections. \u201cThis is the only reason why she was chosen as a party candidate here,\u201d he said.\n\nChoudhury will take on the Congress party\u2019s nominee Brajenjit Sinha in the Bongaigaon Assembly seat.\n\nBy-elections in five assembly constituencies\u2014Dholai, Samaguri, Behali, Bongaigaon, and Sidli became imminent following the elections of five legislators in the lower house of the parliament in this year\u2019s Lok Sabha polls.\n\nApart from Sinha, the Congress has given party tickets to Dhrubajyoti Purakayastha in Dholai, Sanjib Warle in the Sidli seat, and Tanzil Hussain in the Samaguri Assembly constituency.\n\nThe Dholai Assembly constituency is reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) community and the Sidli seat is reserved for the Scheduled Tribe (ST).",

Among the southern states, only Karnataka could see a measurable increase - from 28 seats to 36 - in representation in the Lower House.\n\nTamil Nadu's Lok Sabha share will likely only inch up - from 39 to 41, a five per cent increase, and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana may be given only three extra seats each.\n\nNDTV Explains | What India Will Look Like After 2026 Delimitation\n\nAnd Kerala - the state that has best controlled population growth, a critical factor as the country and world battles climate change, unemployment, and resource scarcity - could lose one of its 20 seats.\n\nThe opposition has been fiercely critical about the marked disparity between possible revised Lok Sabha representation for the northern states - a majority of which voted for the BJP in the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections - and for those in the south.\n\nAnd Mr Stalin's government has been among the most vocal in this regard.\n\nTamil Nadu's Anti-Delimitation Move\n\nIn February Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK adopted a resolution against the proposed delimitation, arguing that states that have best controlled population levels ought not to be penalised.\n\nREAD | In Tamil Nadu Assembly, A Challenge To Delimitation Exercise\n\nConversely, the DMK said, states that had failed to do so should not be rewarded.\n\nChandrababu Naidu's Remark\n\nMr Stalin's comment - in jest, yes, but with a definite edge - came shortly after his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, Chandrababu Naidu, also 'advised' people to have more children.\n\nMr Naidu's comment, however, was in the context of an aging state population.\n\nHe warned that a disproportionate number of elderly people could affect the state's finances and offered Japan as an example. \"In many villages, only elderly people remain... as the young have migrated to cities or overseas,\" he said, adding his government would pass laws in this regard.\n\nCentre Says...\n\nThe Narendra Modi government will be considerate of the fact southern states have, on average, controlled population better than the north, sources told NDTV in September last year. Fears southern states will be penalised by their Lok Sabha seats being affected, will be allayed, sources said.\n\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

        "text": "The time, date, and venue of Sunday\u2019s blast at a CRPF school in Rohini\u2019s Prashant Vihar area was selected to cause minimum damage, top intelligence sources have told CNN-News18 even as agencies look for clues to understand the motive behind the incident.\n\u201cPost-facto claims have become the norm and we are verifying those. There were no clues available from the spot and analysis is going on,\u201d they said.\nThe sources added: \u201cThe place is insignificant in terms of being picked as a target for a bomb blast. This is a busy area in terms of car parking and residential locality but the logistics ensured that no damage occurred. What is most surprising is that no bomb blast material is available and neither was any device found. In this case, it becomes a crude bomb.\u201d\nCrude bomb is used in Bengal and other parts of India, sources said, adding that they had never been used in the national capital.\n\u201cThe CCTV footage examination is crucial. There is no clue in CCTVs so far as no one is seen going closer to the spot where the blast took place.\u201d\nOn Monday, Delhi Police said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to the blast. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform.\nThe purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents. The claim was made by Justice League India using a clip of the blast with a \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d watermark at the bottom, and circulated on social media platforms.\nThe blast, which destroyed a portion of the school wall, window panes of nearby shops, and damaged a few cars parked nearby, was captured in a CCTV camera. Police suspect that the bomb might have been placed late at night as local residents said it went off between 7.35 am and 7.40 am.\nThe sound of the blast was heard several hundred metres away. Videos from the spot showed thick plumes rising from the site. Residents called the explosion \u201cintense\u201d and reported a foul smell in the area.\nPolice have filed a case under sections of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on charges of \u201cmischief through explosion\u201d and under the Explosives Act.",

        "text": "The newly elected members of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly were administered oath on Monday (October 21, 2024) by Pro-tem Speaker Mubarak Gul, with Chief Minister Omar Abdullah taking the pledge in the Kashmiri language.\n\nThe Chief Minister won both the Budgam and Ganderbal Assembly constituencies in the recently held elections. He vacated the Budgam seat and retained the Ganderbal constituency, the pro-tem speaker announced in the House on Monday. The Ganderbal seat is considered an Abdullah family stronghold.\n\nThe 54-year-old leader was an MLA from Ganderbal from 2009 to 2014 during his first tenure as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nWith this, the strength of the National Conference in the 95-member House has been reduced to 41 but the party still enjoys a comfortable majority with the support of six Congress MLA, five Independents and one MLA each of the AAP and the CPI(M). The BJP with 29 seats is the second-largest party - its best-ever performance in J&K.\n\nOmar takes pledge in Kashmiri\n\nOmar Abdullah, son of Farooq Abdullah and his British wife Mollie Abdullah, had often faced criticism for not being able to speak his native language.\n\nWhile the third generation politician from the Abdullah family is fluent in English, his fluency in vernaculars like Hindi, Urdu and Kashmiri was poor at the start of his political career in the late 1990s.\n\nHowever, during his first tenure as Chief Minister from 2009 to 2014, Mr. Omar Abdullah took lessons to improve his speaking skills in these three languages. And on Monday, he took the oath as MLA in Kashmiri.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Surinder Kumar Choudhary took oath in English.\n\nThe oath-taking ceremony of the MLAs marks an end to the six-year-long legislative hiatus.\n\nThere are 51 first-time members including BJP MLA from Kishtwar Shagun Parihar, who is the youngest member at 29. The NC veteran and MLA from Chrar-e-Sharief, Abdul Rahim Rather, is the oldest at 80.\n\nMr. Rather and party colleague Ali Mohammad Sagar (MLA Khanyar) have been elected to the Assembly for a record seven terms. While Mr. Sagar has been a member of the Legislative Assembly since 1983, Mr. Rather started his long stint as a legislator in 1977. However, the former finance minister lost the 2014 Assembly elections.",

The EU condemned the violence, demanding an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation. \u201cIn a democracy, there is no place for politically motivated killings,\u201d the EU's diplomatic service stated, adding that its election observers are still assessing the electoral process. As of now, Frelimo leads in all 11 provinces, with Daniel Chapo expected to win the 9 October election, despite external observers raising concerns about the poll's integrity due to reports of vote-buying and intimidation. Full results are due on 24 October, but fears mount that Monday\u2019s protests could turn violent, given the history of police brutality against political dissent. The city of Maputo resembled a ghost town, with shops closed and helicopters hovering above, as the nation awaits official presidential and parliamentary results.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed that secularism has long been regarded as an integral part of the Constitution's basic structure. The top court made the statement orally while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the removal of the terms 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Preamble to the Constitution.\"You don't want India to be secular?\" Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked, while hearing the plea alongside Justice Sanjay Kumar. The Supreme Court bench said that the term 'socialism' should not necessarily be interpreted in the western context and the term can also mean that there has to be an equal opportunity for all. \"There are a number of judgments of this court which hold that Secularism was always part of the basic structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and word fraternity used in the Constitution as well as the rights under Part III, there is a clear indication that secular has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,\" Live Law quoted Justice Khanna as saying. Khanna also pointed out that, unlike the French model of secularism, India adopted a new model of secularism.The plea, filed by senior BJP leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy and one Balram Singh, challenged the 42nd amendment to the Indian Constitution that was made by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi-led government during the Emergency.Responding to the top court judge, Advocate Jain said, \"We are not saying that India is not secular, we are challenging the amendment\". Jain further argued that Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar had opined that the inclusion of the word 'socialism' would curtail personal liberty.In response, Justice Khanna said, \"Socialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of country should be distributed equally. Let's not take the Western meaning\".It was also argued by the petitioner that the Preamble of the Constitution, as it stood on November 26, 1949, was a definitive declaration, contending that any subsequent amendment adding words such as 'socialist\" and 'secular' was arbitrary, according to Live Law.To this, Justice Khanna highlighted that the words introduced by the 1976 amendment were clearly indicated by brackets, making it evident that they were additions. Khanna also pointed out that terms such as 'unity' and 'integrity' of the nation were also incorporated through this amendment.The bench then agreed to examine the issue in detail and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Oct 21, 2024ALSO READ | Supreme Court dismisses Arvind Kejriwal's plea in case over remark on PM's degreeALSO READ | Supreme Court junks plea to replace 'Hindutva' with 'Indian constitutionalism",

        "text": "In Madhya Pradesh, a significant debate has emerged regarding the use of loudspeakers in temples, ignited by a recent social media post from IAS officer Shailbala Martin. The 2009-batch officer, currently serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department, raised pertinent questions that garnered widespread attention.\nWho Is Shailbala Martin?\nShailbala Martin, originally from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, was born on April 9, 1965. According to the state government website, she began her career in the State Civil Service (SCS) before being promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) on June 12, 2017. With a BA and an MA in Arts from Holkar Science College in Indore, Martin joined the State Civil Service in 2009.\nThroughout her career, Martin has held various positions, including roles in the Health Department in 2014, Municipal Commissioner of Burhanpur in 2019, and Collector of Niwari district the same year. Since January 25, 2022, she has been serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department.\nThe Loudspeaker Controversy\nThe recent controversy can be traced back to guidelines issued by the state government last year to mitigate noise pollution, which specifically aimed to regulate loudspeakers in religious venues. A journalist on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) questioned the disparity in enforcement, focusing on the use of loudspeakers in mosques and the prevalence of DJs playing music outside these spaces.\nIn response, Martin highlighted the noise pollution caused by loudspeakers in temples, questioning why such disturbances, which can be heard several streets away and continue late into the night, are often overlooked. Her tweet sparked a mix of reactions, with some users supporting her stance while others criticised her for raising the issue.",

        "text": "Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra on Monday (October 21, 2024) ruled out the possibility of an alliance with any regional party for the upcoming bypolls to seven assembly seats.\n\nTalking to reporters after a meeting of the Congress Coordination Committee, Mr. Dotasra said the State unit has made panels of probable candidates for the seven seats and the final announcement will be made by the party's high command in Delhi.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha election held this year, the Congress entered into an alliance with the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) for the Nagaur seat and with the CPI(M) for the Sikar seat.\n\nRLP convener Hanuman Beniwal, who had won the Khinvsar assembly seat in Nagaur district in last year's assembly election, emerged victorious from the Nagaur parliamentary constituency this year. As a result, the Khinsvar assembly seat fell vacant.\n\nThere was speculation about a Congress-RLP alliance for the bypoll to the Khinvsar seat but Mr. Dotasra said the Congress' State unit was not looking for a tie-up.\n\nHe said the Congress' Rajasthan in-charge Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa would take the panels for all seven seats to Delhi and candidates would be declared after a discussion with the high command.\n\nDungarpur's Chorasi assembly seat fell vacant after Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) MLA Rajkumar Roat won the Lok Sabha election from the Banswara-Dungarpur district.\n\nThe Congress did not announce any alliance with the BAP in the general election but asked its candidate to withdraw their nominations from the Banswara-Dungarpur constituency. The move was aimed at supporting the BAP.\n\n\"There are no talks of alliance with any party in the assembly bypolls in Rajasthan. We have prepared panels for all seven seats in the meeting today,\" Mr. Dotasra said.\n\nHe also exuded confidence that the party would win all seven assembly seats.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Assembly Tikaram Jully, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, former assembly Speaker CP Joshi and other party leaders attended the meeting chaired by Randhawa.\n\nVoting on seven assembly seats -- Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Deoli-Uniara, Khinvsar, Chorasi, Salumbar and Ramgarh -- will be held on November 13 and the results will be declared on November 23.\n\nBypolls on two seats are being held due to the death of the MLAs -- Congress's Zubair Khan from Ramgarh and BJP's Amritlal Meena from Salumbar.\n\nIn the other five constituencies, the MLAs were elected as MPs, necessitating the bypolls.\n\nCongress MLAs Brijendra Ola (Jhunjhunu), Harish Chandra Meena (Deoli-Uniara) and Murari Lal Meena (Dasau) were elected as MPs in the Lok Sabha election. The other two are Beniwal and Roat.\n\nFour of the seven seats where bypolls will be held were with the Congress, while the BJP, BAP and the RLP held one each.\n\nThe BJP has declared candidates for all seats except Chorasi.\n\nThe BAP has already declared its candidate for the Chorasi seat.\n\nCurrently, the 200-seat state assembly has 114 MLAs of the BJP, 65 of the Congress, three of the BAP, two of the BSP, one of the Rashtriya Lok Dal and eight Independents.",

It's mind-boggling - you are one nation but you are speaking different languages and even the written languages are different. The first thing he (PM Modi) did was unify the tax system. This is an incredible accomplishment. This is something that probably would have taken a century.\"The investor said India's diversity results in incredible creativity and the future belongs to those who are creative.\"I definitely think India is going to become a leader or the leader in semiconductor production in the future. One reason I say that is the demand - you have got a market here that is one of the biggest in the world. Secondly, it is a relatively open economy, so you are going to be able to take technology from Taiwan, China, the United States, wherever. Thirdly, you have got an incredible software industry already, you are the largest exporter of software in the world,\" Mr Mobius said, adding that many large semiconductor companies already have software bases in India.The investor said semiconductor fabrication will happen in India because the country has the labour force. \"I remember I was meeting an Indian friend of mine a few years ago and I said India will become a big semiconductor manufacturer. He said Indians are not as patient and not so good with small things like the Chinese are and I asked him if he had seen the places where they are polishing these tiny diamonds in India. They will do a very good job here, no questions about it. But it will require a huge amount of capital,\" he added.In terms of return on capital, it's \"India, China and the US\", Mr Mobius said, adding that India still presents plenty of opportunities despite stock prices climbing. As the conversation moved to lighter topics, the investor said he likes the 'Baahubali' movies and also had a picture taken with a statue of the villain from the movies in Hyderabad. &nbsp",

What came instead was the pronouncement of his death \u2013 Shashi Abrol had been killed in a terror attack in Kashmir's Ganderbal district.\n\nNews of his death came late on Sunday night, long after the moon had risen, the sight millions of Hindu women look out for to break their daylong fast on the day. Fate could not have dealt Ruchi Abrol a crueller blow.\nShashi Abrol, an architectural designer, was among the seven people killed when terrorists attacked a tunnel construction site on the Srinagar-Leh national highway on Sunday.\nThe attack took place when the team had returned from work to their camp late in the evening. The morning after, his wife held on to their three-year-old daughter, angry, anguished and bewildered at the same time. The couple also has a son studying engineering.\n\u201cI spoke to him in the evening. He didn't mention any threats. I was going to the temple as part of my Karwa Chauth fast, and we had a brief conversation. I tried calling him after I returned but he didn't pick up. After that, his phone was switched off,\u201d a sobbing Ruchi told PTI.\n\u201cI waited for his call but had no idea about the attack,\u201d she added at her home in Jammu's Talab Tillo area, her mother-in-law by her side.\nNo one told them what had happened until late at night. And then too, it came through the media, the family said.\nRuchi was refusing to break her fast, said her sister-in-law Divya.\n\u201cHer life is shattered. The festival of Karwa Chauth has turned into a day of catastrophe for us. Our dear Shashi Ji was killed in a cowardly act by terrorists,\u201d she said.\nAnxiety mounted as the hours passed by.\nRuchi had completed her rituals and was waiting for a video call from her husband, everyone unaware of the magnitude of the tragedy that had befallen them.\n\u201cWe tried to comfort Ruchi as we grew worried when his phone switched off late at night. We only learned about his death through the media, which shocked us all,\u201d Divya said.\nShashi was the family's sole breadwinner.\n\u201cWhat have they gained from this? How will she feed her children now? We curse them,\u201d she said.\nShashi, who had been working for the construction company APCO in Sonamarg for the past six years, had last come home two months ago during his son's college admission.\n\u201cHis aim was to see his son as a bright engineer,\u201d Divya said.\nAs news of Shashi's death spread, hundreds of neighbours, relatives and others visited the family home to offer their condolences.\nThe family criticised the government for failing to inform them promptly and urged the authorities to ensure the swift return of Shashi's body for the last rites.\n\u201cThis is proof of how much peace and normalcy has been restored. Seven people were massacred. We lost our brother,\u201d Shashi's sister Urvashi said after the incident that came just four days after Omar Abdullah was sworn in as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe family called on the government to provide financial assistance.\nJ L Abrol, Shashi's father, said they had never anticipated any danger in Kashmir. \u201cWe demand a job for my daughter in law to feed the family,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is no breadwinner left in the family. How will his wife, who is a homemaker, feed the children? She should be given a government job. It is the government's duty to take care of them,\u201d a cousin Navin Suri said.\nAccording to Additional Deputy Commissioner, Jammu, Shishir Gupta, the loss cannot be compensated but the process to bring back Shashi's body is being fast tracked.",

If you look at our history with Russia after Independence, Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively. Among the major countries, there are not many about who we can say this. Today Russia's situation is different, I think Russia's relationship with the West has broken down, so you have a Russia which is turning much more towards Asia. Should Russia not have multiple options in Asia? Should we not take what is good for us in national interests?\"\"And clearly, Russia as a major natural resources power has a complementarity with India at this stage of development where we are big resource consumers. It isn't just Russian oil, it could be fertilisers, metals, coal. There is a whole economic logic to it. There is also a basic strategic logic, if you look at the Eurasian landmass, there are three big countries. You always keep a balance, a relationship,\" the minister said.New Delhi's ties with Moscow have been a key geopolitical talking point over the past few years, especially after the Ukraine War began. With the West siding with Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia, India's decision to buy Russian oil had come under scrutiny.India has consistently refused to take sides in the conflict and said it is on the side of peace. This was also reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Earlier, articulating the Indian position over the decision to procure Russian oil, Dr Jaishankar had said New Delhi has a right to prioritise the interests of its people.\"I understand that there is a conflict situation (in Ukraine). I also understand that Europe has a point of view and Europe will make the choices it will make that is Europe's right. But for Europe to make choices which prioritises its energy needs and then ask India to do something else..,\" he had said.",

She requested an additional three to four months to address their remaining concerns.\n\nChief Minister meeting live: Dr Asfakulla Naiya, a protesting doctor of the West Bengal Junior Doctors\u2019 Front and 3rd year postgraduate trainee of ENT at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, highlights to the Chief Minister that the demands posed by junior doctors include the welfare of patients who seek medical treatment in State-run hospitals\n\nDr Debasish Halder, a senior resident of anaesthesiology at Medical College, Kolkata, says that of the ten-point demands which were demanded to the government earlier, were a centralised referral system and live bed vacancy monitor. He highlights that a State task force was promised for the fulfilment of infrastructural demands. \u201cYou had earlier said that 5-7 junior doctors should be part of the State Task Force, but we had suggested more representatives be present from WBJDF on a rotational basis. However, if a SoP is formed for the State Task Force formation and a monthly meeting of the task force ensured, along with directives for the same, we believe our earlier agreements can be realised more constructively,\u201d he says\n\n\u201cWe want RDAs and MBBS student unions to be statutory bodies authorised by the government via a statute by West Bengal University of Health Sciences, and elected representatives from these bodies be elected into the aforementioned committees,\u201d one of the protesting doctors suggest\n\nThe junior doctors launched their protests after the recovery of the body of a woman medic from a seminar room at RG Kar Medical Hospital on August 9, an incident that sparked outrage nationwide.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)",

Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Waynad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23.\n\nAfter the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Waynad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also remain present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. \n\nAfter being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Waynad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. Along with this, the election commission announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. \n\nIf Priyanka Gandhi wins from Waynad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi had retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. \n\nGandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation Councillor. \n\nRahul Gandhi had said both Raebareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Raebareli before making a run for active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party. \n\nMeanwhile, Congress appointed Saral Patel as the media coordinator for Wayanad ahead of the by-election with immediate effect.
