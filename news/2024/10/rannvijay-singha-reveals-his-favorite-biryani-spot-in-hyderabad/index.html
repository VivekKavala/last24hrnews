A lot of times when you come to Hyderabad, there are some spots that people will say, this is the spot for good biryani and you go to those Spots and I've done that because I've been working there for 20 years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>So, I've done it in the first few years of MTV, I would come and go to those places.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> And i think Andhra food is not just about Biryani.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> That's what I felt.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Because I'll come here so often even the local food, the spices, the chicken dishes they're pretty amazing.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Q So what is special about this season? How will it be different from this? It is Roadies double cross it's in the theme only, which means you can't trust anybody if you want to win, you want to trust yourself because survival of the fittest and I think everything is fair in love and war like they say.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>It could be the end of it as you know it, but if this was a season that somebody wants to win, it would take everything.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The OGs were coming, Neha and Rhea are never been part of the show together, we've added some elements which will keep you guessing, so because all these this season becomes special.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Q How do you maintain your energy throughout? I think probably having experiences and exposure kind of excites me.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But I think different things are driving me now.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I wanted to work, I have kids, and I have high energy generally so I don't have to maintain it's just that things excite me.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Like now this time this whole show me coming back, that's the other thing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The first question that you answered if it was something that kept doing, maybe it would be as exciting.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But today is exciting because I'm coming back.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The reaction is crazy, they have missed me, you know, the feeling that people watch Roadies and continuously every day commented everywhere, where is Rannvijay? come back, come back.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> These things excite me and i'd love, um, the fact that we have the opportunity in the resources to work in the field where your work is fun, like a lot of Adventures.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>I'm very grateful for the kind of, you know, love we get it.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> So I mean, energy is always going to be like that.</p>
