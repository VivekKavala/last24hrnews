Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi said Nehru’s democratic, progressive, and inclusive values represent the pillars on which India remains stable today. In his tribute, Gandhi wrote: “Respectful salutation to the father of modern India, creator of institutions, first Prime Minister of India, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru ji on his birth anniversary. Democratic, progressive, fearless, visionary, inclusive – these values \\u200b\\u200bof ‘Jawaharlal Nehru’ are our ideals and the pillars of Hindustan and will always remain so.\\n\\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge also paid tribute to Nehru’s legacy, recalling the “unprecedented contribution” that he had made to the nation. He also read out an excerpt from his influential work The Discovery of India to emphasize Nehru’s intellectual and political leadership.\\n\\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress leader and sister of Rahul Gandhi, paid a poignant tribute to Nehru, reminding everyone of his emphasis on fearlessness and devotion to selfless public service. She posted on X: “Fear is the root of all evil in the world. Even after we received our independence after decades long struggle and after innumerable sacrifices, even then there were people who used to do the politics of scaring and misleading the innocent public. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji opposed them very strongly and told the common people, ‘Don’t fear!’ People who create fear among the public cannot be true representatives of the public. Those public servants stand in the forefront with their heads held high so that people can live without fear. Pandit Nehru always taught the public to be fearless and serve selflessly, while on the other hand, he kept the public supreme at each and every stage of nation-building. Respectful salute to the creator of modern India.\\n\\nNehru and the Making of Contemporary India Jawaharlal Nehru was born in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, on November 14, 1889. His role was at the forefront of the struggle for India’s independence, and he was undoubtedly one of the most important leaders following the grant of independence in 1947. As India’s first prime minister, he greatly contributed to the political, economic, and social setup of the country. Although certainly based in modernity, science, and technology, Nehru’s vision of India was committed to democratic ideals and social justice.\\n\\nKey institutions which were going to define the India of growth – among other things, the Planning Commission, the IITs, and All India Radio – were established under Nehru. His foreign policy, with an emphasis on non-alignment and international cooperation, is perhaps one of the most significant factors in shaping India’s world position today.\\n\\nSignificance of Children’s Day\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru’s birthday is celebrated as National Children’s Day. This decision was taken by the Indian Parliament barely after his death in 1964. This event annually honors the love Nehru had for children and genuinely believed that children played a role in building a nation. On this day, schools across the country conduct various activities such as cultural functions, sports, and exhibitions to inspire young minds and remind them of Nehru’s values.\\n\\nNehru was particularly fond of children, often referring to them as “the future of the nation.” His policies to enhance the welfare of children were clearly visible in his policy measures concerning education and healthcare. He envisioned the rising generation becoming knowledge conscious, equal, and free.\\n\\nAlthough the United Nations had declared November 20 as Universal Children’s Day, India chose November 14 for Children’s Day to commemorate Nehru’s birthday, creating an indelible link between the statesman and India’s children.\\n\\nA Day of Remembrance and Tribute\\n\\nNovember 14 is remembered not only as a day of recalling Nehru’s service to the nation but also a day for reflection on the ideals that found form in India’s democratic foundations. Politically and socially, the Nehru legacy continues to define the Indian nation, while his dream remains a core spoke in discussions regarding progress in India. While the country celebrates this day, the name of Nehru continues to resonate in the hearts of millions, inspiring new generations to carry his torch of freedom, progress, and inclusiveness.\\n\\nAnd it is annually remembered as Jawaharlal Nehru, whose efforts to make India modern are celebrating the efforts through various commemorative events held by either the government and educational institutions.\\n\\nRead More : Chennai: Another Doctor Attacked In Govt Hospital; IMA Condemns ‘Heinous Crimes’', 'summary': \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 14 paid tribute to India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, on the day of his birthday anniversary.\\n\\n\\nThe post PM Modi Pays Tribute To Pandit Nehru On His Birth Anniversary appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/pm-modi-pays-tribute-to-pandit-nehru-on-his-birth-anniversary/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Elon-Musk-and-Trump.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 06:36:49', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.367}, {'id': 264695698, 'title': 'Sidhant Gupta pens a heartfelt tribute for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on\\n his birth anniversary', 'text': 'Mumbai, Nov 14 (IANS) Actor Sidhant Gupta, who is set to essay the role of India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the upcoming OTT series ‘Freedom at Midnight’, has penned a beautiful poem as a tribute to the late political leader on his birth anniversary.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Sidhant took to his Instagram, and shared several monochromatic throwback pictures featuring Nehru.

This role sits at the top of the nation’s intelligence agencies and serves as the president’s main intelligence adviser. As per an AP report, Gabbard, who has over two decades of military experience, doesn’t have the traditional intelligence background of past directors. After leaving the Democratic Party in 2022, she endorsed Trump earlier this year, gaining popularity among his base. Here’s a closer look at Gabbard:First Hindu Elected to CongressGabbard, 43, born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, also spent part of her early years in the Philippines. She entered politics young, elected to Hawaii’s House of Representatives at 21, though she stepped down after one term to deploy with her National Guard unit in Iraq. Later, she became the first Hindu and American Samoan in Congress, representing Hawaii, and was sworn in on the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu text.Serving four terms, Gabbard often spoke out against her party’s leadership. She gained a progressive following by supporting Bernie Sanders in his 2016 Democratic primary run, earning national attention as a prominent progressive.Ran for President, Then Left the Democratic PartyGabbard ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020, focusing on her opposition to U.S. military interventions. Drawing from her military service, she argued that U.S. actions in the Middle East destabilised the region, made America less secure, and cost American lives. She also accused her party of not challenging these wars. In one debate, she criticised then-Senator Kamala Harris’s record as a prosecutor.She ultimately dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden. But in 2022, Gabbard left the Democratic Party, denouncing it as an “elitist cabal of warmongers” and criticising its focus on “woke” ideologies. Since then, she has supported high-profile Republicans, joined Fox News as a contributor, and launched a podcast. “Today’s Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,” she said.Rising Star in Trump’s CircleGabbard endorsed Trump earlier this year, quickly building support among his followers. Often seen with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who initially challenged Biden as a Democrat before endorsing Trump—Gabbard represents Trump’s claimed bipartisan appeal. She even helped Trump prepare for a debate against Harris this year, and in October, at a Trump rally in North Carolina, she announced her switch to the Republican Party, stating that today’s Democratic Party was “completely unrecognisable.”Trump has brought both Gabbard and Kennedy onto his transition team, giving them a chance to shape his administration’s policies and personnel if he returns to office.Military Veteran, Not an Intelligence InsiderGabbard’s military career spans over 20 years in the Army National Guard, with deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for her service in Operation Iraqi Freedom III, according to the Hawaii National Guard. Yet, unlike prior directors, she hasn’t held senior government intelligence roles. She did serve two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.Current director Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, held multiple high-level security and intelligence positions before her appointment and was the first woman in the role.Overseeing Trump’s Intelligence OverhaulTrump has signalled that he intends to revamp the intelligence agencies, which he perceives as untrustworthy. He has expressed his belief that U.S. intelligence agencies undermined his first term and sees them as part of a “deep state” of civil servants he doesn’t believe are loyal enough.“We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,” Trump said in 2023 when describing his second-term priorities. “The departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled.”The office of the director of national intelligence was created in 2004 to help U.S. intelligence agencies work together and prevent failures, following the Sept. 11 attacks. Today, the office focuses on threats like foreign election interference, cyber issues, terrorism, and espionage.With inputs from AP', 'summary': 'Donald Trump chose Tulsi Gabbard for a top intelligence job. Gabbard, the first Hindu in Congress, switched to the Republican Party. She served in the military and ran for president in 2020. Trump wants to change US intelligence agencies.

Now she has been asked to serve by Trump -- and lead US intelligence. Like few others in US politics, Gabbard defies simple party categorization -- a war veteran who denounces war, a Democrat turned Republican, a vegan climate activist who denounces liberal values, and now an establishment skeptic sent to head part of it. With her prolific media appearances and articulate, undistilled speaking style, Gabbard has built a loyal following in segments of both the right and the left. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in 2019 explaining her presidential ambitions, she said she wanted the United States to stop \"trying to police the world, no more overthrowing governments, an end to the new Cold War and nuclear arms race, and redirecting our resources to urgent needs at home.\" Rejecting the term isolationist, Gabbard denounced both Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Hillary Clinton for, in her view, believing that \"the only way to interact with other nations is by bombing them or starving them with draconian sanctions.\" Her skepticism has also led to heavy criticism of her judgment from more traditional US policymakers. In 2017, she publicly questioned US intelligence that found that Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons to kill dozens of people. Trump responded with a retaliatory missile strike -- boasting of toughness in contrast to his predecessor Barack Obama, who opposed intervention in Syria even though he had explicitly warned Assad of a \"red line\" against using chemical weapons. Gabbard pointed out that US intelligence had been wrong about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the stated reason for Bush\\'s war. On Syria, she told CNN at the time that on chemical weapons she did not want to \"blindly follow this escalation of a counterproductive regime-change war.\" She traveled to Syria to meet Assad, whom the United States was trying to isolate over the brutal civil war, saying that she wanted to find ways to reach peace. Gabbard did not spare Trump from criticism in his last term. When he ordered a strike in Baghdad that killed top Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qassem Soleimani, Gabbard said Trump carried out an \"illegal and unconstitutional act of war.\" Leading Hindu in US politics Gabbard has direct experience with war, having served in Iraq with the Army National Guard of her native Hawaii. Her father, born in American Samoa, continues to serve in the Hawaii State Senate and, in his own maverick stance, remains a Democrat despite prominently opposing LGBTQ rights. Gabbard\\'s mother, born on the US mainland, embraced Hinduism and raised her children in the tradition. Gabbard, whose first name Tulsi is a sacred plant in Hinduism, is a lifelong vegetarian and swore her oath to enter Congress on the Bhagavad Gita. Gabbard got married in a Hindu ceremony to a Hawaii-based cinematographer, Abraham Williams, who met her while shooting her campaign advertisements and proposed to her while surfing in the sunset. Her outspoken embrace of India\\'s Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi has alienated her from some of her left-wing supporters. However, during her tenure in Congress, Gabbard took a number of staunchly progressive domestic positions, calling for a complete transition away from fossil fuels to save the planet from climate change and advocating for the national legalization of marijuana. But in 2022, a year after leaving Congress, she announced that she was exiting the Democratic Party, saying it had turned into an \"elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness\" that stokes \"anti-white racism.\" Her strident tone led critics to believe she was auditioning for roles in a future Republican administration, a view reinforced when she appeared beside Trump in his latest campaign and announced she was becoming a Republican. Trump had welcomed her, she said, and had turned the Republicans into \"the party of peace.\"', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/who-is-tulsi-gabbard-trumps-pick-for-director-of-national-intelligence-1838083', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/14/1862542-ezgif-4-d83bdeddfb.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 03:46:27', 'author': 'AFP', 'authors': ['AFP'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.285}, {'id': 264687108, 'title': 'Who Is Tulsi Gabbard, The First Hindu-American Whom Trump Made US National Intelligence Chief?', 'text': 'Tulsi Gabbard has become first Hindu-American to become Director of National Intelligence in the US.

This position places Gabbard at the helm of the nation’s intelligence agencies, serving as the president’s chief intelligence advisor. This move comes ahead of Trump’s second-term inauguration in January and is expected to significantly shape U.S. intelligence policies.\\n\\nWho Is Tulsi Gabbard? A Unique Political Journey\\n\\nBorn in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has always stood out in the political landscape. At 43, she became the first Hindu elected to Congress and the first American Samoan to represent the United States in the House of Representatives. Her political career began early—elected to Hawaii’s state legislature at the age of 21, Gabbard soon took a leave of absence to serve with her National Guard unit in Iraq from 2004 to 2005. She would later become a major in the Hawaii National Guard and, eventually, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves.\\n\\nGabbard’s tenure in Congress from 2013 to 2021 was marked by her vocal criticism of both party leaderships and U.S. foreign policy. A progressive voice during the 2016 Democratic primaries, Gabbard threw her support behind Bernie Sanders, gaining national recognition. Her appeal to a wide range of voters came from her strong stance on anti-interventionist policies and her criticism of the U.S. military’s global presence. She also served on the House Homeland Security Committee, adding a degree of experience relevant to her upcoming role in national intelligence.\\n\\nA Surprising Shift: From Democrat to Independent to Republican Supporter\\n\\nGabbard’s political evolution took a dramatic turn in 2022, when she left the Democratic Party to become an independent. She denounced the party as an “elitist cabal of warmongers,” expressing disdain for what she viewed as an excessive focus on “woke” ideologies. This marked the beginning of her estrangement from the left, and soon after, she became an outspoken critic of President Joe Biden and his administration.\\n\\nHer ideological shift found her aligning more closely with conservative viewpoints, and she became increasingly popular among Trump supporters. Gabbard’s endorsement of Trump in early 2023 cemented her place in his orbit. In October of that year, she officially announced her switch to the Republican Party, declaring that the modern-day Democratic Party was “unrecognizable” from what it once was.\\n\\nHer growing ties to the Republican Party culminated in her role within Trump’s transition team, where she is expected to help shape Trump’s policies and personnel choices if he returns to office.\\n\\nGabbard’s Military Service: A Stepping Stone to National Intelligence\\n\\nDespite Gabbard’s lack of formal intelligence experience, her extensive military background makes her an intriguing choice for DNI. Her service in Iraq and Kuwait with the Hawaii National Guard gave her firsthand exposure to the challenges of global security. She was awarded the Combat Medical Badge in recognition of her service during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2005.\\n\\nThough Gabbard has not held senior roles within intelligence agencies, her military expertise and long-standing commitment to national security give her a unique perspective on intelligence matters. President Trump himself emphasized Gabbard’s fearless spirit, noting that she would bring her two decades of service to the intelligence community, helping secure America’s constitutional rights and ensuring the nation’s security.\\n\\n“I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength,” Trump said in his statement. He also praised her decades of dedication to the freedom of America and its citizens.\\n\\nA Challenging Role Amid a Changing Landscape\\n\\nGabbard’s confirmation is expected to proceed smoothly in the Senate, where Republicans will hold a slim majority of at least 52-to-48 starting in January. Given her strong connections to the Republican Party, her confirmation is not expected to face significant opposition.\\n\\nHer appointment comes at a pivotal time for the U.S. intelligence community, which has faced mounting criticism under the Trump administration. Trump has long claimed that U.S. intelligence agencies undermined his first term, describing them as part of a “deep state” of bureaucrats who lacked loyalty to his administration. As part of his second-term agenda, Trump has promised to overhaul the intelligence agencies, and Gabbard’s appointment signals a new direction for national security policies, particularly concerning U.S. foreign interventions.\\n\\nThe position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created in 2004 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve coordination among U.S. intelligence agencies and prevent intelligence failures. Today, the DNI oversees agencies tasked with addressing issues such as foreign election interference, cybersecurity, terrorism, and espionage.\\n\\nGabbard’s political stance, particularly her advocacy for non-interventionism, aligns with Trump’s “America First” foreign policy. Her views on limiting U.S. military presence abroad could lead to a shift in how intelligence resources are allocated and how national security threats are assessed.\\n\\nA Bold Choice for the Future of U.S. Intelligence\\n\\nTulsi Gabbard’s appointment as Director of National Intelligence may have raised eyebrows, but it is a move in line with the Trump administration’s broader agenda of shaking up the establishment. While her lack of formal intelligence experience may be seen as a challenge, her military background and willingness to question the status quo offer a fresh perspective on national security. Her role in shaping U.S. intelligence policies will be closely watched, as she faces the dual challenge of modernizing the intelligence community while adhering to her commitment to constitutional freedoms and non-interventionist principles.\\n\\nWhether Gabbard’s appointment represents a step toward a more isolationist foreign policy or a reshaping of U.S. intelligence priorities, it is clear that she is poised to make a significant impact in the Trump administration’s national security strategy.\\n\\nALSO READ: 115,000 Users Quit X After Trump Victory – Is This The Start Of A Social Media Shift?', 'summary': 'Gabbard served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021, during which time she voiced her opposition to the policies pursued by the party she once belonged to.

The WPI for October 2023 was pegged at 8.39 per cent.The wholesale inflation, measured using the Wholesale Price Index, was expected to be at 2.2 per cent, according to economists polled by Reuters.Previously, India’s retail inflation unexpectedly surged to a 14-month high of 6.2% in October, up from 5.5% in September, further delaying the prospect of monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) amid the economy showing signs of slowing. An increase in vegetable, fruit and edible oil prices was the primary driver of the spike, official data released Tuesday showed. The rate breached the outer bounds of the central bank’s inflation target — 4% with a two percentage point tolerance band on either side—for the first time since August 2023.The WPI measures the price of a representative basket of wholesale goods. In India, wholesale price index is divided into three groups: Primary Articles (22.6 percent of total weight); Fuel and Power (13.2 percent); and Manufactured Products (64.2 percent).Food remains costly affairFood prices have always played a significant role in shaping India's inflation picture. The current consumer price inflation (CPI) basket assigns a weight of 46% to food, a figure that many argue needs to be revisited as consumption patterns evolve.As significant portion of 1.4 billion people spend most of their income on food, India's inflation index is heavily influenced by food prices.Experts had earlier indicated that a higher food inflation number could keep overall inflation from declining significantly.Prices of key vegetables such as onion, tomato and potato have risen and a Crisil analysis recently showed the cost of a veg thali in India rose 11% on year in September. Concerns also persist regarding the impact of weather variations on inflation and economic stability.The RBI in its latest bulletin said volatility in food prices remains a contingent risk even as recent easing in retail prices will help boost private consumption.RBI's stanceDuring the latest rate-setting panel meeting, the MPC left its inflation forecast for this fiscal year (FY25) unchanged at 4.5 per cent, even amid caution on food price trajectory that may hurt core inflation along with geopolitical tensions which pose a threat to any comfort on crude prices.The central bank now sees inflation for Q2, Q3 and Q4 of this fiscal year at 4.1%, 4.8%, and 4.2%, respectively. In the August policy, the monetary authority had pegged the inflation readings at 4.4%, 4.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Inflation stood at 4.9% in the first quarter.The inflation forecast for the first quarter of the next fiscal year is projected at 4.3%.India's food inflation has averaged 6.3% between June 2020 and June 2024, a central bank study published in August showed, compared to 2.9% in the previous four years. It eased slightly in July and August due to statistical base effects but is expected to have risen again last month.The Reserve Bank of India-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Wednesday retained repo rate.

Inflation in October has risen from 1.84 per cent in September, primarily due to an increase in prices of food articles which jumped by 13.57 per cent during the month as vegetables such as potatoes and onions turned costlier following the damage to crops caused by the late withdrawal of the monsoon. The wholesale price inflation in manufactured goods, which have a weightage of over 64 per cent in the index, rose by 1.5 per cent. There was a decline in prices in the fuel and power category with the inflation rate at a negative (-) 5.79 per cent, according to the official figures. Data released on Tuesday showed the country\\'s retail price inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 6.21 per cent in October as higher prices of food items such as vegetables spiked during the month. Retail inflation has increased from 5.49 per cent recorded in September as the prices of vegetables surged by as much as 42.18 per cent in October as the late withdrawal of the monsoon this year resulted in damage to crops and reduced supply in the market. This is the first time that the rate of retail inflation has crossed the RBI\\'s upper limit of 6 per cent. The RBI is waiting for the retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth. Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that although the RBI had shifted towards a softer neutral monetary policy stance to spur growth, this did not mean that an interest rate cut would happen immediately. Addressing a media event, the RBI Governor said: \"A change in stance doesn\\'t mean there will be a rate cut in the very next monetary policy meeting.\" He said there were still significant upside risks to inflation and \"a rate cut at this stage would be very risky\".

Fortunately, no injuries were reported, but this incident has raised alarms about ambulance safety standards in India, particularly following a similar explosion in Uttar Pradesh. Officials are now calling for stricter regulations to ensure the safety of patients in transit.\\n\\nA Close Call for Patients \\n\\nIn a terrifying incident in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, a pregnant woman was being transported in an ambulance when the driver, Vivek Gupta, spotted smoke emanating from the vehicle’s engine. Acting quickly, he evacuated the family just moments before the oxygen cylinder exploded, causing significant damage to the ambulance and shattering windows of nearby homes. Eyewitnesses described the explosion as loud enough to be heard from a distance, but thankfully, all passengers escaped unharmed. Gupta’s prompt response was crucial in preventing what could have been a tragic outcome.\\n\\nRising Concerns Over Ambulance Safety \\n\\nThis incident is part of a troubling trend regarding ambulance safety in India. There have been several accidents involving oxygen cylinder explosions that have raised concerns about the safety protocols followed by ambulance services. Health officials are advocating for stricter compliance with safety regulations to prevent such incidents from recurring. Recommendations for improving ambulance safety include secure patient compartments and proper equipment mounting systems to avoid injuries during transport. However, the absence of federally mandated safety standards has resulted in inconsistencies across states regarding ambulance design and operation.\\n\\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective \\n\\nAt The Logical Indian, we believe that every life is precious and that ensuring the safety of patients during emergencies is paramount. The recent explosion serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for improved regulations and adherence to safety standards in ambulances across India. As we reflect on these incidents, we must ask ourselves: what steps can be taken to guarantee that all ambulances are equipped with the necessary safety features to protect those who rely on them during critical moments? We encourage our readers to share their thoughts and suggestions on how we can collectively advocate for better emergency medical services in our communities.\\n\\nPregnant Woman Has Narrow Escape As Oxygen Cylinder In Ambulance Explodes in Jalgaon of Maharashtra. pic.twitter.com/PvQPkQZJEY— Aditya Raj Kaul (@AdityaRajKaul) November 13, 2024', 'summary': 'Pregnant Woman Escapes Unharmed as Ambulance Oxygen Cylinder Explodes in Maharashtra.', 'url': 'https://thelogicalindian.com/the-logical-indian/pregnant-womans-narrow-escape-as-ambulance-oxygen-cylinder-explodes-in-maharashtra/', 'image': 'https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Social-Thumbnail-Template-94.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 05:53:04', 'author': 'News Desk', 'authors': ['News Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.192}, {'id': 264699066, 'title': 'Viral Video: Oxygen Cylinder Explodes In Ambulance In Maharashtra; Driver Saves Pregnant Woman', 'text': 'A dramatic and scary incident, an ambulance blasted in Maharashtras Jalgaon on Wednesday evening.

with new leftist President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s party expected to secure a big majority to drive through economic reforms.\\nThe 55-year-old hopes to grab two-thirds of the legislature’s 225 seats to press ahead with reforms after the country’s economic meltdown in 2022, when then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted.\\nDissanayake took power after sweeping September elections on a promise to combat graft and recover the country’s stolen assets.\\nVoting booths on the South Asian island will close at 4:00 pm (1030 GMT), with 17.1 million people choosing between 8,800 candidates after a seven-week-long campaign that election monitors say was one of the most peaceful in the country.\\nInitial results are expected on Friday.\\nElection officials said over 80,000 police officers — backed by monitoring drones — have been deployed at the country’s more than 13,000 polling booths.\\nDissanayake’s JVP, or the People’s Liberation Front, is the main constituent of the National People’s Power (NPP) coalition of professionals seeking to form the next government.\\nThe NPP held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.\\nDissanayake had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister, but he has distanced himself from traditional politicians accused of leading the country to its worst economic crisis two years ago.\\nHis JVP party led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987, leading to at least 80,000 deaths, but Dissanayake took power peacefully in elections on September 21.\\nFOREGONE CONCLUSION\\nDespite previous promises to renegotiate a controversial $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout secured by his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, Dissanayake has chosen to maintain the agreement with the international lender.\\nThe country’s main private sector lobby, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, is tacitly supporting Dissanayake and expects him to press ahead with reforms.\\n“Continuing reforms… could encourage both investor confidence and fiscal discipline, setting a foundation for sustainable growth,” CCC Secretary Bhuwanekabahu Perera told AFP ahead of voting.\\nHe said Dissanayake’s approach to governance “may lean toward a balanced socialist-democratic model that acknowledges market realities.”\\nAn IMF delegation is due in Colombo on Thursday to review economic progress before releasing the next tranche of $330 million of the bailout loan.\\nOpposition leader Sajith Premadasa, who had campaigned to take part in a coalition government, vowed in his final campaign rally that he would

polls.\\nPolitical analyst Kusal Perera said there was little campaigning by opposition parties.\\n“The opposition is dead,” Perera said. “The result of the election is a foregone conclusion.”\\nOver 60 senior politicians from the previous administration have opted to stay out.\\nThe outgoing parliament was dominated by the party of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa — the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), or the People’s Front — but it has since splintered.\\nRajapaksa is not contesting, but his son Namal, a former sports minister, is seeking re-election.', 'summary': \"Sri Lankans are

The voting started at 7 am and will continue till 4 pm local time. The counting will start soon after the closing of polls.Voters turned out in steady streams during the first hour of the polls, election officials said.Over 17 million voters from the island\\'s 21 million population are eligible to vote for the 225-member Parliament for a five-year term.Nearly 90,000 security personnel from the police and the military are deployed to provide security at the election venues.Thursday\\'s vote would be the first major test of the popularity of the ruling party, National People\\'s Power, led by President Dissanayake.Having failed to secure 50 per cent of the vote at the September 21 presidential election, Dissanayake is pleading for a stronger parliament with well over a simple majority of 113 seats to implement his anti-corruption accountability reformist programme.This will be the first parliamentary election since Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Since assuming office, Dissanayake has stayed on course with his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe\\'s International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout programme.The country is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in history as the Dissanayake government faces the challenge of meeting the IMF targets on revenue in the third review of the USD 2.9 billion programme.As many as 196 members are to be elected from the 22 districts based on the proportional representation system while 29 would be elected from the cumulative votes polled national list to provide a 225-member Parliament for a five-year term.Political parties and independent groups file lists of candidates for each district. Seats are allocated proportionately according to the votes polled.Individual MPs get elected based on the preferential votes cast in their favour. Each voter is entitled to mark three individual preferences.Wickremesinghe, who lost to Dissanayake in last month\\'s presidential election, has not been contesting the parliamentary election for the first time since 1977.The Rajapaksa brothers - Mahinda, Gotabaya, Chamal and Basil too are not contesting this election after decades-long representation.Scores of ministers and deputies from the past regime have opted out of the race.Under the complex proportional representation system, Dissanayake\\'s NPP will be hard-pressed to gain the absolute majority required for initiating major reforms such as overhauling the presidential system.\"We should win big enough to make them cry,\" Dissanayake said, referring to the ruling classes against whom his party had run two bloody rebellions.After Dissanayake\\'s win in the presidential election held in September, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Wickremesinghe-backed New Democratic Front (NDF) seemed to have thrown a feeble challenge to gain control of Parliament, the analysts noted.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/neighbours/sri-lankans-vote-in-parliamentary-election-1838085', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/14/1862551-ezgif-3-c92533cf76.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 04:27:28', 'author': 'PTI', 'authors': ['PTI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.212}, {'id': 264714698, 'title': 'Why Sri Lanka’s Parliamentary Election Is Vital For Marxist-Inclined President Anura Dissanayake?', 'text': 'Sri Lankans on Thursday began casting their ballots in a snap parliamentary election widely considered to be a chance for the new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to secure an imperative mandate for his pro-poor policies. Dissanayake, known for his left and welfare-friendly agenda, would seek to attain parliamentary support to push through reforms that include expansion of welfare programs and renegotiation of terms under the IMF bailout.\\n\\nDissanayake, who assumed the presidency in September by bagging almost 43% of votes, will have to contend with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya party of Sajith Premadasa that is talking about a state interventionist and market-oriented policy. A financial crisis that has recently gripped the country has left it to deal with high living costs particularly for the poor classes. Economic recovery appears slow and fragile when Sri Lanka secured bailout support valued at $2.9 billion from the IMF.\\n\\nGet Parliamentary Backing for Reforms\\n\\nGiven Sri Lanka’s proportion representation system in a 225-member parliament, it is hard for any single party to gain an absolute majority, meaning Dissanayake must win over half the votes to become a majority for his policies. As an “outsider” to Colombo’s political elite, which has traditionally been run by influential families, he has used his party as an advocate for anti-poverty measures and anti-corruption.\\n\\nA Push to Reframe the IMF Bailout\\n\\nRenegotiating some parts of the IMF bailout package is the top priority for Ratnatunga, where his administration will be able to reduce income taxes and increase social welfare. The government is already under pressure to stick to the IMF’s target of a 2.3% primary budget surplus, but there could be concerns that Dissanayake’s method may also delay future installments.\\n\\n“In past elections, people did not have confidence in us but in September people gave us victory and proved that we are a winning party and we can form a government. The next task is to unite people from the four corners of this country and build a powerful people’s movement,” Dissanayake said during a campaign rally on Sunday.\\n\\nNew Political Dawn for Sri Lanka?\\n\\nVoters, including 32-year-old Umeshi Perera of Colombo, voiced cautious optimism: “I think we are seeing the first signs of a positive political change in Sri Lanka after the president was elected and we should give him a chance to continue that change.”\\n\\nDissanayake’s National People’s Power (NPP), founded in 2019, has a number of political newcomers among its slate. Thursday will decide 196 of the country’s 225 parliamentary seats, and 29 “national list” seats will be allocated according to party vote share.

In his statement, Trump praised Rubio as “a very powerful voice for freedom” and a “fearless warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.”Here are 5 facts about Marco Rubio and his career: 1) Early life and immigrant rootsBorn in 1971 in Miami, Florida, Marco Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who came to America in pursuit of their American Dream. His father worked as a banquet bartender, while his mother balanced being a stay-at-home mom with working as a hotel maid. From a young age, Rubio learned the values of faith, family, community, and hard work.2) A career in public service before becoming a US senator in 2010Rubio served in various roles, including as a city commissioner in West Miami and as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. In 2010, he won a seat in the US Senate. The Center for Effective Law Making ranked Rubio as the most effective Republican, while the Lugar Center named him one of the most bipartisan senators. His work includes expanding the child tax credit, reforming the VA system, supporting small businesses during the pandemic, reshaping US policy towards China and strengthening national security.3) 2016 Presidential bidIn April 2015, Marco Rubio entered the US presidential race. Early on, he was the choice of the Republican establishment. But by February 2016, his campaign was struggling, winning just one state and trailing behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the delegate count. Rubio\\'s campaign was heavily impacted by Trump\\'s mockery, with Trump dubbing him “Little Marco” and Rubio responding by calling Trump “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency.” After losing the Florida primary in March 2016, Rubio suspended his campaign. Though initially considering leaving politics, Rubio returned to the Senate race, winning re-election in 2016. Following Trump\\'s victory, Rubio shifted toward a conservative populist stance, becoming a key ally of the new president.4) Legislative achievementsThroughout his Senate tenure, Rubio has championed a wide range of policies aimed at improving the lives of everyday Americans. He played a key role in expanding the child tax credit for working families and reforming the US Department of Veterans Affairs, particularly securing healthcare for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. During the pandemic lockdown, Rubio helped pass the Paycheck Protection Program, keeping millions of small businesses afloat. He also wrote and passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which marked a significant shift in US-China relations.5) Family lifeRubio often underlines that being a father is his most important role. He lost his own father just two months before his election to the US Senate, but his lessons of hard work, responsibility, and family continue to guide him. He met his wife, Jeanette, a fellow Miami native, through mutual friends, and they married in 1998. They have four children — Amanda, Daniella, Anthony and Dominick.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\")', 'summary': 'US President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a prominent critic of China, for the position of US Secretary of State.', 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-marco-rubio-donald-trump-s-nominee-for-us-secretary-of-state-7016545', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/4dcjqha_marco-rubio_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 07:38:37', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.262}]}, {'news': [{'id': 264682230, 'title': 'Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers amid city’s rising air pollution', 'text': 'As Delhi continues to grapple with ‘severe’ air pollution, the Delhi Airport on Thursday issued an advisory for passengers and informed that all flight operations are currently normal, however, ‘Low Visibility Procedures’ are in progress at the airport.

Addressing a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra today, Rahul said that the Prime Minister says that I show the Constitution in public meetings that is empty. “Sanvidhan unke liye khali hai kyuki unhone ise zindagi mein pada nahi hai (The Constitution seems empty to him because he’s never read it in his life),” Rahul Gandhi said in a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra’s Nandurbar. Attacking the Prime Minister further, the Congress leader said that the Constitution is not blank, but carries thoughts and ideas of thousand years.“He has no idea what’s written inside this book; that’s why he says it’s empty. He says Rahul Gandhi shows a red book. It doesn’t matter to us what colour the book is; what matters is what’s written inside it. We are ready to give our lives for what it represents,” Rahul Gandhi said.“I want to explain to the Prime Minister that this Constitution is not hollow. It is filled with thousands of years of thought. When you call it hollow, you disrespect Birsa Munda, Mahatma Gandhi, Ambedkar, and others. This fight is about protecting it,” he added.Earlier, Prime Minister Modi attacked Rahul Gandhi saying the “Laal Kitab” of the Constitution which the Congress was flaunting contained “nothing”.“In ‘farziwada’, Congress has broken its own record. The ‘Laal Kitab’ of the Constitution which the Congress party was flaunting and distributing contained ‘nothing’. It was an empty book. This is nothing but a testament to Congress’ disregard and hate for Baba Saheb Ambedkar. The entire country is in shock over this foolish and unfortunate political play of Congress,” PM Modi said.Further in his address, the Lok Sabha LoP slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party over tribal population, and alleged that the Prime Minister and the BJP-RSS call indigenous people “Vanvasi” (forest dwellers) and carry out deforestation across the country. “Congress introduced the Land Acquisition Bill to protect your land. The Tribal Rights Act granted you rights to the forest, land, and water. But as soon as the BJP government comes to power, they take your land and hand it over to billionaires. The term “Vanvasi” implies that your children should not become doctors or engineers, should not get jobs, and should not do business. “Adivasi,” on the other hand, means that your children can achieve anything. That is the difference between “Adivasi” and “Vanvasi,” Rahul said.He further pointed out that in India, the Adivasi population is eight per cent, and their participation should match this percentage. “I investigated the representation of Adivasis in the Indian government. There are 90 officials who run the government. If the government spends 100 rupees, how many Adivasi officials make decisions about it? Adivasi officials make decisions over just 10 paise of that amount. Out of 90, there is only one Adivasi official, who is side-lined. We need to change this, and the way to do it is through a caste census,” the Congress leader said.The Lok Sabha LoP asserted that the Congress party has decided that as much money the Prime Minister waives off for billionaires, they will give to the common people.Highlighting his guarantees, the Congress MP said that under the Mahalaxmi Yojana, on the first day of every month, women will receive Rs 3,000 directly in their accounts. “After that, we will provide free bus travel for women. Farmers will have up to three lakh rupees of debt waived. When farmers sell paddy, cotton, or soybeans, our government will provide MSP (Minimum Support Price).

The maximum temperature in Delhi (Safdarjung) dropped from 32.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 27.8 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. \\nBihar’s Hajipur, with an AQI of 417, had the second-worst reading in the country on Wednesday, the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) data showed. Of the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi, 30 recorded the air quality in the “severe” category, the CPCB said. \\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, 401 and 450 “severe” and above 450 “severe plus”. According to the CPCB, Delhi’s AQI was in the “severe” category for three days in January. On January 14, the AQI was recorded at 447, followed by 409 on January 24 as well as on January 26. \\nIf the city’s air quality remains in the “severe” category on Thursday, authorities may impose restrictions under the third stage of the GRAP, including a ban on construction and demolition activities and plying of BS-lll petrol and BS-IV diesel light motor vehicles. \\nAccording to the Centre’s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management, vehicular emission was the top contributor to Delhi’s pollution on Wednesday, with an estimated share of 13.3 per cent. The other prominent pollutants were PM2.5 and PM10. PM2.5 and PM10 refer to fine particulate matters in the air, with the numbers indicating their size in micrometre. \\nPM2.5 are fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometre or less, about the width of a human hair. These are so small that these can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing significant health risks. \\nPM10 are coarser particles with a diameter of 10 micrometre or less, about the width of 10 human hairs. While not as concerning as PM2.5, these can still irritate the airways and worsen respiratory problems. Long-term exposure to these particulate matters can increase the risk of heart disease. \\nAccording to the latest CPCB data, Delhi’s annual average PM10 and PM2.5 levels were higher by 5 per cent and 7 per cent respectively between January 1 and November 12 against the year-ago period. \\nBetween January 1 and November 12, the capital witnessed 116 days when the AQI was in the “poor”, “very poor” or “severe” categories. The AQI on 201 days was “good”, “satisfactory” or “moderate”, the data showed. \\nL M Darlong, the head of thoracic oncosurgery at the Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, told PTI that long-term exposure to PM2.5 poses a significant risk of lung cancer. These fine particles can trigger mutations in the lung cells, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Over a decade of exposure, these mutations are often linked to genes that play a key role in regulating cell division, Darlong said. \\nEarly detection of lung cancer is critical as symptoms such as persistent cough or blood in sputum often appear only at later stages, making treatment more challenging, he added. The fog led to limited visibility in the morning, with conditions at the Delhi airport dropping to zero. This marked a notable shift in the capital’s climate and a few flights were diverted due to the low visibility, an official said. \\nZero-metre visibility was recorded at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport at 8:30 am, with the Runway Visual Range varying between 125 metres and 500 metres at different locations, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported. \\n“Very dense” fog began forming around 5:30 am, casting a thick haze over various parts of the national capital, it noted. \\n“By morning, a heavy layer of fog blanketed the city, reducing visibility to as low as 125 metres in certain areas,” an IMD official said. The weather department has forecast a largely clear sky for Thursday, with predominant surface winds likely from the northwest at a speed of less than 6 kilometres per hour during the morning hours. \\nThe IMD has also said smog or dense to very dense fog is expected in the morning. The wind speed will increase to less than 10 kmph from the northwest in the afternoon, decreasing to less than 8 kmph from the same direction in the evening and night.

Then he approached the Supreme Court and tried to get in the building. He failed and then there were the other explosions,” Leao said in a news conference.Local media reported that the car that exploded belonged to a member of Brazil's Liberal Party, the same of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Leao said only investigations will determine whether the owner of the car is the same man who died in the blasts.Leao recommended that Congress be closed Thursday to avoid new risks. Brazil's Senate heeded her call and the lower house will be shut until noon, speaker Arthur Lira said.“It could have been a lone wolf, like others we've seen around the world,” Leao said in a news conference. “We are considering it as a suicide because there was only one victim. But investigations will show if that was indeed the case.” Leao added only forensics will be able to identify the body, which remained outside the Supreme Court for three hours after the blasts.The blasts outside the Supreme Court took place about 20 seconds apart in Brasilia's Three Powers Plaza, where Brazil's main government buildings, including the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace, are located.President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was not in the neighbouring presidential palace at the time, spokesman Jose Chrispiniano said.Police blocked all access to the area and the presidential security bureau was conducting a sweep of the grounds around the presidential palace.Brazil's federal police said it is investigating and did not provide a motive.The Supreme Court in recent years has become a target for threats by far-right groups and supporters of Bolsonaro's due to its crackdown on the spread of false information. In particular, Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been a focus for their ire.Lula's spokesman said that late on Wednesday the leftist leader was gathering at the presidential residence with federal police chief Andrei Rodrigues, and Supreme Court Justices de Moraes and Cristiano Zanin.

Matt Gaetz of Florida to serve as his attorney general on Wednesday, bypassing more experienced options in favor of a loyalist who has built a national reputation as a disruptor and whom Trump has tasked with dramatically overhauling the Justice Department. Trump also announced that he had tapped Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as his nominee for secretary of state. And he selected Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress and presidential candidate, to serve as his director of national intelligence. The choices continued a pattern of Trump stocking his Cabinet with those he believes he can trust to execute his agenda rather than longtime officials with experience in their fields. Gaetz\\'s selection, in particular, was seen as a shock. The Florida lawmaker was not among the more established attorneys who had been mentioned as contenders for the job, and even his colleagues in Congress appeared stunned by the news. “Everybody was saying, ‘Oh my God,’\" said Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. “That was about as big a surprise as I’ve had in a long time.\" Gaetz resigned from his House seat Wednesday evening. Trump announced the decision in a post in his Truth Social network, saying Gaetz would “root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the Department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy and Constitution.” If confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, Gaetz would instantly become one of the most closely watched members of Trump’s Cabinet given his avowed loyalty to a president-elect who has threatened to pursue retribution against perceived adversaries.Gaetz represents much of the Florida Panhandle and became a conservative star when he joined Congress, appearing as a frequent staunch defender of Trump on cable news. He irked fellow GOP members in early 2023 when he filed the resolution that successfully ousted former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy then helped fund a primary challenge to Gaetz that included commercials alleging that he paid for sex with a 17-year-old, an allegation that had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee — though that probe effectively ended Wednesday when Gaetz resigned from Congress. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing and the Justice Department ended its own sex trafficking investigation without bringing charges against him. House Republicans first got wind of the nomination during a private meeting and initially thought the news was a joke before realizing Trump had indeed named Gaetz to serve as the nation\\'s chief law officer. GOP Rep. Max Miller told reporters the shock in the room was more a reflection of members\\' happiness that the Florida Republican will no longer be a member of the chamber after years of instigating intraparty battles. Even Trump’s allies in the Senate were keeping their distance. “We’ll see,” said Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin when asked whether he would vote to confirm the congressman. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, suggested that the Senate would look closely into Gaetz, including the House Ethics Committee investigation. “I’m sure it will make for a popcorn-eating confirmation hearing,” said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who serves on the committee that will take up the Gaetz nomination, said it would be \"the first test of whether Republicans are willing to stand up to Donald Trump and go with conscience and conviction as opposed to just politics.” The announcement came shortly after Trump confirmed that he had picked Rubio, a conservative lawmaker, as the nation’s top diplomat. A onetime critic who evolved into one of the president-elect’s fiercest defenders, Rubio is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate this summer. He would be the first Latino in the job if confirmed. On Capitol Hill, Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has pushed for taking a harder line against China and has targeted social media app TikTok because its parent company is Chinese. He and other lawmakers contend that Beijing could demand access to the data of users whenever it wants. “He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,” Trump said of Rubio in a statement. Trump made the personnel announcements while flying back back to Florida from Washington after meeting with President Joe Biden. The president-elect had been expected...', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-picks-matt-gaetz-for-attorney-general-marco-rubio-for-secretary-of-state-1838070', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/14/1862518-aa-3454598.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 01:35:57', 'author': 'DC Correspondent', 'authors': ['DC Correspondent'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.113}, {'id': 264665226, 'title': 'Donald Trump picks former rival Marco Rubio for secretary of state', 'text': \"WASHINGTON: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump officially announced on Wednesday he is nominating Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of both the foreign relations and intelligence committees and former political rival, to be secretary of state. He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries, Trump said in a statement. The choice could come as a relief to U.S. partners worried that the Trump administration could pull back from its global network of alliances, including NATO, given Trump's more America First approach to foreign affairs. Rumors of Rubio's selection had prompted criticism from some members of the Republican party who saw his foreign policy views as too traditional and internationalist. Rubio, 53, is known as a China hawk, outspoken critic of Cuba's Communist government and strong backer of Israel. He has in the past advocated for a more assertive U.S. foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, although recently his views have aligned more closely with those of Trump's America First approach to foreign policy. In April, Rubio was one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a big military aid package to help Ukraine resist Russia and support other U.S. partners, including Israel. Trump has been critical of Democratic President Joe Biden's continuing military assistance for Ukraine as it fights Russian invaders. Rubio has said in recent interviews that Kyiv needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Russia rather than focus on regaining all territory Moscow has taken in the last decade. On the Gaza war, like Trump, Rubio has been staunchly behind Israel, calling Hamas a terrorist organization that must be eliminated and saying America's role is to resupply Israel with the military materials needed to finish the job. Rubio is a top Senate China hawk, and Beijing imposed sanctions on him in 2020 over his stance on Hong Kong's democracy protests. This could create difficulties for any attempts to maintain the Biden administration's effort to keep up diplomatic engagement with Beijing to avoid an unintended conflict. Among other things, Rubio shepherded an act through Congress that gave Washington a new tool to bar Chinese imports over China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims and has also pushed a bill that would decertify Hong Kong's U.S. economic and trade offices. WILL HE STAND UP TO TRUMP? Rubio had also become a strong Trump backer, after harshly criticizing him when he ran against the former real estate developer for president in 2016. In 2016 Trump helped end Rubio's run for the presidential nomination by nicknaming him Little Marco. Some analysts questioned whether he would stand up to Trump, noting the president-elect's inclination to make personal loyalty a central requirement for administration posts. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said it is essential for any president's advisers to stand up to him when necessary, given the wide array of foreign policy challenges Trump will face. I'm trying to keep an open mind here, Miller said, noting that Rubio, because of his experience in Congress, has a better grasp of foreign policy than any of Trump's other appointees. The three-term Republican senator should easily win confirmation in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans will hold at least a 52-48 majority starting in January. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the intelligence committee, quickly issued a statement praising the choice of Rubio, the panel's vice chairman. I have worked with Marco Rubio for more than a decade on the Intelligence Committee, particularly closely in the last couple of years in his role as Vice Chairman, and while we don't always agree, he is smart, talented, and will be a strong voice for American interests around the globe, Warner said in a statement. Rubio, the son of immigrants from Cuba, will be the first Latino to serve as America's top diplomat.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for Secretary of State.

First Hindu US Congresswoman Appointed US Intel Chief by Donald Trump', 'text': \"Washington: President-elect Donald Trump recently made a significant announcement, naming Tulsi Gabbard as his choice for Director of National Intelligence (DNI). This position would place her in charge of overseeing 18 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and FBI, and preparing the President’s Daily Brief. While the role is crucial for national security, Gabbard's appointment signals a shift in foreign policy priorities, aligning with Trump’s approach of appointing advisers who are deeply skeptical of U.S. military interventions abroad.Early Political Career and Military ServiceTulsi Gabbard, a Samoan-American and a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, served in Iraq and was deployed in the Middle East. She began her political career as a Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii, serving from 2013 to 2021. Known for her strong stance on foreign policy, Gabbard gained national attention for her criticism of US military involvement overseas, especially in the Middle East. Her military experience gives her a unique perspective on the cost of wars, which she believes have destabilized regions and made the US less safe.Shift in Political Views: From Democrat to IndependentGabbard was initially popular with progressives, especially for her support of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential race. However, her views began to diverge from mainstream Democratic politics. She became increasingly vocal against the 'elitist cabal of warmongers' in the Democratic Party, which she claimed controlled foreign policy decisions. In 2020, she ran for president, campaigning on the idea that U.S. involvement in foreign wars was damaging to both the U.S. and the world. After endorsing Joe Biden , Gabbard ultimately left the Democratic Party in 2022, declaring herself an independent.Since then, she has gained support from Republicans and right-wing circles. She has also become a regular commentator on Fox News, where she discusses foreign policy and the issues she believes matter most for America’s future.Criticism of U.S. Foreign Policy and Military InterventionsThroughout her career, Gabbard has consistently criticized US military interventions in the Middle East. She argues that such wars, including the Iraq War and the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, have led to the loss of thousands of lives and wasted American taxpayer money. As the Director of National Intelligence, she is expected to apply this same critical lens to US intelligence strategies, with an emphasis on reducing unnecessary military interventions and focusing on protecting American interests at home and abroad.What Her Appointment Could MeanGabbard’s appointment to this powerful role suggests that Trump intends to shift the direction of US intelligence operations. Her background as a critic of American military overreach means she will likely advocate for intelligence strategies that focus more on diplomacy and strategic partnerships rather than military action.As DNI, Gabbard would be responsible for coordinating the work of all intelligence agencies and ensuring that the President has access to accurate and timely information about national security threats. Her unique blend of military experience, political independence, and skepticism of foreign military interventions could shape her leadership in ways that challenge traditional intelligence practices.\", 'summary': 'Who is Tulsi Gabbard?

Her responsibilities would include managing 18 intelligence organisations and coordinating the President\\'s Daily Brief, a crucial morning intelligence summary.First Hindu elected to CongressAt 43, Gabbard was born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, with a brief period in the Philippines. Her political career began at 21 in Hawaii\\'s House of Representatives, interrupted by her National Guard deployment to Iraq.As the first Hindu member of the House, she took her oath on the \"Bhagavad Gita\". She also holds the distinction of being the first American Samoan in Congress. During her four terms, she notably challenged her party\\'s leadership. Her early backing of senator Bernie Sanders\\' 2016 campaign elevated her national profile amongst progressives.Her family includes her spouse, cinematographer Abraham Williams, and her father, Mike Gabbard, a state senator who transitioned from Republican to Democrat.Presidential aspirations and party switchHer 2020 Democratic presidential campaign emphasised a progressive agenda and opposition to American military interventions. She highlighted how US Middle Eastern conflicts had destabilised the region and compromised American safety. During the primaries, she notably confronted then-senator Kamala Harris about her prosecutorial record.After withdrawing and supporting Biden\\'s candidacy, she later left the Democratic Party, criticising it as controlled by \"an elitist cabal of warmongers\" and \"woke\" ideologues. She subsequently aligned with Republicans, joined Fox News, and launched a podcast.\"Today\\'s Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,\" she said regarding her departure.Prominence in Trump\\'s circleHer endorsement of Trump this year significantly boosted her standing among his supporters. Frequently appearing with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Gabbard exemplified Trump\\'s claimed cross-party appeal. She assisted Trump\\'s debate preparation against Harris and publicly announced her Republican Party membership at a North Carolina rally in October, describing the Democratic Party as \"completely unrecognizable\".Trump has included both Gabbard and Kennedy in his transition team, potentially influencing staffing and policy decisions in a future administration.Military service and intelligence backgroundGabbard\\'s military career spans over twenty years in the Army National Guard, including deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received recognition with a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, as confirmed by the Hawaii National Guard.Unlike her predecessors, she lacks senior government experience, though she served two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.The current director, Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, brought extensive national security and intelligence experience and made history as the first female director.Intelligence sector reform plansTrump intends to restructure intelligence services, which he views with scepticism. He attributes past challenges to intelligence agencies\\' alleged interference with his previous administration and campaigns.He frequently references the \"deep state\", describing career civil servants whom he considers insufficiently loyal. \"We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,\" Trump declared in 2023, outlining second-term priorities.The director\\'s role, established in 2004 post-9/11, aims to enhance interagency cooperation and prevent intelligence failures.

Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi said Nehru’s democratic, progressive, and inclusive values represent the pillars on which India remains stable today. In his tribute, Gandhi wrote: “Respectful salutation to the father of modern India, creator of institutions, first Prime Minister of India, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru ji on his birth anniversary. Democratic, progressive, fearless, visionary, inclusive – these values \\u200b\\u200bof ‘Jawaharlal Nehru’ are our ideals and the pillars of Hindustan and will always remain so.\\n\\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge also paid tribute to Nehru’s legacy, recalling the “unprecedented contribution” that he had made to the nation. He also read out an excerpt from his influential work The Discovery of India to emphasize Nehru’s intellectual and political leadership.\\n\\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress leader and sister of Rahul Gandhi, paid a poignant tribute to Nehru, reminding everyone of his emphasis on fearlessness and devotion to selfless public service. She posted on X: “Fear is the root of all evil in the world. Even after we received our independence after decades long struggle and after innumerable sacrifices, even then there were people who used to do the politics of scaring and misleading the innocent public. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji opposed them very strongly and told the common people, ‘Don’t fear!’ People who create fear among the public cannot be true representatives of the public. Those public servants stand in the forefront with their heads held high so that people can live without fear. Pandit Nehru always taught the public to be fearless and serve selflessly, while on the other hand, he kept the public supreme at each and every stage of nation-building. Respectful salute to the creator of modern India.\\n\\nNehru and the Making of Contemporary India Jawaharlal Nehru was born in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, on November 14, 1889. His role was at the forefront of the struggle for India’s independence, and he was undoubtedly one of the most important leaders following the grant of independence in 1947. As India’s first prime minister, he greatly contributed to the political, economic, and social setup of the country. Although certainly based in modernity, science, and technology, Nehru’s vision of India was committed to democratic ideals and social justice.\\n\\nKey institutions which were going to define the India of growth – among other things, the Planning Commission, the IITs, and All India Radio – were established under Nehru. His foreign policy, with an emphasis on non-alignment and international cooperation, is perhaps one of the most significant factors in shaping India’s world position today.\\n\\nSignificance of Children’s Day\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru’s birthday is celebrated as National Children’s Day. This decision was taken by the Indian Parliament barely after his death in 1964. This event annually honors the love Nehru had for children and genuinely believed that children played a role in building a nation. On this day, schools across the country conduct various activities such as cultural functions, sports, and exhibitions to inspire young minds and remind them of Nehru’s values.\\n\\nNehru was particularly fond of children, often referring to them as “the future of the nation.” His policies to enhance the welfare of children were clearly visible in his policy measures concerning education and healthcare. He envisioned the rising generation becoming knowledge conscious, equal, and free.\\n\\nAlthough the United Nations had declared November 20 as Universal Children’s Day, India chose November 14 for Children’s Day to commemorate Nehru’s birthday, creating an indelible link between the statesman and India’s children.\\n\\nA Day of Remembrance and Tribute\\n\\nNovember 14 is remembered not only as a day of recalling Nehru’s service to the nation but also a day for reflection on the ideals that found form in India’s democratic foundations. Politically and socially, the Nehru legacy continues to define the Indian nation, while his dream remains a core spoke in discussions regarding progress in India. While the country celebrates this day, the name of Nehru continues to resonate in the hearts of millions, inspiring new generations to carry his torch of freedom, progress, and inclusiveness.\\n\\nAnd it is annually remembered as Jawaharlal Nehru, whose efforts to make India modern are celebrating the efforts through various commemorative events held by either the government and educational institutions.\\n\\nRead More : Chennai: Another Doctor Attacked In Govt Hospital; IMA Condemns ‘Heinous Crimes’', 'summary': \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 14 paid tribute to India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, on the day of his birthday anniversary.\\n\\n\\nThe post PM Modi Pays Tribute To Pandit Nehru On His Birth Anniversary appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/india/pm-modi-pays-tribute-to-pandit-nehru-on-his-birth-anniversary/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Elon-Musk-and-Trump.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 06:36:49', 'author': 'anirudh', 'authors': ['anirudh'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.367}, {'id': 264695698, 'title': 'Sidhant Gupta pens a heartfelt tribute for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on\\n his birth anniversary', 'text': 'Mumbai, Nov 14 (IANS) Actor Sidhant Gupta, who is set to essay the role of India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the upcoming OTT series ‘Freedom at Midnight’, has penned a beautiful poem as a tribute to the late political leader on his birth anniversary.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Sidhant took to his Instagram, and shared several monochromatic throwback pictures featuring Nehru.

Gabbard made false claims in 2022 about there being US-sponsored biolabs in Ukraine -- a key trope of Russian propaganda justifying Moscow\\'s invasion that year. She demanded US military withdrawal from Iraq and Syria during her 2020 presidential run. In 2019, Hillary Clinton said that Russia was grooming a US Democratic candidate for a third-party run, in comments that were apparently directed at Gabbard -- and strongly rejected by her.

This role sits at the top of the nation’s intelligence agencies and serves as the president’s main intelligence adviser. As per an AP report, Gabbard, who has over two decades of military experience, doesn’t have the traditional intelligence background of past directors. After leaving the Democratic Party in 2022, she endorsed Trump earlier this year, gaining popularity among his base. Here’s a closer look at Gabbard:First Hindu Elected to CongressGabbard, 43, born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, also spent part of her early years in the Philippines. She entered politics young, elected to Hawaii’s House of Representatives at 21, though she stepped down after one term to deploy with her National Guard unit in Iraq. Later, she became the first Hindu and American Samoan in Congress, representing Hawaii, and was sworn in on the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu text.Serving four terms, Gabbard often spoke out against her party’s leadership. She gained a progressive following by supporting Bernie Sanders in his 2016 Democratic primary run, earning national attention as a prominent progressive.Ran for President, Then Left the Democratic PartyGabbard ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020, focusing on her opposition to U.S. military interventions. Drawing from her military service, she argued that U.S. actions in the Middle East destabilised the region, made America less secure, and cost American lives. She also accused her party of not challenging these wars. In one debate, she criticised then-Senator Kamala Harris’s record as a prosecutor.She ultimately dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden. But in 2022, Gabbard left the Democratic Party, denouncing it as an “elitist cabal of warmongers” and criticising its focus on “woke” ideologies. Since then, she has supported high-profile Republicans, joined Fox News as a contributor, and launched a podcast. “Today’s Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,” she said.Rising Star in Trump’s CircleGabbard endorsed Trump earlier this year, quickly building support among his followers. Often seen with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who initially challenged Biden as a Democrat before endorsing Trump—Gabbard represents Trump’s claimed bipartisan appeal. She even helped Trump prepare for a debate against Harris this year, and in October, at a Trump rally in North Carolina, she announced her switch to the Republican Party, stating that today’s Democratic Party was “completely unrecognisable.”Trump has brought both Gabbard and Kennedy onto his transition team, giving them a chance to shape his administration’s policies and personnel if he returns to office.Military Veteran, Not an Intelligence InsiderGabbard’s military career spans over 20 years in the Army National Guard, with deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for her service in Operation Iraqi Freedom III, according to the Hawaii National Guard. Yet, unlike prior directors, she hasn’t held senior government intelligence roles. She did serve two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.Current director Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, held multiple high-level security and intelligence positions before her appointment and was the first woman in the role.Overseeing Trump’s Intelligence OverhaulTrump has signalled that he intends to revamp the intelligence agencies, which he perceives as untrustworthy. He has expressed his belief that U.S. intelligence agencies undermined his first term and sees them as part of a “deep state” of civil servants he doesn’t believe are loyal enough.“We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,” Trump said in 2023 when describing his second-term priorities. “The departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled.”The office of the director of national intelligence was created in 2004 to help U.S. intelligence agencies work together and prevent failures, following the Sept. 11 attacks. Today, the office focuses on threats like foreign election interference, cyber issues, terrorism, and espionage.With inputs from AP', 'summary': 'Donald Trump chose Tulsi Gabbard for a top intelligence job. Gabbard, the first Hindu in Congress, switched to the Republican Party. She served in the military and ran for president in 2020. Trump wants to change US intelligence agencies.

Now she has been asked to serve by Trump -- and lead US intelligence. Like few others in US politics, Gabbard defies simple party categorization -- a war veteran who denounces war, a Democrat turned Republican, a vegan climate activist who denounces liberal values, and now an establishment skeptic sent to head part of it. With her prolific media appearances and articulate, undistilled speaking style, Gabbard has built a loyal following in segments of both the right and the left. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in 2019 explaining her presidential ambitions, she said she wanted the United States to stop \"trying to police the world, no more overthrowing governments, an end to the new Cold War and nuclear arms race, and redirecting our resources to urgent needs at home.\" Rejecting the term isolationist, Gabbard denounced both Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Hillary Clinton for, in her view, believing that \"the only way to interact with other nations is by bombing them or starving them with draconian sanctions.\" Her skepticism has also led to heavy criticism of her judgment from more traditional US policymakers. In 2017, she publicly questioned US intelligence that found that Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons to kill dozens of people. Trump responded with a retaliatory missile strike -- boasting of toughness in contrast to his predecessor Barack Obama, who opposed intervention in Syria even though he had explicitly warned Assad of a \"red line\" against using chemical weapons. Gabbard pointed out that US intelligence had been wrong about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the stated reason for Bush\\'s war. On Syria, she told CNN at the time that on chemical weapons she did not want to \"blindly follow this escalation of a counterproductive regime-change war.\" She traveled to Syria to meet Assad, whom the United States was trying to isolate over the brutal civil war, saying that she wanted to find ways to reach peace. Gabbard did not spare Trump from criticism in his last term. When he ordered a strike in Baghdad that killed top Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qassem Soleimani, Gabbard said Trump carried out an \"illegal and unconstitutional act of war.\" Leading Hindu in US politics Gabbard has direct experience with war, having served in Iraq with the Army National Guard of her native Hawaii. Her father, born in American Samoa, continues to serve in the Hawaii State Senate and, in his own maverick stance, remains a Democrat despite prominently opposing LGBTQ rights. Gabbard\\'s mother, born on the US mainland, embraced Hinduism and raised her children in the tradition. Gabbard, whose first name Tulsi is a sacred plant in Hinduism, is a lifelong vegetarian and swore her oath to enter Congress on the Bhagavad Gita. Gabbard got married in a Hindu ceremony to a Hawaii-based cinematographer, Abraham Williams, who met her while shooting her campaign advertisements and proposed to her while surfing in the sunset. Her outspoken embrace of India\\'s Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi has alienated her from some of her left-wing supporters. However, during her tenure in Congress, Gabbard took a number of staunchly progressive domestic positions, calling for a complete transition away from fossil fuels to save the planet from climate change and advocating for the national legalization of marijuana. But in 2022, a year after leaving Congress, she announced that she was exiting the Democratic Party, saying it had turned into an \"elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness\" that stokes \"anti-white racism.\" Her strident tone led critics to believe she was auditioning for roles in a future Republican administration, a view reinforced when she appeared beside Trump in his latest campaign and announced she was becoming a Republican. Trump had welcomed her, she said, and had turned the Republicans into \"the party of peace.\"', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/who-is-tulsi-gabbard-trumps-pick-for-director-of-national-intelligence-1838083', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/14/1862542-ezgif-4-d83bdeddfb.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 03:46:27', 'author': 'AFP', 'authors': ['AFP'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.285}, {'id': 264687108, 'title': 'Who Is Tulsi Gabbard, The First Hindu-American Whom Trump Made US National Intelligence Chief?', 'text': 'Tulsi Gabbard has become first Hindu-American to become Director of National Intelligence in the US.

This position places Gabbard at the helm of the nation’s intelligence agencies, serving as the president’s chief intelligence advisor. This move comes ahead of Trump’s second-term inauguration in January and is expected to significantly shape U.S. intelligence policies.\\n\\nWho Is Tulsi Gabbard? A Unique Political Journey\\n\\nBorn in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has always stood out in the political landscape. At 43, she became the first Hindu elected to Congress and the first American Samoan to represent the United States in the House of Representatives. Her political career began early—elected to Hawaii’s state legislature at the age of 21, Gabbard soon took a leave of absence to serve with her National Guard unit in Iraq from 2004 to 2005. She would later become a major in the Hawaii National Guard and, eventually, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves.\\n\\nGabbard’s tenure in Congress from 2013 to 2021 was marked by her vocal criticism of both party leaderships and U.S. foreign policy. A progressive voice during the 2016 Democratic primaries, Gabbard threw her support behind Bernie Sanders, gaining national recognition. Her appeal to a wide range of voters came from her strong stance on anti-interventionist policies and her criticism of the U.S. military’s global presence. She also served on the House Homeland Security Committee, adding a degree of experience relevant to her upcoming role in national intelligence.\\n\\nA Surprising Shift: From Democrat to Independent to Republican Supporter\\n\\nGabbard’s political evolution took a dramatic turn in 2022, when she left the Democratic Party to become an independent. She denounced the party as an “elitist cabal of warmongers,” expressing disdain for what she viewed as an excessive focus on “woke” ideologies. This marked the beginning of her estrangement from the left, and soon after, she became an outspoken critic of President Joe Biden and his administration.\\n\\nHer ideological shift found her aligning more closely with conservative viewpoints, and she became increasingly popular among Trump supporters. Gabbard’s endorsement of Trump in early 2023 cemented her place in his orbit. In October of that year, she officially announced her switch to the Republican Party, declaring that the modern-day Democratic Party was “unrecognizable” from what it once was.\\n\\nHer growing ties to the Republican Party culminated in her role within Trump’s transition team, where she is expected to help shape Trump’s policies and personnel choices if he returns to office.\\n\\nGabbard’s Military Service: A Stepping Stone to National Intelligence\\n\\nDespite Gabbard’s lack of formal intelligence experience, her extensive military background makes her an intriguing choice for DNI. Her service in Iraq and Kuwait with the Hawaii National Guard gave her firsthand exposure to the challenges of global security. She was awarded the Combat Medical Badge in recognition of her service during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2005.\\n\\nThough Gabbard has not held senior roles within intelligence agencies, her military expertise and long-standing commitment to national security give her a unique perspective on intelligence matters. President Trump himself emphasized Gabbard’s fearless spirit, noting that she would bring her two decades of service to the intelligence community, helping secure America’s constitutional rights and ensuring the nation’s security.\\n\\n“I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength,” Trump said in his statement. He also praised her decades of dedication to the freedom of America and its citizens.\\n\\nA Challenging Role Amid a Changing Landscape\\n\\nGabbard’s confirmation is expected to proceed smoothly in the Senate, where Republicans will hold a slim majority of at least 52-to-48 starting in January. Given her strong connections to the Republican Party, her confirmation is not expected to face significant opposition.\\n\\nHer appointment comes at a pivotal time for the U.S. intelligence community, which has faced mounting criticism under the Trump administration. Trump has long claimed that U.S. intelligence agencies undermined his first term, describing them as part of a “deep state” of bureaucrats who lacked loyalty to his administration. As part of his second-term agenda, Trump has promised to overhaul the intelligence agencies, and Gabbard’s appointment signals a new direction for national security policies, particularly concerning U.S. foreign interventions.\\n\\nThe position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created in 2004 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve coordination among U.S. intelligence agencies and prevent intelligence failures. Today, the DNI oversees agencies tasked with addressing issues such as foreign election interference, cybersecurity, terrorism, and espionage.\\n\\nGabbard’s political stance, particularly her advocacy for non-interventionism, aligns with Trump’s “America First” foreign policy. Her views on limiting U.S. military presence abroad could lead to a shift in how intelligence resources are allocated and how national security threats are assessed.\\n\\nA Bold Choice for the Future of U.S. Intelligence\\n\\nTulsi Gabbard’s appointment as Director of National Intelligence may have raised eyebrows, but it is a move in line with the Trump administration’s broader agenda of shaking up the establishment. While her lack of formal intelligence experience may be seen as a challenge, her military background and willingness to question the status quo offer a fresh perspective on national security. Her role in shaping U.S. intelligence policies will be closely watched, as she faces the dual challenge of modernizing the intelligence community while adhering to her commitment to constitutional freedoms and non-interventionist principles.\\n\\nWhether Gabbard’s appointment represents a step toward a more isolationist foreign policy or a reshaping of U.S. intelligence priorities, it is clear that she is poised to make a significant impact in the Trump administration’s national security strategy.\\n\\nALSO READ: 115,000 Users Quit X After Trump Victory – Is This The Start Of A Social Media Shift?', 'summary': 'Gabbard served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021, during which time she voiced her opposition to the policies pursued by the party she once belonged to.

The WPI for October 2023 was pegged at 8.39 per cent.The wholesale inflation, measured using the Wholesale Price Index, was expected to be at 2.2 per cent, according to economists polled by Reuters.Previously, India’s retail inflation unexpectedly surged to a 14-month high of 6.2% in October, up from 5.5% in September, further delaying the prospect of monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) amid the economy showing signs of slowing. An increase in vegetable, fruit and edible oil prices was the primary driver of the spike, official data released Tuesday showed. The rate breached the outer bounds of the central bank’s inflation target — 4% with a two percentage point tolerance band on either side—for the first time since August 2023.The WPI measures the price of a representative basket of wholesale goods. In India, wholesale price index is divided into three groups: Primary Articles (22.6 percent of total weight); Fuel and Power (13.2 percent); and Manufactured Products (64.2 percent).Food remains costly affairFood prices have always played a significant role in shaping India's inflation picture. The current consumer price inflation (CPI) basket assigns a weight of 46% to food, a figure that many argue needs to be revisited as consumption patterns evolve.As significant portion of 1.4 billion people spend most of their income on food, India's inflation index is heavily influenced by food prices.Experts had earlier indicated that a higher food inflation number could keep overall inflation from declining significantly.Prices of key vegetables such as onion, tomato and potato have risen and a Crisil analysis recently showed the cost of a veg thali in India rose 11% on year in September. Concerns also persist regarding the impact of weather variations on inflation and economic stability.The RBI in its latest bulletin said volatility in food prices remains a contingent risk even as recent easing in retail prices will help boost private consumption.RBI's stanceDuring the latest rate-setting panel meeting, the MPC left its inflation forecast for this fiscal year (FY25) unchanged at 4.5 per cent, even amid caution on food price trajectory that may hurt core inflation along with geopolitical tensions which pose a threat to any comfort on crude prices.The central bank now sees inflation for Q2, Q3 and Q4 of this fiscal year at 4.1%, 4.8%, and 4.2%, respectively. In the August policy, the monetary authority had pegged the inflation readings at 4.4%, 4.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Inflation stood at 4.9% in the first quarter.The inflation forecast for the first quarter of the next fiscal year is projected at 4.3%.India's food inflation has averaged 6.3% between June 2020 and June 2024, a central bank study published in August showed, compared to 2.9% in the previous four years. It eased slightly in July and August due to statistical base effects but is expected to have risen again last month.The Reserve Bank of India-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Wednesday retained repo rate.

Inflation in October has risen from 1.84 per cent in September, primarily due to an increase in prices of food articles which jumped by 13.57 per cent during the month as vegetables such as potatoes and onions turned costlier following the damage to crops caused by the late withdrawal of the monsoon. The wholesale price inflation in manufactured goods, which have a weightage of over 64 per cent in the index, rose by 1.5 per cent. There was a decline in prices in the fuel and power category with the inflation rate at a negative (-) 5.79 per cent, according to the official figures. Data released on Tuesday showed the country\\'s retail price inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 6.21 per cent in October as higher prices of food items such as vegetables spiked during the month. Retail inflation has increased from 5.49 per cent recorded in September as the prices of vegetables surged by as much as 42.18 per cent in October as the late withdrawal of the monsoon this year resulted in damage to crops and reduced supply in the market. This is the first time that the rate of retail inflation has crossed the RBI\\'s upper limit of 6 per cent. The RBI is waiting for the retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth. Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that although the RBI had shifted towards a softer neutral monetary policy stance to spur growth, this did not mean that an interest rate cut would happen immediately. Addressing a media event, the RBI Governor said: \"A change in stance doesn\\'t mean there will be a rate cut in the very next monetary policy meeting.\" He said there were still significant upside risks to inflation and \"a rate cut at this stage would be very risky\".

Fortunately, no injuries were reported, but this incident has raised alarms about ambulance safety standards in India, particularly following a similar explosion in Uttar Pradesh. Officials are now calling for stricter regulations to ensure the safety of patients in transit.\\n\\nA Close Call for Patients \\n\\nIn a terrifying incident in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, a pregnant woman was being transported in an ambulance when the driver, Vivek Gupta, spotted smoke emanating from the vehicle’s engine. Acting quickly, he evacuated the family just moments before the oxygen cylinder exploded, causing significant damage to the ambulance and shattering windows of nearby homes. Eyewitnesses described the explosion as loud enough to be heard from a distance, but thankfully, all passengers escaped unharmed. Gupta’s prompt response was crucial in preventing what could have been a tragic outcome.\\n\\nRising Concerns Over Ambulance Safety \\n\\nThis incident is part of a troubling trend regarding ambulance safety in India. There have been several accidents involving oxygen cylinder explosions that have raised concerns about the safety protocols followed by ambulance services. Health officials are advocating for stricter compliance with safety regulations to prevent such incidents from recurring. Recommendations for improving ambulance safety include secure patient compartments and proper equipment mounting systems to avoid injuries during transport. However, the absence of federally mandated safety standards has resulted in inconsistencies across states regarding ambulance design and operation.\\n\\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective \\n\\nAt The Logical Indian, we believe that every life is precious and that ensuring the safety of patients during emergencies is paramount. The recent explosion serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for improved regulations and adherence to safety standards in ambulances across India. As we reflect on these incidents, we must ask ourselves: what steps can be taken to guarantee that all ambulances are equipped with the necessary safety features to protect those who rely on them during critical moments? We encourage our readers to share their thoughts and suggestions on how we can collectively advocate for better emergency medical services in our communities.\\n\\nPregnant Woman Has Narrow Escape As Oxygen Cylinder In Ambulance Explodes in Jalgaon of Maharashtra. pic.twitter.com/PvQPkQZJEY— Aditya Raj Kaul (@AdityaRajKaul) November 13, 2024', 'summary': 'Pregnant Woman Escapes Unharmed as Ambulance Oxygen Cylinder Explodes in Maharashtra.', 'url': 'https://thelogicalindian.com/the-logical-indian/pregnant-womans-narrow-escape-as-ambulance-oxygen-cylinder-explodes-in-maharashtra/', 'image': 'https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Social-Thumbnail-Template-94.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 05:53:04', 'author': 'News Desk', 'authors': ['News Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.192}, {'id': 264699066, 'title': 'Viral Video: Oxygen Cylinder Explodes In Ambulance In Maharashtra; Driver Saves Pregnant Woman', 'text': 'A dramatic and scary incident, an ambulance blasted in Maharashtras Jalgaon on Wednesday evening.

with new leftist President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s party expected to secure a big majority to drive through economic reforms.\\nThe 55-year-old hopes to grab two-thirds of the legislature’s 225 seats to press ahead with reforms after the country’s economic meltdown in 2022, when then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted.\\nDissanayake took power after sweeping September elections on a promise to combat graft and recover the country’s stolen assets.\\nVoting booths on the South Asian island will close at 4:00 pm (1030 GMT), with 17.1 million people choosing between 8,800 candidates after a seven-week-long campaign that election monitors say was one of the most peaceful in the country.\\nInitial results are expected on Friday.\\nElection officials said over 80,000 police officers — backed by monitoring drones — have been deployed at the country’s more than 13,000 polling booths.\\nDissanayake’s JVP, or the People’s Liberation Front, is the main constituent of the National People’s Power (NPP) coalition of professionals seeking to form the next government.\\nThe NPP held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.\\nDissanayake had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister, but he has distanced himself from traditional politicians accused of leading the country to its worst economic crisis two years ago.\\nHis JVP party led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987, leading to at least 80,000 deaths, but Dissanayake took power peacefully in elections on September 21.\\nFOREGONE CONCLUSION\\nDespite previous promises to renegotiate a controversial $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout secured by his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, Dissanayake has chosen to maintain the agreement with the international lender.\\nThe country’s main private sector lobby, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, is tacitly supporting Dissanayake and expects him to press ahead with reforms.\\n“Continuing reforms… could encourage both investor confidence and fiscal discipline, setting a foundation for sustainable growth,” CCC Secretary Bhuwanekabahu Perera told AFP ahead of voting.\\nHe said Dissanayake’s approach to

polls.\\nPolitical analyst Kusal Perera said there was little campaigning by opposition parties.\\n“The opposition is dead,” Perera said. “The result of the election is a foregone conclusion.”\\nOver 60 senior politicians from the previous administration have opted to stay out.\\nThe outgoing parliament was dominated by the party of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa — the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), or the People’s Front — but it has since splintered.\\nRajapaksa is not contesting, but his son Namal, a former sports minister, is seeking re-election.', 'summary': \"Sri Lankans are

The voting started at 7 am and will continue till 4 pm local time. The counting will start soon after the closing of polls.Voters turned out in steady streams during the first hour of the polls, election officials said.Over 17 million voters from the island\\'s 21 million population are eligible to vote for the 225-member Parliament for a five-year term.Nearly 90,000 security personnel from the police and the military are deployed to provide security at the election venues.Thursday\\'s vote would be the first major test of the popularity of the ruling party, National People\\'s Power, led by President Dissanayake.Having failed to secure 50 per cent of the vote at the September 21 presidential election, Dissanayake is pleading for a stronger parliament with well over a simple majority of 113 seats to implement his anti-corruption accountability reformist programme.This will be the first parliamentary election since Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Since assuming office, Dissanayake has stayed on course with his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe\\'s International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout programme.The country is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in history as the Dissanayake government faces the challenge of meeting the IMF targets on revenue in the third review of the USD 2.9 billion programme.As many as 196 members are to be elected from the 22 districts based on the proportional representation system while 29 would be elected from the cumulative votes polled national list to provide a 225-member Parliament for a five-year term.Political parties and independent groups file lists of candidates for each district. Seats are allocated proportionately according to the votes polled.Individual MPs get elected based on the preferential votes cast in their favour. Each voter is entitled to mark three individual preferences.Wickremesinghe, who lost to Dissanayake in last month\\'s presidential election, has not been contesting the parliamentary election for the first time since 1977.The Rajapaksa brothers - Mahinda, Gotabaya, Chamal and Basil too are not contesting this election after decades-long representation.Scores of ministers and deputies from the past regime have opted out of the race.Under the complex proportional representation system, Dissanayake\\'s NPP will be hard-pressed to gain the absolute majority required for initiating major reforms such as overhauling the presidential system.\"We should win big enough to make them cry,\" Dissanayake said, referring to the ruling classes against whom his party had run two bloody rebellions.After Dissanayake\\'s win in the presidential election held in September, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Wickremesinghe-backed New Democratic Front (NDF) seemed to have thrown a feeble challenge to gain control of Parliament, the analysts noted.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/neighbours/sri-lankans-vote-in-parliamentary-election-1838085', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/14/1862551-ezgif-3-c92533cf76.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 04:27:28', 'author': 'PTI', 'authors': ['PTI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.212}, {'id': 264714698, 'title': 'Why Sri Lanka’s Parliamentary Election Is Vital For Marxist-Inclined President Anura Dissanayake?', 'text': 'Sri Lankans on Thursday began casting their ballots in a snap parliamentary election widely considered to be a chance for the new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to secure an imperative mandate for his pro-poor policies. Dissanayake, known for his left and welfare-friendly agenda, would seek to attain parliamentary support to push through reforms that include expansion of welfare programs and renegotiation of terms under the IMF bailout.\\n\\nDissanayake, who assumed the presidency in September by bagging almost 43% of votes, will have to contend with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya party of Sajith Premadasa that is talking about a state interventionist and market-oriented policy. A financial crisis that has recently gripped the country has left it to deal with high living costs particularly for the poor classes. Economic recovery appears slow and fragile when Sri Lanka secured bailout support valued at $2.9 billion from the IMF.\\n\\nGet Parliamentary Backing for Reforms\\n\\nGiven Sri Lanka’s proportion representation system in a 225-member parliament, it is hard for any single party to gain an absolute majority, meaning Dissanayake must win over half the votes to become a majority for his policies. As an “outsider” to Colombo’s political elite, which has traditionally been run by influential families, he has used his party as an advocate for anti-poverty measures and anti-corruption.\\n\\nA Push to Reframe the IMF Bailout\\n\\nRenegotiating some parts of the IMF bailout package is the top priority for Ratnatunga, where his administration will be able to reduce income taxes and increase social welfare. The government is already under pressure to stick to the IMF’s target of a 2.3% primary budget surplus, but there could be concerns that Dissanayake’s method may also delay future installments.\\n\\n“In past elections, people did not have confidence in us but in September people gave us victory and proved that we are a winning party and we can form a government. The next task is to unite people from the four corners of this country and build a powerful people’s movement,” Dissanayake said during a campaign rally on Sunday.\\n\\nNew Political Dawn for Sri Lanka?\\n\\nVoters, including 32-year-old Umeshi Perera of Colombo, voiced cautious optimism: “I think we are seeing the first signs of a positive political change in Sri Lanka after the president was elected and we should give him a chance to continue that change.”\\n\\nDissanayake’s National People’s Power (NPP), founded in 2019, has a number of political newcomers among its slate. Thursday will decide 196 of the country’s 225 parliamentary seats, and 29 “national list” seats will be allocated according to party vote share.

In his statement, Trump praised Rubio as “a very powerful voice for freedom” and a “fearless warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.”Here are 5 facts about Marco Rubio and his career: 1) Early life and immigrant rootsBorn in 1971 in Miami, Florida, Marco Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who came to America in pursuit of their American Dream. His father worked as a banquet bartender, while his mother balanced being a stay-at-home mom with working as a hotel maid. From a young age, Rubio learned the values of faith, family, community, and hard work.2) A career in public service before becoming a US senator in 2010Rubio served in various roles, including as a city commissioner in West Miami and as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. In 2010, he won a seat in the US Senate. The Center for Effective Law Making ranked Rubio as the most effective Republican, while the Lugar Center named him one of the most bipartisan senators. His work includes expanding the child tax credit, reforming the VA system, supporting small businesses during the pandemic, reshaping US policy towards China and strengthening national security.3) 2016 Presidential bidIn April 2015, Marco Rubio entered the US presidential race. Early on, he was the choice of the Republican establishment. But by February 2016, his campaign was struggling, winning just one state and trailing behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the delegate count. Rubio\\'s campaign was heavily impacted by Trump\\'s mockery, with Trump dubbing him “Little Marco” and Rubio responding by calling Trump “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency.” After losing the Florida primary in March 2016, Rubio suspended his campaign. Though initially considering leaving politics, Rubio returned to the Senate race, winning re-election in 2016. Following Trump\\'s victory, Rubio shifted toward a conservative populist stance, becoming a key ally of the new president.4) Legislative achievementsThroughout his Senate tenure, Rubio has championed a wide range of policies aimed at improving the lives of everyday Americans. He played a key role in expanding the child tax credit for working families and reforming the US Department of Veterans Affairs, particularly securing healthcare for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. During the pandemic lockdown, Rubio helped pass the Paycheck Protection Program, keeping millions of small businesses afloat. He also wrote and passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which marked a significant shift in US-China relations.5) Family lifeRubio often underlines that being a father is his most important role. He lost his own father just two months before his election to the US Senate, but his lessons of hard work, responsibility, and family continue to guide him. He met his wife, Jeanette, a fellow Miami native, through mutual friends, and they married in 1998. They have four children — Amanda, Daniella, Anthony and Dominick.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\")', 'summary': 'US President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a prominent critic of China, for the position of US Secretary of State.', 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-marco-rubio-donald-trump-s-nominee-for-us-secretary-of-state-7016545', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/4dcjqha_marco-rubio_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 07:38:37', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.262}, {'id': 264682230, 'title': 'Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers amid city’s rising air pollution', 'text': 'As Delhi continues to grapple with ‘severe’ air pollution, the Delhi Airport on Thursday issued an advisory for passengers and informed that all flight operations are currently normal, however, ‘Low Visibility Procedures’ are in progress at the airport.

Addressing a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra today, Rahul said that the Prime Minister says that I show the Constitution in public meetings that is empty. “Sanvidhan unke liye khali hai kyuki unhone ise zindagi mein pada nahi hai (The Constitution seems empty to him because he’s never read it in his life),” Rahul Gandhi said in a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra’s Nandurbar. Attacking the Prime Minister further, the Congress leader said that the Constitution is not blank, but carries thoughts and ideas of thousand years.“He has no idea what’s written inside this book; that’s why he says it’s empty. He says Rahul Gandhi shows a red book. It doesn’t matter to us what colour the book is; what matters is what’s written inside it. We are ready to give our lives for what it represents,” Rahul Gandhi said.“I want to explain to the Prime Minister that this Constitution is not hollow. It is filled with thousands of years of thought. When you call it hollow, you disrespect Birsa Munda, Mahatma Gandhi, Ambedkar, and others. This fight is about protecting it,” he added.Earlier, Prime Minister Modi attacked Rahul Gandhi saying the “Laal Kitab” of the Constitution which the Congress was flaunting contained “nothing”.“In ‘farziwada’, Congress has broken its own record. The ‘Laal Kitab’ of the Constitution which the Congress party was flaunting and distributing contained ‘nothing’. It was an empty book. This is nothing but a testament to Congress’ disregard and hate for Baba Saheb Ambedkar. The entire country is in shock over this foolish and unfortunate political play of Congress,” PM Modi said.Further in his address, the Lok Sabha LoP slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party over tribal population, and alleged that the Prime Minister and the BJP-RSS call indigenous people “Vanvasi” (forest dwellers) and carry out deforestation across the country. “Congress introduced the Land Acquisition Bill to protect your land. The Tribal Rights Act granted you rights to the forest, land, and water. But as soon as the BJP government comes to power, they take your land and hand it over to billionaires. The term “Vanvasi” implies that your children should not become doctors or engineers, should not get jobs, and should not do business. “Adivasi,” on the other hand, means that your children can achieve anything. That is the difference between “Adivasi” and “Vanvasi,” Rahul said.He further pointed out that in India, the Adivasi population is eight per cent, and their participation should match this percentage. “I investigated the representation of Adivasis in the Indian government. There are 90 officials who run the government. If the government spends 100 rupees, how many Adivasi officials make decisions about it? Adivasi officials make decisions over just 10 paise of that amount. Out of 90, there is only one Adivasi official, who is side-lined. We need to change this, and the way to do it is through a caste census,” the Congress leader said.The Lok Sabha LoP asserted that the Congress party has decided that as much money the Prime Minister waives off for billionaires, they will give to the common people.Highlighting his guarantees, the Congress MP said that under the Mahalaxmi Yojana, on the first day of every month, women will receive Rs 3,000 directly in their accounts. “After that, we will provide free bus travel for women. Farmers will have up to three lakh rupees of debt waived. When farmers sell paddy, cotton, or soybeans, our government will provide MSP (Minimum Support Price).

The maximum temperature in Delhi (Safdarjung) dropped from 32.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 27.8 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. \\nBihar’s Hajipur, with an AQI of 417, had the second-worst reading in the country on Wednesday, the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) data showed. Of the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi, 30 recorded the air quality in the “severe” category, the CPCB said. \\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, 401 and 450 “severe” and above 450 “severe plus”. According to the CPCB, Delhi’s AQI was in the “severe” category for three days in January.

The other prominent pollutants were PM2.5 and PM10. PM2.5 and PM10 refer to fine particulate matters in the air, with the numbers indicating their size in micrometre. \\nPM2.5 are fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometre or less, about the width of a human hair. These are so small that these can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing significant health risks. \\nPM10 are coarser particles with a diameter of 10 micrometre or less, about the width of 10 human hairs. While not as concerning as PM2.5, these can still irritate the airways and worsen respiratory problems. Long-term exposure to these particulate matters can increase the risk of heart disease. \\nAccording to the latest CPCB data, Delhi’s annual average PM10 and PM2.5 levels were higher by 5 per cent and 7 per cent respectively between January 1 and November 12 against the year-ago period. \\nBetween January 1 and November 12, the capital witnessed 116 days when the AQI was in the “poor”, “very poor” or “severe” categories. The AQI on 201 days was “good”, “satisfactory” or “moderate”, the data showed. \\nL M Darlong, the head of thoracic oncosurgery at the Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, told PTI that long-term exposure to PM2.5 poses a significant risk of lung cancer. These fine particles can trigger mutations in the lung cells, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Over a decade of exposure, these mutations are often linked to genes that play a key role in regulating cell division, Darlong said. \\nEarly detection of lung cancer is critical as symptoms such as persistent cough or blood in sputum often appear only at later stages, making treatment more challenging, he added. The fog led to limited visibility in the morning, with conditions at the Delhi airport dropping to zero. This marked a notable shift in the capital’s climate and a few flights were diverted due to the low visibility, an official said. \\nZero-metre visibility was recorded at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport at 8:30 am, with the Runway Visual Range varying between 125 metres and 500 metres at different locations, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported. \\n“Very dense” fog began forming around 5:30 am, casting a thick haze over various parts of the national capital, it noted. \\n“By morning, a heavy layer of fog blanketed the city, reducing visibility to as low as 125 metres in certain areas,” an IMD official said. The weather department has forecast a largely clear sky for Thursday, with predominant surface winds likely from the northwest at a speed of less than 6 kilometres per hour during the morning hours. \\nThe IMD has also said smog or dense to very dense fog is expected in the morning.

The servers and collaborators of the headquarters building were removed as a precautionary measure”. The Supreme Court said that the investigation is underway and they are waiting for the facts to come out. It was also noted that the President of Brazil’s Supreme Court, Luis Roberto Barroso spoke with the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva along with other senior officials of the country.Al Jazeera reported that the Supreme Court buildings will undergo a complete sweep in the early hours of Thursday morning. The office hours were suspended until noon in all buildings, and the situation will be reassessed throughout the morningLocal media have reported that the explosions took place near the Supreme Court and along a street near an annexe building, where a car was parked. Some witnesses said they saw smoke pouring from the car’s boot before the second explosion in front of the court.No motive has been released yet in Wednesday’s bombing incident, nor has a suspect been identified. Al Jazeera noted that Celina Leao, the vice-governor of the Federal District, where the capital is located, said that at least one of the explosions coincided with an unknown individual approaching the doors of the Supreme Court. She indicated he was the same man reported dead in the explosion. She shared her press briefing on X. \\n\\nO Governo do Distrito Federal está no comando e empenhado em garantir a segurança e tranquilidade de todos.

Then he approached the Supreme Court and tried to get in the building. He failed and then there were the other explosions,” Leao said in a news conference.Local media reported that the car that exploded belonged to a member of Brazil's Liberal Party, the same of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Leao said only investigations will determine whether the owner of the car is the same man who died in the blasts.Leao recommended that Congress be closed Thursday to avoid new risks. Brazil's Senate heeded her call and the lower house will be shut until noon, speaker Arthur Lira said.“It could have been a lone wolf, like others we've seen around the world,” Leao said in a news conference. “We are considering it as a suicide because there was only one victim. But investigations will show if that was indeed the case.” Leao added only forensics will be able to identify the body, which remained outside the Supreme Court for three hours after the blasts.The blasts outside the Supreme Court took place about 20 seconds apart in Brasilia's Three Powers Plaza, where Brazil's main government buildings, including the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace, are located.President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was not in the neighbouring presidential palace at the time, spokesman Jose Chrispiniano said.Police blocked all access to the area and the presidential security bureau was conducting a sweep of the grounds around the presidential palace.Brazil's federal police said it is investigating and did not provide a motive.The Supreme Court in recent years has become a target for threats by far-right groups and supporters of Bolsonaro's due to its crackdown on the spread of false information. In particular, Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been a focus for their ire.Lula's spokesman said that late on Wednesday the leftist leader was gathering at the presidential residence with federal police chief Andrei Rodrigues, and Supreme Court Justices de Moraes and Cristiano Zanin.

Matt Gaetz of Florida to serve as his attorney general on Wednesday, bypassing more experienced options in favor of a loyalist who has built a national reputation as a disruptor and whom Trump has tasked with dramatically overhauling the Justice Department. Trump also announced that he had tapped Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as his nominee for secretary of state. And he selected Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress and presidential candidate, to serve as his director of national intelligence. The choices continued a pattern of Trump stocking his Cabinet with those he believes he can trust to execute his agenda rather than longtime officials with experience in their fields. Gaetz\\'s selection, in particular, was seen as a shock. The Florida lawmaker was not among the more established attorneys who had been mentioned as contenders for the job, and even his colleagues in Congress appeared stunned by the news. “Everybody was saying, ‘Oh my God,’\" said Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. “That was about as big a surprise as I’ve had in a long time.\" Gaetz resigned from his House seat Wednesday evening. Trump announced the decision in a post in his Truth Social network, saying Gaetz would “root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the Department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy and Constitution.” If confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, Gaetz would instantly become one of the most closely watched members of Trump’s Cabinet given his avowed loyalty to a president-elect who has threatened to pursue retribution against perceived adversaries.Gaetz represents much of the Florida Panhandle and became a conservative star when he joined Congress, appearing as a frequent staunch defender of Trump on cable news. He irked fellow GOP members in early 2023 when he filed the resolution that successfully ousted former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy then helped fund a primary challenge to Gaetz that included commercials alleging that he paid for sex with a 17-year-old, an allegation that had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee — though that probe effectively ended Wednesday when Gaetz resigned from Congress. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing and the Justice Department ended its own sex trafficking investigation without bringing charges against him. House Republicans first got wind of the nomination during a private meeting and initially thought the news was a joke before realizing Trump had indeed named Gaetz to serve as the nation\\'s chief law officer. GOP Rep. Max Miller told reporters the shock in the room was more a reflection of members\\' happiness that the Florida Republican will no longer be a member of the chamber after years of instigating intraparty battles. Even Trump’s allies in the Senate were keeping their distance. “We’ll see,” said Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin when asked whether he would vote to confirm the congressman. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, suggested that the Senate would look closely into Gaetz, including the House Ethics Committee investigation. “I’m sure it will make for a popcorn-eating confirmation hearing,” said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who serves on the committee that will take up the Gaetz nomination, said it would be \"the first test of whether Republicans are willing to stand up to Donald Trump and go with conscience and conviction as opposed to just politics.” The announcement came shortly after Trump confirmed that he had picked Rubio, a conservative lawmaker, as the nation’s top diplomat. A onetime critic who evolved into one of the president-elect’s fiercest defenders, Rubio is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate this summer. He would be the first Latino in the job if confirmed. On Capitol Hill, Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has pushed for taking a harder line against China and has targeted social media app TikTok because its parent company is Chinese. He and other lawmakers contend that Beijing could demand access to the data of users whenever it wants. “He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,” Trump said of Rubio in a statement. Trump made the personnel announcements while flying back back to Florida from Washington after meeting with President Joe Biden. The president-elect had been expected...', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-picks-matt-gaetz-for-attorney-general-marco-rubio-for-secretary-of-state-1838070', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/14/1862518-aa-3454598.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 01:35:57', 'author': 'DC Correspondent', 'authors': ['DC Correspondent'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.113}, {'id': 264665226, 'title': 'Donald Trump picks former rival Marco Rubio for secretary of state', 'text': \"WASHINGTON: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump officially announced on Wednesday he is nominating Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of both the foreign relations and intelligence committees and former political rival, to be secretary of state. He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries, Trump said in a statement. The choice could come as a relief to U.S. partners worried that the Trump administration could pull back from its global network of alliances, including NATO, given Trump's more America First approach to foreign affairs. Rumors of Rubio's selection had prompted criticism from some members of the Republican party who saw his foreign policy views as too traditional and internationalist. Rubio, 53, is known as a China hawk, outspoken critic of Cuba's Communist government and strong backer of Israel. He has in the past advocated for a more assertive U.S. foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, although recently his views have aligned more closely with those of Trump's America First approach to foreign policy. In April, Rubio was one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a big military aid package to help Ukraine resist Russia and support other U.S. partners, including Israel. Trump has been critical of Democratic President Joe Biden's continuing military assistance for Ukraine as it fights Russian invaders. Rubio has said in recent interviews that Kyiv needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Russia rather than focus on regaining all territory Moscow has taken in the last decade. On the Gaza war, like Trump, Rubio has been staunchly behind Israel, calling Hamas a terrorist organization that must be eliminated and saying America's role is to resupply Israel with the military materials needed to finish the job. Rubio is a top Senate China hawk, and Beijing imposed sanctions on him in 2020 over his stance on Hong Kong's democracy protests. This could create difficulties for any attempts to maintain the Biden administration's effort to keep up diplomatic engagement with Beijing to avoid an unintended conflict. Among other things, Rubio shepherded an act through Congress that gave Washington a new tool to bar Chinese imports over China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims and has also pushed a bill that would decertify Hong Kong's U.S. economic and trade offices. WILL HE STAND UP TO TRUMP? Rubio had also become a strong Trump backer, after harshly criticizing him when he ran against the former real estate developer for president in 2016. In 2016 Trump helped end Rubio's run for the presidential nomination by nicknaming him Little Marco. Some analysts questioned whether he would stand up to Trump, noting the president-elect's inclination to make personal loyalty a central requirement for administration posts. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said it is essential for any president's advisers to stand up to him when necessary, given the wide array of foreign policy challenges Trump will face. I'm trying to keep an open mind here, Miller said, noting that Rubio, because of his experience in Congress, has a better grasp of foreign policy than any of Trump's other appointees. The three-term Republican senator should easily win confirmation in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans will hold at least a 52-48 majority starting in January. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the intelligence committee, quickly issued a statement praising the choice of Rubio, the panel's vice chairman. I have worked with Marco Rubio for more than a decade on the Intelligence Committee, particularly closely in the last couple of years in his role as Vice Chairman, and while we don't always agree, he is smart, talented, and will be a strong voice for American interests around the globe, Warner said in a statement. Rubio, the son of immigrants from Cuba, will be the first Latino to serve as America's top diplomat.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for Secretary of State.

First Hindu US Congresswoman Appointed US Intel Chief by Donald Trump', 'text': \"Washington: President-elect Donald Trump recently made a significant announcement, naming Tulsi Gabbard as his choice for Director of National Intelligence (DNI). This position would place her in charge of overseeing 18 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and FBI, and preparing the President’s Daily Brief. While the role is crucial for national security, Gabbard's appointment signals a shift in foreign policy priorities, aligning with Trump’s approach of appointing advisers who are deeply skeptical of U.S. military interventions abroad.Early Political Career and Military ServiceTulsi Gabbard, a Samoan-American and a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, served in Iraq and was deployed in the Middle East. She began her political career as a Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii, serving from 2013 to 2021. Known for her strong stance on foreign policy, Gabbard gained national attention for her criticism of US military involvement overseas, especially in the Middle East. Her military experience gives her a unique perspective on the cost of wars, which she believes have destabilized regions and made the US less safe.Shift in Political Views: From Democrat to IndependentGabbard was initially popular with progressives, especially for her support of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential race. However, her views began to diverge from mainstream Democratic politics. She became increasingly vocal against the 'elitist cabal of warmongers' in the Democratic Party, which she claimed controlled foreign policy decisions. In 2020, she ran for president, campaigning on the idea that U.S. involvement in foreign wars was damaging to both the U.S. and the world. After endorsing Joe Biden , Gabbard ultimately left the Democratic Party in 2022, declaring herself an independent.Since then, she has gained support from Republicans and right-wing circles. She has also become a regular commentator on Fox News, where she discusses foreign policy and the issues she believes matter most for America’s future.Criticism of U.S. Foreign Policy and Military InterventionsThroughout her career, Gabbard has consistently criticized US military interventions in the Middle East. She argues that such wars, including the Iraq War and the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, have led to the loss of thousands of lives and wasted American taxpayer money. As the Director of National Intelligence, she is expected to apply this same critical lens to US intelligence strategies, with an emphasis on reducing unnecessary military interventions and focusing on protecting American interests at home and abroad.What Her Appointment Could MeanGabbard’s appointment to this powerful role suggests that Trump intends to shift the direction of US intelligence operations. Her background as a critic of American military overreach means she will likely advocate for intelligence strategies that focus more on diplomacy and strategic partnerships rather than military action.As DNI, Gabbard would be responsible for coordinating the work of all intelligence agencies and ensuring that the President has access to accurate and timely information about national security threats. Her unique blend of military experience, political independence, and skepticism of foreign military interventions could shape her leadership in ways that challenge traditional intelligence practices.\", 'summary': 'Who is Tulsi Gabbard?

Her selection reflects Trump\\'s preference for appointing foreign policy sceptics who question American military interventions abroad.Trump\\'s official announcement praised Gabbard\\'s \"fearless spirit\" and her potential contribution to intelligence agencies, emphasising \"peace through strength.\" The announcement noted her transition from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party, saying she switched \"because of President Trump\\'s leadership and how he has been able to transform the Republican Party, bringing it back to the party of the people and the party of peace.\"Roger Stone, Trump\\'s long-time associate who received a presidential pardon in 2020, initially shared the news on his X account, publishing the statement he claimed came directly from Trump.If confirmed, Gabbard would work alongside John Ratcliffe, Trump\\'s CIA director nominee, as a principal intelligence adviser to the White House. Her responsibilities would include managing 18 intelligence organisations and coordinating the President\\'s Daily Brief, a crucial morning intelligence summary.First Hindu elected to CongressAt 43, Gabbard was born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, with a brief period in the Philippines. Her political career began at 21 in Hawaii\\'s House of Representatives, interrupted by her National Guard deployment to Iraq.As the first Hindu member of the House, she took her oath on the \"Bhagavad Gita\". She also holds the distinction of being the first American Samoan in Congress. During her four terms, she notably challenged her party\\'s leadership. Her early backing of senator Bernie Sanders\\' 2016 campaign elevated her national profile amongst progressives.Her family includes her spouse, cinematographer Abraham Williams, and her father, Mike Gabbard, a state senator who transitioned from Republican to Democrat.Presidential aspirations and party switchHer 2020 Democratic presidential campaign emphasised a progressive agenda and opposition to American military interventions. She highlighted how US Middle Eastern conflicts had destabilised the region and compromised American safety. During the primaries, she notably confronted then-senator Kamala Harris about her prosecutorial record.After withdrawing and supporting Biden\\'s candidacy, she later left the Democratic Party, criticising it as controlled by \"an elitist cabal of warmongers\" and \"woke\" ideologues. She subsequently aligned with Republicans, joined Fox News, and launched a podcast.\"Today\\'s Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,\" she said regarding her departure.Prominence in Trump\\'s circleHer endorsement of Trump this year significantly boosted her standing among his supporters. Frequently appearing with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Gabbard exemplified Trump\\'s claimed cross-party appeal. She assisted Trump\\'s debate preparation against Harris and publicly announced her Republican Party membership at a North Carolina rally in October, describing the Democratic Party as \"completely unrecognizable\".Trump has included both Gabbard and Kennedy in his transition team, potentially influencing staffing and policy decisions in a future administration.Military service and intelligence backgroundGabbard\\'s military career spans over twenty years in the Army National Guard, including deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received recognition with a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, as confirmed by the Hawaii National Guard.Unlike her predecessors, she lacks senior government experience, though she served two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.The current director, Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, brought extensive national security and intelligence experience and made history as the first female director.Intelligence sector reform plansTrump intends to restructure intelligence services, which he views with scepticism. He attributes past challenges to intelligence agencies\\' alleged interference with his previous administration and campaigns.He frequently references the \"deep state\", describing career civil servants whom he considers insufficiently loyal. \"We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,\" Trump declared in 2023, outlining second-term priorities.The director\\'s role, established in 2004 post-9/11, aims to enhance interagency cooperation and prevent intelligence failures.

This is a good thing. It is our Dharam to protect the democracy and the constitution for which I am standing and giving a speech today. Whichever leader talks about saving religion, you have to ask only one thing to that leader who is giving you speech about saving religion that will your son or daughter join us in this fight to save religion?” Kanhaiya said during a public rally in Nagpur on Wednesday.“Will this happen that the responsibility of saving the religion will be ours and your children will study in Oxford Cambridge universities. If we want to save religion, let us save it together. It can’t be like we save religion and the Deputy Chief Minister’s wife makes reels on Instagram. It can’t be like that. Everyone will save the religion together,” he added.Last week, Devendra Fadnavis while campaigning for Mahayuti candidates for the upcoming assembly polls, said that “Vote-Jihad” should be countered by “Dharma-Yuddha” of the vote.Kanhaiya’s remarks drew strong criticism from the BJP. Party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla called Kanhaiya “Naxali Afzal Guru Samarthak” and said his remarks are an insult to all the Marathi women“Hey you Naxali Afzal Guru supporter Congress’ Kanhaiya Kumar.

The anonymous bettor, who goes by Theo, was previously believed to operate four separate accounts on Polymarket, the online betting platform that sold Donald Trump and Kamala Harris contracts ahead of the presidential election, as reported by New York Post.According to the report, around USD 3.7 billion were spent on US presidential election betting, with the majority of bets placed on Trump.\"There was USD 3.7 billion spent on placing bets around the US presidential election, the most of which was spent on Trump, rather than Harris, something that had become an election indicator in the last month before the elections,\" as reported by New York Post.\"It\\'s grand political theatre at its worst.

Addressing a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra today, Rahul said that the Prime Minister says that I show the Constitution in public meetings that is empty. “Sanvidhan unke liye khali hai kyuki unhone ise zindagi mein pada nahi hai (The Constitution seems empty to him because he’s never read it in his life),” Rahul Gandhi said in a public gathering in poll-bound Maharashtra’s Nandurbar. Attacking the Prime Minister further, the Congress leader said that the Constitution is not blank, but carries thoughts and ideas of thousand years.“He has no idea what’s written inside this book; that’s why he says it’s empty. He says Rahul Gandhi shows a red book. It doesn’t matter to us what colour the book is; what matters is what’s written inside it. We are ready to give our lives for what it represents,” Rahul Gandhi said.“I want to explain to the Prime Minister that this Constitution is not hollow. It is filled with thousands of years of thought. When you call it hollow, you disrespect Birsa Munda, Mahatma Gandhi, Ambedkar, and others. This fight is about protecting it,” he added.Earlier, Prime Minister Modi attacked Rahul Gandhi saying the “Laal Kitab” of the Constitution which the Congress was flaunting contained “nothing”.“In ‘farziwada’, Congress has broken its own record. The ‘Laal Kitab’ of the Constitution which the Congress party was flaunting and distributing contained ‘nothing’. It was an empty book. This is nothing but a testament to Congress’ disregard and hate for Baba Saheb Ambedkar. The entire country is in shock over this foolish and unfortunate political play of Congress,” PM Modi said.Further in his address, the Lok Sabha LoP slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party over tribal population, and alleged that the Prime Minister and the BJP-RSS call indigenous people “Vanvasi” (forest dwellers) and carry out deforestation across the country. “Congress introduced the Land Acquisition Bill to protect your land. The Tribal Rights Act granted you rights to the forest, land, and water. But as soon as the BJP government comes to power, they take your land and hand it over to billionaires. The term “Vanvasi” implies that your children should not become doctors or engineers, should not get jobs, and should not do business. “Adivasi,” on the other hand, means that your children can achieve anything. That is the difference between “Adivasi” and “Vanvasi,” Rahul said.He further pointed out that in India, the Adivasi population is eight per cent, and their participation should match this percentage. “I investigated the representation of Adivasis in the Indian government. There are 90 officials who run the government. If the government spends 100 rupees, how many Adivasi officials make decisions about it? Adivasi officials make decisions over just 10 paise of that amount. Out of 90, there is only one Adivasi official, who is side-lined. We need to change this, and the way to do it is through a caste census,” the Congress leader said.The Lok Sabha LoP asserted that the Congress party has decided that as much money the Prime Minister waives off for billionaires, they will give to the common people.Highlighting his guarantees, the Congress MP said that under the Mahalaxmi Yojana, on the first day of every month, women will receive Rs 3,000 directly in their accounts. “After that, we will provide free bus travel for women. Farmers will have up to three lakh rupees of debt waived. When farmers sell paddy, cotton, or soybeans, our government will provide MSP (Minimum Support Price). We will conduct the caste census,” Rahul Gandhi said.“In Maharashtra, everyone will be provided with health insurance up to 25 lakh rupees. For any illness, you can go to the hospital and get treatment up to 25 lakh rupees free of charge. Unemployed youth will receive 4,000 rupees per month until they secure employment,” he added.The Congress leader also alleged that the BJP has moved 5 lakh jobs from Maharashtra to other states.“If we look at employment collectively, BJP has moved 5 lakh jobs from Maharashtra to other states. The INDIA bloc government will not do this. The projects of Maharashtra will remain here. We do not want projects from here to be shifted to other states, forcing Adivasis here to work as labourers there,” Rahul added.The campaigning has intensified for the 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra with both the ruling Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) making efforts to woo the electorate.The polls are scheduled for November 20 and counting will be held on November 23.In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena secured 56, and Congress 44.

This special week, declared important by the Indian Library Association (ILA) recognises the invaluable role libraries play in society and spreads awareness about them. This week is also a time to remember India\\'s historic library movement! Driven by people who were passionate about using libraries to eradicate illiteracy, this development had a big impact on libraries and their accessibility. Andhra Pradesh itself holds an important place in this movement—not only as the home of India’s first state-level library association but also as the birthplace of Iyyanki Venkata Ramanayya, hailed as the \"architect of India’s public library movement.\" In the State\\'s contributions, Visakhapatnam also had a hand. Wondering how? Read on:\\r\\nBirth of Andhra’s First Public Library\\r\\nIn 1886, a modest schoolteacher named Manthina Audinarayanamurty Pantula Garu took an ambitious step toward spreading knowledge. He opened Andhra’s first subscription-free public library, Shri Saraswati Nilayam (or, as some sources record, Saraswati Grandhasthanam), in Visakhapatnam. This library was a revolutionary institution for its time—a public library offering free book access to all, not just a privileged few.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nearly two decades, Pantula Garu served as its honorary librarian, volunteering his time to make books accessible to the public. His initiative laid the foundation for a broader movement in Andhra and beyond, establishing Visakhapatnam as a landmark in India’s library history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile public libraries in cities like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras existed by 1850, they were largely subscription-based and primarily served British residents. It is, thus, remarkable that Saraswati Nilayam, in 1886 was set up as a truly public, free-access library aimed at serving the local community.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigging deeper, however, it can be seen that Visakhapatnam’s association with public libraries predates Shri Saraswati Nilayam. As far back as 1800, a library called Arsha Granthalaya was founded by the Paravasthu family. Initially a private collection accessible only to the family, it housed rare Sanskrit manuscripts on philosophy, religion, and Ayurveda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, this library was opened to the public, marking an early commitment to knowledge-sharing in Visakhapatnam. The existence of 30 personal libraries in Vizag, as recorded in a survey by Gustav Oppert in 1870, marks the city’s love for literature and learning.\\r\\nThe Library Movement Picks Up\\r\\nThe early 1900s saw the library movement gain momentum across the country, with Baroda’s ruler, Sayaji Rao Gaekwar, establishing an extensive public library system in his state with the help of American librarian W C Bordon. His model inspired many, including leaders and citizens in Andhra, to establish libraries as a means of community upliftment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1914, Andhra’s passion for accessible knowledge led to the formation of the Andhra Desa Library Association (Andhra Desa Grandhalaya Sangam), established by Iyyanki Venkata Ramanayya. This organization not only created libraries across the region but did so through the voluntary support of the local people, who saw libraries as essential to social development.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1935, the association launched the unique “floating library service,” where boats carried books to remote villages, fostering a love for reading in areas far from traditional library locations. This floating service, which served 30 villages, was one of India’s first initiatives of its kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another progressive move, the association organized “library pilgrimages” on foot and by bicycle. These pilgrimages raised awareness about the importance of libraries in the pre-independence library movement.\\r\\nVizag In The Post-Independence Library Movement\\r\\nVisakhapatnam’s contribution to Andhra’s library history continued after independence. When Andhra Pradesh was carved out as a new state in 1953, it inherited the Public Libraries Act of 1948 from the Madras Presidency. This law required the establishment of a State Central Library, which was consequently established in Visakhapatnam in 1954-55 - another proud moment in the city\\'s history!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when Andhra Pradesh merged with Telangana in 1956, two central libraries—the Andhra State Library in Visakhapatnam and the Hyderabad State Library—could not co-exist under a single state administration. The 1960 Andhra Pradesh Public Libraries (APPL) Act ultimately designated Hyderabad’s library as the State Central Library for Andhra Pradesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, Visakhapatnam’s library was reclassified as the State Regional Library, making it the first regional library in India. It was later moved to Guntur in 1958, where it continued to remain active as a knowledge centre for the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe establishment of Andhra Pradesh\\'s first public library in Visakhapatnam certainly turned the page to a brighter future. Today, the city has a refreshing number of libraries that encourage the young and old to read, think, and grow into better individuals. Looking back, it is worthwhile to remember the events and people that made this possible!\\r\\n\\r\\nStay tuned to Yo!

Earlier, in an interview, Karthi revealed that the two would team up for something substantial and they haven’t found such a script yet. Though the brothers are part of Lokesh Cinematic Universe, which comprises both Kamal Haasan’s Vikram and Karthi’s Kaithi, the actors haven’t shared screen space in a film to date. Even in Virkam, which had Suriya as Rolex, we only get to hear Karthi’s voice and hints about his presence in the universe. With Kanguva, Karthi and Suriya have finally joined hands for the first time as the former has played an important cameo which could possibly make a huge difference in the possible sequel. \\nSpoilers ahead\\nKanguva, set in 1070 is about two warring tribes in an archipelago of five islands near the Indian sub-continent. Suriya’s titular character heads the tribe of one island Perumaachi, while Bobby Deol’s Udhiran heads one in Arathi. The feud between the two tribes has a long history, and in the film, it reaches its pinnacle when Udhiran tries to conquer Perumaachi along with Romanian imperialists. The film ends with Kanguva winning the war by slaughtering Udhiran after a brutal battle in the sea. As Udhiran’s body is laid for cremation, it is discussed who will lit the pyre as all of his sons are also killed. When a relative steps in to do the deed, a sword flies in chopping his hands, and enters Karthi as a barbaric warrior, named Rathangusan. \\nWe are told Rathangusan is an illegitimate child of Udhiran who gets shunned away by the king. With the dead king and deceased heirs, Rathangusan, dreaded by the whole tribe, returns in all his glory to do the ritual, having a last laugh over the body of his father. Immediately after setting the pyre on fire, he sets his eyes on the throne. Instead of taking the seat, he swears to kill Kanguva to make his claim to the throne a righteous one. The end hints at an epic clash between Suriya’s Kanguva and Karthi’s Rathangusan in the possible sequel to Kanguva.\\nThis has opened the possiblities of the brothers not only crossing paths on screen but also having possible face-offs in the sequel. At the recent Mumbai press conference, while answering a question by News18 Showsha, Suriya had hinted at an epic end to the film and teased the sequel as well. \\n“We also have Kanguva 2 in line.

The two countries together account for 35 per cent of the global population and are projected to contribute 50 per cent of global economic growth in 2024. The launch event was also addressed by leading experts, scholars and researchers, including Dr Li Li, Deputy Director of the Institute of International Relations (IIR) at Tsinghua University, and Professor C Raja Mohan, Visiting Research Professor at ISAS. EAI Director Alfred Schipke said, China and India stand as pivotal pillars in the global economic landscape, their combined potential driving half of the world's economic growth in the coming years.

The two NUS research institutes will jointly organise workshops and public events to examine China and India's growth strategies and their broader impact on the global economy from a policy perspective by bringing together academics, policymakers, practitioners and business leaders. ISAS director Iqbal Singh Sevea noted that both India and China are pivotal to the future of digitalisation and the transition to the green economy.

Kanguva seeks to derive power from the elements (wind, water and fire), the ambitious merger of two timelines separated by a millennium, and the immense magnetism of lead actor Suriya. Nothing wrong with that of course, but the building blocks would have come together far more effectively had the writing and treatment been more organised and coherent.The star of the show delivers everything that he is expected to but no matter how much the fantasy epic seeks to ride on a blend of the actor\\'s charisma, the thrills generated by the exploits of warriors of a distant past and the sweeping visual grandeur that cinematographer Vetri Palanisamy rustles up, Kanguva barely stays afloat.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The first 30 minutes of the Tamil-language film written and directed by Siva is as brain-numbingly sloppy as any half-an-hour of cinema that we have ever seen. Be it the banal dialogue, the shrill pitching of the delivery, the perfunctory acting and the feeble stabs at humour, nothing is in order. This stretch adds up to a wayward and mercifully quick lowdown on three present-day bounty hunters who help the police nab slippery law-breakers. One of them ends up dead on a boat in Goa, sending Francis Theodore (Suriya) and his voluble, doltish sidekick Colt 95 (Yogi Babu) scurrying for cover. The shoddy prelude takes the film nowhere and tells us next to nothing about the characters who romp about on the screen and yell at each other at the top of their voices. The shrillest of them all is Angela (Disha Patani), Francis\\' girlfriend-turned-rival moneygrubber.The only thing that emerges from the free-for-all is that Francis senses an unexplained connection with a runaway boy whose brain cells have been tampered with at a Russian biomedical laboratory before he escapes from the clutches of the evil scientists and their soldiers.Colt 95 is meant to provide comic relief. Angela exists because the screenplay needs somebody who can inject meaningless romantic diversion into the proceedings. Neither of them serves the intended purpose. While the opening minutes set the tone for the rest the film, Kanguva shows marked improvement (at last with regard to imagery and intensity) once it plunges into the past - the year is 1070 AD and thereabouts - and follows the actions of the tribal inhabitants of five islands that are united by language but are violently at odds in terms of what each one of them represents.The male protagonist here is Kanguva (Suriya), the prince and principal warrior of Perumaachi island. The Perumanathans are fire worshippers and their land is lust green. It is an island that is worth dying for. But death certainly isn\\'t on the hero\\'s mind. Waiting to pounce upon the islanders are 25,000 soldiers of a Roman army looking for a secluded zone for the training of their men. When all is about to be lost - these people seem to always hang by a thread as the Romans, traitors and enemies lying in wait on the island of Arathi, which is in the vice-like grip of Uthiran (Bobby Deol) - Konguva helps his people fight their way out of trouble.Not that Kanguva needs any help from anybody. He is a force of nature, an unstoppable one-man army. And once he sets himself a goal, nobody and nothing can deflect him from his path. He likens himself to trees in a forest that aren\\'t swayed by the winds and to streams that flow past the biggest rocks in their way.It is not just what he says about himself and how a God-like voiceover introduces him to the audience ahead of his grand entry scene, it is also background songs that provide elucidation on his inner thoughts. But do not let that fool you, the music in Kanguva is anything but subtle. It is at best a distraction that the film would have done well to dial down. The film\\'s sound design definitely needed much more thought and work as did the characterisation. None of the people we see on the screen, including Kanguva, is accorded any wriggle-room to shape themselves into rounded figures.Given the sheer vigour that Suriya brings to bear upon the titular hero, it is surprising that the scriptwriters did not deem it necessary to inform the protagonist with more than just the broad contours that he is boxed into. The film\\'s biggest missed opportunity pertains to the facet of the intrepid warrior that reflects a \\'maternal\\' nourisher when a desperate orphan boy cries out for help. The masculine in Kanguva is on the verge of giving way to an individual who not only protects (by killing a crocodile with his bare hands, when necessary) but also \\'weans\\' a motherless boy. But that significant aspect of the story is allowed to disappear into a miasma of avoidable cliches. That is because Kanguva isn\\'t looking to steer clear of the familiar. It is intent on being the Tamil Baahubali and KGF. And that is its undoing. The immense potential of the core idea of dealing with the past and present as a seamless continuum remains largely untapped.Of course, a bulk of the film plays out in the past, which probably is just as well. The portions that are set in the present are a disappointingly patchy pastiche of science fiction, all-out action movie heroics and emotional tugs at the heartstrings.The climax flits between the eleventh century and 2024. In both, the hero is engaged in a mission to defeat an adversary. Unfortunately, the bad guy in the past is a stodgy caricature rather than a truly menacing foe. Bobby Deol, in his Tamil debut, is called upon to fill up the screen during the limited time that he has on it. But there is so much happening around him that, like much else in the film, he is left jostling for space and attention.All of the spotlight is on Suriya in a dual role. The hoary avatar that he dons works infinitely better than the contemporary one. That reflects the film as a whole: Kanguva is like two separate films, with the past weighing heavy on the present in more ways than one.Kanguva is a visual treat enhanced by the star\\'s tremendous screen presence. If only the script had more to it than just the sensory and the visceral, this would have been a film fully deserving of the sequel that is in the works. Kanguva drops more than a few hints of a follow-up. Should we be excited? \"We are heading for a great future,\" somebody says in the final moments of the film. Are we?

Videos shared by news agency ANI showed dozens of police officers in full gear, marching down a rural road, as an anti-riot vehicle and police cars followed closely behind.\\n\\n“We will approach strategically and request him to surrender without further escalating the situation,” said Vikas Sangwan, Superintendent of Police in Tonk district, in an interview with ANI.\\n\\nViolent Protests Erupt After Meena’s Arrest\\n\\nMeena’s arrest sparked violent protests in Samravata village, the location of the infamous ‘slap-gate’ incident.

His presence in Australia is synonymous with high viewership and extensive media coverage.However, the upcoming series holds immense significance for Kohli. It is viewed as a make-or-break phase in his illustrious career. The former Indian captain is under pressure to regain his form and secure his spot in the Test team amid a potential transition phase, with younger talents waiting for their chance in the playing eleven.Kohli’s current form is a cause for concern. In 19 international matches this year, the 80-time centurion has managed to score only 488 runs at an average of 20.33, with just two half-centuries in 25 innings and a highest score of 76. His struggles in Test cricket have been particularly troubling, given his past dominance in the format.From 2016 to 2019, Kohli was at the peak of his career, amassing 4,208 runs at an astonishing average of 66.79, including 16 centuries and 10 fifties. He also set a record with seven double centuries, the most by a captain in Tests. However, since 2020, his form has dipped dramatically, scoring 1,838 runs in 34 Tests at an average of 31.68, with only two centuries and nine fifties.The recent home Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand further highlighted his struggles. Kohli scored just 192 runs in 10 innings at an average of 21.33, with only one half-century. This decline in performance saw him slip out of the Top 20 in the ICC Men’s Test batting rankings for the first time in a decade.As Kohli faces criticism and doubts about his place in the team, the series in Australia presents an opportunity for redemption. Historically, Australia has been a stage where Kohli has performed spectacularly, and fans hope he can repeat that success.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series kicks off on November 22 with the first Test in Perth. The second Test, a day-night affair, is scheduled from December 6 to 10 at Adelaide Oval. The third Test will take place at The Gabba in Brisbane from December 14 to 18.The traditional Boxing Day Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground is set for December 26 to 30, followed by the fifth and final Test at Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3 to 7. This series promises a thrilling contest and a potential turning point in Kohli’s career.

They emphasised that the rise of national awareness and the ongoing struggle for Baloch rights are direct outcomes of these sacrifices.The spokesperson also recalled the courage of historical leaders such as Mir Mehrab Khan, who chose death over surrendering to British forces, creating a legacy of resistance and sacrifice that continues to inspire future generations, the report added.He further expressed deep solidarity with the families of the ‘martyrs’, recognising the immense pain and loss they have suffered in the name of the national cause. They assured that the committee would remain committed to the principles of resistance, defiance, and sacrifice demonstrated by the Baloch ‘martyrs’, continuing the fight for national rights.In the same vein, the National Democratic Party also paid tribute to the ‘martyrs’ who gave their lives in defence of Baloch land, identity, and rights.The party emphasised that Baloch Martyrs’ Day was created to honour those who sacrificed their lives at various points in history to protect Balochistan.

He also felt young founders should not have a disproportionate salary gap and not engage in vulgar luxury. Edited excerpts:PM and some global leaders are bullish that India has the fastest-growing developer population on the planet.Whatever we have achieved in economic growth is quite impressive. The economy is growing. But this is limited to urban areas; Our challenge, therefore, is to bring this growth to rural India as well. The only way to do that is by creating jobs with good disposable income; And if you want to do it, you need to focus on low-tech manufacturing because most of these people are not very well educated. They will not be able to add value through IT services, where you need certain kinds of skills. So, India must focus on low-tech manufacturing with the objective of creating many low-tech jobs in rural areas with good disposable income.What is the way forward? We must look at how China has done this. If it has grown (the economy) five times, they must have done something right. So, we must study their growth, understand it, and then see how best to implement that. Because unless we create low-tech jobs in India, all of them will have to come to urban India, which is already overcrowded and full of pollution.How do you see the government’s investments in rural infrastructure? Nitin Gadkari has done an excellent job. Look at Bangalore-Mysore highway, we were not able to do it for so many years. There are a few visionary leaders, like Gadkari, and we need to fully support those people. Make sure that we rise above party levels in creating such infrastructure in rural India, and make sure that the Indian and foreign investment goes to rural India so that jobs are created there.There has been an IPO boom. What does the copious availability of public capital tell you about prospects for entrepreneurship in India?It is good. But I am a very old-fashioned, traditional person. I don’t understand high price-to-earnings (P/E) businesses. I am used to P/E ratios between 7 and 15, and in exceptional cases, maybe 20-25. But if people are talking about a P/E of 100, for me, it is speculative. On the one hand, it is good that a lot of money is coming to India. It is good that there are a lot of entrepreneurships, but my view is that entrepreneurs must learn to use that money very carefully, control their costs, focus on their market, grow their revenue faster and faster, and try to minimize expenses as much as possible. Anything higher than a P/E of 20-25 makes me slightly uncomfortable.You set standards for employee well-being at Infosys. How do you see the recent trends?My personal belief is that there is no point in living in ultra-luxury amid penury and suffering. Therefore, as a compassionate capitalist, we must look after the lowest-level employees first before we attend to the senior people. See, there is a saying in Indian culture: the man and the woman of the house always eat last. They don't eat first. Similarly, the leader of a corporation must consider his or her compensation only after making sure that the lowest-level employee has received his or her share so that they can send their children to reasonable schools and take care of the health of their parents. That’s the way I did it throughout my corporate life. Apple Inc is the latest to plan R&D investments in India.I think that is excellent. What that means is we have graduated from simply using the inventions of the developed world to creating new inventions—perhaps guided by the West. If Apple is starting something here, then obviously senior people will guide the researchers and all of that. That is progress, and it’s something we can be proud of. GE started the Jack Welch Center here a long time ago, and now we’re talking about Apple. Microsoft has its center too. These are all very welcome initiatives, and my heart swells with pride.How do you read Trump’s return as the US president in the Indian context?We’ve had a very strong relationship with the US. About 60-65% of our IT services industry's revenue comes from the US. Many US companies have their captive centres here and several US companies have also set up R&D centres here. So, the relationship between India and the US at the business-to-business level has always been strong and will continue to be so.It doesn’t matter what the political relationships are; as long as we work hard, remain disciplined, innovate, and have a good work ethic, US businesses will want to partner with us. They don’t care whether you’re from one party or another, that doesn’t matter to them.Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently said AI generates 25 per cent of the company’s new code. Do you see something similar playing out at Indian technology companies? AI will definitely help us improve productivity. Certain commonly used pieces of code in large application projects can be developed using large language models, like ChatGPT, or similar tools. Those pieces of code can then be reused thousands of times by thousands of people, improving productivity significantly. There’s no doubt about that. AI will also help us innovate more effectively because it can leverage the entire internet as its arena and generate the best algorithms, etcetera, giving us exposure to a higher level of information. It’s incredibly useful, without a doubt.However, in my view, activities like requirement definition, functional design, database design, performance engineering, user documentation, installation, and so on—especially for large applications, not smaller software tools—will still require human effort. AI will support us in becoming more productive, and the quality of work will improve because critical pieces of reusable code can be generated by AI. So, overall, the quality will be better.How well-prepared is India’s workforce for the next wave of technologies?I think quantum computing is still a few years away. While we have seen some simple computing problems tackled by quantum computers at companies like Google and IBM, they are still not large enough to be directly useful to you and me. However, the pace of progress is very high, and that’s promising. What’s good is that even in tier 2 colleges today, there are courses on quantum computing. I’ve visited several of these colleges, and I’ve seen that they’re teaching it. But it’s more theoretical now because there isn’t enough practical application yet. So, I’m not too worried about India not being prepared to engage with and contribute to quantum computing.However, what concerns me more is the state of our primary and secondary education. This is where critical skills like analytical thinking, Socratic questioning, observation, curiosity, problem definition, problem recognition, and problem-solving should be nurtured. These foundational skills are crucial, and they need to be instilled at the primary and secondary school levels to ensure the workforce is truly prepared for the future.I believe education between the ages of 6 and 13 in the UK is some of the best in the world. It’s far better than in the US, and no other country compares. I think we should aim to bring that kind of education to our children because a strong base is essential. Deepfakes and cyber fraud have become a big societal menace. What is the solution to this new-age problem?I had written to (MeitY Minister) Ashwini Vaishnaw last year and suggested a simple solution: ensure that anyone posting on social media has their Aadhaar ID verified. It’s such a straightforward solution. If it were implemented, it would eliminate fake accounts—because the person would be trapped with their verified identity.Many young Indian founders have bolder risk appetites than in earlier times. How do you view this shift?They are the evangelists and hope of capitalism in India. A large part of India is still very poor—$2,000 to $3,000 per capita, a very poor country. If capitalism is to become acceptable in India, they have to conduct themselves in a way that the large majority of poor Indians are comfortable with. That’s where they must lead a reasonably austere life. Young founders should not have a disproportionate salary gap and not engage in vulgar luxury. They should spend less than what they earn, and not violate principles of good governance. Why do you think there are fewer female researchers in India?If the country is to make faster economic progress, we need to leverage the power of women, who form almost half the population. That’s what developed nations have done. I am not sure if we should have quotas and reservations because, in doing so, we might be unfair to women. They are just as competent as men. In fact, I would say my wife is much more qualified than I am.Many parents do not send their daughters to school or are hesitant. When they complete high school, they say further studies are not necessary. That inhibits women from reaching greater heights. It is a sociological problem that must be fought at the family and societal level.Recognizing scholars below 40 years marks a major shift in the Infosys Prize. Does this mean vast areas of research are attracting more people than before?The reason why we reduced the age limit from 50, and in some cases from 55, to 40 is because many of the laureates have administrative responsibilities and are serving the country. However, because they are now in administration, they do not have the opportunity to become role models for younger researchers. The primary objective and emphasis of the science foundation is to create role models for young researchers by honoring the laureates. We believe that by selecting younger people, we will be creating role models because younger researchers can identify with these younger laureates better than with senior ones.The second reason why we thought about doing this is that when you are in your 50s or 55, you are already very senior, even in an academic institution. You are busy with various responsibilities.\", 'summary': 'NR Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys commented on a range of subjects in an interaction with ET’s Puran Choudhary and KR Balasubramanyam ahead of the Infosys Science Foundation’s announcement of winners of Infosys Prize.', 'url': 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/low-tech-jobs-in-rural-india-will-spur-economic-growth-nr-narayana-murthy/articleshow/115291185.cms', 'image': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115291277,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-53370,overlay-ettech/articleshow.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 08:51:45', 'author': 'Puran Choudhary And K R Balasubramanyam', 'authors': ['Puran Choudhary And K R Balasubramanyam'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.134}, {'id': 264729110, 'title': 'Tilak Varma dedicates his maiden T20I ton at Centurion to captain Suryakumar Yadav', 'text': 'Star India batter Tilak Verma dedicated his maiden T20I century to skipper Suryakumar Yadav as he promoted him up the order during the third match of the series at the SuperSport Park on Wednesday.Tilak Varma was named the ‘Player of the Match’ after his staggering performance with the bat.

China's Rover Zhurong Reveals New Clues\", 'text': \"Evidence of an ancient ocean on Mars has been potentially uncovered by China's Zhurong rover, scientists report. Data gathered by the now-defunct rover indicates a possible ancient shoreline in Mars' northern hemisphere. Researchers at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, including lead scientist Bo Wu, believe these findings support long-standing theories of a large Martian ocean that existed billions of years ago. The Zhurong rover, which travelled approximately 2 kilometres within the Utopia Planitia basin, relayed this data through observations from its onboard cameras and ground-penetrating radar.\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible Water-Related Geological Features Identified\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study describing the findings was published in the journal Scientific Reports. Through Zhurong's exploration, researchers identified features possibly related to water activity, including pitted cones, channels, and formations resembling mud volcanoes. Such structures, the scientists suggest, could represent a coastal landscape shaped by the once-existing ocean. Further analysis of the surface deposits indicates that the ocean may have existed around 3.68 billion years ago, potentially containing silt-laden water that left distinct geological layers on the Martian landscape.\\r\\nComplex History of Water on Mars\\r\\n\\r\\nThe research team posits that Mars' ancient ocean may have experienced phases of freezing and thawing, contributing to the formation of the observed coastline. Sergey Krasilnikov of Hong Kong Polytechnic University noted that the ocean may have frozen over for about 10,000 to 100,000 years before completely drying up, roughly 260 million years later.

The most experienced player in the Indian squad after Sunil Chhetri’s retirement, he completed a diamond jubilee of international caps (75) against Vietnam last month, wearing the captain’s armband and crucially saving a penalty.Currently training in Hyderabad with the Blue Tigers ahead of the friendly against Malaysia on November 18, Sandhu shared his thoughts on the preparations during a virtual media interaction on Wednesday.“Everyone knows this is our last FIFA friendly window before the all-important Asian Cup Qualifiers in March. So, it’s very important for us to make the most of this opportunity. We are happy to have a familiar face in Sandesh Jhingan coming back. It’s great to see that he’s recovered well and has already played a couple of games (for FC Goa),” said Sandhu as quoted by the AIFF official website“We have five more days of training before the Malaysia game, which is good because it allows us time to work together as a team and get used to the new system that is in place with our coach,” the goalkeeper added.India faced Malaysia in the Merdeka Tournament last October in Kuala Lumpur, going down 2-4 in a fiercely contested game, which was the first time Sandhu played against the Southeast Asian side. Sandhu believed that was an unlucky result for the Indians and the scoreline didn’t justify the efforts. However, the Blue Tigers are highly motivated to change that and add a green mark to the scoreline in Hyderabad this time.“It was a different experience playing in Malaysia. They’re a good side with a lot of new faces, and a lot of quality players coming from elsewhere and helping them out. We could have got something more out of that game. It was an unlucky result for us, knowing that we scored a goal which was not allowed. Things like that happen in football. We need to brush aside what happened last time. We have a clean board in front of us and we need to make sure that we get the best result at home,” Sandhu said. Sandhu opened up about the intense competition he faces in the goalkeeping position in the national team. With top custodians like Amrinder Singh and Vishal Kaith, who are key players of their ISL clubs, every national team training session is an opportunity to push the other to their limits and bag a spot in the starting eleven.“Playing for the national team comes with a lot of responsibility. It is a privileged position and I know the importance of it. So, as long as I am here, I will give my hundred percent. It’s always a pleasure to have goalkeepers like Amrinder and Vishal in the team, knowing that they can push me and I push them. It’s all about being a team here in the Indian squad. It’s not about who is playing and who’s not. I feel lucky to have such healthy competition. And that’s not just the case in my position, but the outfielders as well. There’s a lot of new blood coming into the team, who have been doing well for their clubs. Everyone wants to play for the national team. We hail from different clubs, but when we come here, it’s about getting together to work for one goal. It’s a very professional and healthy space in the national team right now,” Sandhu said.And at the moment, in the bigger picture, that goal is to qualify for a third successive AFC Asian Cup, which should be the bare minimum target for our team, according to Sandhu, who has been part of three Asian Cup squads (2011, 2019 and 2023).“With every camp under Manolo, we’re getting close to what he wants us to be as a team. With time and the level of coaching and experience that he has, I have no doubt that we’ll be a strong team in the Asian Cup qualifiers. I think qualifying is the minimum for us as a team that we should strive to do, because we have done it already in the last two editions. This should be a no-brainer for us as a team now. We have to qualify for every single Asian Cup. So, let’s keep our head down and work for that target,” said Sandhu.', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/qualifying-for-asian-cup-bare-minimum-target-says-gurpreet-singh-sandhu/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/qualifying-for-asian-cup-bare-minimum-target-says-gurpreet-singh-sandhu.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 09:34:45', 'author': 'TNM NewsDesk', 'authors': ['TNM NewsDesk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.196}, {'id': 264732372, 'title': \"Watch: Musk And Trump's 'God Bless America' Performance Goes Viral\", 'text': 'President-elect Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stage at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night to perform a rendition of \\'God Bless America\\' alongside opera singer Christopher Macchio.

The company announced a 10% reduction in positions last month, equivalent to about 17,000 employees. The move is aimed at restoring Boeing\\'s competitive edge as it reels from multiple crises, including reduced output in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident in January and a strike that shut down most of its production for seven weeks.But if Boeing cuts too deep or in the wrong places, it risks undermining its eventual recovery from years of turmoil. Manufacturers like Boeing used to count on a large portion of furloughed workers to eventually return to work. That pattern was broken when its Covid-era layoffs spurred a permanent exodus, including top-flight engineers and mechanics. And these days, workers have more options. Unemployment in Seattle is hovering at 4% and aerospace workers are in high demand, particularly with the region\\'s booming space economy.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Rivals like SpaceX, Blue Origin LLC and Amazon.com Inc.\\'s Project Kuiper are all searching for new hires to support rapidly growing operations around Seattle, where Boeing manufactures most of its commercial airplanes, said Stan Shull, a space industry analyst and consultant at Alliance Velocity LLC.

While engineers of all stripes are in demand, the companies are also searching for machinists, administrative help, sales and marketing staff and other positions, said Shull.Shifting demographics within the US workforce and continued low unemployment mean Boeing will face more competition when it needs to resume hiring to support its growth, said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director with AeroDynamic Advisory. \"It works fine as long as labor markets aren\\'t tight,\" Aboulafia said in an interview. \"But aerospace and defense labor markets are really tight.\"Besides, rolling out blanket workforce cuts are \"the surest formula for losing 10% of your best people\" who will gravitate to potentially more stable employers, Aboulafia said.The lost institutional knowledge was apparent as the company made only halting progress ramping up manufacturing of its 737 Max jetliner this decade. Executives later acknowledged they\\'d underestimated the training required to bring the large influx of new hires up to speed in their factories.\\'Reset Priorities\\'Even so, the company is staffed for peak production levels it likely won\\'t see for years, especially after a 53-day strike largely halted work in its plants across the west coast. Boeing had 171,000 employees at the start of this year, 12% more than the 153,000 it employed five years earlier, when its factories were at their pre-crisis peak.Relations between workers and Boeing hit a low during the strike that just ended. Boeing was finally able to settle the dispute with concessions including a 38% wage improvement, but many employees remain antagonized by a company they say has not paid them fairly for years. Kelly Ortberg, who was hired in August as chief executive officer to turn around Boeing, has said the 10% workforce reduction is part of a broader campaign to cut out bloat and inefficiency.\"We need to reset priorities and create a leaner, more focused organization,\" Ortberg said during an Oct. 23 earnings call.

They have taken money in wood, taken money in khichdi.”He further said that he and his government is working for the welfare of the people and for development.“We want to nurture our beloved sisters.

On December 5, fog descended upon the city of London but this was not a usual phenomena. Given it was winter season, fog turned into smog as a consequence of mixing with smoke eminiating from coal-burning factories and chimneys, and diesel-fueled automobiles and buses.This toxic smog lingered from December 5th until December 9th, 1952 and dissipated quickly when the weather improved.The smog had a significant impact, drastically lowering visibility and even creeping into indoor spaces, much worse than previous smog episodes known as \"pea-soupers.\" The environmental disaster claimed around 4,000 lives in just a few days. Those who died mainly faced respiratory issues and accidents. Later in 2004, a research indicated that the actual number of deaths linked to the event could be as high as 12,000.The incident prompted the London authorities to take measures to curb \"The Great Smog\" by tackiling air pollution problems.How London Death With Air Pollution:Clean Air Act 1956: In response to the environmental disaster, the Clean Air Act of 1956 was enforced in the city. The law aimed at controlling sources of air pollution from homes and industries which meant setting rules for reducing the amount of smoke eminiating from chimneys, hence, encouraging the use of cleaner fuels in cities. This law also mandated moving certain industrial processes away from crowded areas.Transition Towards Cleaner Fuels: Due to the Clean Air Act, a transition towards using cleaner energy sources like natural gas and electricity, which produced fewer harmful substances compared to coal, was witnessed.Relocating Sources of Pollution: As a measure, some major industrial units that were contributing in polluting the air were shifted to less densely populated areas This significantly reduce the health risks to people.Improving Travel Infra: The disaster also prompted London to invest in enhancing its public transportation system. Soon after, electric buses were introduced in the city, making it easier for people to use cleaner modes of transportation.Monitoring Air Quality: Systems were set up to monitor the quality of the air. After the system were brought into use, it became much easier for them to track pollution levels and give early warnings if there was a risk of smog.Public awareness: Information campaigns were launched to spread awareness among people about the life risks associated with air pollution. They encouraged individuals to take steps to reduce their contribution to pollution.Urban Planning: There were efforts to change how the city was designed. This meant separating areas where industries operated from places where people lived. Better planning overall helped reduce air pollution.Can London\\'s Battle Help Delhi to Tackle Winter Crisis?The initiatives taken by London had a significant impact in improving its air quality and reducing the occurrence of severe smog events.

Steve Smith unfazed of India India has dominated Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy having beaten the Kangaroos in four consecutive series, including the last two series played in Australia. Australia hasn\\'t won the Border Gavaskar Trophy for a decade now and Steve Smith remains intent on changing that in this Australian summer. Steve Smith remained confident of Australia\\'s chances as he believes the Kangaroos have every weapon in their arsenal to hurt an already struggling India. “We\\'ve been outplayed the last couple of time they\\'ve come out to Australia. I think we\\'re a really good side at the moment. We\\'ve got all the bases covered. We\\'ve been playing really good cricket the last few years. So hopefully we\\'re well equipped and it\\'s going to be a great series. They\\'re a very good side.

The food and grocery delivery firm yesterday listed at a 5.6% premium to its IPO price of Rs 390, making it the first company with an issue size of over Rs 10,000 crore in the past decade to have listed above its offer price, ET has reported. The stock closed 17% above its issue price at Rs 455.95 in a weak market, surpassing analysts’ expectations of a tepid debut. The company’s market capitalisation at close on Wednesday was Rs 1.02 lakh crore.Swiggy's impressive debut also indicates the incoming deluge of cash in an emerging business, quick commerce. Swiggy plans to plough more cash into its quick-commerce business, Swiggy Instamart. Swiggy's bigger rival, Zomato, is also planning to fatten its war chest. Zomato plans to raise fresh funds through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) despite sitting on $1.5 billion, or about Rs 12,600 crore. The money will also fuel its quick commerce business, Blinkit. Zepto, another quick commerce player, is also raising money. ET reported last month that Zepto is in talks to raise $100-150 million from a group of domestic family offices and wealthy individuals. It last raised $340 million in August. Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto are the top three players with over 85% market share.The floodgates of capital opening into the quick commerce sector would worry the big e-commerce platforms which have already started feeling the heat from quick commerce. The quick rise of quick commerceWhile quick commerce becomes the preferred medium for immediate needs and impulse purchases, e-commerce is favoured for more planned purchases like home, beauty and personal care. But now quick commerce firms are diversifying beyond groceries, small-value items, etc. and invading the home turf of e-commerce players.Quick commerce is already conquering kirana, the neighbourhood small retail business, as well as hitting modern retail. As consumer preferences shift towards the convenience of last-minute grocery deliveries, quick commerce companies are outpacing traditional retailers, with 46 per cent of consumers surveyed reporting a cut in purchases from Kirana shops, a recent report has said. The quick commerce market size is expected to reach $40 billion by 2030, a jump from $6.1 billion in 2024, according to the report by Datum Intelligence.Quick-commerce operators such as Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto are aggressively trying to lure away consumers from large ecommerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart by matching their prices across groceries and fast-selling general merchandise, triggering a price war in the home delivery space, ET reported a few months ago. This is a departure from the earlier pricing strategy of quick-commerce players who typically charged 10-15% premium over average ecommerce marketplace prices for instant deliveries, industry executives had told ET.A recent ET study of prices of 30 commonly used products in daily necessities, discretionary groceries and other categories, including electronics and toys, in both ecommerce and quick-commerce platforms reveal the pricing disparity has been bridged. The pricing premium which quick commerce used to charge for instant deliveries is gone with these platforms now joining a race with large ecommerce to offer competitive pricing to shift consumer loyalties, B Krishna Rao, senior category head at biscuits major Parle Products had told ET.The increasing competition is putting pressure on ecommerce majors to reduce delivery time. Price matching by quick commerce is to acquire market share and is part of market acquisition cost even when it might not be profitable at a per unit transaction level, Devangshu Dutta, CEO of consulting firm Third Eyesight, had told ET. They may have to sacrifice margins in the short term to get customers shopping more frequently. After challenging kirana and modern retail, e-commerce is the next frontier for quick commerce companies.The challenge shaping up for e-commerce giantsWith Swiggy, Zomato and Zepto raising a huge amount of money, the war between quick commerce and e-commerce is likely to turn bloody, besides increasing internecine competition among quick commerce players themselves.Quick commerce, which began with the delivery of groceries and essential items, has now expanded to include a diverse range of products. This includes electronics, clothing, cosmetics, household goods, medicines, pet supplies, books, sporting equipment, and more.E-commerce sector offers a vast opportunity for growth of quick commerce business. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per Deloitte’s report released on Monday. This huge potential is luring big players. The Tata group’s ecommerce venture Neu is set to enter the quick commerce segment branded as Neu Flash, rolling it out to select users selling grocery, electronics and fashion, ET reported last month. Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance, leveraging its vast network of supermarkets, is expanding into the 10–30 minute delivery segment. Ambani wants to ensure quick commerce helps bolster its business ahead of an IPO of Reliance Retail, which was last year valued at $100 billion, and has backers including KKR, sources told Reuters recently.Besides entry of big ones like Tata and Ambani, the deluge of fresh investment into business by the incumbents such as Swiggy, Blinkit and Zepto will pose a big threat to large e-commerce players Amazon and Flipkart. Swiggy has recently hired two Flipkart executives to boost its senior leadership. They have joined two other executives that Bengaluru-based Swiggy had hired from the Walmart-owned ecommerce major in the past few months.Swiggy and Zomato are both assessing several new services as they diversify beyond their core businesses, ET has reported a few days ago. Swiggy is all set to launch a pilot programme for a services marketplace, labelled ‘Yello’, which will host professionals such as lawyers, therapists, fitness trainers, astrologers, dieticians, according to sources. It is also testing a premium membership service called ‘Rare’, for affluent customers providing them access to high-end events such as Formula 1 races, music concerts, upscale art exhibitions, in addition to VIP hospitality and priority reservations at luxury restaurants.Zomato has previously been bold in its diversification moves by buying Paytm’s events and ticket business for Rs 2,048 crore. It is now trying out a concierge-like service to help users place online food orders over WhatsApp. Human customer relationship agents will provide the Gurgaon-based company’s new service instead of its usual approach of deploying chatbots, a person familiar with the move has told ET recently.Apprehending challenges by quick commerce players, Flipkart has already started its own quick commerce business Flipkart Minutes. While still far behind its established rivals, Flipkart Minutes hit daily orders of 50,000-60,000 during its Big Billion Days sales, people with knowledge of the matter told ET last month.Further investment and bigger players entering the sector will heat up competition among the quick commerce companies even as they will grapple with new challenges such as logistics as they expand. But a bloody war could soon be seen on the e-commerce battlefield as emboldened by huge popular response the quick commerce companies start invading on the well-guarded turf of Flipkart and Amazon.\", 'summary': \"Swiggy's successful IPO, raising over Rs 10,000 crore, signals a surge in investment for quick commerce.

A nine-year-old Mary was in church along with almost everyone for the Sunday service. Just as the service ended, there was a resounding crash. Soon, policemen and other officials arrived in numerous vehicles to tiny Kangathei. An Indian Airlines Boeing aeroplane from Calcutta had crashed into the nearby Thangjing Ching mountain range because of bad weather, and there were no survivors!\\n\\nKangathei was the designated base camp for rescue operations, and locals, including Mary’s father, were hired to recover the bodies. This was the first time Mary had seen an aeroplane, but the thrill was dimmed by the horror of the dead bodies recovered from the crash and kept in the village.\\n\\nMary’s first school was the Loktak Christian Model High School, which was run by a Presbyterian mission in Moirang. It was one of the best schools in Moirang, and Mary’s father had set aside small sums of money from his meagre earnings so that he could enrol his eldest daughter in a good school. What pride he felt when Mary was admitted to this school! \\n\\nSometimes, Mary’s father could not pay the school fees on time, and this embarrassed the children greatly as they were not allowed to enter the class or sit for examinations if their school fees remained unpaid. Mary’s mother tried her best to save them from these embarrassing experiences. \\n\\nFrom an early age, Mary realised that their family was hard for money. She was an understanding child who never demanded anything from her parents. Even during Christmas, which was the only time the children got new clothes to wear, Mary always accepted what was given to her without creating any fuss. Her only preference was boyish clothes like jeans, T-shirts, and shorts. \\n\\nIn the Kom society in those days, boys were given preference over girls when it came to education while the girls were married off early. But Mary’s father held different views and wanted his daughter to study and make a mark rather than sit at home waiting to be married off. It was Mary’s father’s farsightedness that made her an independent spirit. \\n\\nMary had a busy life apart from her studies, as she was her father’s right-hand woman. Apart from ploughing the fields, her other duties in the fields included handling heavy farming tools, carrying bundles of rice saplings for planting, and later, carrying heavy sacks of rice. There would be leeches in the wet rice fields, and occasionally water snakes too. Mary would pull off the leeches with her bare hands, or knock out the snakes. She used this experience many years later at a boxing camp when her friends ran away on spotting a snake but Mary was not scared. \\n\\nNot all the children in the village worked as hard as Mary and her siblings. Most of Mary’s friends spent their free time playing, eating, or sleeping. But Mary’s father had taught his children to work hard from an early age. With time, Mary could do jobs that even bigger and stronger boys struggled with. For example, ploughing the fields demanded great strength and skill as the bullocks were not easy to manage. When Mary drove the animals in the field with ease, the menfolk of the village would stand and gape in amazement. \\n\\nMary would also carry home the straw left over after harvesting, which would be stored as cattle feed. She had to fetch water from a long distance as there was no potable water in the village. She also accompanied her father up the hills to collect firewood and to the lake to fish. \\n\\nHer mother needed Mary’s help too in cooking, washing, gardening, cleaning the house, and several other odd jobs! Neither Mary nor her siblings ever complained about anything. There was simply no time for all that. Their parents toiled harder than anybody else they had seen and also made endless sacrifices. \\n\\nAll the hard work would prove beneficial to Mary when she would begin her boxing career. Her strength and stamina helped her to battle bigger and more powerful opponents in the ring. \\n\\nIn his youth, Mary’s father had been the village wrestling champion. He gave up wrestling to support his family. Mary’s mother was always working. She wove shawls that she sold to pay for her children’s school fees. All the vegetables came from her kitchen garden, and the leftovers were sold in the market. So, even though Mary’s family was poor, they never ate poorly. \\n\\nMary’s father was also an expert fisherman. Sometimes, he left home at the crack of dawn to go fishing and hunting. Mary’s mother packed the day’s food for him. When he returned only after dark, the children crowded around him excitedly, eager to see what he had brought back. He was especially good at catching eels, which he spread out for display in the kitchen. The big eels were exchanged for rice as they fetched a good price. This caused the innocent children much sadness as they wondered why the big fish were always sent away while they could eat only the little ones.\\n\\nExcerpted with permission from The Incredible Life of Mary Kom: The Queen of Boxing, Swayam Ganguly, Talking Cub.', 'summary': 'An excerpt from ‘The Incredible Life of Mary Kom: The Queen of Boxing’, by Swayam Ganguly.', 'url': 'https://scroll.in/article/1075502/for-children-boxer-mary-koms-journey-from-a-childhood-of-hardships-to-an-olympic-medal', 'image': 'https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/161919-bukglbdufv-1627202630.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 08:00:01', 'author': 'Swayam Ganguly', 'authors': ['Swayam Ganguly'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.175}, {'id': 264732290, 'title': 'Shahid Kapoor Looks Dapper In All-Blue Ensemble As He Gets Papped At Mumbai Airport', 'text': 'Shahid Kapoor, who will be next seen in the action thriller Deva, is indeed one of the most stylish and fittest actors in B-town.

These trends have shown shifts among states in the recent while. While traditional hotspots such as Haryana have had success in lowering instances resulting in stubble burning, Punjab still leads with the highest incidents of farm fires, and such incidents have increased significantly in other states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. As per the reports, Madhya Pradesh, in particular, exceeded Punjab in the number of farm fires reported on Monday and has reported the second-highest number of farm fire incidents this season.\\n\\nThe number of incidents recorded to date across states is 10,693. Punjab still is the highest contributor to such cases with 4,394 cases, followed by Madhya Pradesh with 2,875 of 10,693. This modification in the pattern has introduced a new dimension to the continuing agricultural activity, which is well-known for contributing to severe air pollution in North India during harvest. \\n\\nAs of Monday, 13th November, the state of Madhya Pradesh reported a record 506 stubble-burning incidences in a single day, exceeding its earlier seasonal high of 296 cases on November 2nd. This statistic represents more than half of all instances registered nationwide that day, indicating a significant increase in the state. In contrast, Punjab, which had 587 instances on November 1st, was able to lower this number to 262 by November 4th, demonstrating an uptick in crop residue control.\\n\\nUttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, like Madhya Pradesh, have experienced an alarming increase. On Monday, the 13th, Uttar Pradesh recorded 84 instances, up from only 16 the day before. Similarly, Rajasthan’s statistics increased from 36 to 98 instances, making it the second-highest total for the season after October 16th, which witnessed 100 incidences.\\n\\nThe Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) meanwhile reports that satellite remote sensing identified 1,357 active stubble-burning events on November 10th alone, spanning Punjab, 345 cases, Haryana, 22 cases, Uttar Pradesh, 128 cases, Rajasthan, 79 cases, and Madhya Pradesh, 783 cases. These fires accounted for 8% of the season’s total fires.\\n\\nHaryana has seen a progressive decrease in stubble burning, with incidences falling from 42 on October 31st to 13 by November 4th. However, Punjab on the other hand continues to contribute the most cases even today. \\n\\nAccording to the ICAR, from September 15th to November 10th, 17,003 instances of residue burning were found in these states, also including Delhi. Notably, Madhya Pradesh to date has recorded 5,818 fires among this 17,003, down from 7,891 last year, Haryana recorded 981 fires, down from 1,676 last year and the lowest in the last five years, and Punjab has recorded 6,611 fires, down from 23,626 last year and the lowest in the last five years, but maximum as compared to other states this time. But, the state seeing a dramatic drop in farm fires, with just 6,611 occurrences reported this year is worth lauding. This is a considerable decrease from the previous five years, when the number of instances went as high as 72,499 in 2020.\\n\\nStubble (parali) burning is a method of removing paddy crop residues from the field to sow wheat from the last week of September to November. Almost everyone has agreed that stubble burning by farmers in the nearby states, mainly in Punjab and Haryana, has been the primary reason behind deteriorating air quality in Delhi. From the record now, Haryana has also improved its condition by reporting the fewest incidents in the previous five years.\\n\\nHowever, recently, it was reported that Punjab’s particular program to reduce agricultural waste is experiencing major obstacles as northern India struggles with a severe pollution crisis exacerbated by stubble burning.

The left-liberal media is finding it hard to fathom that despite their well-oiled propaganda machinery at work, the Americans handed a historic triumph to the Donald. On Wednesday, the 13th of November, UK-based left-wing media outlet The Guardian announced that it would stop posting on social media site X (formerly Twitter). The Guardian further blamed X’s new owner and Trump supporter Elon Musk for the leftist propaganda outlet’s departure from the popular social media platform.\\n\\nThe leftist propaganda outlet claimed that after the change of ownership, the micro-blogging site now promotes or distributes disturbing content, “including far-right conspiracy theories and racism”. The statement stated, “The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse.”\\n\\nContrary to the expectations The Guardian must have had, the X users expressed their joy over The Guardian’s decision to quit posting on X with many calling it a “good riddance”. Some X users also pointed out that The Guardian fears that X’s Community Notes would not let the British publication peddle its lies and propaganda unchecked.\\n\\nOne X user said, “Scared of getting called out for your propaganda and lies?

The leftist propaganda outlet’s contention that X is now a battleground for toxic discourse, manipulated by its owner Elon Musk, is conveniently skewed. \\n\\nWhat The Guardian fails to admit is that its resentment stems not from the platform’s supposed toxicity, but from the fact that it no longer has control over the political narratives it finds palatable. It is unfathomable for The Guardian and other leftist propagandist legacy media that the era where they used to set the narratives with the people hardly having any say or questioning and critiquing them is gone.\\n\\nThe Guardian says that “X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse.” However, it has no qualms about being absolutely biased and using its reach to shape pro-left-liberal opinions. Media is supposed to be unbiased, however, The Guardian has its own standards of bias.\\n\\nWhen Elon Musk allows people from all walks of life with their own differing ideologies and views to express themselves on X, he is influencing political discourse, but The Guardian serving as a Democrat’s stooge is brave and fair journalism and suffers a massive meltdown when Kamala Harris loses.\\n\\nFor many years, The Guardian not only used but also thrived on platforms like X, where conversations were heavily regulated to fall in line with the leftist narrative and right-wing voices were muzzled. However, after Elon Musk bought X, the platform has witnessed a significant shift towards a more free discourse, allowing a broader spectrum of perspectives to have a say without being scrutinised. Perhaps, this is the main cause of The Guardian’s chagrin: It can no longer dominate the discourse particularly during the election cycle.\\n\\nClearly, The Guardian is throwing tantrums since it can no longer use X to push its leftist agenda and escape criticism as it used to in the pre-Musk Twitter era. Contrary to its holier-than-thou assertion that it cannot tolerate racism and ‘toxicity’ rampant on X, it is simply dejected by the fact that X has in a short time emerged as an alternative to the inherently biased legacy media and people are no longer blindly consuming the propaganda mainstream media offers them under the garb of news.\\n\\nWhat’s even more amusing is that like any other average left-liberal propaganda outlet, The Guardian also positions itself as a ‘defender’ of freedom of speech, and claims to be fighting against the ‘authoritarians’ who have no regard for press freedom, but cries hoarse when those of the opposing view exercise the their freedom of speech. It is quick to label anything out of its ideological bubble as ‘toxic’, ‘fascist’, ‘racist’ and whatnot but passes off its own leftist and woke agenda as ‘open’ and ‘independent’ journalism.\\n\\nLiberals across the world share this trait, they talk about democratic values and press freedom, liberty and what not but only till they control the things, they reveal their true ‘fascist’ character in the face of slight deviance by anyone from their established and control ‘system’. \\n\\nOpIndia reported earlier, how the traditional Democrat propaganda factory The Washington Post received flak from liberals after its owner Jeff Bezos announced that the publication will not endorse any candidate ahead of the 2024 presidential elections in the US. Now, The Guardian’s hissy fit reveals that left-liberals are not actually interested in open discourse allowing diverse, opposing and critical voices to exist and are actual fascists who only loves to brag about it when they control the discourse. Probably, that is why when the The Guardian saw it can no longer push its mendacious narratives with Trump returning to power and Musk transforming the leftist eco-chamber Twitter into a truly unbiased platform X, it decided to pack and leave while throwing allegations of ‘toxicity’ on its way out.', 'summary': 'Contrary to the expectations The Guardian must have had, the X users expressed their joy over The Guardian’s decision to quit posting on X with many calling it a “good riddance”.', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/leftist-propaganda-outlet-the-guardian-throws-a-hissy-fit-says-they-wont-post-on-toxic-platform-x-anymore/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/the-guardian-elon-musk-x-1.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 08:47:37', 'author': 'Shraddha Pandey', 'authors': ['Shraddha Pandey'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.428}, {'id': 264730784, 'title': 'Natural gas: Buy on the breakout of ₹258', 'text': 'Natural gas futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) has recovered well this week and it closed at ₹250.6 per mmBtu.

They expressed what Children\\'s Day meant to them, engaged in trivia games, and participated in live interactions, proudly showcasing their talents in an atmosphere brimming with joy and excitement.\\nAshit Kukian, CEO of Radio City, shared, \"We have a responsibility toward the next generation. With the increase in unmonitored content, it\\'s essential to offer safe media options for children. At Radio City, we believe in nurturing creativity and giving kids a platform to express themselves. \\'Junior Jocks\\' has been a fantastic way to bring children into the spotlight, offering them a chance to co-host their favourite shows and create memories that will last a lifetime. We are also proud to have partnered with WOKA, which aligns perfectly with our mission to offer a safe, positive media experience for children.\"\\nKiran Agarwal, Founder & Chairperson of WOKA, added, \"Recognizing the gap in availability of clean content options for the younger generation at an impressionable age, we launched WOKA. Content plays a crucial role in the holistic development of the child both mental as well as physical.

This nuclear strike occurred in 1945, during World War II, when the United States dropped two atomic bombs, named “Little Boy” and “Fat Man,” on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The aftermath of these bombings brought massive devastation to those cities in Japan. At the time, U.S. President Harry S. Truman authorized this attack.\\n\\nIn the United States, control over nuclear weapons rests with the President, who alone has the authority to order a nuclear strike. This often raises the question in people’s minds about who holds this power in India, where control over nuclear weapons rests differently. Let’s know more about this. \\nDoes PM Modi hold nuclear control?\\nJust as the U.S. President has control over nuclear weapons, accompanied by security personnel carrying the “nuclear football” containing essentials to initiate a nuclear strike, in India, control over nuclear weapons also involves specific protocols. Many people believe that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has this control. \\nThis belief is partially true. Prime Minister Modi does have authority over nuclear weapons and holds a smart code that can be used to launch them. However, the decision to deploy nuclear weapons doesn’t rest solely with him. \\nWho has nuclear command authority in India?\\nIn India, while the control over nuclear weapons technically lies with the Prime Minister, he cannot independently order a nuclear strike. Decisions related to nuclear weapons are collectively made by the Nuclear Command Authority (NCA). The NCA consists of two wings: the Political Council and the Executive Council. \\nThe Political Council, headed by the Prime Minister, is responsible for the overall policy direction and strategic decision-making regarding nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the Executive Council, led by the National Security Advisor (NSA), focuses on providing technical advice and executing decisions related to nuclear operations. The Prime Minister can make decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons based only on the recommendations and consensus of the Nuclear Command Authority. \\nIn the event of a nuclear crisis, the Prime Minister makes the final call on the use of nuclear weapons. The decision process is designed to ensure that nuclear weapons are only used in extreme situations, following a carefully considered and strategic approach. \\nNuclear test conducted in India\\nIndia’s nuclear journey began with its first successful test on May 18, 1974, at the Pokhran test range in Rajasthan, under the code name “Smiling Buddha.” This marked India as the sixth nation in the world to conduct a nuclear test. Later, in 1998, India conducted a series of nuclear tests at the same site, codenamed “Operation Shakti,” which included a thermonuclear test. \\nToday, India boasts an extensive nuclear program, with both civilian and military components. This includes over 10 nuclear reactors, uranium mining and milling sites, facilities for heavy water production, uranium enrichment plants, fuel fabrication units, and robust nuclear research capabilities, according to various media reports. \\nAlthough India has never publicly confirmed the size of its nuclear arsenal, various global estimates suggest that India possesses between 150 and 300 nuclear weapons, making it a significant player in global nuclear dynamics. \\nNuclear control in US\\nIn the United States, the President holds the sole authority to authorize a nuclear attack. This power is part of the President’s role as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, ensuring swift decision-making in critical national security scenarios. When a nuclear launch is considered, the President, in consultation with senior advisors and military officials, must authenticate their identity using a special set of codes kept within a secure briefcase known as the “nuclear football.” \\nThis briefcase accompanies the President at all times and contains the necessary equipment and codes to initiate a nuclear strike. Once the President gives the order, it is transmitted to the military chain of command, where it is processed and carried out by strategic forces. While the President consults with key advisors and the Secretary of Defense, the final decision and responsibility lie solely with the President. \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSource link', 'summary': 'Home News In US, President authorises nuclear attack, who has the control over nuclear weapons in India?

The strategy would have been devised to help the India team but of late it has eroded some of southpaw’s confidence as he seems to be caught between attacking and playing second fiddle.\\nMost of Rinku’s better efforts have come when he has batted at number five but in a line-up where Sanju Samson is settling as an opener and Tilak Varma has staked claim as a No. 3, it might be difficult for Rinku to be promoted ahead of Hardik Pandya. It is an issue that team think-tank would do better to solve at earliest.\\nTeam Combination\\nIndia have used 12 out of their 15 players in the first three games and it would be interesting to see if one among the two uncapped pacers Yash Dayal or Vysakh Vijaykumar gets a debut cap in case the pitch warrants an extra specialist speedster. For Samson, he would like to forget that he is turning into Marco Jansen’s ‘bunny’ after back-to-back failures.\\nIn the final game, it wouldn’t be a bad option for skipper Surya to check on Ramandeep Singh’s steady medium pace as he can be an asset with multiple skills, including ability to field at all positions save keeping.\\nFull Squads\\nIndia: Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (WK), Rinku Singh, Tilak Varma, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Hardik Pandya.

Her response came a day after the former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister dismissed Congress as an “insignificant” party. Sharmila criticised Jagan’s governance in a post on X, accusing the YSRCP of being “all talk, no action” and labelling it as the true “insignificant” party in the state.Sharmila reminded Jagan that the Congress party was a much larger party and existed long before his birth. In a post on X, Sharmila said, “Even with 38 percent support, the YSRCP MLAs lack the courage to speak on the assembly floor about people’s issues.” She argued that the public did not elect Jagan Mohan Reddy and his MLAs “to sit at home” and accused the party of failing to address pressing matters in the state legislature. Sharmila went on to demand that all 11 YSRCP MLAs immediately resign if they cannot actively represent their constituents in the assembly. \"If you have integrity, make the assembly tremble on anti-government policies. YCP MLAs should resign and go for re-elections if they can’t speak up,\" she stated. “Why isn\\'t he and his party attending the assembly? Despite winning 11 seats, why has YSRCP boycotted the assembly?\" she said. She implied that Jagan\\'s significance lies only in his ability to attack others, particularly on social media. \"Abusing women or anyone on social media is a real issue,\" she stated, adding that it has been a prevalent problem, not just recently but throughout the last five years during Jagan\\'s tenure as Chief Minister. She also said that the Congress held a press meet before the YSRCP to address the flaws in the state budget. She accused Jagan Mohan Reddy of saying the exact same things during his press meet discussing the budget. These statements from Sharmila come one day after Jagan dismissed his sister, saying “let’s not talk about her.” Published By: Deepthi Published On: Nov 14, 2024', 'summary': 'YS Sharmila replies to Jagan Reddy, calls YSRCP real insignificant party', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/andhra-pradesh/story/ys-sharmila-responds-jaganmohan-reddy-calls-ysrcp-the-real-insignificant-party-2633328-2024-11-14', 'image': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202411/y-s-jaganmohan-reddy-y-s-sharmila-144607444-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=.8qvJ0DUY7npHb_rEa2RpRdJQyL2xivI?size=1280:720', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 09:47:47', 'author': 'Apoorva Jayachandran', 'authors': ['Apoorva Jayachandran'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.377}, {'id': 264731326, 'title': 'Siddaramiah, Congress reitrate claim that BJP offered Rs 50 crores each to Congress MLAs to destabilise Karnataka govt', 'text': 'The ruling Congress government in Karnataka has upped the ante on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s claims that the BJP offered Rs 50 crores each to 50 Congress MLAs to destabilise the Karnataka government during the alleged ‘poaching’ attempts, dubbed as ‘Operation Kamala’.The CM himself reiterated the allegations, “I said what they did previously. I said they tried to destabilise the govt by offering Rs 50 crores, in which they couldn’t succeed.”The Chief Minister had earlier made the accusation on Wednesday in Mysuru during his address after launching development works worth 470 crores in T. Narasipur. Senior Minister HK Patil said that he backed the CM’s claims as they would have come from credible sources.“Our CM must have got credible information and the way the BJP is functioning and their leaders are talking it shows that they are making that kind of effort. You all know how they operated in Maharashtra. Keeping all this in view, the CM has said so. But there is nothing to worry about, our MLAs and party are strong and our govt is stable,” HK Patil said.Another State Minister Ramalinga Reddy said that the BJP had been trying to destabilise the government over six months but had failed.“They (BJP) have been trying for last 6 months, but they have failed. No MLA is ready to go with those people. Since they have failed, they are making allegations against the Congress party and Siddaramaiah. They will never succeed. They will be in opposition for the next 3-5 years…They (BJP) are dreaming of becoming ministers,” he said.State Minister Dr M C Sudhakar said that the BJP had been publically saying that the Congress government would not last and thus are trying everything.“See, poaching MLAs from other parties is not new to BJP. From the day Congress came to power in Karnataka, time and again BJP started saying that this govt was not going to last long. Their great ally HD Kumaraswamy and former PM Deve Gowda is also saying the same. This indicates that they (BJP) are trying all means. They (BJP) would have tried. Without proper information, the CM would not have spoken…”Karnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar said that the Chief Minister has got some credible information on this.DK Shivakumar said, “A lot of information is coming from the BJP side also. We will speak with CM and come back to you (media) on this.”Earlier CM Siddaramaiah had lashed out at the BJP, saying that it won’t succeed in its plans.Speaking to reporters, the Karnataka Chief Minister said not a single MLA from the ruling Congress will switch sides.“It is true that BJP is trying to destabilise our government, but they will not succeed in their plans. They tried earlier to topple our government and succeeded, but such ploys won’t work this time. It is clear that they can do anything, and go to any lengths to grab power. But now a single MLA from our party will go to the BJP,” Siddaramaiah said.His remark came amid the trading of barbs between the ruling Congress in Karnataka and the BJP over alleged ‘poaching’ attempts, dubbed as ‘Operation Kamala’, in the southern state', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/siddaramiah-congress-reitrate-claim-that-bjp-offered-rs-50-crores-each-to-congress-mlas-to-destabilise-karnataka-govt/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/siddaramiah-congress-reitrate-claim-that-bjp-offered-rs-50-crores-each-to-congress-mlas-to-destabilise-karnataka-govt.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-14 09:58:33', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.717}]\n",
