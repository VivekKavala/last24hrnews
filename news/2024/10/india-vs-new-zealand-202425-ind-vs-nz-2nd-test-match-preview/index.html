                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It hasn't happened all that often in the recent past, but they've been 1-0 down in a home Test series.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It happened against Australia in 2017, and then against England in 2021.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Both times, they came back to win the series.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Both those series, however, were four Tests long.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> India's current generation have never really been in the situation they are in now against New Zealand: 1-0 down at home, with only two Tests to go.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>It puts them under immense pressure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Beating India in India remains the toughest challenge in Test cricket today, but away teams over the last two years have been winning Tests here more frequently than they used to.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It's a sign, perhaps, of one era transitioning into another, a reminder of the cricketing mortality of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>This doesn't change the fact, however, that India remain overwhelming favourites when the second Test begins on Thursday.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> New Zealand won in Bengaluru, yes, but they won via the perfect storm brewed up by the weather and a deceptive pitch that led India to make what turned out to be the wrong toss and selection calls for those conditions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> New Zealand were themselves poised to make the same toss call had Tom Latham called correctly.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>It isn't often that a visiting side shows up for a Test match in India and finds conditions that suit them more than the home side.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Before Bengaluru 2024, it had perhaps happened twice in this century: Nagpur 2004 and Ahmedabad 2008.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Pune will not be like Bengaluru.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> India have made every effort possible to restore to this series the one major ingredient it had lacked up to this point: home advantage.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The specifics of how the Pune pitch will behave will only become clear when the match begins, but the broad outline is likely to be a lot less help for New Zealand's quicks, and a lot more room for India to maximise the superior skill and control of their spin attack.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It won't guarantee the result they want, not against this superb New Zealand side, but whether they win, lose or draw, India will journey to their fate on something like their own terms.</p>
