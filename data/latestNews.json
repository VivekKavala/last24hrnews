        "text": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said she strongly believed that Kannada language, through Bhakti Sangeetha, directly touches the core of your heart. In Dasa Sangeetha, each of the verses sung by the Dasas reaches us without language barriers. The verses are a humble plea of these Dasas, who lived on Bhiksha, followed a Guru and attained Diksha with that Guru\u2019s guidance, she said.\n\nMs. Sitharaman was speaking after inaugurating the three-day Mysuru Sangeetha Suganda, a music festival celebrating the Dasa tradition of Carnatic music, at the KSOU Convocation Hall here.\n\nThe music festival is jointly organised by the Central Ministry of Tourism and State Ministry of Culture and the Tourism Department. The event aims to celebrate Mysuru\u2019s rich Carnatic music traditions, and also promote lesser-known tourist destinations, cuisine, handicrafts and textiles of Karnataka. Many renowned musicians are attending the festival and also performing.\n\nIn her inaugural address, Ms. Sitharaman, who was instrumental in organising the music festival for promoting Carnatic music, said language does not come as a barrier in Dasa Sangeetha as it reaches everybody.\n\nThe Finance Minister, who spoke on the greatness of Mysuru\u2019s Carnatic music traditions and the Dasa Sangeetha, said the festival organised jointly by the Tourism and Culture Ministries should become a calendar event organised annually to promote Kannada language and the Dasa Sangeetha. The Karnataka government must come forward to support the event every year.\n\nWhile complimenting the Tourism Ministry for choosing Mysuru for the music festival, Ms. Sitharaman said the Dasas during the Bhakti movement kept the entire population together and helped people to remain positive. Because of their roles, Karnataka contributed immensely despite the difficult era. Mysuru is a blessed place.\n\nExplaining the vision of the Modi government, she said \u2018Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi\u2019, which highlights the country\u2019s development and at the same time emphasises on safeguarding our heritage and culture. India has diverse languages and cultures. The Prime Minister\u2019s message is, that besides the country\u2019s economic progress, we also need to preserve our cultural heritage. We need language, culture, music and so on, she explained.\n\nShe also spoke on the programme \u201cEk Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\u201d. India is blessed by diverse languages. Every language is superior or \u201cShrestha\u201d. All the beautiful languages make Bharat where different languages are spoken. There is a need to strengthen these languages, the finance minister opined.\n\nDuring her talk, Ms. Sitharaman also spoke on the contributions of the Mysuru kings for the promotion of Carnatic music, and mentioned about the songs composed by Sri Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.\n\nShe said the music festival needs to be supported and all Kannadigas, even through the digital modes, have to come together to promote Carnatic music as many stalwarts of Carnatic music hailed from Mysuru, which was a nerve centre for culture, and who set golden standards for music. It was Purandara Dasaru, known as \u201cPitamaha\u201d of Carnatic music, who codified Carnatic music.\n\nBesides Mysuru, the performances of Dasa Sankeerthana as part of the music festival are also being held simultaneously at the National Gallery of Modern Art, Bengaluru; Sri Aprameya Swamy Temple; Rudrapatna in Hassan district and Araga.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas and Tourism Suresh Gopi, Minister in charge of Mysuru district H.C. Mahadevappa, and Mysuru MP Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar also spoke. Additional Secretary to the Tourism Ministry Suman Billa welcomed. MLA T.S. Srivatsa was present.\n\nThe Finance Minister later had an informal chat with the musicians and experts after the event.",

On their part, underwater drones help closely monitor fish behaviour in natural habitats, to detect signs of distress like erratic swimming patterns and also provide real-time data that strengthen sustainable fisheries management,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event saw live demonstration of drone applications in fisheries, including transportation of fish from the farm, dispensing aquafeeds and rescue operation.\n\nThe Minister said the Centre would develop 100 climate-resilient coastal fishermen villages across the country, to help fisher communities who encounter climate-change challenges, by allocating \u20b92 crore per village under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana. This would help ready common facilities like fish-drying yards, processing centres, fish markets, and emergency rescue facilities, whilst promoting climate-resilient practices like seaweed cultivation, artificial reefs, and green fuel initiatives. \n\nThe Union Department of Fisheries would install transponders in about one lakh marine fishing vessels this year at an estimate of \u20b9364 crore. \n\nThis would provide a two-way communication system enabling real-time tracking of fishing vessels and help fishermen to send short messages using their Android mobile phone while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast.\n\nThe system would also provide weather alerts to the fishermen, including cyclone warning. The Indian Space Research Organisation developed this technology indigenously using GSAT 6 satellite. Information related to potential fishing zones too would be made available to the fishermen on their mobile in regional languages, Mr Kurian said.\n\nNeetu Kumari Prasad, Joint Secretary in Union Department of Fisheries; B.K.

But its plans will not succeed as it is a land of communal harmony,\u201d Minister M.B. Patil said in Vijayapura on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is using the waqf issue to create rifts between communities and spread hatred. It will not succeed, as the people can see through the conspiracy,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is trying to portray Congress as an anti-Hindu party by saying that we are supporting Waqf Board in reclaiming its land. This is not true because the Waqf Board is a statutory body that regularly issues notices to remove encroachments from its land. During its tenure, the BJP has taken several pro-Waqf Board steps, including issuing notices and mutation of Record of Rights, Tenancy and Crops (RTCs),\u201d he said.\n\nReleasing a list of documents to support his claim, he said that the Congress will also release a booklet containing the BJP\u2019s pro-Waqf Board activities.\n\nThe BJP, which has been in power at the Centre since 2014 and also in the and State intermittently, is very concerned about the protection of waqf properties. Its leaders and Ministers have made several statement and took steps towards that end. When the BJP was in power in the State, it allowed the Waqf Board to take back property of farmers, religious places and people from all religions, he said. \u201cIt is now conducting a false campaign propaganda against us in the State and national level,\u201d he added.\n\nHe claimed that the BJP government mutated in favour of the Waqf Board land belonging to many farmers in 2023, citing examples.\n\nThe then Revenue Minister issued circulars in 2010, regarding updating of waqf documents. The Chief Secretary issued a circular in 2010 to remove all encroachments from waqf land by private individuals, government bodies and corporations. The Regional Commissioner of Kalaburagi issued orders in 2011 on protecting waqf property and regularization of records, the Minister pointed out, to show that clearing encroachments is an ongoing process.\n\nThe Principal Secretary, Minority Welfare, issued orders in 2011, on compulsory depositing of compensation against acquisition of waqf land to the board\u2019s account. In 2020, the Deputy Secretary (Land Grant, Land Reforms and Revenue Department) issued orders for flagging wakf property in the Bhoomi portal. In 2021, the BJP government set up district-level task forces to protect waqf property.\n\nIn 2021, the BJP government issued orders for flagging and locking of waqf property in gramthana land in the Panchatantra and e-Swattu software.\n\nIn 2014, the BJP\u2019s election manifesto proposed, in consultation with religious leaders, to empower the Waqf Board and clear encroachments.\n\nIn 2019, MP Shobha Karandlaje asked a question in Parliament seeking information about steps taken to preserve waqf property like geo-tagging and digitization, lease terms, financial assistance to State Waqf Boards, video conferencing facilities, Mr. Patil said, citing these instances.\n\nIn Karnataka, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has ordered withdrawal of all notices when the BJP started making false allegations about waqf assets, he said.\n\n\u201cEven after all this, the BJP is spreading false information among farmers, religious leaders and public for political gains and publicity. Were they not following anti-Hindu policies, when they were in power? Why are they posing now that the BJP is the only party in favor of the Hindus?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said that the BJP has politicised religious institutions. The BJP has dragged into the anti-waqf agitation innocent swamis of various maths who have no clear idea of the double-speak of the party, he added.\n\n\u201cBut then, we will take steps to convince them of the BJP\u2019s hypocrisy. Sri Adrushya Kadasiddeshwar Swami of Kaneri Math, who addressed the rally in Vijayapura, will turn against the BJP. That is because we are true Hindus, but the BJP has fake Hindu leaders who are carrying out a false propaganda for political gains,\u201d Mr. Patil claimed.",

The authorities should organise ambulance and helicopter rescue services at the ports in order to save lives,\u201d the memorandum said. \n\nThe document pointed out that despite the heavy footfall and vehicular traffic at the Mallipattinam fish market, the nearest hospital was in Tiruchi or Thanjavur. \u201cA full-fledged hospital closer to the market would be able to attend to accidents and injuries,\u201d it said.\n\nAmong the other demands were to early installation of curved groynes to protect the Mallipattinam port from sea erosion and climate change. \n\nThe body sought official help to settle disputes between fishermen in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. \u201cWe urge the authorities to resolve the issue of fishermen straying into foreign waters through high-level bilateral talks and secure the release of those who have been arrested along with their vessels from Sri Lankan custody,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFishermen of Thanjavur district could be permitted to stay at sea with their power boats for at least three days, like those of Nagapattinam district, in order to increase the size of their catch, and profits, said the body. Cold storage facilities would help preserve the stock of fish caught daily.",

        "text": "With samba and thaladi paddy cultivation under way on 4,148 hectares in Karaikal district, the Agriculture Department has issued guidelines to ensure fair and sufficient distribution of fertilizers. \n\nKaraikal\u2019s Additional Director of Agriculture R. Ganesan, in a statement, outlined the measures and cautioned vendors that strict action would be taken for non-compliance with these rules. \n\nMr. Ganesan confirmed that fertilizers, including urea, DAP, complex, and potash, are adequately stocked at authorised private and cooperative outlets for local farmers. To maintain transparent and efficient distribution, the department had directed fertilizer vendors to display their sales licences prominently, list stock levels and prices clearly, and sell fertilizers exclusively at government-mandated rates. Sales are restricted to farmers within Karaikal district to prevent unauthorised distribution to neighbouring areas. \n\nThe guidelines stipulate that vendors must avoid combining fertilizer sales with unrelated products and are prohibited from selling unapproved items. All sales are to be documented via POS systems, with receipts provided to farmers. Vendors are required to submit inventory and sales reports bi-monthly, on the 15th and 30th. \n\nMr. Ganesan reiterated that any violations of these regulations would lead to action under the Fertiliser Control Order of 1985, reinforcing the department\u2019s commitment to ensuring a fair and efficient fertilizer supply chain.",

Patil said on Friday.\n\nHe was speaking after inaugurating the 32nd Annual State Conference of the Karnataka Medico-Legal Society (KAMLS) organized by the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, JN Medical University, at KLE Society in Belagavi.\n\n\u201cSubjects like forensics and toxicology are becoming increasingly important in the administration of criminal justice. They are essential to providing conclusive proof by preparing significant documents and evidence to enable courts to determine the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that their importance cannot be minimized in cases of unnatural death, murders, poisoning, drug use, suicide and other such offences.\n\n\u201cWe will not only consider introducing forensic science and toxicology in law colleges but also extend all support and cooperation to colleges and institutions. We can also see that research in the field of forensics and toxicology are few. Serious research should be increased as it can help speedy justice delivery. Medical experts are adept at collecting sensitive evidence unseen by investigating officers. We need to support them,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nThe Minister also said that a significant number of criminal cases is not being dealt in a professional manner. It seems they are being seen as commercial deals. Some lawyers have become adept in confusing witnesses. But then, this trend is reducing as the levels of legal awareness are increasing among the common public, he said.\n\n\u201cWe should realise that ensuring justice in criminal cases will act as a deterrent and reduce the occurrence of serious offences. It is our responsibility to see that prosecutors present proper material and human witnesses before courts. This has become easy due to the increased use of technological tools for evidence collection,\u201d Mr. Patil said.\n\nKLE Society chairman Prabhakar Kore said that the number of trained doctors in areas like forensic sciences and toxicology has increased significantly making it easy for carrying out procedures like post-mortem.\n\n\u201cThat is because training is free and students get stipend. But it was very difficult to find such professionals in the 1980s,\u201d he said. He suggested that the government provide proper training to those who maintain law and order and carry out criminal investigation.\n\nKAHER Vice-Chancellor Nithin Gangane, principal N.S.
