        "text": "New Delhi: Former India player and head coach Ravi Shastri backed current coach Gautam Gambhir to soon learn from the setbacks in the early phase of his stint at the helm in the national set-up.\r\n\r\nShastri's comments come after India suffered their first-ever Test series loss at home in 12 years, through a 113-run defeat to New Zealand in the second Test at Pune.\r\n\r\nGambhir, who took over as India's coach from Rahul Dravid in July, also saw the team lose its first bilateral ODI series against Sri Lanka after 27 years in August.\r\n\r\n\"New Zealand have beaten them (India) handsomely in both the Test matches. It's food for thought (on series loss). He (Gambhir) has just taken over the job. It's never easy being coach of a team that has such a big following. It's still early days in his career as a coach. But he'll soon learn,\" said Shastri when on air in the match at MCA Stadium, Gahunje.\r\n\r\nAfter an eight-wicket loss to New Zealand in the first Test at Bengaluru, the defeat in Pune inside three days meant India's unbeaten 18-series streak at home was brought to a screeching halt.\r\n\r\nThe last time India lost a Test series at home was in November-December 2012, when they lost to Alastair Cook-led England 2-1.\r\n\r\nThough India have retained their top spot in the ongoing World Test Championship cycle, the Rohit Sharma-led side has suffered a drop in their points percentage to be at 62.82 points percentage.\r\n\r\nThere is now not much to separate India from Australia, who are at number two on the standings with 62.50 points percentage. With New Zealand having an unassailable 2-0 lead, India will be aiming for a consolation win when the third and final Test of the series takes place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai from November 1-5, before heading to Australia for the all-important five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series.",

And from there obviously do the best I can to defend,\" Sainz said.\r\n\r\n\"I have two guys behind fighting for quite important things and the run down into Turn One should be interesting. I have obviously less to lose in that sense,\" he added.\r\n\r\nTo boost his title hopes, Norris needs to win the race and hope the Ferraris finish between him and Verstappen. But the Briton fears the pace of the Ferraris - Leclerc has taken two wins and a second in the last four races.\r\n\r\nNorris, who needs to win the race and hopes Ferraris to finish ahead of Verstappen to bolster his title hopes. \"The last few weekends, they've been extremely quick and quicker than us, so it's... I don't have the confidence to say, yes, we can just beat them on pace. Like today, not on their level,\" said Norris, who needs to win the race and hope Ferraris to finish ahead of Verstappen to bolster his title chances. I had definitely nowhere near close to 0.3 seconds left in the car. So it was more that they just went quicker. I was at the limit.\"\r\n\r\nVerstappen was pleased to secure a front-row start after a challenging Friday, during which he completed only six laps due to an engine issue that left him with \"basically no data.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were massively on the back foot,\" Verstappen said. \"After yesterday, I knew it would be a tough weekend, but we kept making little improvements with the car. \"Qualifying felt better and to be on the front row is an incredible result if you look back at yesterday.\"",

Then he took a flight back to London that evening and then returned to India after two days,\u201d alleged Ambedkar, the grandson of the Chief Architect of the Indian Constitution B. R. Ambedkar.\n\nRejecting the claims, NCP (SP) National Spokesperson Clyde Crasto said that it is clear that Ambedkar is attempting to create a \u2018fake narrative\u2019 ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear\u2026 He is speaking on behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2026 He is just trying to float a narrative with the state assembly polls coming up soon,\u201d said Crasto dismissively.\n\nOn the purported trip around 35 years ago, Ambedkar questioned that as Pawar was the Chief Minister then did he get the permission of the Central government before travelling abroad.\n\n\u201cDid the Centre allow him to travel and attend the meetings in California then? If yes, then was he also permitted to go and meet Dawood in Dubai?

However, Kyodo News polls suggest they are facing significant challenges.\n\nIn Japan\u2019s first general election since 2021, voters will cast two ballots each \u2014 one for a candidate in a single-seat constituency and another for a party in proportional representation. Final results are anticipated by early Monday, reports Kyodo News.\n\nA total of 1,300 candidates are competing for the 465 seats \u2014 289 in single-seat districts and 176 through proportional representation.\n\nIshiba dissolved the lower house on October 9, just eight days after taking office, pledging to restore public trust in politics and advance key policy initiatives.\n\nThe 67-year-old premier has promised to ease the inflationary burden on households, bolster national defence against regional threats, and enhance regional economies and disaster resilience.\n\nHowever, during the 12-day campaign, the LDP faced backlash after reports emerged that the party provided 20 million yen (approximately $132,000) to local branches led by members who lacked official party backing due to a slush funds scandal.\n\nThe scandal has shadowed the LDP since late 2023, eroding public support to levels that ultimately led Ishiba\u2019s predecessor, Fumio Kishida, to step down and clear the way for a leadership change.\n\nThe main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), hopes to leverage public discontent with the LDP, which has governed Japan for most of the postwar period.\n\nPrior to the recent dissolution, the ruling camp controlled the more powerful lower house with 288 seats, comfortably above the majority threshold of 233. The LDP held 256 seats, while the CDPJ had 98.\n\nTo achieve its long-sought goal of amending Japan\u2019s Constitution, the LDP must secure a two-thirds majority, or 310 seats, allowing them to propose a revision ahead of a national referendum.",

Artists often use brushes made from twigs, rice straw, or even fingers to create intricate designs. They have been traditionally created by women, especially during festivals and harvest seasons. The art is a form of gratitude for the harvest and is believed to bring good fortune for the coming year.\n\nMother of Pearl Vase: A masterpiece of coastal craftsmanship\n\nThe Mother of Pearl (MOP) sea shell vase from Maharashtra is a captivating example of fine craftsmanship that combines natural beauty with the rich artisanal tradition of the region.\n\nMother of Pearl, known for its iridescent shimmer, is sourced from the inner layer of certain mollusc shells. It has been prized in many cultures for its symbolic associations with purity, tranquillity, and prosperity.\n\nThe vase features a visually appealing mosaic design, with small, carefully cut pieces of Mother of Pearl in various shades of yellow, black, white, and gray. It represents the perfect blend of nature\u2019s beauty and human craftsmanship. By using sustainable materials from the sea and traditional techniques, artisans create pieces that are as timeless as they are beautiful.\n\nWarli Painting: A traditional art with a modern identity\n\nWarli painting is a tribal art form originating from the Warli tribe primarily located in the Dahanu, Talasari and Palghar regions of Maharashtra, India, renowned for its simplicity and deep connection to nature and daily life. This tribal art form is one of the oldest in India, with roots tracing back to around 3000 BCE.\n\nThe art was traditionally created by Warli women on the walls of their mud homes during special occasions like weddings and harvest festivals. Through their art, they documented their lifestyle, customs, and rituals in a visual storytelling format that transcended language.\n\nWhat makes Warli art distinctive is its monochromatic colour scheme. Traditionally, Warli artists used a white pigment made from rice paste, applied on the earthen, red ochre background of the mud walls. Warli painting is more than just an art form\u2014it is a living narrative of tribal culture, spirituality, and life\u2019s simple yet profound truths.",

Jaishankar on Sunday asserted that India has emerged as a leader in fighting terrorism under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \n\nFurther, amid tense global scenarios and ongoing Iran-Israel and Ukraine-Russia war, he said that India is ready to provide all possible support in the times to come.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Mumbai, Jaishankar said that as far as terrorism is concerned, India has adopted a zero tolerance policy.\n\n\u201cI am in Mumbai which has become a counter terrorism centre for the country and for the world especially after the 26/11 terror attacks. The UNSC\u2019s Counter Terrorism Council summit recently held in Mumbai and in the same hotel which was attacked by the terrorists. We have to be very clear. We say zero tolerance for terrorism and we should not have a repeat about what happened in Mumbai. It cannot be day time doing business and nighttime terrorism\u2026 this will not be accepted. We will expose terrorism and then we will act,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nJaishankar said that after the disengagement agreement between India and China to end the standoff between armies of two countries, India will focus on de-escalation.\n\n\u201cIndia and China on October 21 reached a disengagement agreement whereby soldiers belonging to both the countries will resume patrolling as they did before the 2020 border face-off. The agreement is anticipated to ease patrolling in the Depsang and Demchok areas where patrolling will be restored. However, for implementation of this agreement, it will need some time.\u201d\n\nHe further said, the next level is de-escalation and the third larger issue is how do you manage the border and how do you negotiate the boundary settlement,\u201d he added.\n\nAs far as Kashmir is concerned, he said, \u201cWe have been very clear that there is cross border terrorism\u2026 we have felt that there are many ways to deal with the issue. When Assembly elections were held, voter\u2019s turnout was more than 60 per cent and it was a big statement considering the people\u2019s response. Who wins is a secondary part. India won that day, that many people put their faith on the government\u2019s move to scrap article 370 and remove the hold of separatist policy.\u201d\n\nThe minister said that he went to Pakistan recently with a clear message that India would not compromise on its zero tolerance policy.\n\nOn the issue of entry of illegal migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar, Jaishankar said that the government\u2019s focus is to tighten the border security.\n\nJaishankar made a strong pitch for a double engine government to achieve the Viksit Bharat goal.\n\n\u201cFor Viksit Bharat, Viksit Maharashtra is necessary. Maharashtra is the most industrialised with a long history. There are factories, technology, research, quality of people, environment but there are new possibilities. With the implementation of Centre\u2019s India Middle East Economic Corridor initiative, Maharashtra will benefit a lot with investors investing in ports, logistics, roads and railways. Investors are interested to invest in the state,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nJaishankar however, also called for proper alignment between the Centre and the states to implement slew of development decisions and attract investments.\n\n\u201cInvestors are coming to India and Maharashtra as they look at various factors including governance, alignment between the Centre and the states, smooth implementation of policies on the ground,\u201d he noted.",

Other income surged 55.6 per cent YoY to Rs 296.08 crore.\n\nNet Interest Margin (NIM) improved to 3.90 per cent from 3.86 per cent recorded in Q1 while the cost to income ratio improved significantly to 54.56 per cent YoY from 64.93 per cent.\n\nCommenting on the bank's Q2 numbers, MD and CEO Baldev Prakash said the results are almost in line with the expectations.\n\n\u201cThe bottom-line growth underscores our financial prudence and operational excellence while reflecting our commitment to deliver consistent value for our stakeholders as we stay steady on course to achieve the annual numbers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe, with a healthy balance sheet, a diversified portfolio and consistent focus on digital transformation, we are well-positioned to maintain this growth momentum and capitalize on emerging opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe bank's gross NPA ratio decreased by 131 basis points YoY to 3.95 per cent as against 5.26 per cent recorded in September 2023. Net NPA ratio also moderated to 0.85 per cent from 1.04 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, during the quarter the Return on Assets (RoA) jumped to 1.41 per cent YoY. Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) also improved 55 basis-points YoY to 90.54 per cent.\n\nPrakash said keeping gross NPA below 4 per cent highlights the success of the robust risk management practices of the bank.\n\n\u201cWe have been focusing on proactive asset-quality management and ensuring long-term sustainability in lending. Another highlight of this quarter is RoA, which has surged to 1.41 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\nWith continued improvement in key performance indicators, the bank is reinforcing its position as a leading financial institution focused on profitability and sound asset management, he added.\n\nThe bank's CASA stood at 48.60 per cent, which continues to be one of the highest in the industry.\n\nRegarding business growth, the MD and CEO said during September quarter, \u201cour growth in advances is near 10 per cent, while we have maintained the deposit growth within the range of industry average.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, the bank will intensify efforts to strengthen deposit base and increase loan book to achieve its top-line growth numbers, he said.\n\n\u201cWith a CRAR of almost 15 per cent, we remain well-capitalized, ensuring that the bank is positioned to support future growth opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. Pertinently, the CAR is exclusive of half-yearly profit of Rs 966 crore, which would otherwise result in taking the ratio to 16 per cent,\u201d Prakash added.\n\nHe also emphasized on the prioritisation of carrying forward the digital momentum.\n\n\u201cSince our role as a developmental financial institution here is not just to provide credit, we have to take care that businesses are equipped with the tools they need to manage growth sustainably,\u201d he said.\n\nTherefore, by carrying forward the digital momentum, the bank is also revolutionizing the way its customers experience banking, making it more convenient, swift, secure and efficient for them with every passing day, Prakash added.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we have devised a comprehensive road map to help businesses particularly MSMEs get equipped with beneficial, convenient and efficient management solutions, through collaborative banking with our fintech partners, so that these enterprises sustain growth and enjoy prosperity.\u201d",
