Australia calls incident ‘upsetting’ for Hindu community
Reacting to the incident in Brampton, Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said it was “upsetting” for the Hindu community who had just celebrated Diwali last week and said such acts of vandalism should be dealt by appropriate law enforcement authorities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
“Regardless of their faith, culture, who they are and where they are, all are entitled to be safe and respected and… Particularly, in the week of Diwali, it is a very upsetting thing for members of the Indian community… People have a right to express their views peacefully, We draw a line at that and violence, incitement, hatred and vandalism should be dealt with by appropriate law enforcement authorities,” said Wong.</p>

Meanwhile, India’s Ministry of External Affairs also condemned the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, Ontario yesterday.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
“We call on the Government of Canada to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
“The outreach of our Consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike will not be deterred by intimidation, harassment and violence,” he added.</p>

‘Red lines crossed’: Brampton attack condemned by leaders
Hours after the attack, several Canadian lawmakers and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in the country demanded strict action against those involved.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Canadian MP Chandra Arya said a “red line has been crossed” by Canadian Khalistani extremists, and that the Khalistani extremists are getting a free pass in Canada.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Also condemning the attack, the VHP Canada shared a video of the incident on X and wrote, “VHP Canada denounces today’s violent protests at Hindu Sabha Mandir, Brampton, ON and the violence against Hindu community members by Khalistani extremists.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”
Upholding the right to practice religion “freely and safely”, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday called the violence at a Hindu temple near Toronto “unacceptable”, but failed to call out the pro-Khalistani elements who have been orchestrating violent acts in his regime.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
India’s political parties, often at odds over ideological differences, came together to condemn the attack on a Hindu temple in Canada and called on Ottawa to ensure accountability for the incident.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “Not only all the political parties of the country but all the 140 crore people of the country are standing shoulder to shoulder with the Government of India on this issue,” said AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal.</p>
