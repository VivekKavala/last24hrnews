                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Is it too early to start?While the raging Indian markets have pulled in many an unlikely investor in the past few years, pushing youngsters on the threshold of adulthood into this ‘risky’ avenue could be seen as extreme by many.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Yet, experts disagree.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>“Early exposure to equity can demystify investing and help teens see it as an approachable, systematic process rather than a complex, blackhole scenario,” says Abhijit Bhave, MD & CEO, Equirus Wealth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “While 16 years can be a good starting age because teens are beginning to understand real-world financial concepts, at 17, they can definitely grasp basic concepts like risk, return and long-term growth potential of investments,” he adds.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>“Some teens are already exposed to these concepts through their families or friend circles, but this age is appropriate for giving them an orientation, assuming they have an interest,” agrees Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>There is no dearth of interest for Japneet Singh Bhalla, the 17-year-old who started with an IPO last year and now invests in stocks, ETFs and mutual funds—with his parents’ account and most of their money.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Not only is he uncannily familiar with market concepts and jargon but, more surprisingly, Bhalla is a self-starter.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “My parents have no knowledge about the markets.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>The approach can be subjective depending on the parents, but the consensus is clear.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It’s a good idea for parents to prod their teens towards equity investing, be it stocks or mutual funds.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It not only opens up a seemingly arcane investing avenue, but also prepares them for more focused investing when they start earning, and gives them a long horizon for wealth creation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>“Compounding in equities takes time, and time is compounding’s best friend.</p>
