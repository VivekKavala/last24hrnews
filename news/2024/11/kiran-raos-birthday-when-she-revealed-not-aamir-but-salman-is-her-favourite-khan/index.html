                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Happy birthday, Kiran Rao! Today, November 7 marks her 51st birthday and on this special occasion, let’s uncover her hidden liking for a Khan in the industry.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Surprisingly, it’s not her ex-husband Aamir Khan.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Talking about Kiran’s career at a glance, the filmmaker has produced a number of films, including Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na, Peepli Live, Delhi Belly, Talaash, Dangal and Laal Singh Chaddha.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She made her directorial debut with Dhobi Ghat in 2011, and her 2024 release Laapataa Ladies made waves after hitting OTT platform Netflix.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Going down the memory lane, in an old interview with India TV, Kiran Rao was asked about her favourite Khan in the industry.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She was even given the example of Shah Rukh Khan’s doting wife, Gauri Khan, who credits Aamir Khan as her favourite Khan in the industry.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, the filmmaker made a startling revelation and took Salman Khan’s name.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Aamir, who was also present during the interview, quizzed his ex-wife about the reason.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> To this, Kiran said, “I just enjoy watching him.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I haven’t seen all his films, but woh jab aate hai main dekhna chahti hu unko (I want to see him when he appears).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He’s got charisma.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”
Kiran further mentioned that she finds Salman entertaining.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The Laapataa Ladies director revealed that she had seen his movies Dabangg and No Entry, and found his work extremely well.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She also stated, “Maine Pyar Kiya, way back to his first film.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” This revelation of her admiration for Salman adds an intriguing layer to her personality.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
Salman Khan also tends to be a big fan of Kiran Rao’s works.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> When the filmmaker’s Laapataa Ladies premiered, the superstar took to his X handle and penned a heartfelt note for the entire team of the film.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Initially his tweet read, “Just saw Kiran Rao’s Laapataa Ladies.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wah wah Kiran.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Congrats on your debut as a director, superb job.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Kab kaam karoge mere saath?” However, Salman’s tweet made a huge goof up, and he had to face social media trolling.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Since Salman congratulated Kiran for her debut directorial while talking about Laapataa Ladies, netizens reminded him that Dhobi Ghat was her first film.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They even highlighted that the actor had also attended the premiere.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> One user wrote, “Bro u literally attended the function for her directorial debut Dhobi Ghat 14 years ago,” while another joked, “This is Dhobi Ghat erasure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”
Soon, he had to delete the previous one and repost it with the note that read, “Just saw Kiran Rao’s Laapataa Ladies.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wah wah (Wow, wow) Kiran.</p>
