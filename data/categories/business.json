        "text": "NEW DELHI: Indian batting sensation Yashasvi Jaiswal has etched his name in cricketing history, becoming the first Indian batter to hit 30 sixes in a calendar year in Test matches.Jaiswal, known for his elegant batting, demonstrated that his power-hitting acumen extends beyond the shortest format with this remarkable milestone.The landmark six came early in India\u2019s chase of 359 against New Zealand during the second Test in Pune.Facing Tim Southee in the innings' first over, Jaiswal announced his intentions in emphatic style, smashing the second ball of the first over over deep square leg for a massive six.The commentators praised the youngster's intent as the opener effortlessly dispatched a length delivery from Southee. Later, he went on to smash two more sixes before the lunch break.\u2014 JioCinema (@JioCinema) Jaiswal now shares an elite list, becoming only the second batter in men\u2019s Test cricket to achieve this feat.New Zealand\u2019s Brendon McCullum first set the benchmark with 30 sixes in 2014. But with Jaiswal still having matches left in the year, he could extend the record even further.Batters with 30+ Sixes in a Calendar Year in Tests:Brendon McCullum (New Zealand) \u2013 2014Yashasvi Jaiswal (India) \u2013 2024*Jaiswal\u2019s aggressive start offered a glimmer of hope in India\u2019s daunting task of chasing 359. However, with India trailing the three-match series 1-0 and facing their first potential home Test series defeat since 2012, the pressure is immense. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfVGXwheYa8New Zealand\u2019s spinners have dominated the series, with Mitchell Santner\u2019s 7-53 in India\u2019s first innings putting the visitors firmly in control.India\u2019s bowlers fought back on Day 3, with Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja sharing seven wickets to bowl New Zealand out for 255. But the hosts need a record-breaking chase to stay alive in the series.",

        "text": "One of India's leading stockbroking companies has resolved pending issues with the country's market regulator through monetary settlement. Angel One, a prominent equity trading platform, paid Rs. 5.75 crore to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to conclude inquiries into multiple alleged rule breaches.\n\nIn March, SEBI had initiated investigations against Angel One through adjudication and inquiry notices regarding certain regulatory matters. The notices sought Angel One's response on why penalties should not be imposed under relevant SEBI laws. After evaluating the case, SEBI's whole-time members approved receiving the recommended amount from Angel One on October 15. The firm transferred the funds on October 23 without accepting or denying the investigation's findings.\n\nThe settlement brings an end to SEBI's inquiries and allows both sides to avoid a lengthy legal process. It remains unclear what specific violations triggered the regulator's action initially. However, Angel One's swift cooperation in resolving the matter through payment suggests the aim was compliance over denial or litigation. The amount also factors in the scale and commercial impact of Angel One's operations.\n\nFor investors, the development highlights SEBI's role in enforcing transparency and oversight of capital markets. It ensures brokerage houses follow prescribed conduct norms to preserve investors' faith in fair play. Angel One can now focus fully on servicing clients while SEBI continues its efforts to strengthen regulatory practices for sustainable market growth.",

In 1946, in view of the possibility of getting independence soon, 13 out of 15 provincial committees of the Congress proposed the name of Sardar Patel for the national president, so that he could become the first Prime Minister of independent India. But despite the proposal of an invincible majority, this could not happen due to the insistence of Gandhi in favour of Nehru and the country was deprived of a strong and practical leadership. This adversely affected the policies of the nation in various domestic and foreign matters, for which we are suffering till date.\n\nSardar's view towards the economic affairs of the country was very practical. It was full of humanity and the need of the hour. More production, equitable distribution, and fair treatment of all the means of production were the mainstays of his economic policy. He made it clear that achieving industrial dexterity and self-reliance through progressive development would be the first goal of the nation, which would increase the prosperity of the common mass and ensure a high standard of living for them. In a speech given in Kolkata on January 5, 1948, he stressed that before nationalization of industries it is necessary to first establish them properly and such people cannot be patriots who believe that workers should reduce production, but they should be given more money.\n\nSardar Patel had realistic views on the planning and economic policy of India. He had emphasized on the co-operation between the three stakeholders, the government, the industrialist and the workers, to counter the economic sickness spreading in the country. He was a staunch supporter of the abolition of control and supported the government's plan to decontrol food and clothing and provide industrial relief. He was opposed to the planning framework which went beyond the country's capacity and resources. He wanted to organize the country's economy on the basis of villages. He firmly believed that once the facilities were provided to the villagers, they would take care of themselves and then their grain production would increase much more than we expected.\n\nPatel was against instilling in the people such hope which would never be fulfilled. He was not against taking foreign loans when needed, which could be spent on production related plans and industrialization. According to Shri N. G. Ranga, in 1936, Rajaji and Sardar Patel had rehearsed that Jawaharlal's socialism would create problems for the social economy of India, so he presided over the Congress and opposed their campaign of socialism from a favorable position. As a result of which Nehru had to wait till the year 1951 i.e. Sardar's death before launching his campaign against the economy of the Indian peasantry and the enterprise of its people.\n\nIn a meeting of Chief Ministers and heads of provincial Congress Committees, Patel clarified that the plan for this country would be different from that of industrialized countries, which were either small in extent or highly developed. Machine is not the complete solution to the problem of this country. Millions of useless hands cannot get work from the machine, because the machine itself displaces man. He emphasized on the expansion of cottage industries, but at the same time called for rapid industrialization in the country to generate sufficient resources, so that the country does not face a serious crisis.\n\nSardar Patel was accused by the so-called socialists of being a friend of the capitalists. He made it clear that on the basis of Gandhiji's teachings, he behaves workers, industrialists, princes, farmers and landlords in equal measure and lovingly inspires them to do the right thing. In the current situation, he was against nationalization. He said that it is necessary to establish industry and increase production in the country before nationalisation. Socialism in England has come there rightly by following the path of industrialization. In India, socialism in true sense lies in the development of cottage industries, which can provide employment to crores of people. By making the spinning wheel more ubiquitous, the concept of Swadeshi can be developed through Khadi.\n\nPatel urged the traders not to import foreign clothes and urged the citizens not to wear it. In order to take a step towards self-reliance, he wrote a letter to the then Industries and Supplies Minister Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookherjee to manufacture the necessary equipments and weapons for the army in the country itself and his idea was supported by the eminent scientist S.S. Bhatnagar. He was of the clear opinion that the pharmaceutical manufacturing industries in India should flourish and there should be no excise duty applicable on inter-provincial trade. He stressed the importance of improving livestock and increasing agricultural production in the country.\n\nSardar Patel wanted to have a good relation between industry and labour, because the differences arising at that time could turn out to be a severe blow to India's industrial future. He insisted on adopting the policy of mediation to solve the problem prevailing between industry and labour, as he had done earlier in Ahmedabad. Although there was a labour government in England and they were far ahead in the field of industrialization, they were moving very slowly towards nationalization. This was likely to lead to industrial peace and good conditions of production. He was strongly against the strike and criticized the organizers who resorted to strikes merely to give importance to their leadership & politics. A strike stops production and less production means promoting poverty. He inspired those who wanted to break this endless cycle.\n\nPatel tried to allay the apprehensions of the industrialists regarding nationalization and assured them that since the industry is yet to be established and expanded, the question of nationalization does not arise. He appealed to the resourceful businessmen to come forward and help the government in improving the condition of the poor and said that when there are crores of people in the country who are hungry, it is a sin to eat comfortably twice a day.\n\nPatel fixed a certain amount for the salary and allowances of the ministers and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and suggested to the Prime Minister that there is no need to deploy more than two security personnel apart from a few policemen to them from the point of view of security. He refused the demand for increase in the allowance payable to the Governor of Odisha. He praised those, who gave up their luxuries to serve the country as a minister or speaker.\n\nIn the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Advisory Council of Industries, Patel told that there is a lot of foreign capital in the country, but after independence it has decreased significantly due to post-World War II inflation, which has increased the prices and taxes have become high. He advised the Finance Minister to re-evaluate the entire taxation according to the current situation in the next budget.\n\nSardar Patel insisted that a committee of experts should be constituted, consisting of industrialists, economists and representatives of the government, who should be entrusted with the task of implementing the framework and policies laid down by the government. The then Prime Minister, Nehru, who had earlier decided to create a separate ministry for social and economic affairs, changed his mind after hearing Sardar's views and agreed to set up a board or special advisory committee, which will monitor the economic situation at every step and submit its suggestions to the government for consideration.\n\nSardar Patel's advice on the economic policies of the nation was not followed after his death. India adopted a so-called socialist framework, due to which there were dire consequences and the country had to pay a heavy price. Communist Russia, which Nehru regarded as the ideal state, had to face unimaginable difficulties and eventually due to its disintegration, it had to return to a free economy in mid-Ninety.\n\nThe liberal steps taken by the Narsimha Rao government shortly before the disintegration and economic ruin of Soviet Russia confirms Patel's foregoing thought and realistic approach. Nehru's socialism had brought the country to such a place that the Congress Government at the Center had to reverse the policies and liberalize the economy, which was not thought of forty years ago.\n\n(The author is a technocrat \n\n& educationist.

This follows a complaint filed with the Prime Minister\u2019s public grievance cell over violation of the Section 106 A(C) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. \n\nKannur-based ophthalmologist and RTI activist K.V. Babu, who had filed the complaint on September 23, was informed on October 23 that Bhargava Phytolabs, the manufacturing company, had not submitted any application for the renewal of the licence. Quoting the State Drugs Controller, Rajasthan, the PMO also said that the licence stood cancelled. \n\nProprietary name \n\nDr. Babu had earlier filed a complaint on January 24 with the Drugs Controller General of India seeking action against the manufacturer under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. Section 106 A(C) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, says that no homoeopathic medicine containing a single ingredient shall bear a proprietary name on its label. The particulars shall either be printed or written in indelible ink and shall appear in a conspicuous manner on the label of the innermost container of any homoeopathic medicine and on every other covering in which the container is packed. \n\nThe Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) sought a review of the licence in June and the Union Ayush Ministry found the labelling incorrect. \u201cMy concern was that a tablet being made available with the name insulin may confuse the patients, who may switch over from insulin injection to the tablets. This could lead to uncontrolled diabetes, especially in children. I approached the PM\u2019s grievance cell as the State Drugs Controller of Rajasthan and the manufacturer refused to budge even after the CDSCO and the Union Ayush Ministry made their stand clear about the illegal labelling,\u201d Dr. Babu said. \n\nIn their reply to the authorities, the manufacturer had said in May that the drug had been \u201clicensed\u201d by the Rajasthan State Drug Licensing Authority. The Ayush Ministry, however, found that the manufacturer was labelling the product as a brand name and indicating its composition saying \u201cEach tablet of 400 mg contains Insulin 6x\u201d. Insulin 6x is a single ingredient drug in this case and writing \u2018Insulin Tablets\u2019 on the label imitating it as a proprietary name was in violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. The Ministry had also noted that the manufacturer may be directed to prominently label the product as \u201cInsulin Homoeopathic trituration tablets\u201d with appropriate potency for which it has obtained licence instead of using \u201cInsulin tablets\u201d as a proprietary name to avoid confusion and misleading information in public interest.",

You should not outsource, you should not export data to import intelligence. There\u2019s a new manufacturing industry, don\u2019t wait to jump into this one 20 years later. Enter this one at Ground Zero. India already has the IT industry producing software for the world and the shift to producing digital intelligence is so close now. It\u2019s going to be a truly multi-trillion dollar industry, the beginning of a new industrial revolution. I can\u2019t wait to see India manufacture artificial intelligence at scale,\u201d Huang said. \n\nHuang, who used to wash toilets and clean dishes before he founded Nvidia, said India should lead the way in manufacturing AI. \u201cOther countries have been manufacturing chips and systems. No one manufactures intelligence at the moment. Before every other country jumps into it, India should jump into that,\u201d said Huang.\n\nWhen asked if Nvidia would consider manufacturing chipsets in India, Huang said that India is already world-class in designing chips. \u201cOur centres in Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore are already designing here. Our AI is developed in all these centres. A third of Nvidia is in India. It is also a reason why so many of the world\u2019s capability centres are in India. Now it is good to see India move into manufacturing,\u201d he said, adding that Nvidia has close to 10,000 employees in India.\n\nResponding to a question from businessline about regulating AI to manage risks, Huang said that regulations should not be targeted at the technology but at the usage. \u201cThere is no simple answer but the best way to look at this is to innovate technology that would keep the technology safe. There is a constant debate between how to regulate, when to regulate and how much to regulate,\u201d Huang said.",

As the market navigates these challenges, investors remain cautious amid uncertain economic conditions.\u201d\n\nGift Nifty at 24,450 signals flat opening.\n\nSiddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said that Nifty has been consolidating for the last two sessions following persistent foreign outflows and dull earnings. We expect this range-bound move (Nifty hovering around the 24400-24500 zone) to continue without any major triggers, while the earning season would drive sectorial rotation.\u201d\n\nKey results to watch out for today is BEL, Chola Investment, JSW Steel, HPCL, Coal India, and BPCL, he said.\n\nPranay Aggarwal, CEO of Stoxkart - a discount broker, said: The overall market is currently in an oversold zone, which indicates Doji could be positive for the short term. However, the medium-term trend remains bearish as long as Nifty stays below the 25000 mark. A decisive move above 24500 could trigger a short-term pullback or relief rally following the recent decline. Conversely, a slide below 24300 may increase selling pressure, potentially pushing us down towards 24200 and 24100 levels as well.

        "text": "Amid the ongoing inflation in Pakistan, All Pakistan Textile Mills Association has demanded a reduction in interest rates to enhance textile exports.According to ARY News, Kamran Arshad Chairperson of APTMA has called for a 400 basis point reduction in interest rates to enhance textile exports.He emphasized that the current effective interest rate of 10.6 per cent is detrimental to the industry\u2019s growth. Arshad pointed out that despite inflation dropping to 6.9 per cent, the interest rate remains at 17.5 per cent, posing serious challenges for the sector, ARY News.He argued that an immediate decrease in interest rates is vital for economic recovery and job creation, as the high borrowing costs threaten the stability of the textile industry. Lower interest rates, he asserted, are essential for fostering economic revival and generating employment opportunities.The report further stated that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb suggested on Wednesday that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) may consider lowering the interest rate further in its upcoming Monetary Policy meeting in November.He noted that the SBP has already reduced its benchmark interest rate by 450 basis points over the last three meetings, bringing it down from a high of 22 per cent to 17.5 per cent.In an interview with Bloomberg during the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, Aurangzeb mentioned that the next meeting on November 4 could lead to another policy rate cut. He also stated that the current government is actively working to increase the share of taxes in the economy to 135 per cent.Currently, the interest rate in Pakistan stands at around 17.5 per cent, following a series of cuts by the SBP in response to economic conditions.The SBP\u2019s adjustments aimed to support economic growth while controlling inflation. Since becoming a member of the IMF in 1950, Pakistan has availed itself of 25 IMF programs, with the most recent being a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) approved in September 2024.This new USD 7 billion loan marks Pakistan\u2019s 25th IMF program since independence in 1947, the highest number of any country, according to Voice of America.",

During the discussion, he approved the release of Rs 150 crore for managing street lights in rural and urban areas, allocating Rs 100 crore specifically for rural gram panchayats and Rs 50 crore for urban locations.Naidu emphasised the need to reduce energy consumption, directing officials to ensure that 100 per cent of street lights are equipped with LED technology. He criticised the previous government for inaction, stating that it had rendered village panchayats ineffective and failed to settle outstanding dues for street light management.To enhance monitoring and management of street lighting, the Chief Minister called for adopting technology, noting that transitioning to LED lights could save 30 to 60 per cent in electricity costs. He urged the revival of successful policies from the previous Telugu Desam government to lead the state in energy efficiency.Additionally, Naidu announced the introduction of electric induction stoves in 55,000 anganwadi centres to reduce reliance on cooking gas. Officials were instructed to coordinate with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) for this initiative.To streamline street light management, Naidu ordered the formation of a three-member committee comprising representatives from the Finance Department, Energy Department, and EESL to provide development reports.In a significant partnership, the state government signed a memorandum of understanding with EESL to supply energy-efficient appliances to 1.5 lakh homes, with plans to extend services to another 900,000 homes.

Another highlight of this quarter is RoA, which has surged to 1.41 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\nWith continued improvement in key performance indicators, the bank is reinforcing its position as a leading financial institution focused on profitability and sound asset management, he added.\n\nThe bank's CASA stood at 48.60 per cent, which continues to be one of the highest in the industry.\n\nRegarding business growth, the MD and CEO said during September quarter, \u201cour growth in advances is near 10 per cent, while we have maintained the deposit growth within the range of industry average.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, the bank will intensify efforts to strengthen deposit base and increase loan book to achieve its top-line growth numbers, he said.\n\n\u201cWith a CRAR of almost 15 per cent, we remain well-capitalized, ensuring that the bank is positioned to support future growth opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. Pertinently, the CAR is exclusive of half-yearly profit of Rs 966 crore, which would otherwise result in taking the ratio to 16 per cent,\u201d Prakash added.\n\nHe also emphasized on the prioritisation of carrying forward the digital momentum.\n\n\u201cSince our role as a developmental financial institution here is not just to provide credit, we have to take care that businesses are equipped with the tools they need to manage growth sustainably,\u201d he said.\n\nTherefore, by carrying forward the digital momentum, the bank is also revolutionizing the way its customers experience banking, making it more convenient, swift, secure and efficient for them with every passing day, Prakash added.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we have devised a comprehensive road map to help businesses particularly MSMEs get equipped with beneficial, convenient and efficient management solutions, through collaborative banking with our fintech partners, so that these enterprises sustain growth and enjoy prosperity.\u201d",

The BSE index slid by over 900 points, while the Nifty fell below the 24,500 mark, marking an erratic day for Indian equities. \n\nAt 3:10 PM, Sensex plunged by 902 points, or 1.11%, to 80,249, and Nifty succumbed to a fall of 1.25%, losing 310 points at 24,471. The sharp fall at both Sensex and Nifty deprived the market of its nearly Rs 8.9 lakh crore in market capitalization, which clearly signifies how turbulent today\u2019s market has been.\n\nFactors Affecting Stock Market Today: Sensex and Nifty in Pressure Zone\n\nThis led to an increase in the stock market today mainly due to profit booking after a strong rally witnessed in the recent sessions. The analysts claimed that the share market was seen witnessing the Sensex and as well as Nifty dip today as there is huge profit-taking going on, which had been spurred by high market valuations. Market experts predict possible corrections and hence Sensex and Nifty saw their reaction to both local and global economic cues.\n\nFII selling hits the stock market today\n\nThe greatest spoiler for the downward slide in the equity market today has been sustained selling by FIIs, seeming to be making the Sensex and as well as Nifty take the downward road. \n\nFIIs have been selling at record levels, offloading Rs 88,244 crore worth of shares alone in October, putting pressure on both indices. The FII selling thus caused appears to be balanced out to a certain extent only by DIIs and not sufficiently to prevent the Sensex and the Nifty from sliding.\n\nGlobal Markets Add to the Woes of Securities Market Today\n\nAgain echoing the woes of the stock market, poor Asian market performances also reflected poorly on the Sensex and as well as Nifty. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi witnessed jarring dips that went through their due share of reverberations in Indian equities. The stock market today saw heavy selling pressure as Sensex and Nifty followed the global trends downwards.\n\nAs the volatile nature of the stock market continues to gain momentum, analysts believe that Sensex and Nifty are unlikely to recover in the short term. Corrections remain in the pipeline.\n\nAlso, see: Bengaluru police arrest Axis Bank manager in Rs 97 crore stock market fraud",

        "text": "Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s (J&K\u2019s) apple industry, the backbone of its agrarian economy, has shaped the region\u2019s social and economic fabric for centuries. As the largest producer of apples in India, the valley\u2019s orchards not only support thousands of livelihoods but also position the region on the global fruit market map. Apple farming is the largest employment generator in J&K, with nearly 3.5 million farmers \u2014 27 per cent of the region\u2019s population \u2014 involved in growing the fruit, whose export contributes more than 8 per cent to the region\u2019s GDP. However, behind this thriving industry lies a crisis of fluctuating market forces, geopolitical tensions, and environmental challenges.\n\nThreats and challenges\n\nKashmir\u2019s apple growers are increasingly relying on cold storage units to navigate fluctuating demand. With over 40 cold storage facilities, mostly in SIDCO Lassipora, capable of holding more than 2.5 lakh tonnes, these controlled-atmospheric units provide a crucial buffer. However, with limited cold storage in Kashmir, many apple growers are left with no choice but to sell early at low prices, or risk watching their produce go to waste.\n\nThe influx of foreign apples has driven down prices for Kashmiri apples, leaving local growers struggling against a tide of cheaper imports. The flood of Iranian, Washington, and South African apples has sharply eroded the dominance of Kashmiri apples. J&K\u2019s apple industry is hindered by the region\u2019s rugged terrain and insufficient infrastructure. The fragile transportation network, often blocked by political instability or harsh weather, further impedes the timely distribution of produce. Erratic weather patterns, particularly frequent hailstorms, devastate orchards.\n\nReviving the orchard\n\nA growing demand for organic and premium apple varieties is reshaping the market, driven by health-conscious consumers. The apple growers in Kashmir are unable to produce organically grown apples. Promoting traditional apples grown organically in Kashmir is essential to safeguard health and preserve the region\u2019s agricultural heritage and enhance sustainability. Hanabi \u2014 an innovative solution (advanced pesticide) to boost apple farming in Kashmir \u2014 must be used in the early stage of rat infestation.\n\nThe National Conference, now at the helm in J&K, must turn their promises into action, especially when it comes to the apple industry. The new government must craft a robust natural farming policy, and must enhance the quality of Kashmiri apples through better farming practices, pest management, and post-harvest handling to meet international standards.\n\nFarmers must be encouraged to diversify their crops or invest in value-added products like apple juice, cider, or dried apples to reduce dependence on fresh apple sales. The Modified High Density Plantation Scheme, set to span 5,500 hectares in J&K from March 2021 to March 2026, embodies a vision for agricultural revitalisation. This scheme could serve as a force for economic growth, empowering farmers and boosting the apple industry through increased productivity and sustainability.\n\nKashmir\u2019s apple growers face triple burden \u2014 spurious pesticides that threaten crops, an erratic climate disrupting yields, and the glaring absence of insurance coverage. This leaves them vulnerable, with little protection for their labour or livelihood. The Market Intervention Scheme for apple procurement in Jammu and Kashmir addresses the needs of perishable agricultural and horticultural commodities excluded from the Minimum Support Price. By stabilising market prices and ensuring timely procurement, this initiative can safeguard farmers\u2019 livelihoods and reduce post-harvest losses.\n\nJ&K\u2019s economy hinges on a single national highway, its vital lifeline to the rest of the country. Yet, this crucial route is often blocked, leaving the region\u2019s trade at a standstill. The highway must be operational round the year, or alternative routes must emerge.\n\nBilal teaches politics at Government Degree College, Beerwah.

        "title": "Coral craze that guided business interests",
        "text": "Working on the history of Coral Merchant Street recently, I mused on how this marine invertebrate has had an importance far exceeding gems. Though the Sephardic Jewish merchants in Madras of the 17th and 18th Centuries traded in many precious stones, it is as coral merchants that they are remembered. And interestingly, it is one of two marine animal products used in jewellery that are commemorated in area names in George Town. After all, the eastern end is still known as Muthialpet (the pearl district), while just to the rear of it, where Coral Merchant Street is, was Pagadalupet (the coral district), though that name is largely forgotten. Of course, pearl and coral make for a good combination in Indian jewellery, but the importance of coral, over and above diamonds and emeralds, is intriguing to say the least. \n\nIn demand since Roman times \n\nIt was corals from the Mediterranean that Indians hankered after, and they were in demand from Roman times. The red variety was much sought after, and Indians were willing to pay high prices. Centuries later, when the colonials came along, the demand was undiminished. In fact, it had multiplied. And the Europeans saw an opportunity. A proper network was established and Portuguese Jewish dealers in London began sending out coral in large quantities to Madras. The proceeds from the sale were invested in diamonds, which were exported from here. Eventually, they sent representatives to settle here and carry on the Indian end of the business. \n\nCompany records are full of references to coral. As I have written in The Hindu dated October 23, 2015 (A Temple and Its Builder), it was by secretly selling a consignment of coral worth 1,200 pounds that Samudra Mudali, dubash to Governor Francis Hastings, made his fortune. In Ananda Ranga Pillai\u2019s diary, Governor Dupleix keeps asking him about the quantity of coral in stock and what prices it would fetch. And, in the 1760s, the enormously corrupt and wily George, Lord Pigot, managed to convince the Company that the Governor of Madras ought to get a 2 \u00bd percent cut on proceeds of all coral sales in the region. The money he made on this was one of the bones of contention with his council, which led to a coup against him and his mysterious death. The commission on coral would last till 1801, when Edward, the Second Lord Clive, as Governor, relinquished it. Having written all the above, I am yet to fathom what was the reason for such a high demand for coral. That it was in use for jewellery is certain, and it was also probably used as a constituent in aphrodisiacs, but what else could have contributed to the craze? By the 19th Century, it was on the wane and had become yet another item on ornaments. But while it lasted, it had a good run, and many in Madras did well out of it. \n\nNew light on New Street \n\nLast week\u2019s article on New Street had M.S.R. Ravichandran writing to me. He has been living there for five decades, he says, and his ancestors have been residents there for four generations. Though they always referred to it as Pudu Theru (New Street), he says land records from 1880 carry the name Sengazhuneer Pillaiyar Koil Street and there is a temple to Ganesha at the end of the thoroughfare. That had me checking my street directory of 1932 and sure enough, that is the correct name. Why did it become New Street and when remains a mystery. \n\n(V. Sriram is a writer and historian.)",

        "title": "Opinion: Save Indigenous languages",
        "text": "By Geetartha Pathak\r\n\r\nOn October 3, the Centre approved five new classical languages: Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali. This increased the total number of recognised classical languages in India to 11, which includes Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia. Some critics said political motivations could be behind such a move.\r\n\r\nThe Shiv Sena-BJP-led government in Maharashtra formed a \u201cpersuasion\u201d committee, led by former diplomat Dnyaneshwar Muley, a few months ago to get Marathi recognised as a classical language. The demand was raised many times by MPs from Maharashtra in Parliament, and the Centre gave assurances at least three times in the last 10 years that Marathi was being considered for according classical status.\r\n\r\nOdia was declared a classical language in 2014 after much political persuasion. Interestingly, Odia, which is viewed by many as a dialect of Bengali, got recognition as a classical language ten years before Bengali was recognised as a classical language. The Assembly elections in Maharashtra is next month and the timing of recognising Marathi as a classical language indicates the political angle to it. The inclusion of Bengali and Assamese too may have some link with the nearing of Assembly elections in these two States.\r\n\r\nDropping Key Provision\r\n\r\nThe Union Cabinet\u2019s decision to accord classical language status to these five languages came after a key provision, which mandated that a language must have an original literary tradition, was dropped. The Linguistic Expert Committee discussed and understood that it was very difficult to prove or disprove (original literary tradition) as all ancient languages borrowed from each other.\r\n\r\nThe initial criteria evolved by the government to determine the declaration of a language as classical are: it should have high antiquity of its early texts, recorded history of over 1,500-2,000 years, a body of ancient literature or texts that is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers, the literary tradition should be original and not borrowed from another speech community. Another criterion is that the said language and literature should be distinct from its modern format; there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots.\r\n\r\nOnce notified, the Education Ministry provides certain benefits to promote the language, which include two major annual international awards for scholars of eminence in the said languages. Apart from this, a centre of excellence for studies in the classical language is set up, and the University Grants Commission is requested to create a certain number of Professional Chairs in central universities for the languages that get the classical tag. These measures may help to some extent but to ensure the survival and growth of such languages much more efforts are needed. Moreover, all the 11 recognised classical languages are dominating languages in their respective States. The languages of the indigenous and tribal people need more attention as many such languages are vanishing fast.\r\n\r\nEndangered Language\r\n\r\nThe UNESCO recorded that 2,469 languages are at risk of extinction. With globalisation, major languages like English are pushing the languages with few speakers to the deathbed. Migration, cultural fusion and absence of written script are some of the reasons for the disappearance of languages. One of the examples of endangered language is Irish, which is also known as Gaeilge. It is an official language of the Republic of Ireland but is endangered due to historical factors and language shifts. Half of the languages that exist today worldwide will disappear over the next century. In Latin America and the Caribbean, one in every five indigenous people has already lost their native tongue \u2014 44% now speak Spanish and 55% Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThere are 7,000 documented languages currently spoken across the world, but half of them could be endangered, according to a new study. It is predicted that 1,500 known languages may no longer be spoken by the end of this century. Researchers from The Australian National University analysed thousands of languages to identify factors that put endangered ones at risk. The findings highlight a link between higher levels of schooling and language loss, as regionally dominant languages taught in class often overshadow indigenous languages.\r\n\r\nThe link between the endangering of language and more roads or climate change may sound like an absurd likelihood, however, it is real. \u201cWe found that the more roads there are, connecting country to city, and villages to towns, the higher the risk of languages being endangered. It is as if roads are helping dominant languages \u2018steamroll\u2019 over other smaller languages,\u201d said Professor Lindell Bromham, co-author of the above-mentioned study. Climate changes oblige the communities to relocate, creating climate change refugees. The catastrophes caused 23.7 million internal displacements in 2021, most of which were due to meteorological consequences.\r\n\r\nWith the material development, indigenous people are losing their land which is often appropriated by corporations vying to get a hold of natural resources. When biodiversity disappears, they lose access to their only source of livelihood. They are then forced to migrate to other rural or urban areas. When these communities split up, their languages begin to face a slow death. The split communities are often compelled to communicate with the dominant language of their new homes and over generations, the traditional tongues become extinct.\r\n\r\nPreserving Them\r\n\r\nWith each indigenous language that disappears, thinking, culture, tradition and the knowledge it encompasses is lost. Allowing a language to disappear is like burning books or bombing museums in wartime. An important part of humanity, its history and way of understanding the world disappear forever when this happens. Many of the languages predicted to be lost in future still have many speakers. Therefore, investing in supporting these Indigenous communities to revitalise their languages may alter the trend of vanishing languages.\r\n\r\nThe Rosetta Project, a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers is working to build a digital library of human languages. The project draws attention to the accelerated loss of the world\u2019s languages and could help preserve many endangered and \u201csleeping\u201d languages for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe UNESCO International Decade of Indigenous Languages, from 2022 to 2032, aims to engage the global community with the critical issue of language loss. The initiative continues the work of the UN\u2019s 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. As part of its plan, it is creating a network of international stakeholders focused on protecting the rights of Indigenous people to revitalise and preserve their languages. Cornish, a dead language spoken in a part of England, was revived with the help of the internet. People found each other online and communities around Cornish were formed. The language has even found its way back into schools. SGaawaay K\u2019uuna, the first feature-length film made completely in Haida, a Canadian indigenous language, encouraged film production in endangered languages. In 2018, it was honoured as the best Canadian film by the Vancouver International Film Festival and Vancouver Film Critics Circle.\r\n\r\nThe government of India should pay more attention to the dwindling Indigenous languages than according recognition to a handful of mainstream languages that too with political motivation and chalk out a project in line with the UNESCO and Rosetta Project, which may save many local communities\u2019 languages from extinction and our rich diverse human heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(The author is a senior journalist from Assam)",

He paid Rs 30 at the counter, expecting the clerk to return 50 paise since the postal fee for the specified destination was Rs 29.50.When Manasha insisted that the balance be returned, he was informed that the system automatically rounded off the amount to Rs 30. He then offered to pay the exact amount through UPI, which the post office declined by citing a technical issue.Manasha mentioned in his complaint to District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that India Post's alleged practice of rounding off daily transactions could lead to significant amounts of money being siphoned off, even resulting in black money and a loss of GST revenue for the government. The post office stated that amounts involving less than 50 paise were invariably \"ignored\" and that the software had been programmed to round off any such amount to the nearest rupee.On Manasha not being allowed to pay through UPI, the post office explained that the \"Pay U\" QR digital payment mode had been malfunctioning since Nov 2023 and was discontinued in May 2024. After hearing both sides, the commission said the post office had admitted to \"overcharging\" due to a software glitch, which amounted to an unfair trade practice under Section 2(47) of Consumer Protection Act, 2019.",

Another linked incident is the three incarnations of Jaya and Vijaya, the door guardians of Vishnu. Third of their incarnation was Shishupala and Dantavakra. Vishnu taking the form of Krishna eliminated Shishupala and Dantavakra pair.\n\n\u2018Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum\u2019 is the prayerful reminder we have for ourselves. Krishna is the chaitanya, consciousness that prevails in all. Universal consciousness when took the human form, it assumed the shape and rupa of Sri Krishna. This is the reason we find that irrespective of number of problems Krishna faced in life, he was unperturbed. He was unshaken. Krishna is the epitome of the vyavahara gyana and also para vidya.\n\nBorn to imprisoned parents and inside the prison is not a good experience for any. Then getting separated from parents, growing up in a different context, and like \u2018one among them\u2019 could be done only by Krishna. Multiple attempts on the life of Sri Krishna have no parallel. Ranging from calf to donkey to cart to storm, the danger could come in any shape and form. One has to be constantly aware of. The final call came from the suspicious Kamsa that the brothers are \u201cinvited\u201d for the yagya that happened at the capital. The only aim was to eliminate brother duo. The attempt failed, and Kamsa lost life.\n\nKrishna\u2019s attached detachment is a wonder to be observed. The large group of Gopis owned up Krishna, and he never made it appear that he doesn\u2019t belong to them. Though he is worshiped as and the shloka-pada says \u2018Rukmini Satyabhamabhyam sahitam Sri Krishnam ashraye\u2019, many had Krishna as a part of them. He appreciated it, and allowed them the ownership of him. He was with everyone, and everyone felt he was only with them.\n\nPartha could win due to the \u2018Sarathi\u2019 he had. When the guiding light of life becomes Krishna, then our journey gets natural illumination. No false steps or mis-directions happen.

Nifty50 was at 24,505.05, up 33 points or 0.13%.The Nifty has experienced a 7% correction from its all-time high, reaching a crucial support level at the 100-day exponential moving average (DEMA) of 24,485. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, anticipates further downside, especially in midcap and smallcap stocks. He suggests that the next significant support for the index is around 24,000, with potential resistance between 24,700 and 25,000 in case of a rebound. Mishra advises adjusting trades accordingly and cautions against adding to losing positions.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities notes that Nifty's short-term trend remains negative, and a decisive move below the 24,500-25,450 range could open the door for a further downside target of 24,000. He suggests that any rise up to the immediate resistance of 24,700 could present a selling opportunity.

        "text": "Hindustan Zinc, owned by Vedanta and India\u2019s largest zinc and silver producer, has initiated a $2-2.5 billion (\u20b930,000 crore) capex plan to double its metal production to over 2 million tonnes, \u201cat least five-year period\u201d. \n\nThe company, in the coming weeks, will be engaging global contractors who would look at mine expansion and development. \n\n Mined metal will include doubling zinc capacity to 2 mt, lead and silver from 800 tonnes to 2000 tonnes.\n\n The company recently roped in a couple of international consultants - two Australian mine-planning and mine-contracting entities. It has also engaged a consultant to work on expanding zinc smelting capacity, a mix of greenfield and brownfield diversification. \n\n According to Arun Misra, CEO, Hindustan Zinc, the report they have said the mines have to be developed in a particular manner to make adequate ore for 2 million tonnes. \n\n \u201cSo for that, we are now inviting discussions with mining contractors who are global players. The mines have to be expanded. And around November-end or so, we should be able to fix the global contractor, whom we will appoint for starting the mine development,\u201d he told businessline during an interaction. Mine development apparently is the first part, following which production can take place.\n\n \u201cInvestments will be around $2 \u2013 2.5 billion or so, and it will be a through a mix of internal accruals and debt. We are working out the details and will be presenting it before the Board soon. However, these investments will be spread over a few years,\u201d Misra added. \n\n For FY25, the company has guided for a mined metal production of 1.2 mt and in H1 its production was around 0.52 mt. \n\n\u201cSo we are on course with our guidance. And sequentially mined metal capacities will be upped, say from 1.2 mt to 1.3 mt in the following year and so on,\u201d he said. \n\n The FY25 guidance also include 1.075 - 1.1 mt refined metal, and 750-775 tonnes saleable silver, with mined metal target of 1.2 mt to be achieved in FY26. \n\n During the recent analyst call, the Hindustan Zinc top brass said, expansion of capacity (mined metal) includes working-out on the logistics of how to transport the material out of the mine and then the concentrator expansion. Both these are \u201cfeasible and very easy to do\u201d. \n\n \u201cAs far as this 2 million tonne is concerned, project is feasible. There is no doubt on that. It is only the mining contractor\u2019s appointment and to see how the adequate metal in concentrate can be produced from the mine,\u201d the CEO had said.\n\n The company has however not shared how the production will be split across its existing mines. It operates six mines, all of which are located in Rajasthan. It has three smelter. Zinc smelting alone accounts of over 913,000 tonnes per annum. \n\n \u201cLet the project be done. But of course, we would love to have as much production from Agucha because that is the highest grid. And the biggest expansion that can happen with the current operations from is in Zawar mine, where (virgin) resources are available. So we will have to make a combination,\u201d Misra further said during the call. \n\n Consultant firm Systematix in a recent report said the company\u2019s growth trajectory \u201cappears to be fully priced in,\u201d and \u201cthe growth here-on is hinged on smelter capacity expansion and commissioning of the fertilizer plant in FY26\u201d.",

Now, we are switching to other industries and as of now we have planned to set up CBG plants of around 10 to 20 tonne capacity in every district of Madhya Pradesh. Our CBG plant will be different from the current CBG plants. Present plants are based on Municipal waste but for the first time we will develop the plant based on napier grass. This grass can be grown. We held a meeting with the CM for the same and he asked his team to guide us and implement it,\u201d Singh told ANI. \u201cThis plant will help in creating a lot of job opportunities.

Additionally, MD and CEO of Dalmia Bharat Limited, Puneet Dalmia told ANI, \u201cI am very excited and inspired to see such an event which is a regional event. Usually, all the conclaves happen in big cities. Still, I think we need to have conclaves in smaller cities like Rewa for a balanced development in India as it inspires many people. I am seeing a real impact of the double-engine government and Development is happening at a very fast pace.\u201d\u201cMadhya Pradesh is a land of opportunity, it has minerals, forest, tourism opportunities, and it has manpower who are very simple people.

        "text": "Hyderabad: The PIL panel of the Telangana High Court on an undertaking by the state\u2019s additional advocate general refused interim orders in a PIL seeking a blanket stay of demolitions on HYDRAA demolitions and Musi River Beautification Project. The panel heard at length Dr K.A. Paul Kilari Anand Paul, party in person who pointed out to the court the anguish and sorrow of those suffering \u201cunprecedented demolitions\u201d. The panel of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J. Sreenivas Rao are hearing a petition based on print, electronic, and social media reports. The petitioner pointed out that over 462 structures were pulled down by HYDRAA and that there was no respect to the rule of law in such large-scale demolitions. Even as the party in person made his plea citing global parallels, additional advocate general Imran Khan assured the court that the government was committed to the rule of law. He said that the government would strictly adhere to the procedure prescribed by the law. For a while, the court witnessed conflicting presentations on whether there were demolitions on the banks of river Musi. Since the petitioner relied highly on a recent judgment of the apex court, the panel observed that the said judgment would not apply in the instant case. Distinguishing the recent apex court judgment on large scale evictions, the panel pointed out that they did not apply to encroachments on river and water bodies. It not only recorded that the government had not filed its response to the allegations but it also held that in view of the undertaking given by the state, there was no need to pass an interim order. The panel in fact recorded its appreciation to the statement of additional advocate general reiterating the state government\u2019s commitment to the rule of law and said that no interim orders were necessary.",

The state's expenditure on salaries and pensions, subsidies and loan repayments has also increased significantly, the report says. The state government has projected total revenue receipts for this current fiscal 2024-25 at Rs.2,21,242.23 crore in the Budget. Of this, it realised Rs.75,454 crore in the first six months of this fiscal (April-September), amounting to 34.10 per cent of the budget estimates.

However, loans and other liabilities account for the lion's share of state's revenue receipts till September-end, at `32,536 crore. The state government took loans worth Rs.32,556 crore in six months out of projected estimates of Rs.49,255 crore for 2024-25. The government is left with a loan limit of less than Rs.17,000 crore for the second half of this fiscal (October-March 2024-25). But the non-tax revenues continue to be disappointing. The non-tax revenues recorded at just Rs.4,101 crore till September-end, which accounts for just 11.65 per cent of total estimates of Rs.35,208 crore in Budget for 2024-25. The grants-in-aid from the Centre fared even worse at just Rs.2,447 crore, which accounts for a meagre 11.31 per cent of total Budget estimates of Rs.21,636 crore. Revenue through sales tax was impressive at Rs.16,081 crore, 48.08 per cent of the Rs.33,449 crore of budget estimates while that from Goods and Services Tax (GST) and stamps and registration was Rs.24,731 crore and `7,251 crore respectively by September-end.

Payments in the form of pensions was on the higher side at Rs.8,560 crore, 73.54 per cent of Rs.11,641 crore projected for the entire fiscal. The state plunged into a revenue deficit of Rs.15,752 crore and fiscal deficit of Rs.32,536 crore by September-end contrary to revenue surplus of R.297 crore projected in the Budget for 2024-25.

        "title": "India's Ethanol Push: A Path to Energy Security",
        "text": "New Delhi: India is taking significant steps toward securing its energy future by embracing sustainable practices like ethanol blending. As the world\u2019s third-largest energy consumer, the country has traditionally depended on oil imports to meet its growing energy demands. This reliance not only poses challenges to energy security but also leads to a substantial outflow of foreign currency. However, with ethanol blending, India has a promising opportunity to reduce its dependence on imported oil while addressing environmental concerns. Ethanol, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, can be mixed with petrol, cutting down on fossil fuel consumption and reducing harmful carbon emissions that contribute to climate change and public health issues. The practice of blending ethanol with petrol began in 2001 as a pilot project. Yet, for many years, progress was slow, and ethanol production remained stagnant. Only recently, through a series of comprehensive reforms, has India been able to unlock the full potential of this initiative. These reforms are now driving substantial outcomes, not just by enhancing energy security, but also by revitalizing rural economies. Ethanol production offers a new source of income for farmers, supporting the agricultural sector and fostering economic growth in rural areas. The government\u2019s proactive approach to ethanol blending is evident in its decision to advance the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending from 2030 to 2025, demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable energy practices. During the 7th G-STIC Delhi Conference, Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, emphasized India\u2019s growing success in ethanol blending and its broader commitment to sustainable energy solutions. He highlighted that, in recognition of the progress made, the government has already begun planning for the future by exploring goals beyond the 20% ethanol blending target. This forward-looking approach indicates that India is not only focused on meeting its immediate energy needs but is also preparing for long-term sustainable energy solutions to address future demands. Ethanol is one of the primary biofuels, naturally produced through the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or through petrochemical processes like ethylene hydration. It is widely used not only as an alternative fuel source but also in various industries as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds. Ethanol also has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant, adding to its versatile uses. In the context of India\u2019s rising energy demand, driven by factors such as a growing economy, an expanding population, increasing urbanization, and evolving lifestyles, ethanol plays a critical role. As of March 2024, around 98 per cent of the fuel used in the road transportation sector comes from fossil fuels, while only two per cent is met by biofuels like ethanol. This dependency on fossil fuels presents challenges related to energy security, foreign currency outflow, and environmental impact. Ethanol, as a domestically produced biofuel, offers a strategic opportunity to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuels. When used responsibly, biofuels like ethanol are more environmentally friendly and sustainable, contributing to a cleaner energy landscape. Additionally, ethanol production and usage align with national goals like generating employment, promoting the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, supporting the Swachh Bharat Mission, and contributing to the doubling of farmers' incomes. It also fosters the creation of wealth from waste, further enhancing its importance to India\u2019s economy and energy security. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has embarked on a series of comprehensive reforms aimed at enhancing energy security, combating climate change, and boosting the rural economy. An indicative target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol was initially set for 2030 under the EBP Programme. However, in 2020, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) advanced this target to 2025, reflecting the government's commitment to accelerating ethanol usage. The progress of India\u2019s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme has been noteworthy, with the ethanol production capacity more than doubling in the last four years to reach 1,623 crore litres as of September 18, 2024. This substantial increase highlights the government's commitment to enhancing the role of ethanol in the nation\u2019s energy landscape. In the Ethanol Supply Year (ESY), which runs from November to October, the blending of ethanol with petrol stood at 38 crore litres with a blending percentage of 1.53 per cent in ESY 2013-14.

Company bagged mixed responses from brokerages as they flagged concerns about volume growth, demand recovery and product portfolio across segments. \n\nNuvama Institutional Equities mentioned Hindustan Unilever has posted an overall in-line Q2 FY25 against its estimates. However, the volume growth was at 3 per cent y-o-y, below street\u2019s forecast of 4-5 per cent. \u201cA gradual rural recovery along with pricing growth coming back in H2FY25E/26E bodes well for HUL\u2019s long-term growth trajectory,\u201d it said. The brokerage has given buy rating on HUL at an increased target price of \u20b93,395 against \u20b93,375 earlier.\n\nAlso read: F5 partners with Nvidia to boost AI application performance \n\nMotilal Oswal has reiterated buy rating at a target price of \u20b93,200. \u201cDemand trends remained stable, with moderate growth in urban areas and a stable recovery in rural regions,\u201d Motilal analysts said. Diverse product basked is expected to support steady growth recovery. However, Motilal Oswal has cut EPS estimates by 2 per cent each for FY25 and FY26.\n\nHUL remains HDFC Securities\u2019 top pick within the large-cap staples pack, as the worst is behind in terms of muted volume growth, pricing corrections, and rural weakness. The brokerage has maintained buy rating at a target price of \u20b93,200.\n\nJM Financial, which has assigned buy rating at a revised target price of \u20b92,870 from \u20b92,915 earlier, emphasised the moderation in urban market has come as a negative surprise. \n\nAmit Agarwal, Senior VP \u2013 Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities, stated that the inflation in crude palm oil and tea weighed on gross margins. Against expectations, HUL\u2019s competitive actions or new formulation in tea and soaps did not translate into volume growth, while home care and beauty segments were the bright spots in an otherwise tepid quarter, he added.\n\nAnalysts of Yes Securities have maintained neutral stance on HUL stock at a target price of \u20b92,845. HUL\u2019s Q2 results were in-line with their estimates. Underlying volume growth (UVG) decline in soaps and tea was offset by high-single-digit UVG in fabric wash & household care, the report read.\n\nAnalysts of Centrum Institutional Research have retained \u2018reduce\u2019 rating on HUL at a target price of \u20b92,697. They expect gradual recovery in the discretionary spends and inherent distribution strength to drive beauty & well-being, and GSK-CH business. Though margins could remain in tight band, given inflationary cycle and high ad-spends.\n\nIce cream business\n\nThe FMCG major also announced separation of its ice cream business, which contributed 3 per cent to the company\u2019s turnover. \n\nNuvama believes that exiting ice cream business is not the best option emphasising it as a high-growth business. \n\nHUL is the second strong player in this \u201chigh investment and low-margin business\u201d. Separating ice cream business will have a lesser impact on HUL\u2019s earnings, according to Ajay Thakur, Research Analyst, Anand Rathi Institutional Equities. He added that the segment demands a different supply chain and higher investment. \n\nThakur, positive about growth volume of beauty and wellness segment, stressed that HUL Q2 performance was slightly lower than the street expectations.\n\nAlso read: Indus Towers\u2019 profit margins to grow in coming quarters with more site rollouts expected from VIL, BSNL: analysts\n\n\u201cGiven that HUL has decided to separate its ice cream business, local capabilities will need to be developed to continue running the business. Ice cream has a different operating model and a distinct channel landscape, limiting synergies with rest of HUL,\u201d Agarwal of Kotak Securities said. \n\nGlobal brokerage Jefferies has maintained \u2018buy\u2019 at a target price of \u20b93,130.

        "title": "How to Open an FD Account with Attractive Interest Rates",
        "text": "Fixed Deposits (FDs) remain one of the most preferred investment options, especially for risk-averse individuals seeking a stable return. The guaranteed returns, relatively higher interest rates compared to a regular savings account, and flexibility in tenure make FDs a popular choice for many. However, with a wide variety of banks and financial institutions offering FD accounts, it's essential to know how to open FD account with attractive interest rates to maximise your returns.\nIn this article, we will explore the steps to open an FD account, discuss what to look for when selecting an FD, and highlight ways to secure the best FD interest rate for your investment.\nUnderstanding Fixed Deposits Before diving into how to open FD account, it's crucial to understand what a Fixed Deposit is. FDs are term deposits offered by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). You deposit a lump sum amount for a fixed tenure, and the bank offers a predetermined FD interest rate for that period. At the end of the tenure, you receive your principal along with the accrued interest.\nThe interest rate on FDs varies depending on the bank or financial institution, the tenure, and the type of FD (cumulative or non-cumulative). Some institutions may offer senior citizens and existing customers preferential interest rates.\nSteps to open FD account Opening an FD account is relatively simple and can be done through both online and offline channels. Heres a detailed guide on how to open FD account.\n1. Choose the Right Financial Institution The first and most crucial step is to choose the right bank or NBFC. Different banks offer varying FD interest rates based on the deposit amount and tenure. Its essential to compare interest rates from multiple institutions to find the most attractive offer. While banks are considered safer, NBFCs often offer higher interest rates but come with slightly higher risk. Ensure the institution is reputed and offers secure services.\n2. Determine the Investment Amount Once you've selected a financial institution, the next step is to decide how much you want to invest. The minimum deposit required for an FD account can vary between institutions, ranging from as low as \u00e2\u0082\u00b91,000 to higher amounts for special schemes. Decide your investment based on your financial goals, liquidity requirements, and the FD interest rate offered.\n3. Select the Tenure FDs come with varying tenures, ranging from seven days to ten years. You can select a short-term or long-term FD based on your financial needs. Usually, longer tenures offer better interest rates, but it's crucial to evaluate your liquidity needs before locking in your money for an extended period. If you are looking for attractive returns, opt for a tenure that offers a higher FD interest rate without compromising your financial flexibility.\n4. Choose Between Cumulative and Non-Cumulative FD When opening an FD account, you need to decide between cumulative and non-cumulative options. In a cumulative FD, interest is compounded and paid at the end of the tenure, offering a higher return. A non-cumulative FD pays interest at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually). If youre looking for regular income, a non-cumulative FD might be better, while a cumulative FD is ideal if youre focused on long-term wealth building.\n5. Apply to open FD account Once youve finalised the institution, amount, tenure, and type of FD, the next step is to apply to open FD account. This can be done online or by visiting a bank branch. If you are an existing customer of the bank, opening an FD online is straightforward and quick.\nFor offline account opening, visit the nearest branch of the bank or NBFC with the required documents, including proof of identity, proof of address, and passport-sized photographs. Complete the application form and submit the documents to the bank representative. Once your application is processed, your FD account will be opened.\n6. Monitor the FD Interest Rates Interest rates fluctuate depending on market conditions and the policies of financial institutions. To secure the best FD interest rate, keep an eye on the current rates before opening your FD account. Some institutions also offer promotional interest rates during specific periods, which can help you earn higher returns. Regular monitoring of interest rates ensures that you open your FD at the best possible time.\nSecuring Attractive FD Interest Rates When opening an FD account, your primary goal is to maximise the FD interest rate to grow your wealth effectively. Here are some strategies to secure attractive interest rates:\n1. Compare Rates Across Banks and NBFCs Interest rates on FDs vary significantly between institutions. It's essential to compare rates across different banks and NBFCs to find the best option. Some financial institutions offer higher rates for specific tenures or during promotional periods. Additionally, NBFCs generally offer better rates than banks, although they may carry slightly higher risk.\n2. Opt for Special FD Schemes Many banks offer special FD schemes with higher interest rates for specific tenures or deposit amounts. These schemes are often available for limited periods, and they can provide a substantial boost to your returns. Keep an eye out for these offers when you decide to open FD account.\n3. Look for Senior Citizen Benefits If you're a senior citizen, you can take advantage of preferential interest rates offered by most banks and NBFCs. Typically, senior citizens receive an additional 0.25% to 0.50% interest on top of the standard rates. This can significantly enhance your returns.\n4. Consider Long-Term FDs Longer-term FDs generally offer higher interest rates than short-term ones. If you can afford to lock your funds for an extended period, consider choosing a long-term FD with a higher FD interest rate. However, ensure you dont require liquidity during the tenure, as premature withdrawals may lead to penalties and lower interest earnings.\nThe Impact of FD Interest Rates on Your Returns The FD interest rate plays a crucial role in determining the returns on your investment. A higher interest rate ensures that your deposit grows faster. To understand the impact of interest rates, consider using an FD calculator. This tool helps you calculate your estimated earnings based on the deposit amount, tenure, and interest rate, allowing you to choose the best option for your needs.\nBefore opening an FD account, also take into account the frequency of interest compounding (monthly, quarterly, or annually) as it can affect your total returns. Compounding at shorter intervals leads to higher returns.\nConclusion Opening an FD account with attractive FD interest rates requires careful planning and research. Begin by comparing the interest rates offered by various banks and NBFCs, and choose a tenure and type of FD that aligns with your financial goals. Whether youre looking for long-term wealth accumulation or regular income, FDs can be a reliable investment option. Always keep an eye on promotional rates and special schemes that can help you earn higher returns.\nCheck more details at www.bajajfinserv.in/investments/fixed-deposit \nWith the right strategy and timely decisions, you can open FD account that maximises your savings and secures your financial future. By selecting a bank or NBFC that offers attractive interest rates, opting for tax-saving FDs, and monitoring market trends, you can ensure your fixed deposit yields optimal results.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: Former MP and senior BRS leader B Vinod Kumar on Monday held Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy responsible for the economic downturn in Telangana within a short span of 10 months. He accused the Congress government of neglecting the State\u2019s financial health, which witnessed significant growth under former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao.\r\n\r\nAddressing a press meet at Telangana Bhavan here, Vinod Kumar rubbished the false propaganda of the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues about the previous BRS government obtaining loans at huge interest rates. He pointed out that Telangana\u2019s loans under the BRS regime were taken at the lowest interest rates among Southern States, leading to a GSDP of Rs 16 lakh crore, or $200 billion.\r\n\r\n\"A comparison of the interest payments on budgetary borrowings of the Southern States reveals that Telangana stood at the bottom with Rs 32,920 crore in 2022-23. But it is unclear as to how the Ministers arrived at the figure Rs 72,000 crore per annum on interest payments,\" he said. He stated that the interest payments on budgetary borrowings as percentage of revenue receipts was 13.69 which was the second lowest after Karnataka among Southern States.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Revanth Reddy had not taken any significant steps to stabilize the State's financial position, with only liquor sales showing growth, while other revenues declined. He pointed out contradictions in Revanth Reddy's speeches on economic policies. He blamed Revanth Reddy for failing to attract investments, citing the impact of real estate sector issues and HYDRAA demolitions. \"Revanth Reddy speaks of turning Telangana into a trillion-dollar economy, but his governance doesn't reflect that ambition,\" Kumar said, urging the Congress government to stop \"defaming Telangana\" with poor economic policies.",

        "text": "Tirupati: Tobacco growers in Andhra Pradesh are enjoying a windfall this season, as a surge in demand has led to record-breaking prices, with some farmers earning as much as Rs 360 per kg for premium-quality tobacco. The favourable market conditions have turned the 2023-24 season into one of the most profitable years in recent memory, attracting widespread attention from growers hoping to cash in.This season, tobacco sales across the Nellore district reached 46.8 million kg, with the highest average prices ever recorded at multiple auction centers. Farmers are thrilled, and many are already preparing to expand their acreage next year despite warnings from officials about overproduction and rising land lease costs.In the Southern Light Soils (SLS) region, which comprises the auction centers Kandukur-1, Kandukur-2, DC Palli and Kaligiri, sales commenced on March 6. Auctions at DC Palli and Kaligiri closed on October 14, while the Kandukur-1 centre concluded on Monday. The auction process stretched over 140 days, longer than usual. The highest quality tobacco attracted a record price of Rs 360 per kg, a first in the SLS region. The average price at various centres for the 2023-24 season was Rs 270 per kg, a notable Rs 50 increase from the previous year's Rs 220. \u201cWe have never seen prices like this in my 20 years of farming. I was able to sell my crop for an average of Rs 270 per kg. This season has been life-changing for us,\u201d said K. Rajesh, a farmer from Kandukur-2. Another farmer, Ramana Reddy from Kandukur-1, echoed similar sentiments saying, \u201cLast year was good, but this year was exceptional. With the profits, I am able to clear my debts and invest in better seeds for next season.\u201d However, amid the excitement, the Tobacco Board has issued a word of caution to farmers about the potential risks of increasing the acreage. \"Farmers should be cautious. While this season has seen record profits, the market is unpredictable, and it is important not to assume prices will remain at these levels. Over-expansion can lead to a surplus and drive the prices down,\" a tobacco board official said.The official also warned against the illegal construction of unauthorized barns to store tobacco, emphasising the legal risks and urging farmers to follow the approved guidelines. \"It is important for farmers to focus on improving efficiency, cutting costs and maintaining quality rather than chasing more land and barns that could lead to financial strain in the future,\" he added.",

        "text": "Tuesday saw a significant downturn in the Indian stock market, with major indices including the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 experiencing notable declines. By afternoon, the BSE Sensex had fallen by 787.64 points, marking a 0.97 per cent decrease, positioning it at 80,363.63. Similarly, the Nifty 50 dipped by 262.50 points or by 1.06 per cent, bringing it to 24,518.This downturn affected a broad spectrum of stocks, particularly within the small-cap segment, signalling widespread selling pressure and a shift in investor sentiment.The majority of stocks within the BSE Sensex were observed to be in decline. Tata Steel led the downward trend with a 1.16 per cent drop, closely followed by significant losses in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors, SBI, and IndusInd Bank.Conversely, a few companies managed to buck the trend, with UltraTech Cement seeing an increase of 1.61 per cent, alongside gains in Titan, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and Power Grid Corp.Similarly, the Nifty 50 saw 28 of its 50 stocks decline, with SBI Life, HDFC Life, Shriram Finance, BEL, and Kotak Mahindra Bank experiencing the most significant drops.Market Sector VariancesDifferences were also noted across various market sectors. IT, FMCG, Financial Services, and Private Bank indices were among the few that traded higher, contrasting sharply with the Realty index, which fell by 1.15 per cent. This downturn was echoed by losses in the PSU Bank, Metal, and Auto indices. In the broader market, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 also faced declines, down by 0.29 per cent and 0.83 per cent respectively, further highlighting the days general market downturn.Impact on Individual StocksIn particular, individual stocks faced significant challenges. Amber Enterprises India saw a sharp 13 per cent drop, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Jupiter Wagons among others experienced declines exceeding 5 per cent. This overall trend suggests a cautious or negative outlook from investors, particularly towards small-cap stocks, which have previously enjoyed robust investor sentiment and strong valuations.The decrease in the valuation of small-cap stocks is a point of concern among analysts, indicating a potential overvaluation. Motilal Oswal, a domestic brokerage firm, has pointed out that the market capitalisation-to-GDP ratio for large, mid, and small caps continues to be at historical highs, with small caps surpassing midcaps. This suggests that despite the appeal of small-cap stocks as affordable alternatives to their larger counterparts, their steep valuations have become a point of contention.The sentiment shift and selling pressure, particularly in the small-cap segment, reflect a broader trend of reassessment among investors. This cautious approach is spurred by disappointments in the Q2 earnings season and a scarcity of fresh catalysts for further gains. As investors engage in profit-taking, the allure of small-cap stocks, once seen as key growth opportunities, has diminished.In wrapping up, Tuesdays market activity underscored the volatility and shifting dynamics within the Indian equity markets. While certain sectors and stocks managed to navigate the turbulence, the overall trend signalled caution, particularly towards small-cap stocks. As investors recalibrate their strategies in light of recent developments, the focus may increasingly shift towards sectors and stocks considered more stable or offering better value amidst the current market conditions.",

He pointed out that Telangana\u2019s loans under the BRS regime were taken at the lowest interest rates among Southern States, leading to a GSDP of Rs 16 lakh crore, or $200 billion.\r\n\r\n\"A comparison of the interest payments on budgetary borrowings of the Southern States reveals that Telangana stood at the bottom with Rs 32,920 crore in 2022-23. But it is unclear as to how the Ministers arrived at the figure Rs 72,000 crore per annum on interest payments,\" he said. He stated that the interest payments on budgetary borrowings as percentage of revenue receipts was 13.69 which was the second lowest after Karnataka among Southern States.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Revanth Reddy had not taken any significant steps to stabilize the State's financial position, with only liquor sales showing growth, while other revenues declined. He pointed out contradictions in Revanth Reddy's speeches on economic policies. He blamed Revanth Reddy for failing to attract investments, citing the impact of real estate sector issues and HYDRAA demolitions. \"Revanth Reddy speaks of turning Telangana into a trillion-dollar economy, but his governance doesn't reflect that ambition,\" Kumar said, urging the Congress government to stop \"defaming Telangana\" with poor economic policies.",

        "text": "Tirupati: Tobacco growers in Andhra Pradesh are enjoying a windfall this season, as a surge in demand has led to record-breaking prices, with some farmers earning as much as Rs 360 per kg for premium-quality tobacco. The favourable market conditions have turned the 2023-24 season into one of the most profitable years in recent memory, attracting widespread attention from growers hoping to cash in.This season, tobacco sales across the Nellore district reached 46.8 million kg, with the highest average prices ever recorded at multiple auction centers. Farmers are thrilled, and many are already preparing to expand their acreage next year despite warnings from officials about overproduction and rising land lease costs.In the Southern Light Soils (SLS) region, which comprises the auction centers Kandukur-1, Kandukur-2, DC Palli and Kaligiri, sales commenced on March 6. Auctions at DC Palli and Kaligiri closed on October 14, while the Kandukur-1 centre concluded on Monday. The auction process stretched over 140 days, longer than usual. The highest quality tobacco attracted a record price of Rs 360 per kg, a first in the SLS region. The average price at various centres for the 2023-24 season was Rs 270 per kg, a notable Rs 50 increase from the previous year's Rs 220. \u201cWe have never seen prices like this in my 20 years of farming. I was able to sell my crop for an average of Rs 270 per kg. This season has been life-changing for us,\u201d said K. Rajesh, a farmer from Kandukur-2. Another farmer, Ramana Reddy from Kandukur-1, echoed similar sentiments saying, \u201cLast year was good, but this year was exceptional. With the profits, I am able to clear my debts and invest in better seeds for next season.\u201d However, amid the excitement, the Tobacco Board has issued a word of caution to farmers about the potential risks of increasing the acreage. \"Farmers should be cautious. While this season has seen record profits, the market is unpredictable, and it is important not to assume prices will remain at these levels. Over-expansion can lead to a surplus and drive the prices down,\" a tobacco board official said.The official also warned against the illegal construction of unauthorized barns to store tobacco, emphasising the legal risks and urging farmers to follow the approved guidelines. \"It is important for farmers to focus on improving efficiency, cutting costs and maintaining quality rather than chasing more land and barns that could lead to financial strain in the future,\" he added.",

        "title": "Sensex Plummets 931 Points, Nifty Dips Below 24,500; Mid & Smallcap Indices Drop Over 2%",
        "text": "Tuesday saw a significant downturn in the Indian stock market, with major indices including the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 experiencing notable declines. By afternoon, the BSE Sensex had fallen by 787.64 points, marking a 0.97 per cent decrease, positioning it at 80,363.63. Similarly, the Nifty 50 dipped by 262.50 points or by 1.06 per cent, bringing it to 24,518.This downturn affected a broad spectrum of stocks, particularly within the small-cap segment, signalling widespread selling pressure and a shift in investor sentiment.The majority of stocks within the BSE Sensex were observed to be in decline. Tata Steel led the downward trend with a 1.16 per cent drop, closely followed by significant losses in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors, SBI, and IndusInd Bank.Conversely, a few companies managed to buck the trend, with UltraTech Cement seeing an increase of 1.61 per cent, alongside gains in Titan, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and Power Grid Corp.Similarly, the Nifty 50 saw 28 of its 50 stocks decline, with SBI Life, HDFC Life, Shriram Finance, BEL, and Kotak Mahindra Bank experiencing the most significant drops.Market Sector VariancesDifferences were also noted across various market sectors. IT, FMCG, Financial Services, and Private Bank indices were among the few that traded higher, contrasting sharply with the Realty index, which fell by 1.15 per cent. This downturn was echoed by losses in the PSU Bank, Metal, and Auto indices. In the broader market, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 also faced declines, down by 0.29 per cent and 0.83 per cent respectively, further highlighting the days general market downturn.Impact on Individual StocksIn particular, individual stocks faced significant challenges. Amber Enterprises India saw a sharp 13 per cent drop, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Jupiter Wagons among others experienced declines exceeding 5 per cent. This overall trend suggests a cautious or negative outlook from investors, particularly towards small-cap stocks, which have previously enjoyed robust investor sentiment and strong valuations.The decrease in the valuation of small-cap stocks is a point of concern among analysts, indicating a potential overvaluation. Motilal Oswal, a domestic brokerage firm, has pointed out that the market capitalisation-to-GDP ratio for large, mid, and small caps continues to be at historical highs, with small caps surpassing midcaps. This suggests that despite the appeal of small-cap stocks as affordable alternatives to their larger counterparts, their steep valuations have become a point of contention.The sentiment shift and selling pressure, particularly in the small-cap segment, reflect a broader trend of reassessment among investors. This cautious approach is spurred by disappointments in the Q2 earnings season and a scarcity of fresh catalysts for further gains. As investors engage in profit-taking, the allure of small-cap stocks, once seen as key growth opportunities, has diminished.In wrapping up, Tuesdays market activity underscored the volatility and shifting dynamics within the Indian equity markets. While certain sectors and stocks managed to navigate the turbulence, the overall trend signalled caution, particularly towards small-cap stocks. As investors recalibrate their strategies in light of recent developments, the focus may increasingly shift towards sectors and stocks considered more stable or offering better value amidst the current market conditions.",

        "title": "OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion in Funds at $157 Billion Value",
        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world\u2019s leading generative AI technology.The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment.The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry\u2019s belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement.Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter.Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank\u2019s investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated.In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \u201cAI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \u201cAnd this is just the start.\u201dThe huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \u201cPeople are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\u201d said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year \u2013 adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn\u2019t exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round.Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \u201cthe most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\u201dApple Inc. didn\u2019t participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs.The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company\u2019s board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure \u2014 an unusual organization that has frustrated investors \u2014 to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company\u2019s backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company \u2014 a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI\u2019s board said it hasn\u2019t discussed specific numbers.OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said.

        "text": "Shares of Marico hit a record high of Rs 719.80, gaining 4 per cent on the BSE in Thursday\u2019s intra-day trade in an otherwise weak market on stable volume growth in July to September quarter (Q2FY25). The stock surpassed its previous high of Rs 713.60 touched on September 27, 2024.At 02:18 pm; Marico had erased its intra-day gain and was trading 0.5 per cent higher at Rs 696.50 on the BSE. In comparison, the BSE Sensex tanked 2.1 per cent or 1,781 points at 82,485. In the last six months, the stock has outperformed the market by surging 41 per cent, as against a near 12 per cent rise in the benchmark index.Marico in its Q2 quarterly update said that consolidated revenue growth remained in high single digits, as higher realisations in the domestic business was offset by incremental currency headwinds in some overseas markets. The company expects consolidated revenue growth to move into double digits in the second half of the year and expects to deliver double-digit revenue growth in this year.The sector witnessed stable demand trends with rural outperforming urban on a year-on-year basis for the third quarter in a row. In the given context, the domestic business posted mid-single digit volume growth, exhibiting improvement on a sequential basis, Marico said.The management said the International business delivered robust low teen constant currency (CC) growth with each of the markets contributing positively. Bangladesh posted high-single digit growth, demonstrating the strong resilience of the company\u2019s business model amidst a challenging operating environment which has now largely stabilized. Vietnam also grew in high single digits, while MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and South Africa maintained their robust double digit growth trajectory.However, Marico expects gross margin to moderate on a year-on-year basis owing to partial absorption of higher input costs, as the Company prioritized expanding its consumer franchise in the current demand environment. Consequently, the company expects a moderate lag in operating profit growth vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.Among key inputs, copra prices rose ahead of internal forecasts and the recent import duty hike led to vegetable oil prices moving higher towards the end of the quarter. Crude oil derivatives, however, remained rangebound.On outlook, Marico said the company remains focused on achieving double-digit revenue growth while managing margin pressures from commodity inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.After a weak update from Dabur, Marico\u2019s update reassured investors. The numbers are largely in line with our estimates, said analysts at Nuvama Wealth Management. Value Added Hair Oils (VAHO) and Saffola Oils remain muted.The brokerage firm said Marico\u2019s consolidated revenue growth is likely to be 8 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Domestic business shall clock 5 per cent volume growth YoY. The International business shall deliver 13 per cent CC growth. Bangladesh shall post high-single digit growth amid a turbulent operating environment. Copra experienced inflation higher than expectations. Parachute shall see mid-single digit volume and double-digit revenue growth.

        "text": "Stock market crash today: In the aftermath of the bloodbath at the Dalal-street on Thursday, investors lost a total of Rs 9.7 trillion in market capitalisation on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At Tuesday's close, the total market capitalisation of companies listed on the BSE stood at around Rs 474 trillion - this was pulled down to Rs 465 trillion on Thursday. However, in intraday deals, investors losses mounted to Rs 10.56 trillion with the total market capitalisation of the BSE slipping to Rs 464 trillion. The market breath also favoured the declines as around 2,875 stocks traded losses versus advances by 985 stocks, with 109 remaining unchanged. In terms of contribution to the 30-blue chip stock index, BSE Sensex\u2019s decline, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank led the way, pulling Sensex down in its sharpest decline since August 05. The BSE Sensex plunged 1,832 points or 2.17 per cent to 82,434 level in intraday deals. Meanwhile, Nifty50 slipped to an intraday low of 566 points, down 2.19 per cent to 25,230.30 level in intraday trade. That apart, the country's volatility indicator, India VIX jumped to 11.72 per cent. Among sectors, Nifty Realty was clear loser ending the day 4.36 per cent lower and was followed by Nifty Auto slipping 2.88 per cent, Nifty Private Bank declining 2.61 per cent and Nifty Financial Services sliding 2.59 per cent. According to analysts, today\u2019s sharp decline was driven by several negative factors, including escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by Sebi and strength in the Chinese market, following the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) stimulus package. \u201cSpeculation is growing that Israel may retaliate by targeting major oil fields in Iran, which could further fuel the rise in oil prices. Additionally, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by SEBI are expected to impact trading volumes, as retail participation may decline due to the increased contract size and limits on weekly expiries,\u201d said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP, research & advisory at Master Capital Services.Analysts also concurred that the foreign money is being diverted from India to China as the country became attractive to investors following its government\u2019s stimulus package. \u201cThere has been a notable outflow of Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) money from India to China over the past few days, exerting pressure on large-cap stocks. Lastly, profit booking ahead of state elections and concerns over elevated valuations have added to the downward pressure,\u201d stated Santosh Meena, head of research, Swastika Investmart. .storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "The Airports Authority of India\u2019s Madurai Airport commenced 24-hour operations with effect from October 1, 2024. This milestone marks a significant step towards enhancing connectivity, providing a seamless travel experience and supporting the growth of regional as well as national Air traffic. This will provide flexibility to Airlines, Non-Scheduled operators, Medical flights and General Aviation for efficient planning of Aircraft operations. Airlines can also plan bases at Madurai Airport. This will also enable effective use of Airport Infrastructure and resources, read an official statement.At an event organised at Madurai Airport to formally start the 24-hour operations, M. Suresh, Chairman, AAI underscored the organisation\u2019s strategic approach towards this transformative upgrade. He also emphasised the widespread benefits of the commencement of round-the-clock operations from the Airport. The event also saw the esteemed presence of MP, Manickam Tagore, MP, S. Venkatesan, MLA, V. V. Rajan Chellappa, MLA, A.M.S.G. Ashokan and senior officials from the District Administration.At present Madurai has 248 scheduled movements in a week and is connected to cities like Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Singapore, Dubai and Colombo. Additionally, there is a demand for flight connectivity to other cities of India like Pune, Goa, Kolkata, Cochin, Bhubaneshwar, Varanasi, Guwahati, etc. With round-the-clock operations, the weekly scheduled movements in the winter season of 2024 are expected to be around 344 movements for Madurai Airport.Extending operational hours will allow more flights to land and take off, thereby improving connectivity, especially for flights of long-haul routes. This will attract more airlines and routes, making Madurai Airport a more prominent hub.Travellers will have more flexible flight options, making travel easier and more convenient. This will enhance passenger satisfaction and attract more travellers to Madurai.With more flights and passengers, local businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation services will likely see increased demand. This will lead to job creation and stimulate the local economy. Madurai has a rich cultural and religious heritage. Round-the-clock operations will make this city more accessible to tourists, especially those from different time zones, contributing to the growth of the tourism sector. 24-hour operations will also facilitate better cargo handling, allowing for more efficient logistics operations. This will attract businesses that rely on air freight, further boosting the local economy. It will also enable the locals to have better access to enhanced medical facilities.With the starting of 24-hour operations, a Night parking facility will be available at Madurai Airport as well. This will help the Airport to facilitate connections not only within India but also to international destinations. Since most international operators prefer to operate during night time from India, 24-hour operations will encourage airlines to consider international operations from Madurai Airport. It will also allow airlines to plan night parking at the Airport and plan base flights. Transitioning Madurai Airport to 24-hour operations presents a compelling opportunity to enhance Passenger service, drive economic growth, and improve overall operational efficiency. By embracing this change, the Airport can position itself as the leading airport in the country, catering to the diverse needs of passengers and contributing to the region\u2019s overall development. Implementing these extended hours will not only meet the demands of a growing travel market but also support Madurai\u2019s aspirations as a vital transportation hub in the region",

        "text": "The rupee depreciated 14 paise to settle at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as the volatile geopolitical situation triggered a surge in crude oil prices, weighed down by a steep fall of over two per cent in domestic equity markets. According to forex traders, a strong American currency and unabated outflow of foreign funds fuelled by the bullish Chinese markets also accelerated the rupee's slide. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.91 and touched a low of 83.97 against the greenback during intra-day trading. The unit ended the session at 83.96 (provisional) against the American currency, registering a steep loss of 14 paise from its previous closing level. On Tuesday, the rupee settled 3 paise lower at 83.82 against the American currency. Forex markets were closed on Wednesday on account of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. According to Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the rupee declined on weak domestic markets and a strong dollar, while a surge in crude oil prices also weighed on the domestic unit. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a slight negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"Traders may take cues from ISM services PMI, weekly unemployment claims and factory orders data from the US. Investors may watch out for a non-farm payrolls report from the US on Friday. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.23 per cent to 101.91. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.66 per cent to $75.13 in futures trade. Experts attributed the spike in crude prices to the fear of Israel's retaliatory attacks on Iran's oil installations amid escalating tension in West Asia. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex crashed 1,769.19 points, or 2.10 per cent, to settle at 82,497.10, while the Nifty tanked 546.80 points, or 2.12 per cent to close the session at 25,250.10. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Tuesday, offloading shares worth \u20b95,579.35 crore on a net basis in the cash segment, according to exchange data. FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b915,000 crore since Monday. Analysts said foreign investors rushed to sell Indian equities as Chinese stocks turned bullish after the country announced a slew of stimulus measures to revive the economy. On the domestic macroeconomic front, a monthly survey released on Tuesday showed India's manufacturing sector growth fell to an eight-month low in September amid a softer increase in factory production, sales and new export orders. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from 57.5 in August to 56.5 in September, registering the weakest pace of growth since January.",

        "title": "OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion In Funds at $157 Billion Value",
        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world's leading generative AI technology. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment. The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry's belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement. Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank's investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated. In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\" OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \"And this is just the start.\" The huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \"People are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\" said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year - adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn't exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round. Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \"the most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\" Apple Inc. didn't participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI's board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs. The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company's board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure - an unusual organization that has frustrated investors - to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company's backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company - a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI's board said it hasn't discussed specific numbers. OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported. A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees - such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also developing their own AI models. In this funding round, OpenAI discouraged investors from backing rival companies, such as Anthropic or Musk's AI startup xAI, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg earlier reported that leading venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which backed Safe Superintelligence, would not participate in the newest fundraising.

        "text": "Interest rates are expected to decline soon after remaining elevated for an extended period. After the US Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 50-basis-point (bps) cut, other central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will likely follow suit.\u201cThis is a good time to take fixed-income exposure at elevated rates before the softening starts,\u201d says Amol Joshi, founder, PlanRupee Investment Managers.Rate cuts on the horizonThe RBI has projected inflation at 4.5 per cent for financial year 2025 (FY25), close to its 4 per cent target. With the current repo rate at 6.5 per cent, experts anticipate a 50 basis point cut soon. \u201cI see a repo rate cut of 50 bps to 6 per cent,\u201d says Joydeep Sen, author and corporate trainer (debt).\u201cRBI may cut rates by 50 bps over the next six months, starting with a 25 bps cut in December,\u201d says Pankaj Mathpal, managing director, Optima Money Managers. Current rates are attractiveFixed-income instruments such as bank fixed deposits (FDs), corporate FDs, and small savings schemes (SSS) are currently offering attractive returns. For example, bank FDs of two to three years\u2019 duration are yielding 7 per cent, while the government has kept SSS rates unchanged as of September 30, 2024. \u201cIf you want to invest in FDs or the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme (SCSS), now is the right time. Investors can also consider long-term debt funds,\u201d says Mathpal.Sen notes that any reduction in bank FD rates will lag behind the RBI\u2019s actions. \u201cBank deposit rates will ease but may not align directly with RBI rate cuts, as credit demand remains strong, and banks need deposits,\u201d he explains.Which instruments look good?Several fixed-income products currently offer attractive rates. The SCSS, with an 8.2 per cent interest rate that can be locked in for five years, remains one of the most attractive. The scheme\u2019s investment limit has been enhanced to Rs 30 lakh.The Mahila Samman Certificate offers 7.5 per cent interest for two years on deposits up to Rs 2 lakh. Select corporate FDs offering around 9 per cent are worth considering. Banks are offering attractive rates for 12-15 month FDs. Investors with a longer time frame will, however, be better off investing in longer-tenured FDs.\u201cSenior citizens should capitalise on high SCSS rates and lock in investments now. For short-term needs, FDs are a good option. NBFC FDs offer slightly higher rates than bank FDs,\u201d says Mathpal. As a rule, match your investment timeframe with the product\u2019s tenure, as premature withdrawals lead to penalties.Avoid floating rate instruments With interest rates set to fall, floating-rate instruments like RBI Floating Rate Savings Bonds may not be ideal. They currently offer 8.05 per cent (35 bps higher than the 7.7 per cent offered by the National Savings Certificate). \u201cFloating-rate instruments will adjust downwards as rates drop, so they are not suitable in a declining interest-rate environment,\u201d says Joshi.Focus on goals and allocationInvest according to your horizon. \u201cYoung investors should focus more on equity, while retired senior citizens should prioritise fixed income. Mid-career investors should aim for a balanced allocation,\u201d says Sen.Fixed income allocation should also depend on investment horizon and risk appetite. \u201cInvestors with lower risk tolerance and short-term goals should focus on debt instruments,\u201d says Mathpal..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Leading artificial intelligence research company OpenAI announced this week that it has closed an enormous funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion. This massive injection of capital positions OpenAI as one of the highest valued private companies in the world. The round was led by previous investor Thrive Capital, with Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, Khosla Ventures and others also participating. This brings OpenAI's total funding to nearly $18 billion since its founding in 2015. OpenAI says the new funds will allow it to expand its AI research, build new tools, and grow its infrastructure to handle increasing demands on its systems. OpenAI has become the worldwide leader in generative AI models like ChatGPT, which has over 250 million users. The company is also known for developing powerful transformer models for natural language processing, computer vision and other domains. However, continued progress requires vast computing resources and talent \u2013 two things that do not come cheaply. OpenAI reportedly spends billions each year on research costs like training new models as well as hiring top AI scientists and engineers. Sustaining this level of spending is likely why OpenAI sought such a gargantuan funding round. The company faces intensifying competition from DeepMind, Anthropic, xAi and others working in similar areas. Microsoft has also become a close partner, building products using OpenAI technology. To maintain its advantages, OpenAI needs ample funds to recruit top people, invest in the latest hardware and pursue ambitious long-term research goals. With over $17 billion in capital raised to date, OpenAI is now in an elite class of private unicorns. How the company utilizes these massive new resources, and whether it can fulfill its lofty visions, will be exciting to watch unfold in the coming years. For now, OpenAI's dominant position in critical AI domains seems set to continue fueling innovative advances that impact technology worldwide.",

Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory firm, noted in a client note that \"Iran's decision to respond to devastating attacks from Israel against its proxy Hezbollah, including a new ground offensive, with a ballistic missile strike against Israel, raises the risk of a wider regional conflict that could draw in the US and disrupt oil markets. However, according to an ET report, market analysts suggest that the potential downsides in stock markets could be contained.Stock market outlook: Where are Sensex & Nifty headed?According to Sandeep Raina, Executive Vice President-Research, Nuvama Professional, the market correction is temporary in nature. \u201cThe changes in derivative regulations and the expiry scheduled for today has led to the corrections in the market,\u201d Raina told TOI. \u201cHowever, this is a temporary reaction and we don't expect any major corrections. The markets should stabilize and return to normal levels in the coming days,\u201d he said.Escalating tensions in the Middle East have led to a surge in oil prices, with concerns that supplies from major producers could be disrupted. For countries that heavily rely on oil imports, such as India, the increase in crude prices is a significant concern, as it can have a substantial impact on their import bill and overall economy.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, warned, \"The situation will change if Israel attacks any oil installations in Iran which will trigger a huge spike in crude. If it happens, it can turn out to be more damaging for oil importers like India. Therefore, investors should watch the emerging situation very closely.\" Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers predicts heightened volatility in Indian stock markets in the coming weeks.\u201cThe current geopolitical induced risks and ongoing US election cycle may continue to impact global markets including India in the short term. Also, we are entering the results season starting next week and that is also going to add to the moves depending on the quality of results,\u201d Solanki told TOI.\u201cHence, I see near term 2-3 weeks of heightened news based volatility in the markets. Investors may book some profits in stocks which have run up way ahead of fundamentals and could look for new ideas and add in a staggered manner,\u201d he said.Chinese dragon roars: India\u2019s biggest worryFor investors in India, the resurgence of Chinese stocks, which have underperformed in recent years, could be a more significant concern, feel analysts. The Chinese government recently announced a series of economic stimulus measures, which has led to predictions by analysts that the rebound in Chinese stocks could be sustained. As a result, there is a possibility that some funds may be redirected from India to China, as global investors have been favoring India over China in recent times.The recent stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government is being hailed as a game-changer for the nation's economy and stock markets. Victoria Mio, head of Greater China equities and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, believes that this shift in focus from debt control to growth support could be the key to restoring investor confidence and unlocking value in China's markets.\"As global investors seek stability amidst uncertainty, the Chinese government's decisive pivot from debt control to growth support could be the catalyst needed to restore confidence and unlock value in China's markets.\"The impact of this stimulus package is already being felt in the Chinese stock market, with the SSE Composite index gaining over 15% in the past week, including an impressive 8% rise on Tuesday. Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, attributes this surge to a combination of short covering and a growing belief in the effectiveness of the government's policies. He also suggests that some of the capital outflows from India may have been redirected to China to capitalize on the sharp rally.Looking ahead, Holland believes that global interest rate cuts will benefit all emerging markets. For India specifically, investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming results season to gauge the health of the economy and individual companies.",

        "text": "Amid long-standing calls by private port players to bring parity between recent winners of public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports and players with older contracts, the Centre has released draft guidelines for tariff migration, allowing concessionaires to switch to a market-based tariff regime.\u201cIn the past, tariffs were regulated due to a limited competitive landscape, but the evolving market and competitive landscape necessitates deregulation. The original objective of introducing the tariff regulations in 2005 included safeguarding the interest of users, while ensuring fair returns to the port and encouraging competition and efficiency. The long-term objective outlined in the Tariff Guidelines 2005 was competitive pricing. The market and competitive landscape in the Indian port sector have since witnessed a significant shift,\u201d the shipping ministry said in the draft guidelines.Currently, tariffs for private operators at central government ports are regulated under three separate regimes \u2014 Tariff Guidelines 2005 (superseded by Tariff Guidelines 2019), Tariff Guidelines 2008, and those of 2013.The draft guidelines will allow PPP players to fix their own scale of rates (SOR) and will require them to sign a supplementary agreement.Previously, the major port authorities were both service providers to end users and the concessioning authority. Thus, the tariff regulations played an important role in safeguarding the interests of both port users and PPP operators.According to the Centre, with the transition to the landlord port model and increased private sector participation, the utility of tariff regulations (and fixation) in this context has diminished.Several PPP operators had also raised concerns with the ministry in the past, stating they were at a disadvantage compared to fully private ports, as there was no parity in tariff fixation, making PPP projects less desirable.While the new regulations allow pricing freedom, they will not hinder government revenues earned from these PPP projects, as there will be no change in royalty.\u201cAs an additional measure, the royalty as revenue share of the major port should/would not go below what it would have got under the regime when the tariff was fixed/determined as per the Tariff Guidelines. This would be done by converting the revenue share to royalty based on the annual revenue requirement of the project as determined earlier,\u201d the draft guidelines said.The government has invited stakeholders to send their inputs by 25 October..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "In a boost to commercial real estate and infrastructure projects, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that if the building is constructed for supplying services such as renting or leasing out, it can be regarded as a plant and input tax credit (ITC) under GST will be eligible. However, it rejected constitutional validity challenge to blocked credit provisions in the GST law. \u201cIf the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, the building could be held to be a plant,\u201d a division bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol said. ITC norms With this the apex court upheld Odisha High Court\u2019s ruling in the matter of Safari Retreats. The issue here revolved around section 17(5) of the CGST Act. This particular section prohibits ITC for works contract services when supplied for construction of an immovable property. However, this will exclude plant and machinery. The big question concerned what will be included in the definition of \u2018plant and machinery\u2019? The High Court had held that if the assessee is required to pay GST on the rental income from the mall, it is entitled to ITC on the GST paid on the construction of the mall. Aggrieved by this, the Tax Department moved the Apex Court. After going through all the submissions, the top Court while saying the shopping mall is a \u2018plant\u2019, held that functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant. Expert terms this ruling as a boon for the industry. \u201cThe outcome of the ruling that \u2018functionality test\u2019 should be applied on buildings to determine whether the same qualify as plant is very positive for the industry. With this ruling, by applying the functionality test, if one is able to prove the nexus/ role a particular product with the business of a taxpayer, credit should ideally be admissible\u201d said Harpreet Singh, Partner at Deloitte. \u201cThe eligibility of input tax credit (ITC) will be determined based on the functionality and essentiality tests,\u201d explained Abhishek A. Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who represented multiple petitioners in the case before the Supreme Court. \u201cIn essence, the Court has effectively read down the provisions of Section 17(5)(c) and (d) of the GST Act. ITC can only be denied in situations where the nature of the taxpayer\u2019s business and the claimed credits fail to satisfy these two critical tests. Post this ruling, there will be no requirement to amend the law. According to Rohit Jain, Deputy Managing Partner at Economic Laws Practice, the top Court has upheld the existing provisions and interpreted that building for leasing qualifies as a \u201cplant\u201d and no restriction of ITC is applicable. \u201cThere is no need to make any changes in the law,\u201d he said. Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co felt by reiterating this broader principle in the context of GST, the Supreme Court has given a lot of hope to taxpayers across the country, especially those whose input costs include substantial construction expenses. \u201cCompanies in the commercial real estate as well as infrastructure sectors will do well to review their input credit positions in the light of this judgment,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "SC permits input tax credits on construction expenses for leased buildings",
        "text": "In a development that may encourage increased investment in commercial real estate, the Supreme Court granted the industry relief on Thursday by permitting the application of input tax credits (ITC) on construction expenses for commercial buildings meant for leasing.\"If the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, which are covered by clauses (2) and (5) of Schedule II of the CGST Act, the building could be held to be a plant,\" said Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol.This ruling is anticipated to ease the financial strain of rent on tenants occupying commercial spaces. Real estate companies stand to gain, as buildings can now be categorised as plant and machinery. Additionally, this advantage is not limited to commercial real estate; various industries will also be able to claim ITC on rentals for commercial properties. The ruling suggests that the ITC benefit will be available retroactively.\u201cThis is an important decision that could have wide ramifications for industries, particularly hotels, infrastructure, and logistics, including warehousing. While the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of restrictions relating to input credit on construction-related procurements, it has been held that whether a building constitutes 'plant or machinery' needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis,\u201d said Pratik Jain, Partner, PwC India.\u201cIt means that where it falls under this category, credit would be allowed. It will be interesting to see if the government considers amending the GST laws after this decision,\u201d added Jain.Experts believe that although the constitutional challenge was dismissed, the acceptance of the taxpayer\u2019s submission under Section 17(5)(d) is a positive outcome, potentially lowering the financial burden on developers and fostering greater investment in commercial real estate.\u201cThe real estate industry should carefully evaluate the implications of this ruling on ITC eligibility for outward supplies related to rental income. Given the Supreme Court's decision, it would be prudent for the GST Council to issue clarifications allowing real estate players to claim ITC on rental income,\u201d said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY India.Tax experts also pointed out that the question now arises whether this ruling would also apply to factory buildings, jetties, storage tanks, etc.\u201cThe applicability will depend on the specifics of each case. In the Safari Retreats case, the petitioner retained the property and leased it out rather than using it for personal purposes. In contrast, factory buildings, storage tanks, etc. are typically used by the registered person for their own operations. Therefore, once the detailed ruling is available, it will be crucial to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether ITC related to factory buildings, storage tanks, etc., will be allowed. If ITC is permitted, it will be important to understand the circumstances under which it can be claimed,\u201d said Agarwal.Tax experts also believe that GST laws generally do not allow the benefit of input credit/set-off of GST costs incurred on the input side for the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, with very few exceptions. This often results in additional GST costs for service providers whose primary input-side investment is in immoveable property, such as malls/commercial real estate players, port or airport service providers, and LNG terminal operators.Background of the caseIn the case of Safari Retreats, a mall owner approached the Orissa High Court, arguing that when a mall is being built for providing commercial rental services for the shop spaces therein, there should be no restriction on availing input credit/set-off for the GST cost incurred on the said construction. The Orissa High Court upheld this argument, and the GST authorities subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court. Several similar matters eventually reached the Supreme Court, leading to the formation of a large batch of matters on this legal point. Some of these newer matters also challenged the constitutional validity of such a restriction on input GST credit. Today, the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment\u2014while it has rejected the constitutional validity of the restriction, it upheld the conclusions of the Orissa High Court and, among other things, held that input credit will be allowed if the construction activity is for \u2018plant\u2019 or \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201cThis is a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court. While determining whether a mall, hotel, jetty, breakwater, or warehouse qualifies as \u2018plant or machinery\u2019 will remain a factual question (potentially leading to a second round of litigation), the greatest positive is that the Court has categorically held that there is no blanket restriction against input credit/set-off of the GST cost incurred on the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, especially when the said structure itself is integral to providing the output services in question,\u201d said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "The Indian equity market is on a high: again. On August 1, Nifty 50, the benchmark index for the Indian equity market, hit the \u201825000\u2019 mark. The jump from 24000 to 25000 took just 24 trading sessions. By September 24, it soared past \u201826000\u2019. This unbridled bull run has, in fact, characterised the Indian equity markets since the March 2020. However, now the bullish frenzy has regulators concerned. On March 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch, underlined the \u2018stretched valuations\u2019 of small and mid-cap stocks, iterating there are \u201cpockets of froth\u201d in the market. On July 22, she shared her concerns about speculative trading in F&O segment and losses made by retail traders in this segment. Latest reports suggest, SEBI is all set to tighten regulation to curb retail frenzy in equity options. Are the concerns of the regulator regarding a \u2018froth\u2019 in the market valid? Chart 1 shows the six global markets: Nifty 50, India (NSEI), Dow Jones, United States (DJI), German Index (GDAXI), Bovespa Index, Brazil (BVSP), and SSE Composite Index, China (000001.SS) from 2015 to 2024. For every market, we can see a sharp rally post the pandemic, an uncertain correction in 2022 and a sharper rally from late 2022 onwards. However, for both DJI and Nifty 50 (top two panels), the bullish spree in the last two years is extraordinarily strong. The market capitalisation (mcap) as percentage of GDP (Buffet indicator) suggests the Indian markets are overvalued. The Buffet indicator for India increased substantially from 2019 to 2022, a pattern which matches the US\u2019 (Table 1). India\u2019s mcap-to-GDP ratio reached a 15-year high of 140.2 per cent in May 2024. Values of the Buffet indicator above 100 is, by itself, an indicator of overvaluation but with values skirting 150 per cent, the financial sector has, it seems, decided to grow on its own. The concerns of the regulator about \u2018froth\u2019 in the market are evidently not unfounded. What is leading to the continued bullish frenzy? For one, the retail market participants have entered the stock markets in a big way post Covid, especially in India. Moreover, there are concerns that credit growth in the real sector could be finding a route to the equity market. Table 2 presents the growth in the US and Indian equity markets during different monetary policy phases of the US Federal Reserve, broadly matched by central banks of major markets. Expansionary phase The sharp rally in both the markets post Covid coincides with the expansionary phase. From May 2022, Federal Reserve increased interest rates responding to inflationary pressures, leading to some correction: for both DJI and Nifty 50, we see markets returns fall during contractionary phase. However, with the rate hike paused from September 2023, the markets rallied sharply again. With the Fed\u2019s decision to slash interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, we are looking at another expansionary phase, which may stretch valuations on the upside. How will the financialisation impact the real economy? The symptoms of overvaluation bring forth concerns about financialisation: proliferation of financial assets and financial market growth unrelated to the real sector growth. First, financialisation makes companies more concerned about \u2018share-holder value creation\u2019 than real capital accumulation. Financialisation can lead to \u2018distribute and disinvest\u2019 rather than \u2018retain and reinvest\u2019 for firms, which will jeopardize the real capital accumulation and employment generation. Speculative surge Second, the retail participation in the F&O segment and growth in intra-day trading shows the inclination to use the equity market for speculative gains rather than for long-term investment. This can be detrimental to retail participants\u2019 long-term saving behaviour, and adversely impact saving rates in the economy. Furthermore, if the participation in the stock market is leveraged, a market crash can lead to substantial erosion of wealth for retail investors. The Union Budget in 2024, increased short-term capital gains tax (STCG) and introduced a flat long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) across asset classes, discouraging short-term churning of portfolios. But have the market participants, especially the younger retail traders, taken the cue? Going ahead, regulatory measures should not only discourage leveraged trading, but also create awareness on appropriate risk management strategies for intra-day trading and the pitfalls of shorter-term churning for long term financial goals. \u2018Nudges\u2019 may be more effective than overt paternalism in guiding younger retail participants.

        "text": "Mumbai: Rupee paused its slide and traded flat at 83.96 against the US dollar in early deals on Friday amid retreating crude oil prices and a weak American currency against major Asian rivals. Subdued sentiment in the domestic equity markets amid massive outflow of foreign funds in the past three days played a spoilsport and prevented a recovery in the rupee, forex traders said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.96 against the greenback and failed to recover from the deep plunge witnessed in the previous session. On Thursday, the rupee slid 14 paise to settle at 83.96 against the American currency.

        "text": "Swift, the global financial messaging provider, announced on Thursday that it will begin trialing transactions involving digital currencies and assets on its secure network starting in 2025. This marks a notable step toward the gradual integration of digital assets into the broader financial system.Headquartered in Belgium, Swift is a member-owned cooperative that connects over 11,500 banks, securities organisations, and corporations across more than 200 countries, enabling the secure exchange of standardised financial messages. Although Swift does not hold or manage funds, its network allows financial institutions to communicate, facilitating global and local financial transactions. This initiative aims to demonstrate how Swift can support the movement of diverse types of value \u2014 whether digital or traditional \u2014 across over four billion accounts in 200 countries and territories.Bridging digital and traditional currenciesThe pilot programme will involve central and commercial banks, exploring how Swift\u2019s existing infrastructure can facilitate transactions of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets alongside traditional money. Initial use cases will include payments, foreign exchange (FX), securities, and trade-related transactions. A particular focus will be on enabling Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) and Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) transactions across different digital ledgers.In the release, Tom Zschach, Swift\u2019s chief innovation officer, emphasised the need for digital assets and currencies to coexist with traditional money. \u201cWith Swift\u2019s vast global reach, we are uniquely positioned to bridge both emerging and established forms of value,\u201d Zschach stated. \u201cAs new forms of value emerge, our intention is to continue offering our community the ability to seamlessly make and track transactions of all kinds of assets.\u201dRole of CBDCs in tokenised assetsTokenisation, the process of converting traditional assets such as bonds into digital units or blockchain-based tokens, has been explored by banks and asset managers for several years. The hope is that tokenised assets will make trading more efficient, reducing costs and removing intermediaries. Despite these ambitions, tokenisation has yet to gain significant traction in mainstream markets. The tokenised asset market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, the company said.CBDCs, digital versions of a country\u2019s official fiat currency, are also being trialled worldwide. According to recent data, around 90 per cent of the world\u2019s central banks are currently experimenting with CBDCs. These digital currencies aim to support the trading of tokenised assets and are a response to technological advances that have led to the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.SWIFT, a key player in the global financial system, has been actively involved in trials of both CBDCs and tokenised assets. In March, it announced plans to launch a platform that would connect developing CBDCs to the traditional financial system, ensuring a seamless transition between digital and traditional forms of money..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

The benchmark Sensex surged 729.46 points or 0.88 per cent to 83,226.56 at 12.31 PM, while the Nifty climbed 191.80 points or 0.76 per cent to 25,441.90. This upward momentum comes after a weak start, with markets opening lower for the fifth consecutive session due to geopolitical tensions and foreign institutional investor (FII) selling. The Sensex had opened at 82,244.25, down from its previous close of 82,497.10. The market breadth remained positive, with 2,284 stocks advancing against 1,529 declines on the BSE. 174 stocks hit 52-week highs, while 50 touched 52-week lows. 292 stocks reached the upper circuit limit, and 222 hit the lower circuit.

On the flip side, Cipla (-1.42 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (-1.33 per cent), Shriram Finance (-1.13 per cent), BPCL (-1.10 per cent), and Apollo Hospitals (-0.86 per cent) were the top losers. Sectoral indices also showed strength, with the Nifty Bank up 453.30 points or 0.87 per cent at 52,298.50, and Nifty Financial Services gaining 135.35 points or 0.57 per cent to 24,016.90. The Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap Select indices rose 0.31 per cent and 0.26 per cent respectively. The market\u2019s reversal comes despite ongoing concerns about the Iran-Israel conflict and its potential impact on crude oil prices, which could affect inflation and India\u2019s fiscal deficit. Earlier in the day, experts had pointed to global factors, including FII withdrawals to cheaper markets like Hong Kong, as reasons for the initial weakness. Investors are now closely watching US job data and further geopolitical developments for cues on market direction. The sharp intraday turnaround suggests a possible change in sentiment, although it remains to be seen if this momentum will sustain until market close at 3.30 PM. As trading continues, market participants will be keenly observing whether key support levels can be maintained and if the recovery can offset the losses from previous sessions.",

        "text": "Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, the latest entrant in the Gemini family of artificial intelligence (AI) models, is now generally available for production use. On Thursday, Google announced the general availability of the model, highlighting that it was a smaller and faster version of the Gemini 1.5 Flash which was introduced at Google I/O. Due to being fast, it has a low latency inference and more efficient output generation. More importantly, the tech giant stated that the Flash-8B AI model is the \u201clowest cost per intelligence of any Gemini model\u201d. Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B Now Generally Available In a developer blog post, the Mountain View-based tech giant detailed the new AI model. The Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B was distilled from the Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model, which was focused on faster processing and more efficient output generation. The company now claims that Google DeepMind developed this even smaller and faster version of the AI model in the last few months. Despite being a smaller model, the tech giant claims that it \u201cnearly matches\u201d the performance of the 1.5 Flash model across multiple benchmarks. Some of these include chat, transcription, and long context language translation.You Might Soon Be Able to Share Images Directly With Google's Gemini App One major benefit of the AI model is its price effectiveness. Google said that the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B will offer the lowest token pricing in the Gemini family. Developers will have to pay $0.15 (roughly Rs. 12.5) per one million output tokens, $0.0375 (roughly Rs. 3) per one million input tokens, and $0.01 (roughly Rs. 0.8) per one million tokens on cached prompts. Additionally, Google is doubling the rate limits of the 1.5 Flash-8B AI model. Now, developers can send up to 4,000 requests per minute (RPM) while using this model. Explaining the decision, the tech giant stated that the model is suited for simple, high-volume tasks. Developers who wish to try out the model can do so via Google AI Studio and the Gemini API free of charge. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "The rupee traded on a flat note and settled at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday as surging crude oil prices amid volatile geopolitics weighed on the local unit, while the Reserve Bank intervened to prevent the domestic currency from touching its lowest level. Forex traders said a weak American currency against major Asian rivals as well as the RBI's move to sell dollars supported the local unit. However, it was weighed down by weak domestic equity markets and unabated outflow of foreign funds. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.96 and moved between a narrow range of 83.93 and 83.97 against the greenback. The unit failed to recover from its deep plunge witnessed in previous sessions, and ended flat at 83.96 (provisional) against the dollar. On Thursday, the rupee slid 14 paise to settle at 83.96 against the American currency. The unit had touched its all-time low of 84.09 on August 5. Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said the rupee traded nearly flat amid reports of the Reserve Bank of India selling dollars in the short-term offshore markets, which prevented the Indian currency from hitting a new record low. However, weak domestic markets, a strong dollar and a surge in crude oil prices weighed on the rupee. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"FII outflows and elevated crude oil prices may further pressurise the rupee. Traders may take cues from non-farm payrolls report from the US. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.11 per cent to 101.87. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.12 per cent to $78.49 in futures trade. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex extended its sharp loss from the previous session and crashed another 808.65 points, or 0.98 per cent, to settle at 81,688.45. The Nifty also tanked 200.25 points, or 0.79 per cent to close the session at 25,049.85. Both the indices had tumbled over 2 per cent on Thursday. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Thursday, offloading shares worth \u20b915,243.27 crore on a net basis in the cash segment, according to exchange data. FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b930,000 crore since Monday as they turned bullish towards the Chinese market, betting on various economic stimulus measures announced by the country. Meanwhile, a monthly survey released on Friday showed India's services sector activity fell to a 10-month low in September as new business, international sales and output growth moderated. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services Business Activity Index fell from 60.9 in August to 57.7 in September, indicating that the output registered an increase, but at the slowest rate since November 2023.",

        "text": "By delivering a political speech at the inaugural ceremony of Dasara, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and chief guest litterateur Dr. Hampa Nagarajaiah have desecrated the holy shrine and ruined the sanctity of Nada Habba: MLC A.H. Vishwanath Mysuru: MLC A.H. Vishwanath has strongly criticised the political speeches made during the inauguration of Dasara-2024 atop Chamundi Hill yesterday, asserting that the event lost its sanctity due to the political undertones. Speaking to reporters at Jaladarshini Guest House here this morning, he stated that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah exploited the traditional Dasara inauguration to advance his political agenda. \u201cCM Siddaramaiah, who once spoke lightly of the Gods, has now sought the blessings of Goddess Chamundeshwari, the presiding deity of Mysuru,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dasara inauguration yesterday devolved into a political platform, with CM Siddaramaiah, MLA G.T. Devegowda (GTD), and even the inaugurator, Dr. Hampana, delivering speeches laden with political tones. It was more of a political event than a devotional one,\u201d Vishwanath lamented. He noted that the speakers, focused on their political agendas, overlooked the rich history of Nada Habba Dasara. \u201cDasara has shifted from being a public celebration to a political affair,\u201d he stated, adding that politicians have brought Dasara to a new low. Is GTD a MUDA beneficiary? Regarding MLA G.T. Devegowda\u2019s (GTD) praise for Siddaramaiah, he described it as mere flattery and theatrics. \u201cOne must wonder whether GTD is a beneficiary of the MUDA scam,\u201d he remarked, implying that the MLA\u2019s unnecessary adulation of the CM raises suspicions about his own connections to several MUDA sites. \u201cGTD turned the entire inauguration into a farce, and there is no excuse for this. The function became hypocritical, with everyone patting themselves on the back. It is truly unfortunate that nobody took the time to speak about Goddess Chamundeshwari, the erstwhile Mysuru Maharajas, or the glory of Dasara,\u201d he regretted. He further noted that Union Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has appointed a Non-Vokkaliga leader (C.B. Sureshbabu of the Kuruba community) as the Legislative Party leader of the JD(S), fearing that appointing a Vokkaliga leader might be detrimental to the party in the future. Vishwanath pointed out that no one from the Opposition has explicitly declared intentions to topple the State government, asserting that the Government is propagating this false narrative to protect itself amid the MUDA scam and divert public attention from it. Netas sullied Mysuru\u2019s reputation The MLC questioned whether Siddaramaiah had overlooked the verdict delivered by Justice M. Nagaprasanna, emphasising that the CM\u2019s wife wrote an emotional letter expressing her intention to return the 14 sites just hours after the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s intervention. He maintained that returning the sites does not erase the wrongdoing, arguing that the offence remains even if it is acknowledged. Vishwanath expressed scepticism about GTD\u2019s sudden vocal support for the CM, noting that the MLA has remained silent on the issue until now and allegedly possesses multiple MUDA sites himself. \u201cPoliticians are responsible for tarnishing Mysuru\u2019s reputation. There must be an investigation into all MUDA site allocations, and previous MUDA Commissioners should face imprisonment for their misconduct,\u201d he declared. MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority He further questioned the current MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority to cancel the Khata of the returned sites while the case is still under judicial review. \u201cSiddaramaiah should first read the 197-page verdict from the High Court. A thorough investigation into the entire MUDA scam is necessary. The current MUDA Commissioner must also be held accountable for hastily cancelling the Khata of the returned sites without properly examining the process,\u201d he stated, challenging the Commissioner\u2019s powers to unilaterally annul the Khata. Vishwanath argued that Siddaramaiah\u2019s remarks seem to suggest he operates above the law, accusing him of undermining the rule of law. He added that the Lokayukta case against Siddaramaiah cannot be withdrawn unilaterally, even after the CM\u2019s wife returned the 14 sites.",

New tools for the new world This is especially crucial as aviation continues to be affected by global conflicts such as those in West Asia and Ukraine.

This will also help to improve the credit-deposit (C/D) ratio, according to the ratings agency ICRA.

About 35 per cent of the volumes originated from private sector banks, which have dived into the securitisation market to improve their credit-deposit ratio given the relatively slower pace of deposit accretion, he added.The country\u2019s largest private lender, HDFC Bank, securitised new car loans worth Rs 9,063 crore through a PTC transaction where mutual funds were key investors.

The sustenance of volume growth in the coming quarters, however, remains to be seen, given the appetite for large-size transactions, as seen in Q2, may be limited.

Reportedly, more than 40% of cows slaughtered in Kerala are infertile and in order to address the issue the Animal Husbandry department will establish Regional Livestock Fertility Management Centres (RLFMC) across the State. A first of its kind initiative in Kerala, the project implemented through the Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) will provide multiple treatment options including IVF (in vitro fertilisation) to the farmers. \u201cA large percentage of infertility cases can be corrected. The RLMFC will take cases referred by department veterinarians and normally cows that fail to get pregnant after three sessions of Artificial Insemination (AI) will be considered,\u201d says R. Rajeev, managing director, KLDB. State-of-the-art facilities Each centre will have a mobile unit with state-of-the-art facilities for embryo transfer process, providing doorstep service to the farmers. It will be led by a team of experts, who will assess the cow\u2019s living conditions, feed, health and case history. While treatment for nutritional and hormonal problems will start immediately, some issues will require an extended period to be addressed. In the meantime, the RLFMC team will use software to collect and examine the data of each case and give instructions to the farmers. While infertility causes considerable losses for farmers, it also impacts Kerala\u2019s goal of attaining self-sufficiency in milk production. \u201cThe expense for producing an embryo and transferring it will come to around \u20b96,000. We mainly target heifers as chances of hormonal imbalance are higher in cows. Heifers are ideal carriers for embryo transfer,\u201d says Mr. Rajeev. The centres also offer the provision to opt for quality embryos if the cows are not superior breed. \u201cThe ovum can be taken from any other cow or the farmer can also opt for quality embryos produced by us. The mobile lab will assess fertility issues in cows and also carry out embryo transfers,\u201d he adds. A joint initiative of the State and the Centre, the RLFMCs will come up at Chithara in Kollam and Thalayolaparambu in Kottayam in the initial phase.

        "title": "254,000 jobs added in September as US economic growth holds steady: Report",
        "text": "The US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far surpassing expectations and alleviating concerns about a faltering job market, as per the US Department of Labor. The report has also beaten Wall Street's expectations of a substantial interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the New York Post.Unemployment rate dropsThe unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%, down from 4.2% the previous month, while hourly earnings rose by 4% year-on-year. Consensus estimates had predicted a gain of 150,000 jobs, a modest increase from the 142,000 reported for August. The unemployment rate had previously shown slight fluctuations, falling from an unexpected rise to 4.3% in July.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that further interest rate cuts are likely, but he emphasised a gradual approach designed to support a healthy economy. At the Fed's last meeting on September 18, officials reduced the rate to 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, and projected two additional quarter-point cuts in November and December.\u201cIf the economy performs as expected, that would mean two more cuts this year,\u201d Powell said.Private sector growthData from ADP showed that private sector companies added 143,000 jobs in September, surpassing analysts' estimates of 125,000 and marking a rebound from August's figure of 99,000. This increase ended a streak of five consecutive months of job declines.Despite these positive signs, there are indications of a weakening job market. The Labour Department reported that the quits rate, a crucial measure of worker confidence, fell to 1.9% in August, the lowest since June 2020. The hiring rate also declined to 3.3%, down from 3.4% in July, the weakest rate since August 2013, excluding the pandemic.Low layoffsPayroll growth across most sectors suggests fewer layoffs, although hiring has slowed due to reduced demand following the Federal Reserve's rate hikes of 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% last month, following a 0.5% rise in August, while year-on-year wages rose by 4.0%, up from 3.9% in August. This strong wage growth makes it unlikely that the US central bank will implement another half-percentage-point rate cut at its meeting on November 6-7.ChallengesThe labour market continues to add jobs at a steady pace, allowing Americans to maintain confidence and spending, which supports the economy. However, the hiring rate has slowed significantly, with an average of 116,000 jobs added monthly from June through August, marking the weakest three-month stretch since mid-2020.However, the economy has remained resilient, growing at a 3% annual pace from April to June, boosted by consumer spending and business investments. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta indicates a growth rate of 2.5% for the July-September quarter.Economic concerns weigh heavily on voters as the presidential election on November 5 approaches. While many Americans appreciate the job market's resilience, high prices continue to frustrate them, remaining approximately 19% above levels recorded in February 2021 when inflation began surging.",
        "summary": "The US economy experienced significant job growth last month, adding 254,000 jobs and reducing the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Despite a slowdown in the hiring rate and worker confidence, wage growth remains strong, making further substantial rate cuts from the Federal Reserve unlikely.",

        "text": "Gold has always been a haven both for investors and borrowers. Even in recent times, gold loans are becoming increasingly popular for those seeking quick financial assistance. They allow borrowers to leverage their gold jewellery to secure funds without the need for extensive complicated documentation or a perfect credit score. Moreover, gold loan interest rates are generally lower than unsecured loans, making them a cost-effective borrowing option. Understanding the various benefits of a gold loan is essential, if an individual is planning on availing one. This can significantly improve one's overall borrowing experience. Bajaj Finance Gold Loan All about the gold loan A gold loan is a secured loan where individuals can pledge their 18-22 karat gold jewellery as collateral to obtain funds. This type of loan offers numerous benefits, including: Quick processing Gold loans are typically processed much faster than traditional loans, with many lenders offering instant approvals. This rapid turnaround can be a lifesaver for those facing unexpected expenses. Higher loan amounts Borrowers can receive loans based on the value of the gold pledged, often up to 75% of its market value. This flexibility allows individuals to secure the exact amount they need without overcommitting. No need for perfect credit score Since gold acts as collateral, lenders are more lenient regarding the borrowers credit history. This makes gold loans an attractive option for those who may struggle to secure other types of financing due to a lower CIBIL score. Reasons to choose Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan There are multiple lenders in the market that one can choose from. However, here are some reasons that make Bajaj Finance a preferable choice for many borrowers: Quick loan processing Bajaj Finance processes gold loans quickly, allowing borrowers to get the funds they need without delays.

Minimal documentation Borrowers can secure a substantial loan amount by submitting their basic KYC documents like Aadhaar card, Voter ID, driving licence, passport, letter from NPR or NREGA job card. High loan amount One can get a loan starting from \u00e2\u0082\u00b95,000 to \u00e2\u0082\u00b92 crore, depending on the value of the gold pledged, gold loan interest rate, and the borrowers liquidity requirements. This makes it possible for individuals to meet their financial needs, whether big or small. Convenient repayment options With multiple repayment plans, borrowers can choose a schedule that suits their financial situation, making it easier to manage repayments. This flexibility ensures that borrowers can stay on top of their finances without feeling overwhelmed. Zero part-prepayment fee Bajaj Finance does not levy any part-prepayment fees, allowing borrowers to save on unnecessary administrative costs when they clear their loans early. This feature is especially beneficial for those who might receive windfalls or bonuses and wish to reduce their debt. Complimentary insurance on gold assets When opting for a loan with Bajaj Finance, pledging gold is insured for free, providing added peace of mind. This safeguard ensures that borrowers do not have to worry about the security of their valuable assets while they are being used as collateral. Steps to apply for a Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan Applying for a gold loan with Bajaj Finance is pretty simple.

        "text": "I am 42 years old. I run my own business. I wish to buy life insurance, but I don\u2019t get salary slips, which is an important document to buy a policy. How can I get covered? Congratulations on taking the important step of considering life insurance. It is an essential tool to secure the future of your dependents and safeguard your business interests. Insurance providers understand that entrepreneurs and business-owners like yourself have different financial structures and offer various alternative ways to evaluate your financial stability. There are several options available to you: Bank statements: Your bank statements can offer a clear picture of your financial health and stability. As a business-owner, your transactional history and cash flow from your primary bank account (reasonably reflecting your business and savings) will serve as proof of income. By examining your regular deposits and business-related transactions, we can get a comprehensive understanding of your financial standing. A 12-month record of your bank statements is typically sufficient to demonstrate your financial viability. Using account aggregators, your bank statements can be verified digitally with your consent, with your mobile number and an OTP. Income tax returns (ITR): Another excellent option is your ITR. They reflect your declared income over time and are particularly useful for self-employed individuals or business owners whose income may fluctuate. Your ITR provides consistency, helping us determine an accurate picture of your earning capacity. This is a reliable document for underwriting purposes, giving us the confidence to offer you a suitable insurance policy. Vahan portal: If you own a vehicle, we can retrieve information from the Vahan Dashboard, a government database of registered vehicles. These data help us assess your assets and overall financial position. While vehicle ownership may not directly indicate your full financial strength, it adds another dimension to your profile, further enriching the financial underwriting process. Credit history: Your credit history \u2014 whether through credit card transactions, personal loans, or business loans \u2014 can be accessed via credit bureaus based on your PAN. This allows us to assess your financial behaviour, creditworthiness, and ability to manage financial obligations. A strong credit score is a key indicator of financial health and can significantly strengthen your life insurance application. GST details: As a business-owner, your goods and services tax (GST) filings can be another surrogate for salary slips. GST returns provide insight into your business\u2019 turnover and profitability, helping us assess your financial standing and stability. If your business is registered under GST, sharing your filings can help us tailor your insurance coverage based on your business performance. Other ways In rare cases, when the above financial surrogates may not fully establish your eligibility, there are still ways to secure a policy. Insurers are often open to considering other financial assets you may own, such as property, investments or business assets, that can demonstrate your financial strength. Flexibility is key, and we believe that every customer deserves a thorough and fair evaluation. Points to note You can present any asset you own \u2014 property, mutual funds, fixed deposits, or business assets.

        "title": "RBI survey indicates slowdown in manufacturing",
        "text": "The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) latest quarterly industrial outlook survey of 1,300 manufacturing companies reveals that manufacturing companies are witnessing a slowing growth in the first and second quarter of 2024-25. This is also mirrored in manufacturing PMI which is tapering downwards.\n\nAccording to RBI survey data, the net response (difference in the percentage of companies reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism) regarding production output has decreased from 27.9 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 22.9 per cent in Q2 2024-25. The number was 34.4 in the fourth quarter of FY24. This implies that more manufacturers witnessed slowdown in production this fiscal. One concern is that the companies polled indicated a steep fall in growth expectation of production output in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal.\n\nThe RBI survey report states that the pressure from raw material costs, financing expenses, and salary payments has eased. As a result, expectations of growth in selling prices and profit margins have also softened. \u201cManufacturers polled for better expectations on production, order books, employment, capacity utilisation and overall business situation during Q4:2024-25 and Q1:2025-26. Input cost pressures are likely to continue for manufacturers, who expect to retain pricing power and increase in selling prices on the back of robust demand conditions,\u201d the survey report reads.\n\nGeopolitical strife\n\nRamendra Verma, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat says, \u201cThiscan be attributed to a chain reaction of geo-political situation, which has resulted in supply chain disruptions leading to high inputs costs (for e.g. \u2013 energy and semiconductors). This is also leading to weakening of demand.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, net responses for order book growth dropped 25.6 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 19.5 per cent in Q2 2024-25, while net responses for pending orders increased from 5.9 per cent to 8 per cent in the same period. Similarly, net responses for capacity utilisation fell from 18.7 per cent to 15.1 per cent.\n\nVerma outlined several factors contributing to the low net responses for order books, such as declining consumer confidence and reduced spending, which have led to fewer new orders. Additionally, global economic uncertainties have made businesses reluctant to place large orders. \u201cMany manufacturers are operating below capacity due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions,\u201d Verma explained, adding that this under-utilisation is also linked to more cautious inventory management practices.\n\nSujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, pointed out that the slower growth in related indicators aligns with the decline in industrial production. In Q1 FY25, capacity utilisation dropped after surpassing 75 per cent in the final quarter of the previous fiscal. \u201cOne of the reasons for lower utilisation was elections which usually disrupts activity along with heatwaves especially in the north. This was also highlighted in the PMI survey which indicated some of the factories remained shut due to excessive heat,\u201d Hajra added. \n\nThe monthly Purchasing Managers Index for India\u2019s manufacturing sector has also shown a downward trend. It was reported at 58.8 in April 2024, remained relatively stable at 58.3 in June, but declined slightly to 57.5 in August 2024, and further dropped to 56.5 in September 2024.\n\nThe global market research firm Nomura\u2019s report indicates a similar weakening outlook. \u201cEven as the pace of government spending picks up in coming months and base effects become more favourable, we expect growth momentum to remain soft, due to fading urban pent-up demand, tight monetary policy, a moderation in credit growth, negative real rural wage growth, sluggish private capex and soft external demand,\u201d the Nomura report says.",

They will stay put for two days and public entry to MUDA Office has been restricted.\n\nThe investigation focuses on the controversial allotment of 14 sites to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah\u2019s wife, B.M. Parvathi, along with other irregularities related to 50:50 site allocations, alternative sites and compensatory sites. Social activist Snehamayi Krishna has complained to the ED that irregularities worth Rs. 4,000 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore has happened in MUDA.\n\nThe team, accompanied by armed personnel, travelled from Bengaluru\u2019s Shantinagar Office and arrived at MUDA gate around 10.45 am. More than 20 armed personnel from Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have provided security to the ED sleuths. The Mysuru City Police are providing additional security.\n\nAfter their arrival, an ED representative informed the Police officers on duty at MUDA gate that they were from ED in Bengaluru. Upon hearing the update, MUDA Commissioner A.N. Raghunandan promptly arrived at the gate to welcome the ED officers. Subsequently, the sleuths proceeded directly to the MUDA Commissioner\u2019s chamber on second floor, where they began discussions in the antechamber around 11.30 am.\n\nAn Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Siddaramaiah, Parvathi and others, revolving around allegations of illegal money transfers linked to the land allotments.\n\nRaid at Kengeri home\n\nSources informed Star of Mysore that the ED team also conducted a raid at the residence of J. Devaraju in Kengeri, Bengaluru. Devaraju was the individual who sold the 3.16-acre land at Kesare to B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy, Parvathi\u2019s brother. Mallikarjunaswamy later gifted the land to Parvathi, in exchange for which she received 14 sites in the Vijayanagar Third and Fourth Stages under a 50:50 ratio.\n\nAfter a brief discussion in the antechamber of the Commissioner\u2019s Office, the ED sleuths proceeded to MUDA Chairman\u2019s Office. Chairman K. Marigowda has already resigned from his post. The officers then moved to the meeting room adjacent to Chairman\u2019s Office, where they held discussions with senior officials.\n\nWill cooperate: MUDA Secretary\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the MUDA Office around 12.15 pm, MUDA Secretary Prasanna Kumar stated that the ED has officially commenced its investigation. \u201cWe will cooperate with the sleuths and provide whatever information they request. All documents will be made available, and there will be no public work for two days,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked how much longer the ED sleuths intend to remain in Mysuru, the MUDA Secretary replied that, for now, they would stay for two days. \u201cDepending on their progress, their stay might be extended. Ultimately, it is for them to decide, and I have no role to play in that matter,\u201d he added.\n\nSeeking documents\n\nBefore arriving in Mysuru, the ED had instructed MUDA to submit all the crucial documents related to the case, which forms the basis of the FIR (11/2024) registered by the Lokayukta against Siddaramaiah, his wife Parvathi, his brother-in-law B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy and landowner J. Devaraju.\n\nLokayukta Police have already launched a detailed investigation, examining alleged offences spanning from 1968 to 2023. Teams are tracing records dating as far back as 1935, when Ninga, father of Devaraju, originally owned the disputed land in Kesare\u2019s survey numbers 462 and 464.",

        "title": "Why this small-cap real estate and EPC company is a worthy buy",
        "text": "Both the construction and infrastructure industries have taken off strongly in the post-Covid period. Residential real estate and commercial construction have been on overdrive over the past three-four years. Infrastructure projects such as ports have been in the limelight for a while now and continue to see considerable traction.\n\nAs a play on these segments, Man Infraconstruction (Man Infra) has been a key beneficiary of the offtake in the real estate and construction businesses.\n\nThe company focuses on residential construction and infrastructure projects (ports). It takes an EPC (engineering, procurement and contracting/construction) approach in its infrastructure business as well as select real estate projects. \n\nIn the residential construction segment, Man Infra takes the joint development agreement (JDA), joint venture (JV), development manager (DM) and society redevelopment approaches, which ensure that the upfront investments are minimal and margins are healthy. It is focused on the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in its residential towers projects.\n\nAt \u20b9190, the stock trades at 23 times its per share earnings for FY24 and 19 times its likely per share earnings for FY25. This is among the lowest valuation multiples commanded by any real estate or construction company with mid-sized operations. The BSE Realty trades at a PE of nearly 65 times, while most frontline and mid-sized real estate players trade at price-earnings multiples of 30-70 times. \n\nA track record of strong execution of projects, expertise in residential, commercial properties, as well as ports, multiple revenue streams via a low-risk, asset-light business model and a net-debt-free balance sheet are positives for Man Infra. The company has both private and public sector clients.\n\nThe stock has corrected about 20 per cent from its recent high and presents a reasonably attractive opportunity. Investors with a two-three-year perspective can buy the shares of the company at the current price. \n\nBetween FY22 and FY24, the company\u2019s revenues grew at a compounded annual rate of 43.5 per cent to \u20b91,263.5 crore in FY24, while net profits rose at nearly 111 per cent annually to \u20b9300.4 crore. It enjoys an EBITDA margin of 25.8 per cent in FY24, which is among the best in the industry.\n\nDiversified operating model\n\nMan Infra has been in the construction business for nearly 60 years now. It has specialised capabilities in the ports business. It has helped in the development of eight major ports in India including those of Navi Mumbai, Chennai, Gujarat Pipavav, Mundra and Kochi. It has also been an EPC contractor for leading infrastructure companies and real estate developers. \n\nIn the last several years, Man Infra has been able to up its game in the residential space. Projects such as Atmosphere O2, Mulund West (47 storeys \u2013 two towers), Aaradhya Highpark, Nr. Dahisar (30 storeys \u2013 six towers) and Aaradhya EastWind, Vikhroli (34 storeys) were executed in three-and-a-half to four years.\n\nIn the last 10 years, the company has become a reasonably-established player in the MMR, with a presence in the central, eastern, western suburbs and recently in South Mumbai as well.\n\nIn all, 17 projects totalling 2.4 million sq ft have been delivered, mostly six months to one year ahead of schedule. Around 90 per cent of its inventory reportedly is sold before even the occupancy certificate is received.\n\nMan Infra receives DM fee for handling and marketing a real estate project. It receives EPC margin for in-house construction and engineering capabilities. The company receives interest margin on funds infused into projects. \n\nIn the EPC business, it receives regular EPC margin from the government and private clients. When it professionally manages a site, material and labour of a real estate project, it receives a PMC (project management consultancy) margin. \n\nRevenues from projects executed under the DM model are not reflected in consolidated sales figures, but only the DM fee (12-14 per cent of total project revenues) gets added to the sales and PBT.\n\nFor projects executed under the JV model, sales are not reflected in the consolidated revenue figure, but the company\u2019s share of profits gets added to the bottom line.\n\nThus, in the DM model, all costs and revenues are booked in the landlord\u2019s financials, while in the JV model, all costs and revenues are booked in the SPV, even as Man Infra receives a share of profit based on the extent of its stake in the venture.\n\nThis asset-light approach is set to continue for the company. Given the focus on DM and JV-based revenue generation, the top-line growth may not be as robust as in the past few years, though profitability is set to receive a considerable boost given that minimal to no upfront capital commitment is required.\n\nFuture potential and healthy financials\n\nMan Infra has cash and cash equivalents of \u20b9487 crore as of June 2024. Its debt was only \u20b933 crore as of June 2024, down from \u20b9332 crore in September 2022. Very few real estate and construction players enjoy a net-debt-free balance sheet as well as healthy operating margins.\n\nThe company has 6.1 million sq ft of carpet area waiting for execution over the next several years. Man Infra\u2019s real estate business itself has a visibility of \u20b915,000 crore over the next five-six years, with margins expected to be north of 20 per cent consistently.",

        "text": "As the agriculture minister chairs the annual conference on Rabi crops on Saturday, where strategies will be chalked out with States for a bumper harvest, one important issue to grab attention may be the shortage of Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), the key fertiliser used in wheat, mustard and gram, all three major winter crops. \n\nLatest data show that sales of DAP fell to 7.76 lakh tonnes (lt) last month, which is 51 per cent lower from 15.7 lt year-ago. Monthly sales of DAP in September were reported at 11.15 lt in 2022, 5.96 lt in 2021, 7.65 lt in 2020 and 6.33 lt in 2019.\n\n\u201cFarmers normally buy DAP in September-October to prepare the field for the sowing. With a favourable monsoon and its delayed withdrawal as well as good moisture has created the demand for fertilisers as farmers expect a good harvest of winter crops,\u201d said agriculture scientist A K Singh. \n\nAlso read: India decides to ease rice export curbs further\n\nWith the reports of farmers\u2019 protest over alleged shortages of DAP coming particularly from Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, there is something amiss as far as availability is concerned, Singh added.\n\n\u201cWheat crop this year is very crucial and the government should not take any chance and ensure ample and timely availability,\u201d Singh suggested and added that there should be study on shrivelled crop of wheat, which has been continuing for last few years and the government has been relaxing procurement norms in one state or the other.\n\nAccording to the crop weather watch report, the total fertiliser sale during Kharif season 2024 (April-September) was 319.97 lt which included 189.12 lt of urea, 46.12 lt of DAP, 9.27 lt of MOP and 75.46 lt of complex (a mixture of N, P , K nutrients). The total demand for the season was estimated at 321.44 lt \u2013 177.12 lt of urea, 59.87 lt of DAP, 10.26 lt of MOP and 74.19 lt of complex.\n\nSingh said that it is unusual to see the fall in sales of DAP as against its projected demand whereas there is no such difference noticed in other fertilisers when sales data are compared with demand.\n\nOfficial data show that sales of urea were up 3.1 per cent at 30.89 lt in September 2024 from 29.97 lt year-ago, but those of MOP were down 4.7 per cent at 2.25 lt from 2.36 lt and complex dropped by 11.6 per cent at 16.6 lt from 18.77 lt.\n\nThe Centre will discuss (on October 19) with state officials about the plan and strategies about the on-going Rabi sowing season that started from October 1, to ensure that the winter-grown foodgrains production target of 164 million tonnes (mt) including 115 mt of wheat, 13.65 mt of gram and 13.8 mt of mustard, officials said.\n\nAlso read: Rice exports a tad lower in H1, but trade sees shipments gaining pace in year ahead as govt eases curbs",

Even as security for Salman is at an all-time high following threats from gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, the actor has immense faith in his bracelet, which, he feels, has kept him safe so far. The bracelet, passed on to him by his father Salim Khan, has been integral to Salman\u2019s life for several decades. You will never spot Salman without the bracelet. So how does the Firoza bracelet secure Salman Khan? In a recently resurfaced Reddit video, Salman elucidates the protective mechanism of the \u201cFiroza\u201d stone in his bracelet. He says, \u201cThis stone is called Firoza. Apparently, there are only two living stones, they say. One is a Greek, and one is a Firoza. This is the turquoise.

Neelam says, \u201cAstrologically and spiritually, anyone can wear this crystal to enhance good luck and protection.\u201d She suggests that individuals seeking balance and making decisions based on divine guidance, rather than emotions, should wear this more frequently. Enhanced Communication: Dr Priya refers to turquoise as the \u201cstone of communication.\u201d \u201cIt encourages open dialogue, making it a perfect companion for those in professions that require clear expressions\u2014like teaching, counselling, or public speaking.\u201d Spiritual Growth: \u201cMany practitioners of meditation and yoga wear turquoise to enhance their spiritual journey, as it helps to release outdated belief systems and foster a deeper connection to one\u2019s higher self,\u201d says Priya. Physical Well-Being: People believe that turquoise supports the respiratory system, alleviates ailments like asthma, and promotes overall physical well-being. \u201cIts detoxifying properties may also improve metabolic processes and enhance immunity. People often wear turquoise as a talisman for overall health and protection against illness.\u201d Protection and Safety: Many ancient cultures, including Native Americans, wore it as a safeguard against negative energies, psychic attacks, and physical threats. \u201cFor those who travel frequently or live in uncertain circumstances, wearing turquoise can impart a sense of safety and security.\u201d Promoting Creativity: The vibrant colours of turquoise stimulate creativity and inspire self-expression.

        "title": "Your Guide to Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates in India",
        "text": "Purchasing a car is not just a significant milestone; it\u2019s often a major financial commitment that can impact your budget for years to come. One of the most crucial aspects of financing your vehicle is securing the best car loan interest rates. Whether you\u2019re considering a sleek new model or a reliable used car, understanding how to get favorable loan terms can save you substantial money over time. This guide provides essential tips and insights to help you secure the best deal on your car loan and streamline your new car loan approval process.\n\nWhy Car Loan Interest Rates Matter\n\nCar loan interest rates play a vital role in determining how much you will ultimately pay for your vehicle. A lower interest rate means reduced monthly payments and lower total interest paid over the loan term. On the other hand, a higher interest rate can inflate the overall cost of your vehicle, leading to financial strain.\n\nFor example, consider a \u20b910,00,000 car loan with a five-year term. If you secure a loan with an 8% interest rate, your monthly payment will be approximately \u20b920,000. However, if your interest rate is 12%, your monthly payment jumps to around \u20b922,000. Over five years, that\u2019s a difference of nearly \u20b91,20,000! Clearly, understanding how to obtain the best car loan interest rates is essential for making a sound financial decision.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nSeveral factors influence the car loan interest rates you may qualify for, including:\n\n1. Credit Score\n\nYour credit score is one of the most significant determinants of your car loan interest rates. Lenders assess your creditworthiness based on this score; a higher credit score generally results in a lower interest rate. For example, individuals with a score above 700 typically enjoy more favorable loan terms than those with lower scores.\n\nBefore applying for a car loan, it\u2019s wise to check your credit score. If you find areas for improvement, such as outstanding debts or errors on your credit report, take steps to rectify these issues. Paying off debts and ensuring timely payments can help boost your score, making you more attractive to lenders.\n\n2. Loan Term\n\nThe length of your loan, or the term, can also impact your interest rate. Generally, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates, while longer-term loans may carry higher rates but result in lower monthly payments. It\u2019s crucial to strike a balance that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nWhile a longer loan term might seem appealing due to lower monthly payments, keep in mind that you could end up paying significantly more in interest over the life of the loan. Consider your budget and long-term financial objectives when choosing a loan term.\n\n3. Loan Amount and Down Payment\n\nThe amount you borrow, and your down payment can influence the interest rate offered. A larger down payment reduces the loan amount, which can lead to a lower interest rate. Additionally, a significant down payment shows lenders that you are financially responsible, potentially improving your loan terms.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the car\u2019s purchase price. For example, if you\u2019re purchasing a car for \u20b915,00,000, a down payment of \u20b93,00,000 can significantly improve your chances of securing a better rate.\n\n4. Market Conditions\n\nCurrent market conditions can also affect car loan interest rates. Economic factors, such as inflation and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policies, can influence lending rates across the board. Keeping an eye on market trends can help you time your loan application for better rates.\n\nTips for Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nTo maximize your chances of obtaining the best car loan interest rates, follow these actionable tips:\n\n1. Improve Your Credit Score\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a higher credit score can lead to lower interest rates. Take proactive steps to improve your credit before applying for a loan:\n\n\u2022 Pay bills on time: Late payments can negatively impact your score.\n\n\u2022 Reduce outstanding debts: Aim to lower credit card balances and pay off loans.\n\n\u2022 Check your credit report: Correct any errors that may be affecting your score.\n\n2. Shop Around\n\nNot all lenders offer the same car loan interest rates. To find the best deal, compare rates from various sources, including banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Make sure to take into account the loan terms, fees, and other charges that may apply.\n\nUse online comparison tools to simplify this process. A little research can go a long way in helping you secure a better interest rate.\n\n3. Consider Pre-Approval\n\nGetting pre-approved for a car loan can significantly enhance your bargaining power when shopping for a vehicle. Pre-approval provides you with a clear idea of how much you can borrow and what interest rates you might qualify for. This not only streamlines the buying process but also strengthens your position when negotiating with dealerships.\n\nAdditionally, a pre-approved loan can help you avoid high dealer financing rates, ensuring that you stick to your budget.\n\n4. Negotiate Your Rate\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to negotiate with lenders. If you receive a better rate from another lender, use it as leverage in your discussions. Many lenders are willing to match or even beat competing offers to secure your business.\n\nBe prepared to discuss your credit history and financial situation during negotiations. Demonstrating that you\u2019ve done your research can bolster your position.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Additional Fees\n\nWhen considering a car loan, pay attention to any additional fees that may affect your overall costs. These can include:\n\nProcessing fees\n\nPrepayment penalties\n\nLate payment fees\n\nUnderstanding these charges can help you make a more informed decision about your loan.\n\n6. Stay Informed About Market Trends\n\nKeeping an eye on market conditions can help you identify the best time to apply for a loan. Interest rates can fluctuate based on economic factors, so being informed can guide your decision-making process.\n\nNavigating the world of car loan interest rates doesn\u2019t have to be daunting. By understanding the factors that influence your rate and taking proactive measures, you can significantly reduce your vehicle's overall cost. Start by checking your credit score, comparing lenders, considering your loan term, and confidently negotiating your rate. With these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to drive off in your new car with a loan that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nReady to kick off your journey? Begin by reviewing your credit score and exploring various lenders to uncover the best car loan interest rates available. Your dream car is within reach\u2014ensure you\u2019re financing it wisely!",

        "text": "China's drone manufacturer DJI has filed a lawsuit against the US department of defense (DoD), challenging its inclusion on a blacklist of Chinese military companies, the company announced on Saturday. DJI claimed that the designation given to it by the Pentagon, a metonym for the department of defense and its leadership, is incorrect.\u201cOn October 18, DJI filed a lawsuit to challenge the department of defense's (DoD) erroneous designation of the company as a 'Chinese military company,'\u201d DJI told AFP.\"DJI is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military, and the DoD itself acknowledges that DJI makes consumer and commercial drones, not military drones,\" the company added. \"DJI is a private company and should not be misclassified as a military company.\"In recent years, DJI has come under scrutiny from Washington for allegedly surveilling ethnic minorities in China. Its drones have reportedly been used by both sides in the ongoing war in Ukraine.The Pentagon added DJI to its list of Chinese military-linked companies in 2022. It claimed at that time that China ensures access to advanced technologies and expertise through PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian but support military advancements. The Pentagon stated that this was part of China's effort to \"highlight and counter (China's) Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).\"Founded in 2006, DJI said that it tried to engage with the DoD for over sixteen months before deciding to seek relief in federal court.The company said, \u201cDJI is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military, and the DoD itself acknowledges that DJI manufactures consumer and commercial drones, not military drones. DJI is a private company and should not be misclassified as a military company.\u201dDJI's lawsuit follows several measures by Washington targeting Chinese tech companies due to national security concerns. Last month, the US commerce department banned the sale of vehicles that incorporate Chinese technology over similar risks.DJI is a leading global manufacturer of consumer and commercial drones, used for various applications including aerial photography, filmmaking, crop-dusting, search and rescue, and public safety.The company has also faced controversy amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict when the Ukrainian government accused DJI of aiding Russia with its AeroScope system, which was allegedly used to guide missiles. DJI denied these claims and suspended business operations in both Russia and Ukraine in April 2022 to reassess compliance requirements.DJI was also previously blacklisted by the US department of the treasury in 2021 for allegedly supporting the surveillance of the Uyghur minority in China's Xinjiang region.",

Exports of petroleum products dropped by 12.48 per cent to USD 36.54 billion, while gems and jewellery exports fell 10.89 per cent to USD 13.92 billion. \n\nA slowdown in developed economies, along with higher crude prices and disruptions in global supply chains, compounded these challenges.\n\nIndia\u2019s trade dynamics have been shaped by several international factors, including the Russia-Ukraine war, which has kept energy prices elevated, and tensions between the US and China, which have disrupted supply chains. \n\nAdditional pressures arose from Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, causing higher freight rates, and the EU\u2019s new carbon tax and forest regulations.\n\nWhile the WTO projects a gradual recovery in global trade, predicting 2.6 per cent volume growth in 2024 and 3.3 per cent in 2025, geopolitical risks remain.\n\nIndia\u2019s top export markets during H1 included the US, the UAE, the Netherlands, the UK, and China.

        "text": "The dollar index continued its rise for the third consecutive week. The rise to 104 almost happened last week in line with our expectation. The index touched a high of 103.87, and has come down from there to close the week at 103.49. \n\nDollar outlook\n\nThe overall bullish view is intact. The dollar index (103.49) has some resistance at 104 which can be tested this week. We expect this resistance to hold on its first test.\n\n A corrective fall from around 104 to 103-102.70 is a possibility. A fresh leg of up-move thereafter will have the potential to breach 104. That in turn will open the doors for the dollar index to see a fresh rise to 105-105.50 in the coming weeks. \n\nFinds support\n\nThe US 10Yr Treasury yield (4.08 per cent) is getting support around 4 per cent. The yield fell in the first half of the week and made a low of 3.99 per cent. But from there it rose back well in the second half recovering all the loss.\n\nImmediate resistance is at 4.12 per cent. A break above it can take the US 10Yr Treasury yield up to 4.17 and 4.21 per cent this week. The price action thereafter will need a close watch to see if the rise is extending beyond 4.21 per cent or not.\n\nThe outlook will turn negative only if the yield declines below 4 per cent. Only then the chances of a fall to 3.85-3.8 per cent will come into the picture again.\n\nMore downside\n\nThe euro (EURUSD: 1.0867) continues to fall. It touched a low of 1.0811 and has bounced back from there. The broader trend is down. Resistances are at 1.0885 and then 1.0920-1.0930 which can cap the upside if more rise is seen from current levels.\n\nThe outlook is bearish to break 1.08 in the coming days. Such a break can take the euro down to 1.0750 in the short term.\n\nThe level of 1.0750 is a strong support which can halt the current fall. A bounce from there can trigger a corrective rise to 1.09-1.0950 going forward.\n\nThe Indian rupee (USDINR: 84.07) was broadly stable all through last week. The domestic currency was stuck in a narrow 10-paise range of 83.98-84.08 through the week. The break above 84 seen on Wednesday failed to get a strong follow-through rise. There are chances for the rupee to remain stuck between 84 and 84.10 for some more time.\n\nHowever, the bias is negative. We expect the rupee to break 84.10 eventually and decline towards 84.40 going forward. \n\nRupee has to get a sustained rise above 84 in order to see a recovery towards 83.85-83.80.\n\nOn the charts, the medium-term picture is negative for the rupee. It is likely to remain below 83.50 going forward. Once the break below 84.10 happens, it will open the doors for the rupee to weaken towards 84.80-85 over the medium-term.",

        "text": "The Nobel prize in economics for 2024, or more correctly Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded earlier this week has triggered off debates not as much about economics but about colonialism and its institutions. Economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were awarded for their significant work on how a nation\u2019s institutions shape its economic development. Among the most cited in economics, their work not only draws a connection between the two but parses societal institutions into \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cextractive\u201d, and theorises that inclusive institutions have a positive long-term impact on economic prosperity while extractive institutions stifle a country\u2019s economic development. They claim inclusive institutions are the ones that promote democracy, limit corruption, enforce justice and property rights; the extractive show a high concentration of power, corruption, and limited political freedom.\n\nThe claim that certain institutions are a pre-condition for economic development has drawn criticism from within the discipline because inclusive institutions in many high-income western economies came about after their development. Equally important is how countries like China, to take an example, enjoy staggering economic prosperity despite \u201cextractive\u201d institutions. The economists have ignored the impact of colonialism \u2014 and its extractive institutions in colonies \u2014 on economic development. This should interest India where the flavour of the season is to throw off the colonial yoke and symbols. Its institutions, a colonial legacy, still function on the discredited trickle-down theory; there has been a staggering rise in its billionaires count even as household savings have fallen sharply with people spending more on basic necessities. If anything, this year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics draws attention to why it is critical for India to de-colonise its economic structure that was, and continues to be, based on the extractive principle.",

Fresh slippages stood at \u20b9864 crore during Q2FY25 compared with \u20b9578 crore in Q2FY24. \u201cSlippage was slightly elevated in this quarter due to one corporate account which turned into an NPA, having an exposure of around \u20b9245 crore,\u201d the MD said. \n\nTotal Recovery and upgradation\n\nTotal recovery and upgradation during the period stood at \u20b91017 crore as against \u20b9656 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal. \n\nUCO Bank has so far recovered around 90 per cent of the \u201cerroneous credits\u201d which certain account holders of the bank had received via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) last year. \u201cActions are on to recover the rest of the money. Our endeavour is to recover maximum during this fiscal,\u201d Kumar said. Notably, certain accounts holders of the Kolkata-based bank in November last year had received a total of around Rs 820 crore \u201cerroneous credits\u201d via IMPS.\n\nThe lender\u2019s asset quality improved during Q2FY25. Gross NPA ratio fell 96 bps year-on-year to 3.18 per cent, whereas net NPA ratio fell 38 bps y-o-y to 0.73 per cent during the period. \n\nThe bank is planning to tap capital markets for raising of equity capital upto \u20b9 1500-2000 crore by way of QIP in one or more tranches. \u201cWe may go for it in the third quarter, subject to market conditions,\u201d Kumar said. \n\nThe bank\u2019s overall loan growth target for this fiscal is 12-14 per cent y-o-y. It expects that home and car loans to grow 18 per cent and 30 per cent y-o-y, respectively, during this festive season.\n\nIn the second quarter the lender witnessed an 18 per cent y-o-y growth in gross advances, while deposits growth stood at 10.57 per cent y-o-y.",

Among the key industries fueling this growth, the Indian government has prioritised the agrochemical sector, recognising it as one of the \u201c12 industries with the greatest potential for India to achieve global leadership.\u201d\n\nThe agrochemical sector has experienced significant progress, with projections estimating its value will reach $8.22 billion by 2024 and grow to $13.08 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 4 per cent. \n\nHowever, FY2023-24 brought its share of challenges, including fluctuating markets, rising raw material costs, and unpredictable monsoons. \n\nAlso read: What is it in the Digital Farm Mission?\n\nResilient industry\n\nThe industry has remained resilient, supported by government initiatives like \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cAtmanirbhar Abhiyan,\u201d strategic investments, and a focus on innovation. Increased collaboration in research and development, alongside the growing focus on manufacturing is expected to further drive the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nInternational magazine Agropages released the rankings of the top 20 Indian agrochemical companies based on their FY 2023-24 performance. The revenue threshold for inclusion in the top 20 list increased to \u20b91,226 crore, up from \u20b91,151 crore in the previous year, reflecting robust growth among the Indian agrochemical companies. \n\nAmong the top 20 companies, 11 surpassed the \u20b92,000 crore sales mark, while nine companies reported revenues between \u20b91,000 crore and \u20b92,000 crore. \n\nNotably, 10 companies posted year-on-year growth, with PI Industries and Safex Chemicals achieving double-digit increases, nearing or exceeding 20 per cent. \n\nOn the other hand, 10 companies faced declines in sales, with Sharda Cropchem and Meghmani Group experiencing the steepest drops.\n\nFocus on R&D pays off\n\nOne of the standout performers in the Agropages rankings was Best Agrolife Ltd (BAL), which climbed from 16th place last year to 13th in FY 23-24. \n\nThe company reported a consolidated revenue of \u20b91,873.3 crores for the fiscal year, showcasing its growth and increasing market presence. Interestingly, the company\u2019s growth relied on building its brand business. Its branded business grew by 85 per cent in FY \u201824, while having shifted its focus from B2B to B2C. \n\nThe company\u2019s focus on R&D and patented products seems to have yielded a strong product presence in the expanding customer base. Considering the Indian brand business, the company has positioned itself among the top 5 Indian agrochemical brands.\n\nAlso read: DAP sales in September drops by 50% to less than 8 lakh tonnes \n\nDespite India being the world\u2019s second-largest agrochemical exporter with $5.5 Billion in exports, China leads with $12 Billion.\n\nAs the Indian agrochemical industry continues to evolve, companies focused on innovation are poised to play a vital role in shaping the sector\u2019s future.

The consumer price inflation in India rose to 5.49 per cent in September from 3.65 per cent in the previous month, well above market estimates of 5 per cent. It was the highest inflation rate since the start of the year, overshooting the RBI\u2019s target of 4 per cent after dropping below the threshold in the first two months of the September quarter.\n\nHowever, a significant fall in crude oil prices helped the market to recover from lower levels.\n\nOn the domestic front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to offload shares, selling Rs 21,823 crore in the cash segment, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) kept their buying momentum with purchases totalling Rs16,384 crore in the same segment.\n\nPalka Arora Chopra, Director of Master Capital Services said, \u201cNifty 50 ended its three-week losing streak by closing in the green. The key resistance now stands at 25,000, and a breakout above this could lead to a move toward 25,300.

        "text": "The USD 200 billion Chinese food delivery industry, once a thriving sector that expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic, is now facing a downturn, according to a report by CNN.Having more than doubled in size over three years, this industry \u2013 the world\u2019s largest by revenue and volume of orders \u2013 had provided a steady income for casual workers. However, the workers are now struggling to make ends meet.China\u2019s economic slowdown, prompted by a property crisis and weak consumer spending, has hit delivery workers hard, decreasing their incomes and job stability.On Friday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed a moderation in third-quarter growth and said that weakened consumer spending and the ongoing property market crisis continue to weigh heavily on the economy.Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.6 per cent in the three-month period from July to September, compared with a year ago. That was just slightly higher than the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, who had predicted an expansion of 4.5 per cent, CNN reported.According to a professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, delivery workers will persistently face pressure as long as delivery platforms prioritise cost-cutting measures. \u201cThey are working long hours, really being squeezed,\u201d said Jenny Chan, associate sociology professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong. \u201c[And] they will continue to face pressure as [delivery platforms] have to keep the cost low,\u201d she said.Chan further noted that the economic downturn has led to a shift towards budget-friendly meals, resulting in decreased earnings for delivery workers, who must then work extended hours to maintain their earnings.Apart from the given problems, the workers are constantly under immense pressure to meet tight deadlines, even if it means cutting corners on the road \u2013 by speeding or running red lights \u2013 causing hazards that endanger both themselves and other road users, CNN reported.Delivery workers have been witnessing their paychecks shrink dramatically, increasing their financial struggles.Last year, they made 6,803 yuan (USD 956) a month, according to a report from the China New Employment Research Center. That\u2019s almost 1,000 yuan (USD 140) a month less than they were making five years ago, despite many reporting working longer hours, according to CNN.A 1,000 yuan difference may seem negligible in US dollars, but it\u2019s substantial in China, where the national average monthly wage stood at just 1,838 yuan (USD 258) last year, according to the NBS figures.",

        "title": "Shift from agriculture to manufacturing must for India\u2019s growth: Amitabh Kant",
        "text": "Kasauli, Oct 20 (IANS) India\u2019s G20 Sherpa and former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant contends that in order for India to grow at high rates of nine to ten per cent and become a developed economy by 2047, the country\u2019s GDP has to grow by nine times and per capita income by eight times, with manufacturing and urbanisation playing a key role in the process.\n\nHe also hailed India\u2019s chairmanship of the G20 and batted for lateral entry into the government service.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturing has to grow by 16 times. It has to fire on all cylinders. We have to become a manufacturing nation,\u201d Kant told IANS at the Kasauli Literary Festival.\n\nHe also stressed that the country must urbanise in a scientific, sustainable manner, enhance agriculture productivity, and remain a services nation.\n\n\u201cFor all this to happen, you have to provide well-paid jobs to the people and every transition that takes place to manufacturing means that people must move from agriculture to manufacturing and towards urbanisation. The dependence of population in India on agriculture is 46.5 per cent,\u201d Kant added.\n\nHe pointed out that agriculture gives us 16.5 per cent of the GDP, adding that nowhere in the world does this happen.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you need to take the population away from agriculture and put them into manufacturing on better-paid quality jobs. There also needs to be stress on disinvestment, cutting red tape, and ease of doing business which has been this government\u2019s agenda,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nAbout the time when India held the presidency of G20 from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, Kant recollects that the country was able to bring consensus on all key issues confronting the world.\n\nSome of the key issues were a specific action plan for sustainable development goals which had been impacted due to Covid, the issue of strong, sustainable, balanced growth in the global economy, the issue of Green Development Pact, technological transformation and the use of digital public infrastructure and more importantly, the issue of women-led development.\n\n\u201cThese were all critical issues. But to my mind, our biggest achievement during G20 was the fact that it spoke the voice of the Global South, and under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, was able to make the African Union an integral member of G20. So, in a way, we succeeded in making it from G20 to G21 which has made G20 a far more inclusive body in the world. Now, it covers almost 90 per cent of the global population and covers a very vast, almost 80 per cent of the global GDP. So, this has been India\u2019s biggest achievement,\u201d Kant said.\n\nStressing that it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wish to hold G20 meetings in most states and UTs, and not just at one or two places, the former bureaucrat said: \u201cWe took it to every nook and corner of the country. And every state was an active participant. This required clockwork precision. It was a very federal G20. Every state brought their one district and a product forward.\u201d\n\nAdding that the country has succeeded hugely when it comes to ease of doing business, Kant claims what India has achieved in last eight years what it could not achieve in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe have scrapped over 1,600 laws. And moved up 79 positions in the World Bank ease of doing business. India has now become an easy and simple nation,\u201d he said.\n\nKant feels that the next lot of reforms have to happen by the states which have to make procedures simple.\n\n\u201cThis is very critical. India has done a lot of work in terms of insolvency, bankruptcy code, real estate regulation act, and goods and services tax. We have opened up, reduced the corporate tax, and opened up the economy for the private sector in a much bigger way while the FDI has also grown,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked why small traders are not very happy with the introduction of GST, Kant said that there will be some unhappy people when you bring in major reforms of paperless digital tax, as you are cutting out human intervention completely.\n\n\u201cGST rates in some areas are high but that is an issue where states and Central government have to sit down and sort out,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout India\u2019s focus right now, the former NITI Aayog CEO said first and foremost, the country needs to drive manufacturing in a big way and increase exports in order to become an exporting nation.\n\n\u201cWe must urbanise and must improve learning and health outcomes and nutritional standards which is very important. The social indicators to improve are very critical. Health, education, nutrition, all these are very critical over a long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nConsidering that NITI Ayog during his reign had several lateral entries, India\u2019s G20 Sherpa said that he has always been in favour of lateral entrants considering they bring in a lot of fresh thinking.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to find ways of, introducing new talents into government to constantly push for innovation and transformation within government,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that there was no disconnect between major schemes and their implementation on the ground, Kant cited a few examples.\n\n\u201cWe have made 40 million houses and provided pipe water connection to 253 million Indians. Around 130 million toilets and 88,000 kilometres of road have been made. Now this is the kind of infrastructure which no other country has been able to make in seven years. What disconnection are you talking about?\u201d",

During the previous year, the soyameal shiipments stood at 18.36 lakh tonnes. \n\nThe increase in shipments is despite the fact that Indian soyameal had been expensive in the world market by around $100-150 per tonne.\n\nIran was the largest buyer with volumes of around 4.15 lakh tonnes followed by Bangladesh at 3.02 lakh tonnes. Nepal was the third largest buyer with volumes of 1.92 lakh tonnes and Germany at 1.06 lakh tonnes and Afghanistan at 85,181 tonnes. \n\nAlso read: Iran turns saviour for pricey Indian soyameal exports\n\n\u201cIn view of demand from Iran, Bangladesh and Nepal export of soybean meal during this oil year was higher than last year by 15.90 per cent, resulting in better crushing and production of soybean meal\u201d said D N Pathak, Executive Director, The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA).\n\nSoyabean meal production increased during the year to 94.69 lakh tonnes, up from previous year\u2019s 91.79 lakh tonnes as per the latest estimates revealed by SOPA. Soyameal imports reduced during the year marginally to 0.25 lakh tonnes, down from same period last year\u2019s 0.27 lakh tonnes. \n\nDomestic consumption by the feed sector was a tad lower at 66 lakh tonnes during oil year 2023-24, down from previous year\u2019s 67 lakh tonnes, while the off-take from food sector was flat at 8 lakh tonnes. \n\nAlso read: India\u2019s oilmeal exports down by 8.5% in H1 of current fiscal \n\nFor the current oil year 2024-25, SOPA expects the production of soyabean to increase by around 6 per cent to over 125.8 lakh tonnes on higher yields, over previous year\u2019s 118.74 lakh tonnes. This is mainly on account of higher yields on account of favourable weather conditions. The yields are estimated to be higher this year at 1063 kg per hectare as against 1002 kg per ha in the previous year, as per the survey carried out by SOPA recently in the key producing states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.",

The IPO is a pure offer for sale (OFS) and the entire proceeds will go to the promoter.\r\n\r\nIndia serves as a key global production base for the Korean automotive giant. Last year, Hyundai produced 765,000 vehicles in India, reports Yonhap news agency.\r\n\r\nHyundai Motor India is the second-biggest carmaker in India, following Japan's Maruti Suzuki. Industry observers are keen on whether the company can enhance its local competitiveness through the listing on the Indian stock market.\r\n\r\nThe South Korean automotive giant has made aggressive investments in India in recent years.\r\n\r\nLast year, Hyundai acquired General Motors' manufacturing plant in India's western city of Pune. The company is currently upgrading the facility with a smart manufacturing system, aiming to achieve a production capacity of over 200,000 units annually.\r\n\r\nOnce the Pune plant becomes operational in the second half of next year, Hyundai Motor India will have a combined annual production capacity of 1 million units when leveraging both the Chennai and Pune plants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Hyundai Motor plans to expand the number of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in India to 485 by 2030.\r\n\r\nTogether with affiliate Kia Corp., Hyundai Motor has entered into a strategic partnership with Indian battery giant Exide Energy this year.\r\n\r\nHyundai plans to introduce the Creta EV, which is the electric version of the company's first India-specific Creta SUV, in 2025. The model will be the first EV produced locally at the Chennai plant.\r\n\r\nThe company plans to introduce five EV models in the Indian market by 2030 to meet the growing demand for EVs in the country.",
