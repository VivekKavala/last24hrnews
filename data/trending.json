        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) Mushaal Hussein Mullick, the wife of jailed Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief, Yasin Malik, wrote to Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi, urging him to initiate a debate in Parliament for her husband, who she claims can bring peace to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).\n\nMullick, a former assistant to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on human rights and women empowerment, believes that Yasin Malik\u2019s role in the ongoing peace process in J&K is critical and that his plight must be addressed urgently.\n\n\u201cRahul Ji, Yasin Malik could be a force for peace in Jammu and Kashmir, if only he is given a fair chance,\u201d Mullick wrote, urging the Congress leader to intervene before Malik\u2019s deteriorating health leads to irreversible consequences.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing treatment of my husband is nothing short of torture, and I request you to help us secure justice for him,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a letter to Gandhi, Mullick drew attention to the ongoing legal battles her husband faces, particularly a decades-old sedition case in which the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now demanded the death penalty.\n\nMalik, who has been at the forefront of Kashmir\u2019s separatist movement, is currently involved in challenging the NIA\u2019s appeal for capital punishment in a terror funding case.\n\nThe NIA\u2019s charges stem from a 2017 investigation into terror financing involving Malik along with several others. In 2022, Malik was sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court after he pleaded guilty to the charges.\n\nHowever, according to Mullick, Malik\u2019s detention and the demand for his death sentence are \u201cpart of a broader political vendetta.\u201d\n\nShe claimed that since 2019, the BJP-led central government has subjected Malik to \u201cinhumane\u201d treatment, and his trials have been \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalik is being tried for waging war against India in a 35-year-old case, and now, fabricated charges are being used to demand his execution,\u201d Mullick alleged in the letter.\n\nShe further stated that her husband, who once advocated for armed struggle, had renounced violence years ago, embracing the path of non-violence and peace.\n\n\u201cYasin Malik can become an instrument for real peace in J&K, not the cosmetic peace that has been promised,\u201d she added.\n\nMullick also highlighted that since November 2, Malik has been on an indefinite hunger strike to protest his harsh treatment in jail. She expressed deep concern for his health, warning that the prolonged hunger strike could jeopardise his life.\n\n\u201cThis hunger strike is a desperate cry against the cruel conditions he has endured, and it is putting his life at severe risk,\u201d she said.\n\nMalik, she emphasised, chose the path of non-violence after renouncing armed resistance, a change of heart that has been acknowledged by various authors and peace advocates over the years.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered that the report prepared by the National Task Force (NTF), set up by the Union government on its order in the aftermath of the ghastly rape and murder of a junior doctor of R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital in West Bengal\u2019s Kolkata, be made available to Chief Secretaries of all state and Union Territories and other stakeholders, including the doctors\u2019 associations.\n\nA bench, headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, noted that the NTF has formulated recommendations in two categories, first, prevention of violence against medical professionals and providing safe working conditions, and, second, prevention of sexual violence against doctors.\n\n\u201cIn order to enable this court to issue directions for compliance with the NTF recommendations, we consider it appropriate to direct that a copy of the report shall be made available to all the counsels appearing in the present batch of proceedings. The report shall also be supplied to the Chief Secretaries of all the states/UTs. In the event, any state/UT intends to make any submission with regard to the recommendations, a brief note of submissions may be filed through the standing counsel to the court master within a period of three weeks,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, pursued the 6th status report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and said that it would refrain from making any observations since the investigation is underway.\n\nThe apex court noted that the trial will commence on November 11 at a special court in Kolkata after charges were framed against the \u201csole prime accused\u201d in the case, Sanjay Roy. The process of the framing of charges was completed on Monday, exactly 87 days after the body of the junior doctor was discovered at a seminar hall within the state-run R.G. Kar premises on the morning of August 9 this year. Around a month ago, the CBI filed its first charge sheet against Roy, a civic volunteer with Kolkata Police, in the alleged rape and murder case.\n\nIn the charge sheet, the CBI did not rule out the possibilities of a larger conspiracy behind the macabre crime that prompted alleged events of tampering and altering of evidence during the initial phase of the investigation which was carried out by Kolkata Police.\n\nBesides Roy, two others arrested by the CBI officials in the matter are the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital\u2019s former Principal Sandip Ghosh, and the former SHO of Tala Police Station, Abhijit Mondal. RG Kar comes under the jurisdiction of Tala Police Station. The main charges against Ghosh and Mondal are misleading the investigation when the Kolkata Police were carrying out the investigation before it was handed over to the CBI by the Calcutta High Court. Both have been accused of tampering with evidence in the case.\n\nThe top court asked the CBI to file a fresh status report before the next date of listing.\n\nIn a hearing held last month, the SC had stressed that the NTF should complete its task within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n\u201cWe are of the view that the Union government must take proactive measures to ensure that the work of the task force is completed within a reasonable period in the future. Accordingly, the meetings of the NTF shall be held at periodic intervals,\u201d it ordered, asking the NTF to apprise the top court about its tentative recommendations by the next date of listing.\n\n\u201cWe will give three weeks to NTF to meet and complete all of its work,\u201d the SC told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.\n\nThe Supreme Court had ordered the formation of the NTF to suggest measures for the security of medical professionals across the country, observing that the safety of doctors is the \u201chighest national concern\u201d.\n\nTaking suo moto cognisance of the rape and murder case of a junior doctor, the Supreme Court had termed the incident \u201chorrific,\u201d which raises the \u201csystemic issue of safety of doctors across the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the fact that there is an absence of safe conditions of work for young doctors across the country, particularly, public hospitals,\u201d it had said.",

In September, a probe by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) reportedly found that Amazon and Flipkart breached local competition laws by favouring specific sellers on their platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, is also examining numerous complaints related to the use of \u201cdark patterns\u201d and planning a crackdown on online e-commerce companies violating consumer protection laws.

Jayasankaran Nambiar and C. S. Sudha, hearing the matters relating to the Justice Hema Committee report, decided to appoint advocate Mitha Sudhindran to assist the court.\r\n\r\nAfter the appointment was announced, the court orally directed to ensure all views must be collected from all relevant stakeholders allowing the state to review them so as to come up with the draft of a special law that incorporates a feminine perspective.\r\n\r\n\"Give us different perspectives so we that we can put all of that to the state to make the work of the state also easier\u2026 let's have as many perspectives and using all of these inputs, the state can embark upon this draft legislation... It will probably get a sort of nod from the Court to test its legality. It is not going to be like many of the legislations that come normally, maybe it is a radical approach that the legislators are actually seeking prior approval from the judiciary... It is always better to be cautious in these matters\u2026..we are not drafting the legislation... what we are doing here is perspectives from different stakeholders,\" it said.\r\n\r\n\"This court is certainly is not going to be legislating\u2026 what we are doing here is trying to get different perspectives, and predominantly the feminine perspective, because that is something that we find is lacking in our laws now. So let us have a feminine perspective also,\" it added.\r\n\r\nEver since August 19 when the Justice Hema Committee report was made public and highlighted the pitiable conditions of women in the film industry including sexual exploitation, there was a huge hue and cry as there is no clear employer-employee relationship in the film industry.\r\n\r\nFollowing the report's publication, the High Court decided to form a separate bench to hear all the pleas arising from it. In the last hearing, the court was informed that 26 FIRs have been registered pursuant to its direction to the Special Investigating Team (SIT) to take necessary action.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the court was informed that in five FIRs, the victims are unwilling to cooperate with the investigation, while in three FIRs, the victims have refuted their own statements and declined to continue with the investigation. The court was further informed that more time is required to submit statements in the remaining 18 FIRs and posted the case for its next hearing on November 21.",

This was a tribute to the courage and sacrifices of our veterans and ex-service personnel who dedicate their lives to protecting our nation.

My gratitude to the Prime Minister for fulfilling the commitment given to the ex-servicemen of this country.\u201d\n\nOROP, implemented in 2014, is a long-awaited scheme that ensures uniform pension payments for retired military personnel based on rank and service length, regardless of retirement date.\n\nThis reform addressed disparities in pension, where personnel with the same rank and service length but different retirement dates received unequal pensions.\n\nPreviously, a Lieutenant General who retired in 1995 could have received a lower pension than a colonel who retired after 2006 despite similar service tenure.\n\nUnder the revised system, all Defence pensioners retired, discharged, or invalided out of service as of July 1 \u2014 including Commissioned Officers, honorary commissioned officers, JCOs/ORs, and non-combatants \u2014 are eligible for the OROP pension.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) Erstwhile royal families from across India have lambasted Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for describing the country\u2019s former kings as \u201cpliant maharajas\u201d subjugated by the East India Company.\n\nHis words sparked a strong backlash, with royal descendants urging him to \u201clook into the pages of history\u201d and accusing him of attempting to \u201cmalign the erstwhile royal families of India\u201d through an \u201cinaccurate portrayal\u201d in his recent editorial.\n\nRajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Diya Kumari, the granddaughter of Man Singh II, the last Maharaja of Jaipur, voiced her disapproval on X, saying, \u201cI strongly condemn Mr Rahul Gandhi\u2019s attempt to malign the erstwhile royal families of India in an editorial today. The dream of an integrated India was only possible because of the utmost sacrifice of the erstwhile royal families of India.\u201d\n\n\u201cBaseless allegations made on the basis of half-baked interpretation of historical facts are completely unacceptable,\u201d she added.\n\nVikramaditya Singh, former Congress leader and grandson of Maharaja Sir Hari Singh, the last ruler of Kashmir, criticised Gandhi\u2019s \u201csuperficial understanding of history.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the Maharajas\u2019 contributions and roles were far from \u201cpliant,\u201d stating that many royal rulers began with humble origins as soldiers or farmers, fighting countless battles to establish their kingdoms.\n\n\u201cThe irony that Mr Rahul Gandhi, coming from such immense privilege himself, would repeatedly attempt to malign the Maharajas\u2019 colossal contributions to the Republic of India is appalling,\u201d Singh wrote.\n\nSingh cited Maharaja Gulab Singh, who rose from a foot soldier to command his own army and ultimately unified Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh as part of India.\n\nHe reminded Rahul Gandhi of Maharaja Hari Singh\u2019s historic demand for Indian independence at the 1930 Round Table Conference in London, remarking that to draw parallels between today\u2019s business climate and colonial India is \u201centirely unfounded and erroneous.\u201d\n\nAdding to the outcry, Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar, scion of the 1,500-year-old House of Mewar in Udaipur, noted, \u201cThe royal families of India, throughout history, have consistently embodied a spirit of cooperation in governance rather than resorting to control and exploitation. Despite the divisions imposed by the colonial structure, the royal families have always been protectors of their people and have played an essential role in shaping India\u2019s economic, cultural, and political landscape.\u201d\n\nChaitanya Raj Singh, representing the former royal family of Jaisalmer, called the LoP\u2019s claims \u201cbaseless and unacceptable,\u201d remarking, \u201cPerhaps Rahul Gandhi has forgotten who actually did the work of uniting India; he should look into the pages of history.\u201d\n\nNathdwara MLA Vishvaraj Singh Mewar, grandson of the last Maharana of Mewar, also condemned Rahul Gandhi on X, questioning whether his statements stem from \u201cignorance or intentional misrepresentation\u201d to \u201cmalign\u201d the Maharajas.\n\nShrimant Gayatri Raje Puar, a BJP leader and member of Dewas\u2019 former royal family, expressed her disapproval, stating, \u201cI condemn Rahul Gandhi\u2019s editorial defaming India\u2019s Maharajas, who were pillars of Sanatan Sanskriti. These royals safeguarded our heritage, sovereignty, and culture at great personal cost, giving us \u2018Akhand Bharat.\u2019 Ignoring this legacy disrespects our heritage.\u201d\n\nMysore MLA Yaduveer Wadiyar, a scion of the former Wadiyar dynasty, also weighed in, saying that Rahul Gandhi\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge of true history is on constant display,\u201d accusing him of \u201cignorance of the contributions made by erstwhile princely states towards today\u2019s Bharat.\u201d\n\nThis wave of condemnation follows Rahul Gandhi\u2019s recent opinion piece, in which he contrasted present-day monopolistic pressures with the control exerted by the East India Company.\n\nOn X, Rahul Gandhi urged Indians to \u201cChoose your India: Play-Fair or Monopoly? Jobs or Oligarchies? Competence or Connections? Innovation or Intimidation? Wealth for many or the few?\u201d\n\nIn an opinion piece published in a leading daily newspaper, Rahul Gandhi wrote, \u201cIndia was silenced by the East India Company, and it was silenced not by its business prowess, but by its chokehold. The Company choked India by partnering with, bribing, and threatening more pliant maharajas and nawabs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt controlled our banking, bureaucratic, and information networks. We didn\u2019t lose our freedom to another nation; we lost it to a monopolistic corporation that ran a coercive apparatus,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe original East India Company wound up over 150 years ago, but the raw fear it then generated is back. A new breed of monopolists has taken its place. They have amassed colossal wealth, even as India has become far more unequal and unfair for everybody else. Our institutions no longer belong to our people, they do the bidding of monopolists. Lakhs of businesses have been decimated, and India is unable to generate jobs for her youth. Bharat Mata is mother to all her children. The monopolisation of her resources and power, this blatant denial of the many for the sake of a chosen few, has wounded her,\u201d Rahul Gandhi wrote.\n\nThe opinion piece further read: \u201cI know that hundreds of India\u2019s brilliant and dynamic business leaders are scared of the monopolists. Are you one of them? Scared to talk on the phone? Scared of the monopolists colluding with the state to enter your sector and crush you? Scared of I-T, CBI or ED raids forcing you to sell your business to them? Scared of them starving you of capital when you need it the most? Scared of them changing the rules of the game mid-way to ambush you?\u201d",

But, if the rules empower the competent authority to set benchmarks at different stages of the recruitment process, then such benchmarks may be set before that stage is reached so that neither candidates nor invigilators are taken by surprise,\" ruled the five-judge Constitution Bench.\r\n\r\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy, PS Narasimha, Pankaj Mithal and Manoj Misra, said that if change in eligibility criteria is permitted under rules or advertisement, the change will have to satisfy the test of non-arbitrariness.\r\n\r\nIt said, \"The object of any process of selection for entry into public service is to ensure that a person suitable for the post is selected. What is suitable for one post cannot be for another. Thus, a degree of discretion is necessary to be left to the employer to devise a method to select a candidate most suitable for the post.\"\r\n\r\nIn its judgment, the top court stressed the recruiting bodies, subject to the extant rules, may devise appropriate procedure for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end, provided that the procedure adopted is transparent, non-discriminatory, non-arbitrary and has a rational nexus to the objects sought to be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution Bench was hearing a reference after a three-judge Bench doubted the correctness of an earlier decision, where it was held that the selection criteria cannot be changed midway during the recruitment process.",

Police station-level staff need to follow the evolving strategy which started with 'Need to know' to 'Need to share' and should now be seen as 'Duty to share', \"\u009d he said.\r\n\r\nHe said state police should join the NIA in building a database of illegal weapons seized across the country.

        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 7 (IANS) The Union government will soon release a national policy and strategy to counter terrorism, that will help demolish the entire terror ecosystem, said Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday, reiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s slogan of \u201czero tolerance for terrorism\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at the \u2018Anti-Terror Conference-2024\u2019 organised here, HM Shah said the National Counter-terrorism Policy and Strategy will soon be ready for circulation among all states as they have to lead the fight against \u201cterrorism, terrorists and the terror ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the importance of infusing technology and training officers in using technology, HM Shah urged state police forces to join hands with Central agencies like the NIA and use federal forensic facilities to demolish the terror ecosystem.\n\nHe also paid tributes to 36,468 policemen who laid down their lives for national security and in the fight against terror, claiming that there has been a drop of 70 per cent in terror activities in the country since 2014.\n\nHe highlighted the new provisions in the three criminal laws that, for the first time in 76 years after Independence, define terrorism and allow security agencies to pursue trials in absentia against terrorists and financial criminals.\n\nTo become a developed nation, the country also needs to upgrade its security system and put in place a unified anti-terrorism ecosystem, he said.\n\n\u201cA strong ecosystem against terror can be built only if all states implement the ATS structure, STF structure and training module suggested by the Central agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing on the need for information sharing in the battle against terror, HM Shah appreciated the progress made by the Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), under the Intelligence Bureau. Highlighting the important role that states need to play to fight terror, as security is a state subject, the Home Minister called upon police station-level staff not to suppress information but share it with other agencies.\n\n\u201cSuppressing information is not going to help the nation. Police station-level staff need to follow the evolving strategy which started with \u2018Need to know\u2019 to \u2018Need to share\u2019 and should now be seen as \u2018Duty to share\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said state police should join the NIA in building a database of illegal weapons seized across the country.\n\nHM Shah also highlighted the achievements of I4C \u2013 Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) \u2013 established by the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide a framework and ecosystem for law enforcement against cybercrimes.\n\nThe fight against terror would be incomplete without demolishing its financial system. Whether it is cryptocurrency, gold smuggling, drug smuggling or hawala, the state-level security system needs to contribute towards dismantling the terror finance network.\n\n\u201cUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act should be used freely against the financial network of the terror ecosystem,\u201d he said, urging states to coordinate with the NIA on this issue.\n\nThe Home Minister also urged the media to highlight recovery of explosives and weapons by the police forces to keep them motivated in the fight against terror.",
