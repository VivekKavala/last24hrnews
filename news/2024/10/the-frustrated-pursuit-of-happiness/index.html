                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Pain and disappointment writ large in his face, Sunil, 40, sat down to narrate his story at a lodge on Anna Salai in Chennai.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Hailing from Malappuram, he began driving an autorickshaw at his hometown after completing Class X.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Since he was struggling to make ends meet, and inspired by tales of people from his district going abroad, he began dreaming of a better life in a foreign country.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He was directed to an agent at Palavakkam in Chennai.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In the very first meeting, the agent claimed that he had successfully sent many abroad for jobs, and Sunil was quickly convinced.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He paid ₹40,000 to him in processing fees for a job in Israel.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, thereafter, there was no progress at all for months.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Sunil met the agent frequently to push his case.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Every time, the agent collected more money, and altogether Sunil ended up paying ₹7 lakh, which he mopped up by mortgaging his house, pledging his wife’s jewellery, and borrowing from relatives.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The agent claimed he had tied up with a tour operator in Israel for sending 46 men and women en masse as tourists.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Tickets for onward and return journeys and hotel rooms were booked in their names.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The plan was that they would travel like tourists and on reaching a famous church in Jerusalem, would disappear amid the crowd.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Later, they would stay in the houses of relatives or friends who had already settled down as migrant workers and seek jobs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> A plan fraught with danger and rejection, but Sunil went ahead because he was desperate to “go abroad”.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> However, the visa was rejected.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Neither could he leave Chennai nor was his money repaid.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The agent advised him to stay back and wait for another opportunity, promising this time a job in Canada.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He demanded a further ₹8 lakh, and Sunil coughed it up too, borrowing from every one he knew.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Forged ID cards On May 1, the agent sent Sunil forged ID cards and documents identifying him as a senior scientist in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) attending a conference of scientists in Canada.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This time the visa came through, but as Sunil tried to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the authorities came to know that there was no such conference happening and stopped him.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “My dreams are gone.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I had to come back and begged the agent to return the money.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Instead of returning the money, he threatened me.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I am staying at a cheap lodge for five months now, and I’ve been starving.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If I go back home, all the people who lent me money will be at my door.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> So I am hiding in Chennai.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> My aged father is down with a terminal illness and my wife is unable to bear this life any more.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” Later, investigation revealed that his agent was running an office as a registered bus travel operator.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> His modus operandi was the same: sending people abroad with forged documents and ID cards as scientists from prestigious research institutions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But Sunil is far from alone in his predicament.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The police say there has been a huge increase in the number of overseas job-seekers being cheated by unscrupulous recruitment agents.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Once Gulf countries were the most sought-after, but the pattern of migration by unskilled and semi-skilled aspirants indicates that eastern European nations, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, Lithuania and Armenia, are popular.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> South Korea, Israel, and Canada have also come into the picture.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Recently, it came to light that job-seekers from several districts, especially from South India, were recruited through illegal manpower agencies and sent to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar on tourist visas.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Victims are then held captive in Cambodia or Laos for work in harsh and restrictive conditions.</p>
