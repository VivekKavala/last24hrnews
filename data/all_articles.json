Addressing the villagers, he said a section of media and political parties have started propagating the financial disputes in his family to divert the attention of the people. \u201cThese kinds of issues are common in every household.

        "text": "Atlanta, Oct 24 (IANS) Early votes hit a record high in the US major battleground state of Georgia as a big proportion of voters have already made up their minds on key issues and who to vote for.\n\nAs many as 2.15 million, among 7.2 million active voters in total, have cast their ballots in the Peach State\u2019s early voting as of Wednesday, according to data issued by the Election Lab with the University of Florida as well as the Georgia Secretary of State, Xinhua reported.\n\nGeorgia also saw a record turnout of voters on the first day of early voting, which lasts from October 15 to November 1, shortly before the general election is held on November 5.\n\nThough voters\u2019 first priorities vary, especially between urban and rural people, the cost of living is seen as the most common concern in the voters\u2019 minds.\n\nSedrick Hamner, an African American from the College Park area in the southwest of Atlanta city, said that he cast his vote in support of the candidate who hopefully is going to promote democracy.\n\nStill, kitchen table issues such as inflation, taxes, prices of goods and wages are vitally important, said Hamner, a pastor who voted on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI used to be middle class, perhaps. Now, I\u2019m probably closer to the lower class just due to inflation,\u201d said Hamner, adding that the US dollar doesn\u2019t go as far as it used to go while wages have been stagnant.\n\nHe was not able to eat out or go travelling as much as he used to do due to the expenses, he said.\n\nNancy Goude, a voter from Molena, a town around 100 km south of Atlanta, told Xinhua on Wednesday that her change jars were not as full as a few years ago because she no longer has spare change. \u201cIt takes everything we have to survive,\u201d she said.\n\nGoude added she would like her grandchildren to have opportunities like she herself and her children had enjoyed. She said that everybody in her family has voted and she herself voted early this year.\n\nRomy Goldman, a resident from Buckhead, Atlanta, said that her main considerations were electing someone who\u2019s good for the country, and someone who believes in human rights and women\u2019s rights.\n\nGoldman told Xinhua that she had made her decision on who to vote for early on and had voted early so she could take part in volunteer work in this year\u2019s election cycle.\n\nGeorge Pilibosian, a retired businessman who voted on Tuesday inside Buckhead Library, said that people\u2019s rights to take care of their own bodies are important.\n\n\u201cThe government should not tell us what to do with our own bodies, whether you\u2019re a woman or a man,\u201d said Pilibosian.\n\nJohn Duncan, a retired painter from La Grange, a city which is about 112.6 km southwest of Atlanta, said the US priority should be to secure the border as people cannot go out and enjoy themselves as they could back in 2020.\n\nDuncan said that the new President should get the economy straightened out so that people can buy food for their families.\n\n\u201cI have a family of six. It costs me a good 120 (dollars) a day to feed my family. That\u2019s hard to do when you are retired,\u201d Duncan said.",

He will also meet the Prime Minister. There is no harm if Omar has put forth his demand for restoration of statehood. When Gagangir-type attacks stop only then can a final call be taken by the Centre on restoration of statehood to J&K.

Perhaps the timing of the attack at Gagangir was wrong for the terrorists otherwise there would have been casualties of hundreds of workers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that former Chief Minister and National Conference (NC) president Dr Farooq Abdullah has already condemned the incident, and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti has also condemned the attack though guardedly.\n\n\u201cThese incidents need the highest form of condemnation. These are attempts to destabilise the peace and the new government in J&K. Earlier such attacks were carried out in Kathua, Reasi, Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu division, where innocents were targeted and now it is Kashmir. Today also a non-local labourer was injured in Tral which again is highly condemnable,\u201d he said.\n\nReplying to a question whether there should be talks with Pakistan, Koul said no talks can be held with the neighbouring country unless it hands over militant commanders, including Syed Salahuddin to India. \u201cLet Pakistan hand over Salahuddin to India, only then talks can happen,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe BJP leader dismissed any future possibility of restoration of Article 370.

        "text": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu announced that the state will become the \u201cDrone Capital of India\u201d during the Amaravati Drone Summit 2024, held in Mangalagiri. As part of his vision to make Andhra Pradesh a leader in drone technology, Naidu revealed plans to allocate 300 acres of land in Orvakal, Kurnool District, for a dedicated drone hub. This initiative aims to make Andhra Pradesh the top destination for drone manufacturing, innovation, and research.In addition to developing the drone hub, Naidu also outlined an ambitious plan to train 35,000 drone pilots to meet the growing demand for skilled professionals in this industry. \u201cDrones will play a crucial role in agriculture, healthcare, traffic management, and even disaster relief,\u201d Naidu said, pointing to the use of drones during the recent floods in Vijayawada, where they delivered food and water to stranded people.During the two-day summit, Naidu promised that within 15 days, the state government would release a comprehensive drone policy designed to attract drone manufacturers and create a business-friendly environment for innovators. This policy will make Andhra Pradesh a testing ground for drone applications, with successful pilot projects set to expand across the state and the country.He assured that drones would be used extensively in police work for surveillance and monitoring, especially to keep an eye on criminal activities.Reflecting on his role in driving India\u2019s IT revolution in the 1990s, Naidu shared how his initiatives, such as launching Hyderabad's HiTech City through a public-private partnership, helped establish the city as a major technology hub. He credited his collaboration with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for opening up India\u2019s telecom sector, which paved the way for the country\u2019s mobile technology boom. \u201cBack then, we brought global tech giants like Microsoft to India, and now, we\u2019re doing the same with drones,\u201d Naidu said.The Chief Minister praised the current leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating, \u201cIndia is on track to becoming the third-largest economy by 2047 under Modi's leadership, and with initiatives like JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) and Ayushman Bharat, we\u2019ve strengthened the country\u2019s digital and healthcare infrastructure.\u201dPublished By: Deepthi Published On: Oct 24, 2024Trending Reel",

Andhra Pradesh Minister Nara Lokesh was quick to jump on this, and extended an \"invitation\" to all multinational companies (MNC) in Bengaluru to shift to his state.Nara Lokesh's response came to a tweet by Pai, also known to be a vocal critic of civic issues in Karnataka, in which he claimed that several MNCs in Bengaluru were being forced to consider expanding their operations out of the state capital due to severe infrastructure issues.He said the Karnataka Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister were not fulfilling their promises, leading to a fall in trust among Bengaluru residents.\"Never seen this kind of anger and pain in the last 20 years. Very sad at the misgovernance of the city. False promises, lack of action. Sad day for all of us to have such a non-performing, callous, indifferent govt which treats its own citizens so badly,\" Pai added. Responding to the tweet, Nara Lokesh said on Thursday that he \"would like to extend an invitation to all MNCs to Andhra Pradesh\", where Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has introduced new, business-friendly policies.\"We view industries as vital stakeholders in our state\u2019s welfare and growth. We are ready to offer world-class infrastructure and an exceptional business ecosystem, ensuring both ease and speed of doing business,\" he tweeted. Record-breaking rain in Bengaluru due to the unprecedented has led to flooding in tech parks, forcing companies to adopt work-from-home policies. The heavy downpour has also led to severe traffic jams and water entering offices and homes.In an effort to tackle Bengaluru's infrastructure issues, the Karnataka government on Wednesday announced the formation of a high-level committee to provide long-term solutions to the flooding and traffic issues plaguing the city\u2019s tech hubs.The committee will be chaired by Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar and vice-chaired by state Minister Priyank Kharge.On Wednesday night, thousands of commuters were forced to abandon their vehicles on the Electronic City flyover in Bengaluru due to a massive traffic jam caused by heavy flooding.After being stuck for more than three hours, the commuters chose to walk home. A video doing the rounds on social media captured the chaos, showing people getting off their vehicles and walking.Published By: Karishma Saurabh KalitaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024",

The prosecution had alleged that the accused had instigated the survivor, a student of class seven, to accompany him to Ooty, where he subsequently raped her. The accused was arrested after the girl\u2019s family traced her to Ooty and reported her missing. The Sessions Court, in 2016, convicted him under Section 376 IPC, sentencing him to seven years imprisonment. This decision was challenged by the accused before the High Court.\nThe court, presided over by Justice CS Sudha, clarified that the court in no way justifies the act committed by the accused, however, considering the circumstances of the case, it stated that \u201cIn criminal jurisprudence the concept of punishment has evolved from a retributive approach to a reformative approach. The facts and circumstances of the case call for a lenient approach to be taken against A1 (accused), who was just 19 years old at the time of the incident.\u201d\nDuring the trial, it was also revealed that the survivor had admitted to voluntarily accompanying the accused to Ooty with the intention of getting married, despite her father\u2019s opposition to the relationship. The trial court had acquitted the accused under Section 366A IPC, finding no evidence of compulsion or deceit. The High Court, therefore, noted, \u201cThis is not a case where A1, by deceit or fraud, enticed PW2 out of her lawful guardianship.\u201d\nHowever, the court reiterated that the survivor\u2019s age rendered her consent invalid, citing that she was a minor at the time of the incident. The court observed that the survivor, who had turned 17 by the time of her examination before the trial court, had sent letters to the accused expressing her continued desire to be with him. \u201cThere is no case for PW2 that she was forced or seduced into having illicit intercourse with another person. Her testimony shows that she had voluntarily joined A1,\u201d the court remarked.\nThe court invoked the proviso to Section 376(1) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which, prior to its amendment in 2013, allowed courts to impose a lesser sentence than the prescribed minimum of seven years if there were \u201cadequate and special reasons,\u201d highlighting that \u201cThe legislature itself contemplated such a situation and hence the reason why such a proviso was brought into the statute despite a minimum sentence of seven years being prescribed.\u201d\nReferencing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Sukhwinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2000), where it was established that when the survivor herself is a consenting party, proviso to Section 376 of IPC cannot be overlooked. The High Court concluded that \u201cfacts and circumstances of the case made out an adequate and special reason to invoke the proviso,\u201d particularly given the age of the accused and his expression of remorse.\nAs a result, the court modified the sentence imposed by the trial court and reduced it to a period of simple imprisonment for one year.",

He then capitalised on width from Bumrah\u2019s deliveries by punching off the backfoot and opening the face of the bat late to get back-to-back boundaries.\r\n\r\nFrom the other end, Rachin Ravindra began to find his groove by using Bumrah\u2019s pace to run through the gap between slip and gully for four. Conway continued to be impressive with his drive and reverse sweeps, before poking at a short on a spinning away ball from Ashwin, with the edge caught by Rishabh Pant.\r\n\r\nRavindra took over the run-scoring mantle by lofting Ravindra Jadeja for six, before beautifully flicking Akash Deep for four more. After getting his fifty with a stylish flick going through the hands of short mid-wicket for four, Ravindra had two more boundaries coming off Akash via cut and outside edge.\r\n\r\nThe 59-run stand for the fourth wicket between Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell was brought to a halt by Washington, who turned the tide for India at the fag end of the second session with his dip and drift. Washington got a tossed-up delivery to turn away sharply from the middle stump and hit the top of the off-stump.\r\n\r\nOn outclassing Ravindra with a peach of a delivery, Washington leapt highly in the air. At the stroke of tea, Washington again brought joy to himself and the Indian team by getting a length ball to grip and turn sharply into Tom Blundell, who aimed for a flick but was castled through the gate. Big wickets from Washington in the last 10 minutes of the second session mean India have set themselves a chance to bowl out New Zealand in the final period of the day.\r\n\r\nBrief scores: New Zealand 201/5 in 62 overs (Devon Conway 76, Rachin Ravindra 66; Ravichandran Ashwin 3-48, Washington Sundar 2-34) against India.",

        "text": "Lucknow, Oct 24 (KNN) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced on Wednesday that the state\u2019s economy is set to reach Rs 32 lakh crore by March 2025, positioning it as a vital contributor to India\u2019s USD 5 trillion economy goal.\n\nSpeaking at a function organised by Business Standard, the Chief Minister emphasised that UP's economy, currently at Rs 26 lakh crore, has seen unprecedented growth from Rs 12 lakh crore during previous administrations.\n\nCalling Uttar Pradesh the \u201cfastest-growing economy,\u201d Adityanath projected the creation of employment for 1.5 crore youth through investments and policy reforms. \u201cToday, we have received investment proposals worth Rs 40 lakh crore, compared to the earlier achievement threshold of Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis transformation is due to robust economic policies and strict action against criminal elements,\u201d he stated, crediting the state's crackdown on land mafia and improved law enforcement.\n\nAdityanath highlighted the \"One District, One Product\" (ODOP) initiative, which replaced what he referred to as the previous \u201cOne District, One Mafia\u201d policy. He added that 75 districts have secured 75 Geographical Indication (GI) tags, with Varanasi leading the effort.\n\nKey economic hubs like Moradabad, Bhadohi, and Meerut were cited for their export success. \u201cMoradabad now exports goods worth Rs 16,000 crore, while Bhadohi's carpets have touched Rs 8,000 crore in exports,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Chief Minister also underscored the government\u2019s initiatives to develop UP as a logistics hub. He mentioned the operational multimodal terminal in Varanasi, a logistics hub planned in Gautam Buddha Nagar, and significant expressway projects.\n\n\u201cWe have completed the Purvanchal and Bundelkhand Expressways, and the Ganga Expressway\u2019s main carriageway will be ready by year-end,\u201d he said. Other infrastructure developments include the Delhi-Meerut 12-lane expressway and metro rail projects in six cities.\n\nOn the security front, Adityanath highlighted reforms within the police force, with 1.54 lakh personnel recruited and advanced technologies integrated.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s law enforcement is now equipped to instill fear in wrongdoers, unlike earlier times when criminals had police backing,\u201d he remarked. The creation of the Anti-Land Mafia Task Force has reclaimed 64,000 acres of illegally occupied land.\n\nHe concluded by linking commerce, agriculture, and business growth, drawing on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, and praised central initiatives like the Vishwakarma Yojana for complementing the state\u2019s ODOP scheme in generating employment and attracting investments.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

It also has the MNS headquarters. \n\nThe iconic Shivaji Park ground is also located in nearby Dadar where both the MNS and Sena (UBT) hold their annual Padwa and Dussehra rallies, respectively. \n\nThe constituency has always been with the undivided Shiv Sena or the MNS since 1990. \n\nIn 2009, MNS candidate Nitin Sardesai won from Mahim. \n\nElections to the 288-member State Assembly will be held on November 20 and votes will be counted on November 23.",

Meta\u2019s generative AI, including its open-source Llama technology, will support the development of e-governance solutions to streamline processes, improve transparency, and reduce document tampering risks.Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh emphasised that this collaboration aligns with the state's vision of making governance user-friendly and accessible to all. Meta India\u2019s Vice President Sandhya Devanathan added that the partnership will democratise access to AI models and facilitate smoother governance through digital innovations.This MoU is part of Andhra Pradesh\u2019s larger digital transformation initiative, aiming to provide 100 key government services through WhatsApp by November 2024. The collaboration hopes to improve public services across multiple domains, including land records, civil supplies, education, and transportation, benefiting millions of citizens.This comes only a few days after Nara Lokesh announced that, within the next 100 days, the state will implement a \u2018digital twin\u2019 for every cabinet minister.

The two-term former US president who has visited India twice before, had also mentioned how Mahatma Gandhi has inspired him and that his fascination with India has also largely been around the Independence icon, his writings, and how his thoughts resonated Obama\u2019s deepest instincts as well.\nIn his book A Promised Land, Obama speaks of Gandhi and how his \u201csuccessful non-violent campaign against British rule became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups\u201d.\nKarnataka minister of law HK Patil said that this special invitation is expected to be sent soon and the state government is hopeful that Obama, who called Mahatma Gandhi the leader of the world, will accept it.\n\u201cThe CM will be writing to Obama this week and the former President\u2019s office has already been informed previously of the Karnataka government\u2019s wish to extend this invitation to him,\u201d confirmed a source in the chief minister\u2019s office.\nThis special celebration was announced by Siddaramaiah in the Budget 2024-25 and an allocation of Rs 2 crore has been set aside for it.\nThe centenary event in Belagavi commemorates Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s leadership at the 39th session of the Indian National Congress in 1924, the only time he presided over a Congress session. It was during this session that Gandhi laid out the strategy for India\u2019s independence from British rule.\nThe session, held from December 26-28, 1924, was organised under the leadership of Gangadhar Rao Deshpande, known as the Lion of Karnataka. Gandhi emphasised non-violence, non-cooperation, satyagraha, and civil disobedience as the key strategies for achieving independence.\nThe event in 1924 was held in an open field on the outskirts of Belagavi, now called Congress Road, and saw over 75,000 participants from across India who landed in this border area between Karnataka and Goa to pledge their unity against the British Raj.\nThe session saw stalwarts of the Indian freedom movement such as Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Morarji Desai, C Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya among others in attendance.\nAs part of the centenary celebrations, minister Patil outlined plans for a series of events, including a photo exhibition, a year-long display of historical artefacts, the installation of a memorial pillar, and several other commemorative programmes.\nPatil also emphasised that the focus will be on rural development and Gandhian Swaraj principles. The celebrations will also feature a comprehensive documentary on the 1924 Congress session, discounts on khadi clothing, the publication and distribution of a mini booklet to raise public awareness, and a photographic exhibition from the historic session. Additionally, a group of Gandhians is organising a Charkha Marathon as part of the celebrations.",

        "text": "Colombo, Oct 24 (IANS) Sri Lankan Foreign and Public Security Minister Vijitha Herath revealed on Thursday that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the security threats to Israeli nationals in the Arugam Bay area of the island nation\u2019s Eastern Province.\n\nThe action follows after several countries have issued travel alerts over the past 24 hours considering intelligence information received about a possible terror attack targeting foreigners, especially Israelis, across popular tourist locations in coastal Sri Lanka.\n\nSome reports cited that the intelligence has been provided by India, like it was also reportedly done before the horrific 2019 Easter Sunday bombings which the Lankan security agencies had failed to act on in time.\n\nThe suspects, all Sri Lankan nationals, caught on Thursday are currently being questioned regarding the incident, Herath said at a special media briefing.\n\n\u201cMinister Herath said Sri Lankan authorities received intelligence information from foreign intelligence services about a potential attack on Israeli nationals earlier this month. He said that similar information had also been received by the authorities during the previous government,\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s Daily Mirror reported.\n\nHe asserted that the new government didn\u2019t inform the public until the information was confirmed, but took security measures as soon as the information was received.\n\nHerath also urged the public not to fall victim to misleading reports and assured that comprehensive security measures are in place to protect tourists.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States issued a security alert, strongly advising US citizens of a potential attack on tourist locations in a coastal area of Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cThe Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area. Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice. US citizens are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice,\u201d stated the US Embassy in Colombo.\n\nSimilarly, Israel\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) called on Israeli citizens to immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe NSC said that it has raised the travel alert level for Sri Lanka due to \u201ccredible terrorism threats\u201d at the tourist and coastal areas.\n\n\u201cThe travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4. We recommend leaving these areas immediately. For those currently in these areas, we recommend leaving the country or at least traveling to the capital city Colombo, where there is a heavier presence of local security forces,\u201d the NSC alert detailed.\n\n\u201cFor the rest of Sri Lanka, the travel warning has been raised to level 3, and we recommend that Israelis planning to travel to Sri Lanka delay any non-necessary trips to the country. If you do travel to Sri Lanka, avoid the areas for which level-4 travel alerts have been issued,\u201d it added.\n\nAustralia too asked its citizens in Sri Lanka to \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and tourists, including in regional and coastal towns. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions,\u201d it mentioned.\n\nLankan Daily \u2018The Daily Mirror\u2019 revealed that a building in Arugam Bay, which had been converted into a \u2018Chabad House\u2019 by the Israeli nationals could have been a potential target.\n\n\u201cThe elite STF officers had taken control of the security situation and continue to be stationed to date. It was learnt that STF had also kept bomb squads standby for any emergency,\u201d it reported on Wednesday.\n\nSri Lanka remains on high alert even as it continues to investigate the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks carried out by the ISIS-backed suicide bombers that killed 270 people, including 45 foreign nationals and injured over 500.\n\nIn June, former Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe had appointed a Committee of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the actions taken by Lankan intelligence services on the prior information received from their Indian counterparts regarding the Easter Sunday bombings.\n\nWeeks before the coordinated bomb attacks on three churches and several hotels, the Indian intelligence agencies had reportedly alerted their Lankan counterparts about the Islamic State\u2019s plan to carry out such suicide missions.\n\nLast month, the country\u2019s newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had promised to thoroughly investigate the entire episode.",

Operating from the DEO office in Vadodara, the committee oversees fee-related decisions for private schools in seven districts: Vadodara, Anand, Kheda, Dahod, Mahisagar, Panchmahal, and Chhota Udepur. \n\nHowever, the Vadodara Parents\u2019 Association allegations previously claimed that the FRC has been lax in enforcing fee regulations.\n\nIn its recent decision, the FRC approved a 5 per cent increase for 76 schools, which has sparked optimism among school operators still in line for similar fee hikes. \n\nThe approvals are broken down as follows: 25 schools in Vadodara, 0 in Anand, 12 in Kheda, 6 in Dahod, 7 in Mahisagar, 24 in Panchmahal, and 2 in Chhota Udepur, highlighting Vadodara\u2019s position as having the most private schools awaiting fee hike approvals.\n\nLooking ahead, sources indicate that once the provisional fees are determined, school administrators can file appeals before the final fee structure is confirmed. It is common for schools to request increases greater than 5 per cent, leaving it to be seen which institutions will proceed with appeals in the coming days.\n\nGujarat has over 32,000 government primary schools, alongside the establishment of 84 model schools aimed at enhancing educational quality in the state. As of December 2023, only one teacher was staffed 1,606 of these government primary schools. \n\nIn response to the ongoing teacher shortage, the Gujarat government has implemented various measures, including appointing contractual teachers and organising teacher transfer camps to allocate teaching resources better.\n\nInitiated in 2014, the model schools in Gujarat aim to provide high-quality education within the government school system. Currently, 84 model schools across the state cater to upper primary, secondary, and higher secondary classes.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Nearly 93 per cent respondents in a survey have favoured making public spaces completely smoke-free while 97 per cent have pitched for declaring airports completely smoke-free, similar to railway stations. A recent poll conducted by the citizen-led initiative \"Tobacco Free India\", which garnered more than 65,000 responses, highlights the growing concern among Indians about the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.The survey has revealed that an astounding 92.72 per cent respondents are in favour of making public spaces completely smoke-free. Conducted in both Hindi and English, the poll included six key questions about smoke-free public places and the health risks associated with second-hand smoke. Across all questions, the majority supported stricter measures to protect women, children and other vulnerable groups from exposure to toxic tobacco smoke in public areas, such as restaurants, hotels and airports.\"While the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003 bans smoking in public places, it still permits designated smoking areas in airports, hotels with 30 or more rooms and restaurants with seating capacities above 30,\" said Dr Uma Kumar, head of the rheumatology department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here.\"This situation continues to pose a significant public health threat. Scientific evidence has unequivocally demonstrated that second-hand smoke can easily penetrate these designated areas, exposing non-smokers to harmful toxins and increasing their risk of various diseases,\" she said.The poll was conducted between October 2 and October 19 on X, involving 65,272 participants. While India has made significant strides in tobacco control -- strictly prohibiting smoking on trains, platforms and station premises as well as banning carrying or sale of tobacco products in railway campuses -- the continued presence of smoking areas in airports remains a concern, said international wrestler Sangram Singh.\"These designated areas, often placed in prominent and attractive locations, seem to invite people to smoke. The presence of smoking zones in places like airports often sends an inviting message to smoke, undermining public health efforts,\" emphasised Singh, a \"Fit India\" brand ambassador.\"The overwhelming support for smoke-free public places demonstrates a growing awareness among Indians about the dangers of second-hand smoke. It is a powerful message that reflects our nation's commitment to protecting public health,\" Kumar said.Dr Colonel Shekhar Kashyap, a renowned cardiologist, said, \"Nicotine is a highly-dangerous and addictive substance that poses serious risks to cardiovascular health and overall well-being. Consumed first hand or second hand, nicotine is equally harmful and can lead to a range of debilitating diseases.\"Launched on October 2, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of India's smoke-free rules, the poll comes at a pivotal time. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has proposed amendments to the COTPA to remove smoking zones altogether -- a move strongly supported by the public, as evidenced by the poll results.These efforts align with the ministry's ongoing countrywide Tobacco-Free Youth Campaign 2.0, which aims at protecting young Indians from the hazards of tobacco. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 13 lakh Indians die each year due to tobacco-related diseases, making it a major public health crisis.The poll also highlighted the particular vulnerability of women and children to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Many respondents expressed concern about the impact of smoke-free environments on the health and well-being of these vulnerable groups.Second-hand smoke imposes a significant economic burden on India. A recent study published in the Journal of Nicotine and Tobacco Research revealed that second-hand smoke causes healthcare costs of Rs 567 billion annually, accounting for 8 per cent of total annual healthcare expenditures.This figure, coupled with the staggering Rs 1,773.4 billion in annual economic losses due to tobacco use, underscores the urgent need for effective tobacco-control measures, including comprehensive smoke-free policies. Beyond cigarette smoking, the use of smokeless tobacco products remains a significant public health challenge in India. These products, which include chewing tobacco, gutkha and pan masala, pose serious health risks and contribute to a range of diseases, including oral cancer, heart diseases and digestive disorders.",

        "title": "Opinion: India At BRICS And The Curious Case Of Iran",
        "text": "All eyes have been on Iran for more than a year. Naturally, the first BRICS summit with Tehran's membership is bound to breed speculation about what the prospective new world order would look like. At home, there needs to be an examination of India's bilateral ties with a country that is seen firmly anti-West in its outlook. \n\nIran and India are sailing in the same boat, at least momentarily: of the West's castigation. The temptation may be high on both sides to form a joint front against Western hegemony in the security space. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held bilateral talks with the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, with a focus on strategic cooperation in and beyond the Middle East.\n\nGlobal Groupings vs Realpolitik\n\nIt can be endlessly debated without inching anywhere close to a resolution whether multilateral global groupings make any difference to realpolitik either domestically or internationally. The signalling, however, remains crucial. To begin with, the West is already perceiving the summit as Russia's show of strength. Headlines like 'Putin Gathers Allies' and 'Putin Hosts Global South Leaders at BRICS Summit Meant to Counterbalance Western Clout' in Western media outlets expose apprehension. \n\nA complex interplay of sectarian interests and regional dynamics shapes Iran's geopolitical strategy. It is in the direct line of fire, thanks to Israel's unchecked belligerence. Already reeling under economic pressure owing to the UN sanctions of 2011, the post-October 7 reality for Tehran is even grimmer. Iran blames the US for almost all of its problems. As such, during the last summit, former president Ebrahim Raisi had anointed Iran's proposed BRICS membership as one of the ways of getting even with the US and the West at large. \u201cIran's membership in the bloc is opposition to American unilateralism.\u201d\n\nIndia Needs To Defines Its Position\n\nRussia and China share this sentiment of BRICS emerging as a counterbalance to the West. But what about India? India has lauded and endorsed Iran's presence in BRICS, but will New Delhi also endorse Tehran's oppressive domestic policies in the name of this cooperative alliance? \n\nIndia has not stopped buying oil from Iran despite the sanctions and disapproving remarks from the West. Yet, bilateral trade between the two countries has dropped by 26% in one year. Geoeconomics informs Iranian perceptions of the bloc as a critical driver. Iran aims to secure increased volumes of oil and non-oil exports to fellow BRICS members, bypassing the dollar. \n\nLike Russia, Iran is engaged in a high-stakes battle with the West. China doesn't particularly enjoy a friendly status, either. New Delhi's balancing act, therefore, is set to be tested on many tricky issues in the near future, including the Israel-Palestine issue. \n\nIndia has been an outlier in a manner. At the last UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for the end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, India was the only founding BRICS country to abstain, along with the newcomer Ethiopia. \n\nDuring the Modi-Pezeshkian bilateral, India was urged to play a more substantial role in the Middle East peace process. But what are New Delhi's realistic options? Calling for peace does not usher in peace; arm-twisting the stakeholders does. \n\nA Sticky Question For New Delhi\n\nAny BRICS decision mandates unanimous agreement. In that sense, it is even trickier than the domestic coalition politics that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has found itself in the midst of after a decade. What will, for example, be India's stand should Iran want a revival of its nuclear plan? India's past tussles with the West over its own nuclear programme may trigger another round of strategic unpleasantness over New Delhi's stance.\n\nIndia has a long-standing policy of strategic autonomy, and the complexity of its relations with the West is par for the course. The question is only of degree. The scope of India's support to its alliance partners in any overtures, real or perceived, against the West needs to be clearly defined, if not announced. While BRICS has achieved precious little in tangible terms in the past 15 years, the symbolism of grouping may have consequences for India as ongoing conflicts stretch into the future and new challenges around them emerge.\n\nOn the other hand, the internal dynamics of the expanded BRICS are going to pose another challenge. BRICS, only a little more than an ad hoc grouping with diverse challenges and interests, has miles to go to emerge as a counterforce to alliances like the G7 or the Five Eyes, where members have been able to thrash out at least a common minimum programme. \n\n(Nishtha Gautam is a Delhi-based author and academic.)\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author",

        "text": "Colombo: Sri Lankan Foreign and Public Security Minister Vijitha Herath revealed on Thursday that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the security threats to Israeli nationals in the Arugam Bay area of the island nation's Eastern Province.\r\n\r\nThe action follows after several countries have issued travel alerts over the past 24 hours considering intelligence information received about a possible terror attack targeting foreigners, especially Israelis, across popular tourist locations in coastal Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nSome reports cited that the intelligence has been provided by India, like it was also reportedly done before the horrific 2019 Easter Sunday bombings which the Lankan security agencies had failed to act on in time.\r\n\r\nThe suspects, all Sri Lankan nationals, caught on Thursday are currently being questioned regarding the incident, Herath said at a special media briefing.\r\n\r\n\"Minister Herath said Sri Lankan authorities received intelligence information from foreign intelligence services about a potential attack on Israeli nationals earlier this month. He said that similar information had also been received by the authorities during the previous government,\" Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror reported.\r\n\r\nHe asserted that the new government didn't inform the public until the information was confirmed, but took security measures as soon as the information was received.\r\n\r\nHerath also urged the public not to fall victim to misleading reports and assured that comprehensive security measures are in place to protect tourists.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the United States issued a security alert, strongly advising US citizens of a potential attack on tourist locations in a coastal area of Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\n\"The Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area. Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice. US citizens are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice,\" stated the US Embassy in Colombo.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Israel's National Security Council (NSC) called on Israeli citizens to immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nThe NSC said that it has raised the travel alert level for Sri Lanka due to \"credible terrorism threats\" at the tourist and coastal areas.\r\n\r\n\"The travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4. We recommend leaving these areas immediately. For those currently in these areas, we recommend leaving the country or at least traveling to the capital city Colombo, where there is a heavier presence of local security forces,\" the NSC alert detailed.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest of Sri Lanka, the travel warning has been raised to level 3, and we recommend that Israelis planning to travel to Sri Lanka delay any non-necessary trips to the country. If you do travel to Sri Lanka, avoid the areas for which level-4 travel alerts have been issued,\" it added.\r\n\r\nAustralia too asked its citizens in Sri Lanka to \"exercise a high degree of caution\".\r\n\r\n\"There is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and tourists, including in regional and coastal towns. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions,\" it mentioned.\r\n\r\nLankan Daily 'The Daily Mirror' revealed that a building in Arugam Bay, which had been converted into a 'Chabad House' by the Israeli nationals could have been a potential target.\r\n\r\n\"The elite STF officers had taken control of the security situation and continue to be stationed to date. It was learnt that STF had also kept bomb squads standby for any emergency,\" it reported on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nSri Lanka remains on high alert even as it continues to investigate the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks carried out by the ISIS-backed suicide bombers that killed 270 people, including 45 foreign nationals and injured over 500.\r\n\r\nIn June, former Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe had appointed a Committee of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the actions taken by Lankan intelligence services on the prior information received from their Indian counterparts regarding the Easter Sunday bombings.\r\n\r\nWeeks before the coordinated bomb attacks on three churches and several hotels, the Indian intelligence agencies had reportedly alerted their Lankan counterparts about the Islamic State's plan to carry out such suicide missions.\r\n\r\nLast month, the country's newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had promised to thoroughly investigate the entire episode.",

This JCW version is based on the same Cooper that was launched in India earlier this year in July. The British brand also revealed the JCW Electric with 258 hp and the JCW Aceman at the Paris Motor Show, which took place a few weeks ago.\n\nMechanical Updates\n\nThe petrol-powered JCW versions are equipped with the same potent 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder turbo petrol engine that delivers 228 hp and 380 Nm of peak torque. This offers 27 hp more power and 80 Nm higher torque than the Cooper S sold in India. All this power is sent to the front wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nThe John Cooper Works claims a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 6.1 seconds for the hatchback, while the heavier convertible variant achieves it in 6.4 seconds. The top speed for the hatchback is rated at 250 km/h, with the convertible capable of 245 km/h.\n\nVisual Updates\n\nCosmetic updates to the Mini John Cooper Works include JCW badging on the grille, centrally mounted exhaust unit, a blacked-out rear diffuser, JCW-branded red brake callipers, and 17-inch JCW alloy wheels. There are also optional 18-inch two-tone spoke alloy wheels available.\n\nThe interior features black synthetic leather upholstery with knitted red accents. The dashboard has a knitted surface with a chequered flag pattern. The pedals are finished in stainless steel, and the steering wheel features JCW branding with bespoke fabric trim.\n\nIt is priced between Rs 42.43 lakh and Rs 49.5 lakh (converted from Euro) in Europe.

Nataraj, representing the UP government, said that demolition was carried out to remove encroachments on footpaths and the plea was filed by a third-party organisation on the basis of newspaper reports.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in an interim order passed on September 17, directed that no demolition will take place anywhere across the country except without its permission after several petitions were filed before the apex court alleging that bulldozer action was taken by various state authorities without sufficient notice. However, the top court clarified that its \u201corder would not be applicable if there is an unauthorised structure in any public place such as road, street, footpath, abutting railway line or any river body or water bodies and also to cases where there is an order for demolition made by a court\u201d.\n\nLast week, the top court refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking direction to recover from administrative authorities the costs of bulldozed houses of individuals accused of criminal activities, riots, or other offences.

He emphasised that agreements, once reached, should be followed to the letter. \u201cPrime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception,\u201d Jaishankar said.The minister\u2019s remark comes just days after India and China made a major breakthrough over the border row and reached an agreement to end a four-year-long military standoff in eastern Ladakh. The deal marks a return to patrolling agreements that were in place before the 2020 Galwan clash. The disengagement agreement came after 17 rounds of working mechanism meetings and 21 rounds of military dialogue. The agreement also set the stage for the first bilateral talks between PM Modi and China\u2019s Xi Jinping in five years. PM Modi welcomed the border agreement and said that India-China ties were important for global peace and stability. \u201cMutual trust, respect and sensitivity will guide bilateral relations,\u201d PM Modi said during the delegation-level talks on the sidelines of Brics Summit.At the Brics Summit, PM Modi reiterated India's stance on resolving global conflicts, emphasising that this is not an era of war. The Prime Minister\u2019s peace message came at a time when Russia is at war with Ukraine while Isreal has declared war on Hamas and is in conflict with Iran-backed proxies. Addressing the Brics Outreach session, Jaishankar stressed that there should be zero tolerance for terrorism. He also discussed the escalating situation in West Asia and expressed concern over the potential for the conflict to spread further in the region. \u201cThe situation in the Middle East, West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected. The human and material consequences of further escalation are truly serious. Any approach has to be fair and durable, leading to a two-state solution,\" Jaishankar said.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024Tune InMust Watch",

        "title": "Ahead Of UP Bypolls, Akhilesh Posts Pic With Rahul: 'Will Save Constitution, Reservation, Harmony'",
        "text": "A day after facing flak over its defeat in the Haryana elections - a loss partly attributed to not sharing seats with its state allies - Congress has decided not to contest any of the nine Uttar Pradesh Assembly bypolls scheduled for next month.The party had initially requested to contest at least five seats, including Milkipur in Ayodhya district, which it hasnt won since 1989.Instead, the Samajwadi Party (SP), a member of the Congress-led INDIA bloc, will field candidates for all nine seats, with each candidate standing against the ruling BJP as INDIA bloc nominees.We have decided to save the Constitution... reservation... and harmony. We have decided to build the country as envisioned by Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi) - Babasaheb (Ambedkar) - Lohia (Ram Manohar, an iconic freedom fighter and socialist leader), Akhilesh Yadav posted on X.In his Hindi post, the former UP Chief Minister also shared a photograph of himself standing alongside Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, their hands clasped and raised in victory.Yadav said that the alliance was not based on seat-sharing calculations but on the necessity of cutting into BJPs lead in the UP Assembly.With this unprecedented cooperation, every worker of the INDIA bloc is filled with new energy and the resolve to win all nine Assembly seats, he said.SP-Congress AgreementNews of this Congress-SP alliance followed a prolonged disagreement between the two parties, as the Congress was reportedly pushing to contest at least five seats, while the SP was hesitant to concede more than two, given Congress poor performance in recent Assembly and general elections in the state.In the 2022 Assembly elections, the BJP won 255 seats, while the Samajwadi Party secured 111.The Congress only managed to win two seats - Rampur Khas and Pharenda.The SP also won in the April-June general election in the state, taking 37 of the 80 seats, with the BJP winning 33 and the Congress reclaiming six, including their traditional stronghold of Amethi from Smriti Irani.The Congress position was further weakened after the Haryana and Jammu Kashmir election results, where the party faced criticism from its INDIA bloc partners for failing to cooperate with the SP in Haryana. A day after the election results, the SP announced candidates for six of the nine seats, effectively denying the Congress its request for five.Congress Strategy in Maharashtra?According to sources, standing down in Uttar Pradesh was not what the Congress wanted, but the backlash after the Haryana defeat left the party with limited options.There are suggestions that by conceding in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress could be positioning itself strategically to resist the Samajwadi Partys demand for 12 seats in the upcoming Maharashtra elections.The Congress, reluctant to oblige the SP in Maharashtra, believes that allowing the SP to dominate in Uttar Pradesh could strengthen its argument against conceding seats in Maharashtra, particularly since the Congress performed well there in the general elections, winning 13 seats to become the largest single party.In Maharashtra, the Congress has now reached a seat-sharing agreement with the Shiv Sena and NCP factions led by Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Each party will contest 85 seats.The remaining 33 seats will be allocated to smaller parties, with the SP expected to be among them.Symbol Not Important: CongressSurendra Rajput, a senior Congress leader, told ANI that the decision to step aside in Uttar Pradesh was driven by the need to defeat the BJP.INDIA is contesting all nine seats. For us, the symbol is not important... for us, ending the BJPs misgovernance is important... he said.He also referenced Akhilesh Yadavs big-heartedness in Haryana - a nod to the SP leader not, at least publicly, pressing for a seat-sharing deal in that election.Yadav rounded off the joint appeal by saying that his partys strength had increased manifold with the support of the Congress top leadership and booth-level workers.BJPs ResponseRakesh Tripathi, a spokesperson for the BJPs state unit, claimed that the Samajwadi Party was exacting revenge for the Haryana and Madhya Pradesh elections, where the Congress ignored its allys requests for seat-sharing; the Congress was soundly defeated by the BJP in both states.Tripathi also used a wrestling analogy, saying the Congress had been thrown and pinned to the mat.He further claimed that the INDIA alliance has been broken into pieces and that the SP is making the BJPs Congress-mukt Bharat (Congress-free India) slogan a reality.Uttar Pradesh By-election DatesVoting for the nine by-elections will take place on 13 November, with the results announced on 23 November.A by-election for a tenth seat - Milkipur in Ayodhya district - will be held at a later date.",

They made Congress candidate Rahul Gandhi win the elections first. Then, for 5 years he didn\u2019t do any work for the people. Despite that, he won again but he (Rahul Gandhi) left them.

Sadly, that opportunity was not afforded to me, leaving both my children and me completely blindsided by this announcement.

Medical University in Chennai. A total of 35,793 candidates, both in-person and in-absentia, were awarded post-doctoral, doctoral, postgraduate, undergraduate degrees and diplomas under the faculties of medical, dental, AYUSH, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and allied health science courses. \n\nSpeaking at the function, Vivek Lal, Director, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, stressed the importance of commitment in medical practice. \u201cThis degree is the result of a big asset that all of you have. That is the commitment. It comes before equipment. Medicine is all about committed healthcare professionals. Equipment and technology do play a part. But if you want to exploit technology, you have to be committed.\u201d \n\nHe said Indian doctors and health care professionals are the best in the world. \u201cIn the United States, the second largest [health] caregivers to US citizens are Indians\u2026Our health care professionals and doctors are a class apart.\u201d Because of doctors\u2019 commitment, the country was able to bounce back from COVID-19, even though India has a rudimentary infrastructure compared to Western countries, he said.\n\n\u201cIn our ecosystem, our patients think of us [doctors] as Gods. Not so in the West. They think if a doctor cures a patient, it is his duty. The relationship between a doctor and a patient is through insurance and everything ends there. In India, if a doctor cures a patient, he becomes a family member of that patient.\u201d \n\nK. Narayanasamy, Vice-Chancellor of The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R.

        "text": "SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch skipped a Parliament's Public Accounts Committee meeting on Thursday, prompting panel head KC Venugopal to postpone the sitting, with NDA members accusing him of taking unilateral decisions and lodging a protest with the Lok Sabha Speaker.\n\nMr Venugopal told reporters that the committee received a communication from Ms Buch at 9.30 am that she and her team will not be able to appear before the panel due to \"exigencies\".\n\nHe indicated his disapproval of her decision noting that Ms Buch had confirmed her presence after her earlier request for an exemption was denied.\n\n\"Considering a woman's request, we thought it better to postpone today's meeting for another day,\" Mr Venugopal said as he along with other Opposition members left the venue minutes after the meeting began amid sharp exchanges between the ruling alliance and INDIA bloc MPs.\n\nAn Opposition member alleged that Ms Buch informing the committee about her decision with less than two hours to go for the meeting to begin virtually amounts to contempt of the parliamentary panel.\n\nBJP members accused Mr Venugopal, a senior Congress leader, of not letting them put across their views. They later charged him with acting in a \"suo motu\" manner, suggesting that his decision to summon Ms Buch and even some other regulatory bodies established by the acts of parliament was his own and guided by partisan politics.\n\nPAC member and BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters that many standing committees review the performance of various bodies e.g. the panel on finance scrutinises the work of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe Communication and Information Technology panel scrutinises the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, he added.\n\n\"Your (Mr Venugopal) own words are suo motu. How did you decide? The PAC's job is to consider CAG reports. We have this information from reliable sources that the CAG has made no mention of SEBI. This entire conduct is unparliamentary. The conduct of the chairperson in the way he adjourned, did not allow us to speak. And (he) walked out (which) shows he has extraneous political considerations,\" Mr Prasad said.\n\nThe former Union law minister said the ruling National Democratic Alliance was in a majority.\n\n\"Our main objection was how did he (Mr Venugopal) make suo motu selection of subjects without consulting other members? Nobody had an inkling of the list that was prepared,\" said Mr Prasad, flanked by other NDA members of the panel.\n\nHe also objected to the PAC secretariat officials leaving the venue after Mr Venugopal adjourned the meeting when many other members remained inside. The NDA members met Speaker Om Birla later to register their protest against Mr Venugopal.\n\nUS short seller Hindenburg Research's accusation of conflict of interest against Ms Buch over the SEBI's probe into the short-seller's allegations against the Adani Group was seized upon by the Congress to seek her ouster and to attack the government, giving political dimensions to the panel's missive to her to appear before it.\n\nPAC member and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to Speaker Om Birla last month against Mr Venugopal, accusing the Congress leader of raking up \"non-existent\" issues to defame the central government and allegedly destabilise the country's financial structure and economy.\n\nAccusing Mr Venugopal of \"unconstitutional and disdainful\" conduct, Mr Dubey said the committee's chairperson actions are guided by political motivations after the Congress was \"compelled\" by voters to sit in the opposition benches following the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nClaiming that unverified allegations by a foreign company like Hindenburg against Ms Buch were part of such a campaign, he alleged that the \"India Chapter\" of this toolkit has become active.",

A bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma on October 21 noted it was conscious of the large-scale loss of human lives and property but it couldn't condone the \"long delay\" in filing of the appeal by the prosecution.The prosecution, while seeking the \"leave to appeal\", urged the court to condone the delay of 10,165 days in filing the appeal against the trial court's order of acquittal passed on July 29, 1995 in the murder and rioting case.Dismissing the plea, the bench held, \"Considering the long delay and the decisions of the coordinate bench in similar cases, upheld by the Supreme Court, the delay is not liable to be condoned. Thus, leave (to appeal) is not liable to be granted.\"The prosecution, on the other hand, had said the Justice S N Dhingra Committee was constituted in December 2018 to look into the cases in relation to violence and after its report came out in April 2019, internal reviews were conducted and the matters were processed for filing of appeals.Large-scale violence against the members of the Sikh community erupted in Delhi following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her Sikh security guards.",

        "text": "The Press Council of India has adopted a report on the arrests and wrongful detention of journalists in the country, albeit with a dissent note from its chairperson, former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai.\n\nThe report \u2013 Arrests, Wrongful Detentions and Intimidation of Media Personnel \u2013 has been authored by Press Council member Gurbir Singh. It was adopted by the council on September 27 and a copy was shared with Scroll on Thursday.\n\nThe Press Council is a statutory, adjudicating body established in 1966 and operates as per the provisions of the Press Council Act, 1978.\n\n\u201cFive journalists were killed and 226 others were targeted by state agencies, non-state political actors, anti-social elements and criminals across India during 2023,\u201d the report says, citing data from the India Press Freedom Annual Report released on May 3, the World Press Freedom Day.\n\nSingh also points out that, according to private surveys, the Indian news organisations are functioning under \u201csevere constraints\u201d. India was ranked 159 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index 2024, it points out.\n\n\u201cGiving a breakdown of the numbers, the report, released by the India Freedom of Expression Initiative, an alliance of press freedom NGOs, said while 148 journalists were targeted by state actors, 78 journalists were targeted by the non-state actors including political leaders, activists and criminals,\u201d it notes.\n\nThe report also details several cases and complaints that have been placed before the press body for examination, such as the Newsclick case in which the Delhi Police on October 3, 2023, raided the homes of 86 persons associated with the news portal. Of these, 61 persons were journalists. The portal\u2019s founder and editor Prabir Purkayastha and its human resources head Amit Chakraborty were arrested in the raids.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, journalists of The Caravan magazine who were covering the Delhi riots in August 2020 were charged with \u2018inciting communal violence\u2019,\u201d the report points out.\n\nThe report makes three broad recommendations to the Union government, the foremost being \u201cthe need to promulgate a national law for the security and protection of journalists\u201d.\n\nIt also asks that \u201cmore teeth\u201d be given to the Press Council of India Act \u201cso that the watchdog body is better equipped to meet the increasing challenges and threats faced by the Fourth Estate\u201d.\n\nThe Press Council currently can only issue advisory orders that are not enforceable. These do not work as deterrents for unscrupulous elements who may want to browbeat or intimidate press persons, Singh said in the report.\n\nThe report also calls for \u201csensitising police personnel and codifying norms of behaviour for law enforcement agencies towards the Fourth Estate\u201d.\n\nFor instance, before detaining or arresting a journalist, a law enforcement agency should be mandated to verify with the editor or publication if the concerned journalist is on assignment, the report suggests.\n\nSingh has called for \u201ca serious training programme for government personnel from the most senior level down to the junior-most constable to sensitise and generate respect for the constitutional rights and obligations of news networks, agencies and news persons\u201d.\n\nWhile the report has been adopted by the council, its Chairperson Ranjana Prakash Desai recorded a note of dissent.\n\nIn it, Desai questioned the methodology of the French non-governmental organisation Reporters Sans Frontiers, which publishes the World Press Freedom Index.\n\n\u201cThe ranking methodology is questionable and the Press Council of India, in past, has raised its concern about the authenticity and credibility of such reports prepared and published by RSF,\u201d Desai\u2019s dissenting note reads.\n\nShe said that \u201cthe authenticity and reliability of the India Press Freedom Annual Report\u2026by the India Freedom of Expression Initiative, an alliance of press freedom NGOs needs to be looked into\u201d.\n\nDesai said that since the Press Council has contested the ranking of India on the World Press Freedom Index 2024, \u201cthis portion of Shri Gurbir Singh\u2019s communication is not acceptable as it contradicts Press Council\u2019s stand\u201d.\n\nDesai also objected to several cases detailed in Singh\u2019s report as they did not contain the view of the law enforcement authorities.",

        "text": "Chip behemoth Nvidia expanded tie-ups on Thursday with India's big firms, such as Reliance Industries, and launched a lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) model for the widely-used Hindi language, as it looks to tap a growing market.The company NVDA.O is hosting an AI summit in the business capital of Mumbai, at which Chief Executive Jensen Huang chatted with the chairman of conglomerate Reliance RELI.NS, Mukesh Ambani, who is also Asia's richest man.\"Nvidia is AI in India,\" Huang said. \"In just one year's time, by the end of this year, we will have nearly 20 times more compute here in India than just a little over a year ago,\" he added, referring to the infrastructure for computing.From large companies to startups, businesses in India have focused on building AI models based on its diverse languages to grow consumer appeal and drive activities such as customer service AI assistants and content translation.Nvidia said it was rolling out the new small language model, dubbed Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi-4B, with 4 billion parameters, for firms to use in developing their own AI models.\"The model was pruned, distilled and trained with a combination of real-world Hindi data, synthetic Hindi data and an equal amount of English data,\" it said in a statement.Indian IT services firm Tech Mahindra TEML.NS is the first to use the Nvidia offering to develop a custom AI model called Indus 2.0, focused on Hindi and dozens of its dialects, the U.S. company said.Just a tenth of the population of 1.4 billion speaks English in India, where the constitution recognises 22 languages, it added.Besides Tech Mahindra, Nvidia is partnering with India's other IT giants Infosys INFY.NS, TCS TCS.NS and Wipro WIPR.NS, to train about half a million developers to design and deploy AI agents using its software.Reliance and Ola Electric OLAE.NS were among the companies that would use its \"Omniverse\" simulation technology, allowing them to test factory plans in a virtual world.Crowd at eventThursday's event was delayed more than half-an-hour, which managers blamed on the large crowd that gathered to see Huang, the face of the AI chip boom, a number an Nvidia NVDA.O employee described as \"easily a few thousand\".Unlike large-language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, used to power ChatGPT, small language models are trained on much smaller and more specific datasets. Typically cheaper as well, they are more attractive for companies with scarce resources.Global chip firms are investing and setting up facilities in India as it races to build up the semiconductor industry and compete with major hubs such as Taiwan, though analysts say the effort could take years.Since first setting up shop nearly two decades ago, Nvidia has engineering and design centers in India, as well as offices in key cities such as the southern tech hub of Bengaluru and neighbouring Hyderabad.In September last year, Reliance and Nvidia vowed to develop AI supercomputers in India and build large language models trained on its languages. Later that year, Nvidia unveiled a similar partnership with Tata Group.",

        "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found himself the target of sharp jabs in Parliament on Wednesday, as he attempted to defend his government\u2019s record on immigration. In the midst of a heated debate, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre tore into Trudeau, blaming him for the ongoing housing crisis, claiming the PM \"cannot fix what he broke because he\u2019s busy fighting his own caucus.\"But what really got people talking wasn\u2019t the debate on policy \u2014 it was Trudeau\u2019s unexpected vocabulary blunder.\u2018Brokenist\u2019 \u2014 Is that even a word?As Trudeau delivered a passionate rebuttal, he accused Poilievre of promoting a \"brokenist\" vision of Canada. The word instantly became the highlight of the day. Poilievre, with a grin, responded, \u201cMr Speaker, \u2018brokenist,\u2019 it\u2019s not even a word. He\u2019s even breaking the English language.\u201d\u2014 joshryanjames (@joshryanjames) That quip set the internet on fire. Social media was ablaze with memes mocking the Prime Minister\u2019s creative use of language. \u201cHere we go, folks. \u2018Brokenist,\u2019 the latest addition to Trudeau\u2019s dictionary,\u201d one user joked on X (formerly known as Twitter). Another chimed in, \u201cDid I miss a memo? Is \u2018brokenist\u2019 a thing now?\u201dMeme explosion: Trudeau\u2019s linguistic faux pasNew Trudeau\u2019s \u2018brokenist\u2019 moment quickly turned into meme material, with users having a field day mocking the PM\u2019s slip-up. \u201cFrom the most \u2018brokenist\u2019 PM we\u2019ve ever had!\u201d wrote one user, as another pointed out the irony of the leader who preaches fluency in two official languages accidentally coining a term that doesn\u2019t exist. The ridicule didn\u2019t stop there\u2014\u201cDear Leader is so flustered, he makes no sense. This is the \u2018brokenist\u2019 he\u2019s ever been,\u201d a popular post read.Fourth term drama: Will Trudeau run again?But while the memes may be fun, the political landscape Trudeau faces is anything but. Adding to the PM\u2019s woes, a significant number of his own party members have privately suggested he should bow out before the next election. A letter signed by more than 20 Liberal lawmakers urges Trudeau to step aside. His leadership, once seemingly untouchable, is now the subject of growing skepticism within the party.\u2014 RockwelderBlack (@RockwelderBlack) Although Trudeau didn\u2019t address the internal rebellion directly after the meeting, he\u2019s hinted he plans to run for an unprecedented fourth term. However, cracks are forming, with MPs like Charles Sousa saying Trudeau is \"reflecting\" on his future.\u2014 SassyBullfrog (@SassyBullfrog) Conservatives gain groundWith elections looming between now and October 2025, the Liberal Party's future seems uncertain. Recent losses in key special elections in Toronto and Montreal, combined with polling numbers that show the Conservatives leading by 13 points, spell trouble for Trudeau. Conservative leader Poilievre\u2019s sharp criticism may have hit harder than expected, resonating with a public increasingly disillusioned with the Liberals\u2019 performance.",

        "text": "Indian cricket team skipper Rohit Sharma had to pay the price of ignoring Virat Kohli's advice regarding a DRS review on Day 1 of the second Test match against New Zealand in Pune on Thursday. Rohit and Virat had contrasting views regarding a DRS decision involving New Zealand batter Devon Conway and it resulted in India losing a review. During the 25th over of the New Zealand innings, a delivery from Ravindra Jadeja crashed into Conway's pads and the Indian fielders went for a loud appeal. The umpire did not rule in their favour and although almost everyone seemed convinced that Rohit should go for a DRS, Kohli walked up to Rohit and insisted that the ball was going to miss the leg stump. However, Rohit eventually did go for the review and replays showed that Virat was correct in his assessment.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Off-spin all-rounder Washington Sundar ran through the New Zealand batting order to pick career-best figures of 7-59 as the visitors' were bowled out for 259 by India on day one of second Test at the MCA Stadium on Thursday.Electing to bat first, New Zealand were 197/3 at one stage and it felt like they would go past 300. But Washington displayed an exhibition of drift and dip, while varying his pace well and turned the game on its head for India and keep New Zealand to one below 260.His senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin chipped in with 3-64 as the innings marked the first-ever instance of all ten wickets taken by India's right-arm off-spinners in a Test match. Before the game, Washington being drafted in ahead of Kuldeep Yadav raised eyebrows, but his sensational bowling performance on a slow black-soil pitch shut down all those questions.In the morning, Devon Conway and captain Tom Latham hit five boundaries between themselves, before the latter fell early to Ashwin, who got the length ball to straighten after pitching on leg-stump and trapped the left-handed batter lbw for 15 off 22 balls.Conway and Will Young got some easy singles on offer, while hitting boundaries occasionally to stitch a 44-run stand for the second wicket, with India's spinners bowling quicker through the air. Ashwin then strangled Young down leg, and Sarfaraz Khan, stationed at short leg, prodded captain Rohit Sharma to take a review.Replays justified Sarfaraz's conviction as there was a spike detected on the ultra-edge when the ball passed off the gloves, before being pouched by Rishabh Pant, as Young was dismissed for 18. Conway was solid like a rock, especially in his sweeps, while Rachin Ravindra surviving a few close brushes till lunch came.Resuming from 92/2 in the post-lunch session, Conway started with a cracking cover drive off Jasprit Bumrah to get his fifty. He then capitalised on width from Bumrah's deliveries by punching off the backfoot and opening the face of the bat late to get back-to-back boundaries.From the other end, Ravindra began to find his groove by using Bumrah's pace to run through the gap between slip and gully for four. Conway continued to be impressive with his drive and reverse-sweeps, before poking at a short and spinning away ball from Ashwin, with the edge caught by Rishabh Pant.Ravindra took over the run-scoring mantle by lofting Jadeja for six, before beautifully flicking Akash Deep for four more. After getting his fifty with a stylish flick going through the hands of short mid-wicket for four, Ravindra had two more boundaries coming off Akash via cut and outside edge.The 59-run stand for the fourth wicket between Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell was brought to a halt by Washington, who turned the tide for India in the fag end of the second session with his dip and drift. Washington got a tossed-up delivery to turn away sharply from the middle stump and hit top of the off-stump with a peach of a delivery.At the stroke of tea, Washington again brought joy to himself and Indian team by getting a length ball to grip and turn sharply into Blundell, who aimed for a flick, but was castled through the gate.Post-tea, Washington asked for a review after rapping Daryl Mitchell on the pads with a sharp turning delivery, which proved to be a good review as replays showed ball going on to clip leg-stump. Mitchell Santner tried upping the ante by hitting boundaries, but Washington continued to hurt New Zealand.Glenn Phillips holed out to long-off off him, while Tim Southee and Ajaz Patel were castled by the young all-rounder, and Washington wrapped up the New Zealand innings in style by ratting Santner with grip and turn to take out the off-stump, as the visitors' lost their last seven wickets for 62 runs.(With IANS inputs)",

We have already addressed the water issue,\" MCA secretary Kamlesh Pisal later told the media.\"This time we (have) decided to provide the spectators with chilled drinking water and there were some sort of logistical issues as some of the stalls ran out of water during the lunch break owing to heavy rush,\" he explained.\"It took us 15 to 20 minutes to refill the water containers and since it was delayed, we decided to offer them free bottled water,\" he added.The drama unfolded at the Hill End of the stadium near the media and commentary centres.While the situation did not get any worse, it occurred because the vehicles carrying water to the stadium, which is located in the outskirts of the city, were reportedly delayed due to heavy traffic during morning hours.Another group of fans was seen arguing with the security to be allowed re-entry into the stadium while the rules strictly prohibit them from doing so. The situation was brought under control by the tea break.",

This is also regarding the role of Congress in the by-elections to be held there.\u201d\u201cThe Election Commission has announced by-elections in 9 out of 10 seats in UP. The BJP has been pursuing its political agenda for the last 10 years to weaken the constitution in the country and to serve its political interests, and to divide and break the brotherhood in the society,\u201d claimed Pandey. He further said, \u201cIn the recent Lok Sabha elections, the people of UP gave a befitting reply to them. Today, with values to protect and save the Constitution, Rahul Gandhi is touring the country and working to give justice to every section of the society.\u201d\u201cKeeping the same values in mind, as per the suggestion of the President of the UP Congress Committee and all the senior leaders there and after taking consent from the Congress President, we have decided that the Congress Party will not field its candidates in UP,\u201d announced Avinash Pandey.\u201cAll the candidates of the INDIA bloc will remain united, strong and support Samajwadi Party (SP) in UP,\u201d said the State Congress in-charge.Recently, under the leadership of UP Congress commitee the Congress held \u201cSamvidhan Bachao Sankalp Sammelan\u201d (save Constitution conferences) on all 10 seats.Avinash Pandey said that these conferences were successfully organised in all the 10 Assembly seats of UP and were attended by thousands of people and workers.\u201cAfter the success of these conferences, we have realized that if we do not stop BJP and NDA today, then in the coming times the constitution and brotherhood will weaken in the country,\u201d stated Avinash Pandey.Meanwhile, after announcing that INDIA bloc candidates would be contesting the Uttar Pradesh bypolls on the Samajwadi Party\u2019s \u2018cycle\u2019 symbol, party president Akhilesh Yadav said on Thursday \u2018humne yeh thana hai, \u2018samvidhan, arshan, sohardh (We have decided to save Constitution, Reservation, Harmony). We have to build the country of Bapu-Babasaheb-Lohia\u2019s dreams,\u201d he said in a post on X.Earlier, in another post, Yadav highlighted that the INDIA bloc candidates would be contesting the bypolls under his party\u2019s symbol.\u201cIt is not about seats but about winning. Under this strategy, the joint candidates of \u2018India Alliance\u2019 will contest on all the 9 seats on the Samajwadi Party\u2019s election symbol \u2018cycle\u2019. Congress and Samajwadi Party are united and standing shoulder to shoulder for a big victory. India Alliance is going to write a new chapter of victory in this by-election,\u201d read the post on X.Congress leader Surendra Rajput further confirmed that the main aim of the alliance will be to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instead of choosing the symbol.\u201cINDIA Alliance is contesting all 9 seats. For us, symbol is not important. For us, the end of BJP\u2019s misgovernance is important. For us, the end of Bahraich riot perpetrators is important. For us, it is important that there be security, peace and safeguarding of Constitution. INDIA Alliance is united against those who are against caste census and reservation and will contest all 9 seats. The manner in which Akhilesh Yadav showed big-heartedness in Haryana, we will contest with the same sentiment and win all 9 seats,\u201d he said.Additionally, Akhilesh Yadav also appealed to the people to stand united and vote without dividing the vote.On Tuesday, 15 candidates filed nominations in UP for by-polls and a total of 34 candidates filed nominations for Uttar Pradesh by-polls till Wednesday.

        "text": "In what promises to be a thriller in the bypolls, Channapatna Assembly constituency will witness a mega battle as Nikhil Kumaraswamy has been named the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate to take on C.P. Yogeshwar, who filed his nomination on a Congress ticket on October 24. \n\nMr. Nikhil\u2019s candidature as Janata Dal (Secular) candidate was announced by his grandfather and former Prime Minister H.D. Devegowda in Bengaluru after consultations with JD(S) party workers from Channapatna. Soon after, BJP strongman and former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa officially announced Mr. Nikhil as the NDA candidate. \n\nThis will be Mr Nikhil\u2019s third foray into electoral politics. In 2023, he lost in Ramanagara constituency during the Assembly elections in Karnataka. Earlier in 2019, he lost the Mandya Lok Sabha constituency to independent candidate Sumalatha. At that time, Mr. Nikhil had contested in Mandya as the Janata Dal Secular-Congress alliance candidate when the alliance was in power and the government was headed by his father H.D. Kumaraswamy. \n\nMr. Yogeshwar is seen as a turncoat in politics, but has won five times from Channapatna Assembly constituency. Interestingly, he lost the last two elections (2018 and 2023) to H.D. Kumaraswamy. \n\nIn 2020, BJP had got Mr Yogeshwar elected to the legislative Council. Earlier this week, Mr Yogeshwar resigned from the Council and the BJP.\n\nMr. Gowda announced that Mr. Nikhil will contest from Channapatna and will be filing his nomination on October 25. The former Prime Minister said he, along with BJP leaders, would be with Mr. Nikhil during filing of nomination papers at Channapatna. Besides, he would campaign for his grandson for the by-election. \n\nThe party had been wary of fielding him in the Channapatna by-poll, which was necessitated by the resignation of H.D. Kumaraswamy after he won the Mandya Lok Sabha seat. Mr. Kumaraswamy is now the Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel. \n\nWhile Mr. Nikhil was seen as a front-runner to contest on the NDA ticket and represent JD(S), Mr. Yogeshwar a five-time former MLA and former MLC was adamant on contesting from the BJP ticket. As there was no agreement on the issue, though JD S offered Mr Yogeshwar to contest on its symbol, he chose to join Congress on Wednesday. This development had put the JD S on the backdoor as it feared all forces opposed to it will align in this by polls. The Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh, who lost to Mr. Nikhil\u2019s uncle from Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha constituency, are looking to avenge the defeat. JD S leaders are also wary of support from certain Vokkaliga leaders in BJP though the central leaders are completely backing the JDS. \n\nMeanwhile, though Mr. Gowda announced Mr. Nikhil\u2019s name earlier, Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Nikhil along with several party leaders and BJP leaders met former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to discuss the developments before formally announcing Mr. Nikhil as the NDA candidate. Leader of Opposition in Legislative Assembly R. Ashok and Leader of Opposition in Legislative Council were among those present in the NDA meeting. \n\nThe Channapatna by poll promises to be a cracker of contest given the high political stakes involved. While Mr. Shivakumar and Mr. Yogeshwar will be looking to avenge defeat, Mr. Devegowda\u2019s family will be looking to retain the seat and their influence in the district. For, JD S could retain only Channapatna constituency in Ramanagar district and this constituency is now at stake.",

Jaishankar on Thursday said that there remains a \u201cwidespread anxiety\u201d that the ongoing conflict would spread further in the region.\n\n\u201cThe situation in the Middle East, West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected. The human and material consequences of further escalation are truly serious. Any approach has to be fair and durable, leading to a two-state solution,\u201d the EAM said at the BRICS Outreach session in Kazan.\n\nRepresenting Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the segment, Jaishankar emphasised that conflicts and tensions have to be handled effectively.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception. And there should be zero tolerance for terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting that as the old order changes while inequities of the past continue, the EAM mentioned that BRICS is a statement in itself and can make a real difference.\n\nHe made five key points to ensure that the benefits of change reach those who are currently left behind and a more equitable global order is created.\n\nIt included strengthening and expanding platforms of an independent nature to widen choices and avoid being leveraged; Reforming established institutions and mechanisms, especially the UN Security Council in the permanent and non-permanent categories; Democratizing the global economy through creating more production hubs to build resilient, redundant and shorter supply chains; Correct distortions in global infrastructure through connectivity options that enhance logistics and mitigate risks; and, sharing experiences and new initiatives that hold relevance and are of common interest.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s Digital Public Infrastructure, its Unified Payments Interface and the Gati Shakti infrastructure, all hold a larger relevance. The International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, the Global Biofuel Alliance, Mission LiFE and the International Big Cat Alliance are similarly initiatives of common interest. As a First Responder, be it for natural calamities, health emergencies or economic crises, we seek to do our fair share,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nThe plenary session of the 16th BRICS summit in the outreach/BRICS-plus format on Friday was attended by leaders of the CIS countries, delegations from Asian, African, Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, as well as heads of executive bodies of a number of international organisations.",

        "text": "The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) has urgently called on Chinese authorities to reveal the whereabouts of four Tibetans subjected to incommunicado detention in Ngaba (Aba), located in the Ngaba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province.In early September, Chinese officials arbitrarily detained four individuals, including two monks from Kirti Monastery, Lobsang Samten and Lobsang Trinley, alongside Tsering Tashi and Wangkyi. Since their arrest, no information has been provided regarding their location or the specific charges against them.Lobsang Samten, 53, has been a monk at Kirti Monastery since childhood and is currently a student in the Karampa (Geshe) class. As a junior chant master at the monastery\u2019s Prayer College, he is known for his commitment to monastic studies and previously faced detention in 2011 alongside 300 other monks. Lobsang Trinley, also known as Drenpo, is a monk in his 40s from Rongkhangsar town and plays a significant role in organising ritual ceremonies at Kirti Monastery.Wangkyi, 43, and Tsering Tashi, 41, are siblings from the Haritsang family in Rongkharsar. Wangkyi is married and has four daughters. Reports suggest that members of the Haritsang family may have been arrested for maintaining contacts in India, although details remain unclear.According to a source who spoke with TCHRD, \u201cThere have been reports of members of the Haritsang family being arrested for maintaining contacts in India, though specific details remain elusive. In recent months, repression in the Ngaba region has intensified, with increased restrictions particularly aimed at Kirti Monastery and nearby villages.Arbitrary detentions and secret sentencing of Tibetans have become alarmingly frequent. Local Tibetans are being silenced through intimidation, making it increasingly difficult for information to surface. Even those who are released from detention are prohibited from revealing the charges against them or where they were held, further obscuring the truth from the community.\u201dThis incident comes on the heels of China\u2019s closure of two prominent Buddhist monastery schools in July, which forced approximately 1,600 novice monks to enrol in government-run boarding schools. This move is part of a broader campaign aimed at assimilating Tibetan cultural and religious identity and promoting assimilation into the dominant Han Chinese culture.TCHRD calls on Chinese authorities to immediately cease these arbitrary detentions and to provide accurate information regarding the status and whereabouts of the four detained Tibetans. The organisation urges the international community to raise awareness of the situation and advocate for the rights of the Tibetan people.",

People would revolt against the government and thrash leaders of the Congress soon for failing to fulfill its poll promises soon. Listing out the broken promises of the Congress, he pointed out that even the one tola of gold to promised to the beneficiaries of the Kalyana Lakshmi scheme was not given yet.

No leader of the Congress would be left in the State if all sections lodged complaints against the government.\r\n\r\nRama Rao cautioned that the BRS would not remain silent if cases were booked against farmers. He stated that none would keep quiet if someone demolished their houses. He cited a case registered against Bodigam Ganganna for allegedly abusing Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy. Occupants were given house sites and permissions during the regime of the Congress. He also asked whether cases be booked against the Congress which claimed to keep its words within hundred days at the office or against the farmers or the poor. Cheating cases should be registered against those who duped the farmers and the public, he said, adding that illegal cases would not be tolerated.\r\n\r\nRama Rao also asked the public to warn people in Maharashtra about the Congress, since the State was going for polls soon, and inform them what was happening in Telangana, especially with regard to poll promises. Asking officials to discharge duties as per the law, he asked them not to cross the line by succumbing to pressure exerted by public representatives or ministers.",
        "summary": "Speaking at the 'Rythannala Poru Bata' meeting with farmers at Ramleela ground on Thursday, Rama Rao declared his willingness to go to jail for the sake of the people and farmers. He warned that the public would soon rise up against the government and confront Congress leaders for not fulfilling their election promises.",

Addressing media persons later here on Thursday, he said the turncoats MLAs and leaders were dominating party affairs and calling the shots in different constituencies.\r\n\r\n\"At this juncture, what is our position in the party?\" he asked, also alleging that former Minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy was the leader of the turncoats. He had held a meeting with turncoat MLAs and leaders and directed them to dominate the Congress leaders in the constituencies, he alleged, stating that the high command was against defections into the party. The Congress had got a clear majority in the Assembly and did not need support of any turncoats, he said.\r\n\u201cWill the Congress government not survive without support of turncoat MLAs? Is this the democratic governance Rahul Gandhi promised?\" Jeevan Reddy asked.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, TPCC president Mahesh Kumar Goud has been claiming that defections into the party were as per the high command's instructions. But Jeevan Reddy took strong objection to the defections into the party reminding that it was the Congress which was fighting against defections by elected public representatives. Defections were not only against the party's policy but also creating lot of unrest among loyal leaders. Still, Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy openly welcomed BRS MLA Dr Sanjay into the party.\r\n\u201cWhen his entry was opposed by the cadre in Jagtial, I was personally summoned to New Delhi after Ministers Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and D Sridhar Babu tried to pacify me. Even the party high command wanted me to be patient. Now, I appeal to Mallikarjun Kharge to guide my future course of action,\" Jeevan Reedy said.",

        "text": "Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hailed the breakthrough in resolving the longstanding border tensions between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue 2024 in New Delhi, Singh said that months of diplomatic and military talks have led to both nations achieving a consensus to resume patrolling and grazing rights in traditional areas.\u201cIndia and China have been involved in talks at both diplomatic and military levels to resolve differences along the LAC. Following these efforts, we have reached a broad consensus to restore the ground situation based on principles of equal and mutual security,\u201d Singh stated, marking his first public remarks on the issue.The border agreement between the two nations follows several intense high-level negotiations since the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes, which marked a significant downturn in India-China relations. The new agreement allows Indian forces to resume patrolling in key areas such as Depsang and Demchok, long-standing flashpoints in the standoff. The resumption of these activities is viewed as a confidence-building measure and a signal of both countries' willingness to reduce military tensions.Rajnath Singh emphasised that this breakthrough underscores the power of persistent dialogue. \u201cThe consensus includes patrolling and grazing in traditional areas. This is the power of continuous dialogue \u2014 sooner or later, solutions emerge,\u201d he remarked, highlighting India\u2019s commitment to diplomacy while ensuring national security.The agreement is seen as a critical step towards normalising ties between the two countries, with disputes in areas like Pangong Lake, Gogra-Hot Springs, and Galwan Valley already settled. However, Rajnath Singh was quick to remind that India remains vigilant. \u201cOur pursuit of peace does not mean compromising on security. India will always stand firm in protecting its borders,\u201d he asserted.This pact represents a diplomatic victory for India, particularly given China\u2019s earlier resistance to reverting to the status quo that existed prior to the 2020 clashes. The breakthrough comes after 21 rounds of military talks and 17 working mechanism meetings. With the resumption of patrolling in Depsang and Demchok, where Chinese forces had intruded up to 15 km into Indian-patrolled areas, the new agreement offers hope for easing broader Sino-India territorial disputes.India and China, sharing a 3,488 km long border, have differing perceptions of the LAC, which divides physical control rather than territorial claims. This latest step forward may offer a path towards further reconciliation in the complex territorial disputes that have long strained relations between the two Asian giants.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024Must Watch",

Having said this, what we must understand is that it\u2019s an agreement for disengagement and patrolling. The modalities will take time. The modalities have to be worked out by people on the ground. So far a decision has been taken which is very good. Now this decision, the nuts and bolts of this as to how it will happen will be done by people on the ground,\u201d Former Chief of Army Staff General VK Singh said while speaking to ANI. \n\nGeneral Singh stated that a very positive atmosphere has been created with the India-China agreement and the leaders engaged in talks will be able to come to a conclusion that is mutually beneficial to both of them. \u201cVarious meetings will take place and then only we will see the outcome of it. But with this, I think also a very positive atmosphere has been created where both the leaders who are meeting would meet in a positive environment in something which they would be able to talk about things which are mutually beneficial to both of them,\u201d General VK Singh added. \n\nIn a major development in the 10-month-long military standoff on the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh, India and China have reached an agreement to disengage their troops from the northern and southern banks of the contentious Pangong Lake where the Chinese troops would move back to east of the Finger 8 while the Indian side would go to its Dhan Singh Thapa post near Finger 3, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced on Thursday in Rajya Sabha\n\nIn a statement in Rajya Sabha, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that as per the agreement reached between the two sides, both countries will cease their forward deployments on the Pangong Lake in a \u201ccoordinated, phased and verified\u201d manner where they would restore the situation to the April 2020 status.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform the House today that as a result of our well thought out approach and sustained talks with the Chinese side, we have now been able to reach an agreement on disengagement in the North and South Bank of the Pangong Lake. It has also been agreed to convene the next meeting of the Senior Commanders within 48 hours after the complete disengagement in the Pangong Lake area so as to address and resolve all other remaining issues,\u201d the Minister announced. \n\nThe agreement reached between India and China on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh \u201cessentially pertains\u201d to the areas of Depsang and Demchok, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said.\n\n\u201cInsofar as Depsang and Demchok is concerned, if you see the statements that I have made over the last 48 to 72 hours, I think the answer should be quite clear. I have made the point that the last time we had an agreement on the several issues that had arisen in the India-China border areas since 2020, the last agreement was in 2022 in September,\u201d Misri said at a media briefing here on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for BRICS Summit.\n\n\u201cSince then, we had been involved in trying to find a resolution of the pending issues in the balance areas along the Line of Actual Control, which pertain to these areas that you have mentioned.

        "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to use the \"clock\" symbol in its publicity material in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections with a disclaimer that the matter was sub-judice before it. Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan passed the order on a plea filed by the rival Sharad Pawar-led NCP faction as it issued a notice to the Ajit Pawar-led faction.The top court on March 19 and April 4 had directed the Ajit Pawar-led faction to issue a public notice in the newspapers in English, Hindi and Marathi editions notifying that the allocation of \"clock\" symbol was sub-judice. The apex court had further said the Ajit faction was permitted to use the symbol subject to the case's final outcome.During the proceedings on Thursday, the bench took note of the submissions of senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the Sharad Pawar faction. Singhvi submitted the opponent group should be restrained from using the \"clock\" symbol as it didn't use the disclaimer in their campaign materials and \"misled\" voters.\"They have been blatantly not using the disclaimer. They want to piggyback on me. Nobody should enjoy the goodwill of the symbol which is sub-judice,\" submitted Singhvi. The top court directed Ajit Pawar to file a fresh undertaking over its March 19 and April 4 directions to issue a public notice -- \"NCP's 'clock' symbol is sub-judice\" -- was being meticulously complied with even during the process of the state assembly elections.\"File a fresh undertaking as well that you have not violated our directions in the past and till the end of elections. If there is any violation, we will take note of it. We expect both sides to comply with our directions. Please don't create an embarrassing situation,\" the bench said.Singhvi said the Ajit Pawar group should be allocated a new symbol for the assembly elections. Senior advocate Balbir Singh, appearing for Ajit Pawar, opposed Singhvi's submissions and said all pamphlets and campaign materials contained the disclaimers as directed by the apex court.\"They are showing false documents. We have given disclaimers in our publicity material. They came up with the same allegations during the Lok Sabha polls which was rejected. I am willing to file all documents and pamphlets,\" Singh said.The matter has been posted for hearing on November 6. Sharad Pawar moved the apex court against a February 6 order of the Election Commission of India (ECI) recognising Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.The ECI had allotted the NCP's \"clock\" symbol to the group led by Ajit Pawar. The NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar, had the \"clock\" as its election symbol before its split. On March 19, the top court allowed the Sharad Pawar faction to use \"Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar\" as its name along with the symbol of a man blowing \"turha\" ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in the country.It had passed the order on a plea by the Sharad Pawar group seeking to restrain the Ajit Pawar faction from using the \"clock\" symbol for the polls, as allotted by the ECI, on the ground that it was disrupting the level playing field.The top court had observed the name and photographs of Sharad Pawar could not be used by the Ajit Pawar faction for political gains. On February 19, the top court directed for the continuation of the ECI order allotting \"Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar\" as the party name for the Sharad Pawar faction.Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar had on February 15 held the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar to be the real NCP and said the anti-defection provisions in the Constitution couldn't be used to stifle internal dissent. Sharad Pawar had founded the NCP with former Lok Sabha speaker Purno Sangma and Tariq Anwar in 1999 after their expulsion from the Congress.Ajit Pawar had walked away with a majority of the NCP MLAs in July, 2023, and supported the BJP-Shiv Sena government led by Eknath Shinde.",

        "text": "The National Democratic Alliance on Thursday fielded Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of Union Minister and Karnataka JD(S) chief HD Kumaraswamy for the upcoming Channapatna by-poll.Nikhil Kumaraswamy, who is also the JD(S) State Youth Unit President, will be competing against CP Yogeshwara, who joined the Congress on Wednesday after resigning as BJP MLC on Monday. Notably, HD Kumaraswamy (HDK) defeated Yogeeshwara in the 2018 and 2023 assembly polls from the seat. The seat fell vacant after HDK won from the Mandya parliamentary segment in the last Lok Sabha polls.The announcement was made by former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa during a press conference. He also expressed confidence that the alliance would win all three seats in the upcoming by-polls.\u201cWe have announced Nikhil Kumaraswamy as NDA candidate. We are going to win all three seats\u2026 We are announcing, with the blessings of the high command leaders, that we field him. We\u2019ll meet after we win 100 per cent\u2026I don\u2019t speak about who left the party; we will do whatever is required to make sure Nikhil Kumaraswamy wins,\u201d he said.Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy added, \u201cFinally, we have decided, with the blessings of BS Yediyurappa and other leaders of both parties, to field Nikhil Kumaraswamy as a candidate.\u201d\u201cThis was not my decision or opinion. Our party workers pressurised him (to contest bypoll) and we took this decision,\u201d he added.Following the announcement, Nikhil Kumaraswamy said, \u201cI have been touring Panchayati Headquarters in my constituency and that is only because Kumaraswamy ji said that we should take all the workers and leaders into confidence. I have been doing my work as a Karyakarta and with the recent political developments that have taken place, the NDA has given me an opportunity. I have a lot of confidence in the Channapatna constituency people. They will bless me.\u201dEarlier today, Congress candidate Yogeshwara filed his nomination for the Channapatna by-poll in the presence of Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM DK Shivakumar.Earlier on October 15, the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced by-polls for 48 Assembly constituencies and two Parliamentary seats, scheduled to occur in two phases alongside the Maharashtra and Jharkhand Assembly elections.Voting for the first phase, covering 47 Assembly constituencies and the Wayanad parliamentary seat in Kerala will take place on November 13. The second phase will occur on November 20 for the Kedarnath Assembly constituency in Uttarakhand and the Nanded parliamentary seat in Maharashtra. The counting of votes will take place on November 23",

        "text": "Telangana Government is apparently saddled with the burden of interest payment due to the huge loans obtained from the financial institutions in the past 10 years.\n\nTelangana likely to pay interests higher than projection\n\nThe interest payments over the past few years are on the rise and surpassing the quantum projected in the budget estimates of the respective financial years. For instance, during the current fiscal, the State has incurred expenditure of Rs. 13,187 crore on account of interest payments by the end of September - second quarter. This is 74.38 per cent of the Rs. 17,729 crore interest payments projected in the budget estimates for the entire year. \n\nWith two more quarters still remaining, the State is likely to end up paying interests much higher than the amount projected in the budget estimates. \n\nInterest payment in the previous FYs\n\nThis is not an isolated case, the State Government remitted Rs. 23,337 crore interest in the previous financial year 2023-24, 104% of the Rs. 22,407 crore of the budget estimates.\n\nThe same was the case with the interest payment in 2022-23 when the State ended up paying Rs. 20,952 crore, 110% of the Rs. 18,911 crore projected for the fiscal. And, in 2021-22, the State had to pay Rs. 18,688 crore which is 105% of the projected Rs. 17,854 crore in the budget estimates. \n\nChief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has been expressing concern over the legacy of high interest loans handed over by the previous Government. The Congress Government had estimated that the State is saddled with borrowings of Rs. 6.85 lakh crore in the White Paper on State finances tabled in the assembly. \n\nThe Chief Minister accordingly made strong pitch with the XVI Finance Commission to allow Telangana Government to restructure its debt so that it could mitigate the burden of interest payment. Irrigation Minister N. Uttam Kumar Reddy visited the national capital more than once seeking the Union Finance Ministry\u2019s consent for rescheduling of loans so that the State could withstand the pressure on its finances.",

        "text": "In recent times, traffic violations of various kinds have reached a peak, making it difficult for law-abiding citizens to travel on the roads.\n\nSome common violations include riding without helmets by both rider and pillion, using mobile phones while driving, triple or quadruple riding, jumping traffic signals without restraint, driving on the wrong side and in no-entry zones at reckless speeds, drunk driving, overtaking from the left, and more. This menace can be curbed through the following measures:\n\n1. Imposing heavy fines on traffic violators in line with the penalties set by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (Government of India).\n\n2. Establishing a Traffic Violations Monitoring Cell (TVMC) equipped with advanced infrastructure, including PCs, laptops, and servers, by the Police Department in every district of Karnataka. TVMC should collaborate with the relevant RTOs to share vehicle databases.\n\n3. The TVMC should employ personnel with the necessary qualifications and computer skills, hired either on a contract or regular basis.\n\n4. Hiring physically capable personnel on contract or piecework, equipped with HD button cameras or mobile devices. These devices must feature tamper-proof software to ensure the integrity of videos/photos. The authority to alter footage should only lie with officials of SP rank or higher.\n\n5. Deploying personnel in special uniforms to patrol the roads and capture traffic violations on video or photo. Any attempt to assault these personnel should be treated seriously and prosecuted under relevant laws. Insurance must be provided to ensure compensation in the event of injury or loss of life.\n\n6. Developing software that automatically uploads captured videos / photos to the TVMC servers.\n\n7. TVMC personnel should immediately notify traffic offenders via WhatsApp or email, specifying the fine amount and due date. For those without access to these platforms, notices should be sent by mail.\n\nFailure to pay fines within the due date should result in doubled or tripled penalties until a final deadline. If payment is still not made, the Police should seize the vehicle, which can be traced using advanced TVMC software.\n\nIf these suggestions are implemented effectively, traffic violations could be reduced by 75-80 percent within 5-10 years, similar to the situation in the USA.\n\nHowever, the real question is whether the Government or Police Department will truly adopt these measures. It\u2019s doubtful, as enforcing these rules could reduce the illicit flow of money into both Government coffers and Police pockets, as more people would comply with traffic regulations.\n\nThe world rests on hope, as do the innocent citizens. Only time will reveal the outcome of these suggestions. These recommendations are based on over 46 years of driving experience and 40 years of dedicated service in a Central Government organisation.\n\n\u2013 N.

        "text": "Amaravati: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday promised that he will be the best ambassador for the drone industry to promote its ecosystem and transform the state into a drone hub. The chief minister called on drone players to use the southern state as a pilot or testing ground for producing use cases and proof of concepts. \"Andhra Pradesh will be a testing bed for drone applications. Give us your use cases and we will test them,\" said Naidu, addressing a two-day national drone summit at Mangalagiri in Guntur district. The chief minister inaugurated the summit accompanied by Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu. Naidu noted that the state government is keen on adopting at least 150 drone use cases during the two-day summit on October 22 and 23. Calling on drone ecosystem players, the CM requested them to put their data and use cases in a sandbox for further validation and enhancement. Highlighting that the drone industry is the \"game changer\" of the future, he said these unmanned aerial vehicles have multiple use cases, such as identifying traffic violations, criminals and in farming, among several others. The TD supremo observed that the state government aims to hand over 20,000 drone pilot certificates and achieve 80 per cent indigenisation in drone manufacturing. Promising to allot 300 acres to the Civil Aviation Ministry, Government of India, Naidu requested the Centre to set up a drone certification hub at Orvakal in Kurnool district, which is near to Hyderabad, Chennai and Amaravati. Further, the CM appealed to drone players to keep their costs reasonable and refrain from being \"greedy\" to enable wider adoption of this technology. On the occasion, the Andhra Pradesh government inked an agreement with the Quality Council of India (QCI) for certifying drone startups in the state. There was also an agreement between IIT-Tirupati and Technology Innovative Hub for collaboration in drone technology development, startups and skill initiatives. Later, Naidu released a concept note on drone policy and also inaugurated a drone expo at the venue. Earlier, Union Aviation Minister K Ram Mohan Naidu said that the government does not want to import drones as it envisages the people of the country to manufacture them. The aviation minister highlighted that the Centre has liberalised rules for the drone ecosystem and enabled 27 companies to benefit from the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Noting that India has emerged as a drone hub in the past few years, the union minister said the government wants to push the industry further. \"Looking at a drone hub in Andhra Pradesh in the future... want to ensure that Andhra Pradesh grows to the best of its ability,\" he said, adding that the government wants to ensure that the southern state will emerge as the drone hub of the world. The mega-drone summit will feature drone hackathons, exhibitions and participation from industry experts. As many as 1,711 delegates and 1,306 visitors are expected to attend the summit. Likewise, over 8,000 people are also expected to attend the summit, which will be followed by a drone show at Punnami Ghat in Vijayawada on Tuesday evening.",

        "text": "penText has transformed from on-premises content management (1.0) to information management in hybrid cloud (2.0). Now, OpenText 3.0 focuses on \u2018Information Reimagined\u2019, combining cloud-based information management with AI, security, and compliance.\n\nOpenText\u2019s 3.0 journey has been a transformative experience for us. We are building a new AI platform that will help in the automation of product development internally. It is around \u2018Information Re-imagined\u2019 which is basically an Information Management Cloud with AI and with full security and compliance. \n\nThe 3.0 journey pushed us to embrace a cloud-first, AI-driven mindset, and to focus on delivering innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. OpenText 3.0 is all about security, AI, and information management cloud. We are going to be fully on the cloud, but we keep in mind the local regulatory requirements and data sovereignty requirements of certain countries, which means we\u2019ll bring the hyperscaler cloud into the country. \n\n This is a platform that we intend to use internally for auto-generating the application codes for product development and automating testing. The application code generation will help our developers and especially testers. We can imagine a world in the future where there are some user stories, the business use case stories on which the product development has to happen. You feed into this platform and say that your core language to develop this is Python. It\u2019ll read the user stories and suggest a Python code which the developer can then edit and refine further and then move to the next step of unit testing. Once the developer is happy, then the platform will suggest a test plan or test script for that. The platform itself will help you to test it. Once you approve the test plan and test script. This is not for sale to a customer. This is in pilot with over 2,000 developers testing it. \n\nThe majority of AI and Automation initiatives are being fully developed in India. That\u2019s one of the key elements of India OpenText 3.0, which our CEO entrusted us with. It started like 9-10 months back and we are heavily invested in that. The Indian team played a pivotal role in the development of this platform. India is going to play a very pivotal role in OpenText 3.0. Security is a key focus area in our 3.0 strategy and as an example of the role of India in the security the managed security operations centre under our cybersecurity practice in India will grow significantly and most likely going to double in size. \n\nWill AI be fully successful? The answer is no. Can it replace everything perfectly? The answer is no. It\u2019s a simple common example. I can say critics and admirers are sitting on the left-hand, and right-hand side of the fence. But the answer is in the middle. You will not leave everything with AI, but you will leave a lot of things with AI. It just depends on how everybody is experimenting maybe the AI might fail in one area \u2013 let\u2019s say product development. Maybe it produces a code, then we have to put more effort into correcting it. The efficiency gain is 30 per cent but to rework is another 20 per cent, eventually, a 10 per cent gain is not worth it, but AI-assisted automated testing is most likely 100 per cent guaranteed that it will work well. Therefore in some areas, it will succeed, it will fail. That\u2019s my view.\n\n Price-wise, the Indian market is definitely challenging. The price point that customers expect here is different; North American pricing or other models won\u2019t work. So, we\u2019ve defined specific packages, solutions, and price points tailored for the Indian market. \n\nWe\u2019ve learned these lessons over time, and we\u2019re now seeing significant success. For example, just three months ago, we secured a multi-million dollar deal with a large telecom customer in India. This is a yearly renewable project, highlighting the growing demand for our products and services in the domestic market. This particular customer needed our solutions to streamline their business processes, and we were able to meet their needs effectively. A few other customers in India where we had success in last few years are L&T Technology Services with whom we are partnering to serve strategic Govt institutions, ITC, GAIL, IOCL, and ONGC. \n\nPreviously, we had success stories with only multinational companies that are rolling out in India. But the true India stories have started coming up in the last 24 months or so.\n\n We have a strong internship program that originated in Hyderabad. We hire close to 300 interns every year. Of those interns, 40 per cent get converted to full-time employees. We started with product development, then we replicated to other units as well - now professional services, customer success, and technical support. It is working very well. And in that process, we have a good affiliation with campuses both in Hyderabad and Bangalore and all India level as well. We have identified, certain universities we work with.",

        "text": "Berhampur (Odisha): Even though winter is yet to set in the state, winged guests have started to arrive at Odisha's Chilika lake, the biggest waterfowl habitat in the country, an official said. The migratory birds have already started to arrive in the lake from the first week of the current month, as the usual time of their arrival, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Chilika Wildlife Division, Amlan Nayak said on Tuesday. Their arrival was continuing daily, he said. Migratory birds of different species like northern pintail, Eurasian wigeon, gadwall, black-tailed gadwall, northern shoveller, greater flamingo, common sandpiper, common coot, mongolian plover, common snipe, black winged stilt, etc, have already swooped down in the lake, Nayak said. The DFO said the arrival of migratory birds to the lake is as usual, even though the day temperature in and around the blue lagoon was hovering at 32 to 35 degrees Celsius at present. The onset of winter and some other causes in their native places might have forced the birds to fly to Chilika, he added. Several birds are also seen to fly in the sky near Chilika without settling on the lake. They might land once the water level recedes in the lake, Nayak said, adding, \"We expected their number might be in large by the end of the current month.\" The winged guests mostly from beyond the Himalayas in Northern Eurasia, Caspian region, Siberia, Kazakh, Lake Baikal and remote areas of Russia and neighbouring countries visit the Chilika lake every winter and start their homeward journey before the onset of summer in the second week of March. In the last winter, a total of 11,37,759 birds of 187 species visited Chilika and the majority of them settled in the Nalabana sanctuary area inside the lake. To prevent bird poaching in the lake during the period, the wildlife division has set up 21 temporary camps in the lake. They have also hired around a dozen boats for patrolling in the lake. Besides, they have decided to make surveillance through drones like the previous year. The camps have already started functioning from October 1 and will continue till the end of March. With the setting up of the camps, patrolling was also intensified in the lake. The drive to create awareness among the people to prevent bird poaching was also launched in the vulnerable areas, said the forest official.",

He said that the political families in these MVA and INDIA only want to come to power, asserting that Congress can\u2019t walk together with its allies. Naqvi further attacked the Congress and said that the opposition party didn\u2019t give importance to small and regional parties. He suggested that Congress should learn from BJP and Narendra Modi in handling the allies. While speaking on the seat-sharing tussle of INDIA Alliance in Jharkhand and MVA in Maharashtra, Naqvi said, \u201cBe it Jharkhand or Maharashtra, there is more of \u2018siyasi khurpench\u2019 than \u2018seats ka pench\u2019. Be it Aghadi or alliance, their \u2018khaandani khiladi\u2019 have the same aspiration \u2013 to come into power. Today, whichever alliance will be led by Congress party will have \u2018pench\u2019 as well as \u2018khurpench\u2019 because Congress has no DNA or mindset to walk ahead together with all allies. Congress thinks that small parties and regional parties have no importance.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) had earlier announced that elections in Maharashtra are to be held on November 20 and the counting for all 288 assembly constituencies will be held on November 23. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, while Shiv Sena won 56 seats and the Congress won 44 seats.

The victim's father wrote an email to Amit Shah on his birthday and sought time from him to get guidance on the ways to get the case expedited and get justice for his daughter. In the letter, the victim's father said that the family were \"under tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless\". \"After that heinous unforeseen incident happened to our daughter, we have been going through tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless. I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you and gain your insights on the issue, as I believe your experience and guidance would be invaluable,\" the victim's father wrote in the email. Massive protests broke out after the rape-murder of the trainee doctor in Kolkata. Doctors went on strike demanding better working conditions and guarantees of safety. Doctors all over the country took to the streets demanding action against the accused. Sanjay Roy, believed to be the main accused in the case, was arrested, and the case was handed over to the CBI. The CBI, in its investigation, refuted claims of a gangrape and stated that Sanjay Roy committed the crime alone. Over 45 senior doctors and faculty members of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital collectively resigned in solidarity with their junior colleagues, who were protesting against the murder of the trainee doctor. In their resignation letters, the senior doctors stated that the demands of the junior doctors had not been addressed and that there had been \"no progress\" in the investigation of the trainee doctor\u2019s rape and murder.Furthermore, junior doctors, who sat on a hunger strike in protest against the government ended their strike on Monday after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The doctors, who had been demanding better working conditions and infrastructure improvements in the healthcare sector, also announced the withdrawal of the general medical strike they had earlier called.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) leader Sanjay Raut dropped a bombshell, alleging that the cash was part of a massive \u20b975 crore fund being distributed by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to his party candidates. Raut claimed the seized \u20b95 crore was just the tip of the iceberg, insisting that \u20b915 crore was in transit, but only \u20b95 crore was officially accounted for. According to Raut, the cash was on its way to Shinde\u2019s loyal MLA, Shahjibapu Patil, in Sangola, Solapur district.\n\nHowever, MLA Patil vehemently denied any involvement, branding the accusations as slanderous. \u201cEver since we broke away from Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s Shiv Sena, they\u2019ve been targeting us. I have no knowledge of the cash or the people carrying it,\u201d Patil said, calling Raut\u2019s claims an act of political vendetta. The car carrying the money has been impounded, and four individuals are now being grilled by police at the Rajgad police station.\n\nCash in Stream\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2014this explosive cash drama takes an even more bizarre twist. Far from the police checkpoints, in the sleepy town of Atpadi in Sangli, a different kind of treasure hunt was unfolding. Just before Diwali, the quiet banks of a local stream near the Ambabai temple transformed into a chaotic scene as rumors spread of cash notes flowing in the water. \n\nShocked villagers rushed to the site, scooping up thousands of rupees as they fished currency notes from the stream, unsure where the sudden windfall came from. Videos of the surreal event went viral, adding to the mounting mystery. As locals scramble for answers, police are now investigating the source of this aquatic cash flow.\n\nMeanwhile, in the midst of the frenzy, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MLA Rohit Pawar fired yet another salvo at the ruling BJP-led alliance, accusing them of resorting to cash-for-votes tactics. \u201cLike in the Lok Sabha elections, they are trying to buy votes with dirty money, but the people of Maharashtra won\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Pawar declared. He confidently asserted that this \u201ccorruption money\u201d wouldn\u2019t be enough to secure power for the ruling coalition.",

        "text": "Congress MP Kumari Selja on Tuesday welcomed Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s decision to enter full-time electoral politics, expressing her happiness that Gandhi will contest the upcoming elections from Wayanad.Selja criticised the BJP, claiming that they attempt to communalize issues where they face electoral challenges. \u201cThe BJP always communalizes issues where they are losing. This is an old tactic of the BJP. The country has been waiting for a long time. There has been a nationwide demand for Priyanka to enter full-time politics and contest elections. We are happy that she is going to fight from Wayanad. Today is the nomination day, and I wish her all the best. I am confident she will win there with record votes,\u201d she said. The senior Congress leader added, \u201cThe Minister said that machines should not overpower humanity. The Election Commission must pay attention to this. The issue of EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) has been raised repeatedly, and it is their responsibility to ensure that there should be no doubt anywhere in the country. Everything must be completely fair.\u201d Earlier, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met party chief Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi on Monday to discuss campaign strategies as she prepares to file her nomination for the by-elections in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Wayanad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23. After the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Wayanad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also be present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. After being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. The election commission also announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. If Priyanka Gandhi wins from Wayanad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. Gandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation councillor. Rahul Gandhi had said both Rae Bareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Rae Bareli before entering active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party. Meanwhile, Congress appointed Saral Patel as the media coordinator for Wayanad ahead of the by-election with immediate effect",

        "title": "India-China Agreement Explained: After 4 Years Eastern Ladakh Border Standoff Resolves - Key Details",
        "text": "In a significant development that could mark a turning point in India-China relations, China officially confirmed on October 22, 2024, that it had reached a resolution with India to resolve the prolonged border standoff in eastern Ladakh. This breakthrough comes after years of military tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which escalated in 2020 and has remained a source of concern in regional geopolitics.Diplomatic and Military Dialogue Yields ResultsChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced the resolution at a press briefing in Beijing, stating that China and India had been in close communication through both diplomatic and military channels to address the border issues.Over a recent period, China and India have been in close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues related to the China-India border, Lin Jian stated. Now the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters, which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions.While the Chinese government did not provide specifics of the agreement, the news comes as a positive step towards resolving one of the most tense and dangerous flashpoints in the region.Indias Announcement of DisengagementIndia, too, confirmed that the disengagement process with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh had been completed. On October 21, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that an agreement had been reached on restoring patrolling rights along the LAC, a key aspect of the border tension that had been unresolved since the violent clashes in 2020.Jaishankar said, We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed... We will be able to resume the patrolling that we were doing in 2020. I think its a good development.The disengagement likely covers the critical areas of Depsang and Demchok, regions that had been points of contention since the military standoff began over four years ago. These areas hold strategic importance due to their proximity to supply routes and military outposts.The Four-Year-Long Standoff: A Brief OverviewThe border dispute between India and China reached its peak in June 2020, when both nations troops engaged in violent clashes in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops. The skirmish, fought with sticks, stones, and improvised weapons, was the deadliest confrontation between the two countries in over four decades and marked a major escalation in a border conflict that had simmered for decades.Since then, both sides have maintained a heightened military presence along the disputed areas, particularly in eastern Ladakh. While rounds of diplomatic and military talks followed, they failed to produce any tangible results until now. The lack of a clear demarcation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and competing territorial claims have made the situation highly volatile.BRICS Summit and Potential for Improved Bilateral TiesThe announcement of the agreement coincides with the ongoing 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping were expected to discuss bilateral issues on the sidelines of the summit. While the specific details of their conversation are yet to be disclosed, the confirmation of the border agreement points to a broader effort to improve relations between the two Asian giants.When asked about the bilateral meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, We will keep you updated if anything comes up, indicating the possibility of further developments in the India-China relationship.This agreement could serve as a catalyst for broader discussions aimed at stabilizing bilateral ties, which have been strained since the Galwan Valley clashes. Both sides appear keen to avoid further military confrontations and work towards peaceful coexistence, at least in the immediate future.Historical Context of the India-China Border DisputeThe India-China border dispute dates back to the early years of post-colonial India. The two nations share a 3,488-kilometer-long border, much of which is not clearly demarcated, leading to frequent skirmishes and confrontations. The most significant conflict between the two nations occurred in 1962, when China defeated India in a brief but decisive war over disputed territories in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.Since then, tensions have flared periodically, with both sides accusing the other of transgressing into their territory. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash was a stark reminder of how quickly such tensions can escalate into violence, even in an era of nuclear deterrence.The recent standoff in eastern Ladakh added another layer of complexity to the border issue, as both nations were forced to divert military resources to maintain an uneasy peace in the region.Implications of the AgreementThe successful resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff could have far-reaching implications for regional stability. Here are some of the key takeaways:Resumption of Patrolling: India will now be able to resume patrolling in areas along the LAC, particularly in Depsang and Demchok, where both sides had fortified their positions.Easing of Military Tensions: With the disengagement process complete, both India and China can now focus on reducing their military presence in the region, potentially lowering the risk of accidental escalations or clashes.Bilateral Cooperation: The agreement signals a willingness on both sides to resolve disputes through dialogue rather than military force. This could pave the way for broader discussions on trade, security, and regional cooperation.Geopolitical Impact: With both India and China being key players in regional and global politics, their ability to manage bilateral relations peacefully will have a stabilizing effect on South Asia and beyond.Strategic Positioning: The resolution allows India to focus more on other security concerns, such as its borders with Pakistan and internal issues, while China can turn its attention to other geopolitical interests, such as its ambitions in the South China Sea.Future ChallengesWhile the agreement marks a major step forward, several challenges remain. The border between India and China is still not clearly defined, and periodic confrontations could arise in the future. Additionally, the resolution does not address broader territorial claims, such as Chinas claims over Arunachal Pradesh, which remains a contentious issue.The effectiveness of this agreement will depend largely on how both nations implement the disengagement process and manage future disagreements along the LAC. Continued dialogue and trust-building measures will be critical in preventing future flare-ups.Conclusion: A New Chapter in India-China Relations?The resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff is being hailed as a diplomatic victory for both India and China. It marks the end of one of the most tense periods in their bilateral relationship in recent history.

        "title": "PCOS: Watch Out For These Common Myths",
        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age, causing a variety of symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, excessive levels of androgens (male hormones), and the presence of small cysts on the ovaries. The exact cause of PCOS is unclear, but it is often linked to insulin resistance, genetics, and inflammation. Symptoms may include weight gain, acne, hair thinning, and difficulty in conceiving. While PCOS can lead to complications like infertility and metabolic issues, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medical treatments. There are various myths surrounding PCOS, read on to find out the most common ones.\n\nCommon myths about PCOS\n\n1. Myth: PCOS always causes infertility\n\nMany women with PCOS worry that they won't be able to have children. However, PCOS doesn't make pregnancy impossible. It can make conception more difficult due to irregular ovulation, but with proper medical treatment and lifestyle changes, many women with PCOS can conceive.\n\n2. Myth: You need to have cysts on your ovaries to have PCOS\n\nDespite its name, not all women with PCOS have ovarian cysts. The term \"polycystic\" refers to the appearance of the ovaries in some women, but PCOS is primarily a hormonal imbalance and doesn't necessarily require the presence of cysts.\n\n3. Myth: PCOS only affects overweight women\n\nWhile weight gain is a common symptom, PCOS can affect women of all body types. Lean women can also suffer from PCOS and may face challenges related to hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, and insulin resistance.\n\n4. Myth: Weight loss can cure PCOS\n\nWeight loss can help alleviate some symptoms of PCOS, particularly for those who are overweight, but it is not a cure. PCOS is a chronic condition that can be managed but not entirely eliminated. Even women at a healthy weight can have PCOS.\n\n5. Myth: Irregular periods are the only symptom of PCOS\n\nPCOS is more than just irregular periods. It can also cause symptoms such as acne, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), hair thinning, and insulin resistance. The condition affects multiple systems in the body, not just the reproductive system.\n\n6. Myth: PCOS goes away after menopause\n\nPCOS does not disappear after menopause. While some symptoms, like irregular periods, may no longer be an issue, other symptoms such as insulin resistance, metabolic issues, and an increased risk of heart disease can continue into later life.\n\n7. Myth: Birth control pills cure PCOS\n\nBirth control pills are often used to manage PCOS symptoms, such as regulating periods and reducing acne, but they do not cure the condition. They help manage symptoms temporarily, and stopping them usually leads to the return of symptoms.\n\n8. Myth: PCOS is a rare condition\n\nPCOS is actually quite common, affecting about 1 in 10 women worldwide. Many women go undiagnosed because symptoms can vary widely and mimic other conditions, leading to a lack of proper diagnosis and awareness.\n\n9. Myth: Diet alone can fix PCOS\n\nWhile a healthy diet is essential for managing PCOS symptoms, it is not always enough on its own. PCOS often requires a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, hormonal treatments. A balanced diet can improve insulin sensitivity and help with weight management, but it may not resolve all symptoms.\n\nKeep these points in mind if you have or might have PCOS.\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Beirut: Lebanon\u2019s state media reported Israeli airstrikes near the southern city of Tyre on Tuesday, shortly after Israel's military issued an evacuation warning. Video footage showed smoke rising after Israel warned residents of Al-Hawsh, just south of Tyre, to evacuate. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that \"enemy aircraft launched a series of strikes\" on the area. This escalation comes after Lebanon's health ministry revised the death toll from an Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Beirut on Monday night, stating that 13 people, including a child, were killed. The previous estimate had been four. The strike, which took place near the Rafik Hariri Hospital, Lebanon\u2019s largest public health facility, also left 57 people injured and flattened four buildings in the area, according to reports. Rescuers were still searching for survivors under the rubble on Tuesday, as locals described hearing a cell phone ringing beneath the debris. Monday night\u2019s strike followed Israel's evacuation warnings and targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The Ouzai neighborhood, minutes away from the Jnah area, was hit for the first time in the conflict, sparking an exodus of residents. No warnings were issued for the densely populated area around Rafik Hariri Hospital, which has seen an influx of displaced people from southern Lebanon. Lebanese authorities report that nearly a month of war between Israel and Hezbollah has claimed at least 1,489 lives in Lebanon, with more than a million people displaced, many of whom have fled to neighboring Syria. The ongoing conflict has heavily strained shelters and relief efforts. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel to push for a ceasefire, as diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza and Lebanon conflicts continue.",

The police department has been instructed to immediately communicate these orders to all arms license holders. They must ensure that the weapons are returned to their owners in the same condition as they were surrendered after the deposit period ends.\n\nMumbai: MMRDA To Expand Railway Flyover Near Shahad Station On Kalyan-Ahilyanagar Route, Floats \u20b9320 Crore Tender\n\nBritish Man Who Once Tasted Jhal Muri During Kolkata Trip Is Now Viral Chaatwala In London\n\nMumbai: Edutainment Park To Come Up On 4 Acre Land At DN Nagar In Andheri (West)\n\nIndian Airlines Face Bomb Threats On 30 Domestic & International Flights, Authorities On High Alert\n\nPune: Traffic Diversions Announced In City Ahead Of Diwali\n\nAny violation of this order will result in legal action under Section 223 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nFollow us on\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\nPune District Collector Suhas Diwase Orders Surrender Of Licensed Weapons Ahead Of Assembly Polls\n\nAttention Punekars!

She was barely a child of 3.5 years of age, however, instead of showing any love, affection and protection to the victim, the convict, on the contrary, made her a victim of lust,\" it noted.The court found it a \"clear case\" of betrayal.Apart from Pocso law, the man was convicted under Section 376 AB (punishment for committing rape on a woman under 12 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code.In addition to the 20-year RI, the court saddled the convict with Rs 50,000 fine and awarded Rs 1.2 lakh compensation to the minor survivor.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: The Bombay high court refused pre-arrest bail to a man who allegedly thrashed a 71-year-old man on suspicion that the latter was carrying beef on a train both were travelling. A single bench of Justice R N Laddha, in the order dated October 18, refused anticipatory bail to Akash Avhad, while noting that the elderly man was \"mercilessly assaulted\".The high court said that his custodial interrogation may be required as the investigation in the case was at an initial stage.\"The informant (victim), a senior citizen aged about 71 years, was assaulted mercilessly. The investigation is at a nascent stage. Thus, to facilitate further investigation, custodial interrogation of the applicant (Avhad) would be necessary,\" the court was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The court further added that giving relief to Avhad in the form of pre-arrest bail could \"jeopardise the course of effective investigation\".The accused moved court fearing that he may be arrested again as the cops invoked fresh charges against him under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita. The charges included sections mandating punishment if someone intentionally hurts the religious feelings of another person through words, gestures, or objects and dacoity and causes grievous hurt.What is the case?On August 28, the 71-year-old man was travelling from Chalisgaon to Kalyan on the Dhule-CSMT (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) express. Upon the train reaching the Kalyan railway station, when he picked up his bag to alight, a few passengers suspected him of carrying beef and stopped him.Despite explaining what he carried was buffalo meat, which is not banned in Maharashtra, the men abused and thrashed him.The police have claimed that Avhad recorded the assault on his mobile phone.The bench, in its order, noted that the victim was assaulted by five to six unknown men, including Avhad, over a jar of alleged beef.After the incident, the man registered a case at Thane police station. The accused, however, were later released on bail.\"The applicant (Avhad) and the others restrained the informant (victim) from alighting at Kalyan railway station and assaulted and threatened to kill him. Prima facie, there is material to indicate that the applicant assaulted the informant and recorded the assault on his mobile phone,\" the court said.",
        "summary": "The Bombay high court has denied pre-arrest bail to Akash Avhad, accused of assaulting a 71-year-old man on suspicion of carrying beef. The court emphasized that Avhad's custodial interrogation is essential for the ongoing investigation, which involves serious charges including hurting religious sentiments. The victim man registered a case at Thane police station.",

        "title": "Video Does Not Show Shooter of Baba Siddique Giving a Press Conference",
        "text": "A video of a man talking to the press with police personnel around him is circulating on social media. It is being claimed that he shot politician Baba Siddique. Siddique, a close aide of actor Salman Khan and Nationalist Congress Party (Ajit Pawar faction) leader was shot and killed by people allegedly with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang on 12 October. What does the man say?: Speaking to the press, the man said that Siddique was not a good man. He added that there were charges against him under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). It is said that he was associated with Dawood Ibrahim, the man behind the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts. He also added details about the number of members in Bishnoi's gang, how they are contacted and how he became a part of this nexus. (Archives of similar claims can be found here and here.)Fact-Check: Old Clip of Pappu Yadav Crying Falsely Linked to Baba Siddique CaseIs this true?: The person in the video is Yogesh alias Raju, who is allegedly a part of the Bishnoi gang. He was arrested on 16 October in connection to the murder of Nadir Shah, a gym owner in Delhi. Mumbai Police have arrested around 10 individuals in Siddique's case. Yogesh is not named as one of the suspects.Devendra Fadnavis\u2019 Poster With Gun Falsely Linked to Baba Siddique MurderWhat we found: At first, we ran a Google reverse image search on one of the frames of the video and came across the clip on the official X page of News24 from 18 October. We, then, ran a relevant keyword search and came across multiple news reports about an arrest related to a murder case in Delhi. An Indian Express report from 18 October stated that Delhi police arrested the second suspect in the shooting of gym owner Nadir Shah in Greater Kailash-1. The report noted the suspect's name as Yogesh alias Raju, who was apprehended during a short confrontation on the Mathura highway. They mentioned that he suffered a gunshot wound to his left leg during the gun battle and was treated at a facility in the city. The Indian Express quoting police officials stated that Yogesh was part of Bishnoi's nexus. Seven suspects - Akash Yadav, Nitalesh Tiwari, Vishal Verma, Naveen Baliyan, Mohammed Sajid, Pankaj Kumar, and Sachin Yadav had already been arrested. Old Video of Vivek Oberoi Praising Bishnoi Community Viral as RecentDelhi police comments: Taking to its official X page, the capital's police stated that it had arrested the main shooter in the GK gym murder case, with the help of Mathura police. The Special Cell of Delhi Police also posted on its X page, stating. \"Yogesh Raju, a sharp shooter of Lawrence Bishnoi & Hasim Baba gang arrested by Special Cell (SR) in a joint operation with Mathura Police. He was involved in the murder of Nadir Shah of South Delhi. 01 pistol, 07 live cartridges & a stolen bike recovered.\" (sic) Baba Siddique case: Mumbai police have arrested the two alleged shooters Gurmail Baljit Singh (23) and Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap (19), Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23) and Pravin Lonkar. Five other arrests of the following - Nitin Gautam Sapre (32), Sambhaji Kisan Pardhi (44), Pradeep Dattu Thombre (37), Chetan Dilip Pardhi (27), and Ram Fulchand Kanoujia (43) - have been made in the case. However, the alleged primary shooter, Shivkumar Gautam, along with conspirators Shubham Lonkar and Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar, remain at large. Mumbai police has not named Yogesh as one of the suspects. A report by India Today from 19 October stated that he did not have links with Siddique's murder. The Quint has reached out to Delhi police to confirm the same. Conclusion: The person in the video is not related to the murder of Siddique, but the killing of Nadir Shah.

Twenty of them are Muslims.\n\nThey were asked to vacate their properties in three days as per provisions of the Road Control Act, 1964.\n\nOne of the shops that received an eviction notice belongs to 62-year-old jeweller Abdul Hameed, who was allegedly involved in the killing of a 22-year-old named Ram Gopal Mishra last Sunday.\n\nThe incident led to riots in Bahraich. A total of 104 people have been arrested in connection with the violence.\n\nIn response to a petition challenging the notices, the Supreme Court cautioned the state\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party government against carrying out any demolition works in violation of its past orders.\n\nOn September 17, the Supreme Court stayed all demolitions in the country until further notice without its permission. In a subsequent hearing, the court said: \u201cWe will clarify demolition can\u2019t be carried out merely because someone is an accused or convict.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they [Uttar Pradesh government] want to take risk of flouting our order, it\u2019s their choice,\u201d said the bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan on Tuesday.\n\nThe Allahabad High Court on Sunday granted 15 days to the 23 residents to respond to the demolition notices. The High Court is scheduled to hear a plea filed in connection with the demolition notices on Wednesday.\n\nThere are no provisions in Indian law that allow for the demolition of property as a punitive measure. Nevertheless, the practice has become commonplace mainly in states ruled by the BJP.\n\nAuthorities in four BJP-ruled states and one Aam Aadmi Party-governed state punitively bulldozed 128 structures, mostly belonging to Muslims, between April 2022 and June 2022, human rights group Amnesty International said in a report in February.\n\nAnother FIR filed based on complaint by BJP MLA\n\nThe police in Bahraich have registered another FIR related to the communal violence, bringing the number of cases to 12, officials said on Monday.\n\nThe latest case, based on a complaint by Sureshwar Singh, the BJP MLA from Mahasi. The FIR names seven individuals including the Hindutva party\u2019s city youth wing chief Arpit Srivastava, for rioting and other charges.\n\nSingh has alleged that Srivastava led a mob that attacked his group on October 13 when Mishra\u2019s body was being taken to a mortuary. This led to clashes in which stones were thrown and guns fired.\n\nSingh urged the police to review security camera footage to identify more rioters involved in the clashes.\n\nThe FIR, registered on October 18, names Srivastava, Anuj Singh Raikwar, Shubham Mishra, Kushmendra Chaudhary, Manish Chandra Shukla, Pundrik Pandey and Sudhanshu Singh Rana.",

        "text": "With a semifinal spot already secured, India will look to reaffirm their dominance when they take on Bangladesh in their final Group A match of the SAFF Women's Championship in Kathmandu on Wednesday. For Bangladesh, this is a do-or-die clash. A win would crown them group champions, while a defeat would see Pakistan advance to the semifinals, with a superior goal difference. Pakistan, also on four points, would join India in the semifinals if the Blue Tigresses triumph. A draw would leave Bangladesh as group runners-up with four points, but they need a victory to top the group.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The Blue Tigresses clinched their place in the semifinals with a commanding 5-2 victory over Pakistan but now their focus shifts to topping the group and avenging a painful memory of 2022.In that edition, Bangladesh dealt a shocking blow on India by ending their unbeaten streak in the championship with a decisive 3-0 win in the group stage.It marked the first time India had lost to their South Asian rivals in SAFF history, and the Blue Tigresses will be eager to set the record straight.\"We have faced Bangladesh before, and we watched their last game against Pakistan. Our sole focus now is to win this match,\" skipper Bala Devi said.\"We have both senior and young players and we are prepared to push for a win. We have had productive training sessions, and I hope we can put what we have practiced into action.\" \"As the captain, I aim to lead by example and support the team in every way. Bangladesh has some fast and youthful players, but I believe our mental strength gives us an edge, which will be crucial in tomorrow's game,\" added the 34-year-old from Manipur.Head coach Santosh Kashyap has led the team through five days of training in Kathmandu, preparing for the challenges that lie ahead against Bangladesh.He has carefully assessed all the potential threats posed by the opposition.\"Tomorrow's match will be challenging, as Bangladesh are a strong side with a foreign coach and have solid tactical plans. Although we have already booked a spot in the semi-finals, we are taking it one game at a time, aiming to win every match.\"I prefer playing attacking football because it's not only effective but also entertaining for everyone. It's a style that I, as well as the players, enjoy, and we will try to maintain that momentum,\" Kashyap said.Defender Dalima Chhibber, who was named the Most Valuable Player in the 2019 SAFF Women's Championship, is making her return to the tournament after missing the 2022 edition.She was absent last time due to playing three seasons in Canada, but now she's back and ready to compete in the SAFF Championship once again.Bangladesh and Pakistan are currently tied on one point each after a 1-1 draw in their group-stage match.For Bangladesh, the absence of coach Golam Rabbani Choton, along with key players like defender Akhi Khatun and Anai Mogini, will be felt.However, the team have brought in fresh talents, including young players such as Afeida Khandakar, Matsushima Sumaya, and Airin Khatun.\"We are coming up against an Indian team, who, in my opinion, are probably the best team in the tournament,\" Bangladesh head coach Peter Butler said.\"They are very disciplined and organised in their manner and their demeanour of actually how they walk around the hotel. I think it'll be quite an attacking game. The most important thing is to try and share out the workload with all our players.\"It's a do or die game. It's a game we don't want to lose. India's already booked their semi-final berth and I'm quietly optimistic,\" he added.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

This facility is said to become useful for enabling UPI payments in emergencies and isolated regions. It is also rolling out an encrypted communications platform for government and relief agencies which may come in use in times of crisis. This service will leverage balloon-based and drone-based systems to widen the coverage in disaster-struck areas.\r\n\r\nThe telecom provider has also announced a partnership with C-DAC for the introduction of a private 5G network for mining services. It will enable artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT applications in underground and opencast mines. The high-speed, low latency connectivity is claimed to benefit safety analytics, real-time control of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), remote maintenance courtesy of augmented reality (AR), and fleet tracking and optimisation.\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "Eight students from Balochistan have reportedly gone missing from their shared residence in Gulistan-i-Jauhar in Pakistan\u2019s biggest city Karachi, according to a report by Dawn. Family members allege that law enforcement agencies \u201ctook away\u201d the students, but police have declined to comment on these allegations.According to reports, the missing students\u2013Shoaib Ali, Haneef, Ishfaq , Shahzad, Bebarg Ameer, Zubair, Qambar Ali, and Saeedullah disappeared on October 16. Three of them are enrolled at Karachi University, three attend a seminary, one is an intermediate student, and another studies at Urdu University. Families maintain that the students were picked up by law enforcement from their residence in Rustam Zikri Goth.Talking to Dawn, Wazir Ahmed, the elder brother of missing student Qambar Ali, stated, \u201cQambar is an intermediate student in Mashkey, Awaran, but he was taking coaching classes at a tuition academy near Nipa.\u201d He, along with the families of other missing students, approached the police on October 17, but the SHO refused to file their report. Ahmed emphasised that they have no political affiliations or involvement in any suspicious activities, demanding the immediate release of the students.In response to the situation, Riaz Ahmed, a member of the Karachi University syndicate, condemned the disappearances, stating, \u201cIt is horrifying that students are apprehended and made to disappear without charges. Young students should not be subjected to the harsh realities of state actions.\u201dThe issue of enforced appearances is a significant human rights concern that reflects the broader challenges facing the region. In Balochistan, enforced disappearances have been reported extensively, with individuals, often activists, political leaders, and students, going missing under mysterious circumstances, frequently attributed to state security forces or non-state actors.These disappearances create a climate of fear and insecurity, impacting the social fabric of communities. Families of the disappeared face immense challenges, including emotional distress and a lack of access to justice. The government has been criticized for its insufficient response to these cases, with many families left without answers about the fate of their loved ones.",

While 293.81 kg of heroin was seized from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port (Navi Mumbai) by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Delhi police Special Cell had impounded 352.71 kg of drugs from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana.\n\nAccording to the ED, the arrested people coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. \n\n\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder. The accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED uncovered a highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions and operational expenses by the accused has been made, said the agency. \n\nThe accused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. \n\n\u201cThe syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local market. Further, the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles...from second-hand market for supplying the drugs from the storage hubs to other points of distribution,\u201d said an official. \n\nThe agency said cash was used for purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities. \n\n\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via Nava Sheva port, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri (Madhya Pradesh) and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. The transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED has attached a property in Jandoli village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of the accused and fixed deposits.",

        "text": "Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) president Anbumani Ramadoss on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) urged the State government to drop the Transport Department\u2019s proposal to hire and operate private buses on a contractual basis during the Deepavali festival, expressing concern that it would lead to privatisation.\n\nIn a statement, he said the State government had announced last month that it would operate private buses on a contractual basis during festivals to cater to the needs of commuters. \u201cTransport Minister S.S. Sivasankar had recently announced that the Department would operate private buses by hiring them at \u20b951.25 per kilometre on a rental basis for the Deepavali festival. Operating private buses on behalf of the State government under the guise of people\u2019s convenience cannot be allowed,\u201d Mr. Anbumani said.\n\n\u201cThough the State government had said it would operate only a limited number of private buses, the reasons given by it are false. The private buses will be operated on a Gross Cost Contract basis. Initially, this system will be implemented only on additional buses. But in the future, it is likely that when there is a need to replace old buses operated by transport corporations, they will be replaced by private buses without purchasing new buses,\u201d he alleged.\n\nHe further said: \u201cLack of buses has been created only to impose private buses onto transport corporations. After the DMK came to power, it ordered 8,182 buses but procured only 1,088 buses. Why is there a delay in purchasing new buses?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the State government has any real intention to develop the transport corporations, it should allocate sufficient funds to purchase buses and recruit drivers and conductors,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "The Caribbean nation of Cuba has been left reeling in the aftermath of Hurricane Oscar, with at least six lives lost and large parts of the country plunged into an ongoing electricity blackout. The capital city of Havana has been largely paralyzed for several days as residents and business struggle without power. Other regions are now bracing for a fourth night without lights as repair efforts continue.\n\nHurricane Oscar made landfall on Cuba's eastern coast over the weekend as a tropical storm, bringing strong winds and heavy rains. In its wake, preliminary reports indicate at least six deaths have occurred. Beyond loss of life, the hurricane has exacerbated an existing energy crisis on the island. A massive outage first hit on Thursday and remains unresolved, halting daily activities across Cuba. The prolonged lack of power has renewed frustrations among some in the population.\n\nIn a handful of neighborhoods in Havana, small protests have emerged. Demonstrators have been heard banging pots and pans in the streets or staging demonstrations from their balconies. One group blocked a road using garbage in an apparent expression of discontent. The demonstrations come amidst a time of deep economic troubles in Cuba, which some partially attribute to a long-standing US embargo. Though small so far, any unrest is being closely monitored by authorities.\n\nCuba's Energy Minister stated hopes that reliable electricity may return in the next couple days. However, damage from both the hurricane and pre-existing infrastructure problems could prolong the blackout. Schools and many workplaces will also stay closed through mid-week. Officials are asking the public to conserve power however possible until full restoration is achieved. Meanwhile, residents do what they can to cope with the aftermath of the deadly storm and resulting drawn out period in the dark.",

        "title": "'Sexually Abused Minors Most Vulnerable; Statutory Rights Key to Empowerment': Allahabad HC Denies Bail to Man Accused of Trafficking Daughter",
        "text": "The Allahabad High Court recently emphasised the critical importance of ensuring statutory rights for child victims under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, stating that realisation of these rights is the key to empowering them to engage with the legal process on a fair footing.\nWhile hearing a bail plea in a child abuse case, the court expressed concern that the victim, despite being a minor entitled to multiple protections under the POCSO Act, had not been made aware of her rights. The case records revealed that no support person or legal aid was provided, and the State failed to ensure the victim had access to government schemes, medical care, or counselling services.\nThe bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot remarked that child victims of sexual abuse belong to the most vulnerable class of citizens. They are often hindered in their pursuit of justice by circumstances such as trauma, social marginalisation, poverty, and a lack of legal awareness, it added.\nThe court observed that without the support systems guaranteed by the POCSO Act, child victims are unable to prosecute their cases effectively.\nEmpowering these victims, the court stressed, is vital to dismantling the barriers that impede their search for justice, and this can only be achieved by ensuring the enforcement of their statutory rights, the single-judge bench emphasised.\nThe court further emphasised that authorities\u2014including the police, Child Welfare Committees (CWC), District Legal Services Authorities, and medical and administrative bodies\u2014are obligated under the POCSO Act to provide victims with essential support services, such as legal aid, medical specialists, and access to government welfare schemes.\nThe court also noted that the responsibility is cast on the courts/magistrates considering the bail applications in POCSO offences to ensure that entitlements of the victims are provided and the rights conferred by the said enactment are enforced.\nJustice Bhanot pointed out that the rights and entitlements of victims under the POCSO Act must be safeguarded not only during bail proceedings but throughout the trial process.\nHe stressed that Child Welfare Committees, medical authorities, and police officials must be brought under the jurisdiction of the trial courts to ensure they fulfil their statutory duties.\nThese bodies must submit reports detailing the support provided to victims, and trial courts are legally bound to review these reports and ensure compliance with the POCSO Act, the court stressed.\n\u201cThe above mandate of the POCSO Act has to be rigorously followed and meticulously implemented,\u201d the court said.\nThe court warned that the current implementation is inadequate and risks frustrating the legislative intent behind the law. \u201cLegislation cannot be reduced to a dead letter by the apathy of the statutory authorities\u201d, it said.\nAccordingly, the court directed the Uttar Pradesh Secretary of the Department of Women and Child Development to create standardised formats for the reports that Child Welfare Committees must submit during bail hearings.\nThese reports should detail the support extended to victims, including counselling, legal aid, and access to government schemes. The court also ordered that regular training programs be conducted for CWC members to ensure compliance with the Act.\nIn the case at hand, the court denied bail to Rajendra Prasad, who is accused of trafficking his 14-year-old daughter for sexual exploitation.\nPrasad, who had been in custody since November 2022, had applied for bail on charges under Sections 376 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 16 and 17 of the POCSO Act.\nThe court rejected his bail application, citing the victim\u2019s vulnerability and the fact that she had identified Prasad as the principal offender who trafficked her for money.",

        "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday had a light-hearted moment when a lawyer accidentally referred to Justice Hrishikesh Roy as Justice Hrishikesh Mukherjee, mixing up the judge\u2019s name with that of the legendary filmmaker. Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud immediately corrected the lawyer, reminding him that it's essential for an advocate to know the names of the judges. While referring a previous case, the lawyer said, \"This matter was before Justice Hrishikesh Mukherjee.\" Chandrachud, quick to step in, humorously responded, \u201cHrishikesh Mukherjee or Justice Hrishikesh Roy? If you make Roy into Mukherjee, then... you must know your judges. This is the limit. Please go and check the website.\u201d The mix-up was particularly amusing because Hrishikesh Mukherjee is one of Indian cinema's most beloved filmmakers, known for his timeless films like Anand, Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Guddi, Bawarchi, and Abhimaan. His movies, which blended humor, emotion, and subtle social commentary, continue to be adored across generations. Justice Hrishikesh Roy, who took oath as a Supreme Court judge in September 2019, has had a distinguished career. Before his Supreme Court appointment, he served as the Chief Justice of Kerala High Court and as a judge in the Gauhati High Court. Prior to his judicial role, he was a senior lawyer. Despite the amusing slip-up, the Chief Justice's light correction ensured the moment ended with a smile, adding a touch of humor to the court proceedings.",

The parody account mocks Sitharaman's role as the finance minister and there was mixed reaction towards it from the netizens.

The bio reads: \"\u201cI don\u2019t believe in love at first sight, but I do believe in GST on everything you own. I\u2019ve raised more taxes than your ex raised red flags. Swipe right if you're into women who can deduct happiness, itemize suffering, and maximize your stress. I'm not your girlfriend; I'm your liability.\" The profile has more quirky description.

        "text": "Uncertainty shocks for India tend to mimic aggregate supply shocks, with heightened uncertainty leading to slower growth but higher inflation, said RBI Deputy Governor Michael D Patra, even as he emphasised that this presents a dilemma for monetary policy -- tighten to control high inflation or ease to respond to lower growth.\n\n Applying a one standard deviation shock to the (text mining-based policy uncertainty) index in a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework on quarterly data for India produces an interesting result. In the case of advanced economies such as the US, research suggests that uncertainty shocks lead to lower output and lower prices.\n\nAlso read: RBI imposes restrictions on Asirvad Micro Finance, Arohan Financial Services, DMI Finance and Navi Finserv\n\n \u201cIn the Indian context, however, uncertainty shocks tend to mimic aggregate supply shocks such that heightened uncertainty leads to slower growth but higher inflation\u201d Patra said in his inaugural address at the New York Fed Central Banking Seminar organised by the Federal Reserve Bank, New York, USA.\n\nIndia\u2019s time has come\n\nThe Deputy Governor emphasised that he does believe with all the strength of his conviction that India\u2019s time has come. \n\n \u201cIndia heads into its future with the youngest population in the world with a median age of 28 years. Unlike in many parts of the world, the working age population is growing \u2013 every sixth working age person is an Indian,\u201d he said. \n\nPatra noted that since independence in 1947, India\u2019s growth path has undergone three structural shifts with trend growth, having risen to 7 per cent during 2002-2019. \n\nAlso read: India\u2019s overall growth outlook remains strong despite temporary dip in momentum: RBI Bulletin\n\n After the severe contraction in the pandemic, a new growth trajectory averaging 8 per cent seems to be forming during 2021-24, he added. \n\nGrowth to revert to 8% trend\n\n \u201cIndia is now regarded as the fastest growing major economy in the world. Already the fifth largest economy in terms of market exchange rates, it is poised to become the third largest economy by 2030.\n\n \u201cIt is already the third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. Our projections show that India\u2019s real GDP growth will be 7.2 per cent in 2024-25 and around 7.0 per cent in 2025-26 in a cyclical correction to the rebound from the pandemic. Thereafter, there is a strong likelihood that India\u2019s growth will revert to the 8 per cent trend,\u201d he said.\n\nPrice pressures\n\n Patra observed that the front-loaded monetary policy tightening with a cumulative 250 basis points (bps) increase in the policy rate and a stance of withdrawal of accommodation guided inflation down to an average of 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 -- back into the tolerance band (2-6 per cent). \n\n \u201cIt is projected to average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 and 4.1 per cent in 2025-26. Inflation fell below (4 pe per cent) target during July-August but rose to 5.5 per cent in September on the back of a pickup in price momentum in some food items and adverse base effects inherent in year-on-year measurement. \n\nAlso read: MPC keeps repo rate unchanged; changes stance to neutral\n\n \u201cOur projection indicates that these price pressures will persist in October and November before headline inflation realigns with the target from December 2024 and remains aligned in 2025-26,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "No questions please: Kamala Harris mocked for holding 'staged' townhall",
        "text": "Former California first lady and journalist Maria Shriver recently disclosed that only pre-arranged questions were allowed to be posed to Vice President Kamala Harris during a town hall event held in Michigan on Monday.At the Oakland County event, a woman in the audience inquired if it would be possible to ask a question, just before Harris was set to appear alongside former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, according to the Daily Mail. Shriver responded by informing her that audience members would not be allowed to ask questions, as there were already pre-determined questions. Shriver added that she hoped to raise some questions that might be on the audience's minds.A video clip of Shriver\u2019s exchange soon went viral on social media, leading to widespread criticism. Many users remarked that the event appeared more like a staged production rather than a genuine town hall, where candidates typically engage with unscripted questions from voters. Comments on X (formerly Twitter) were filled with scepticism, with one user remarking that the event resembled a \"stage production\" rather than an authentic town hall, claiming that Harris was unable to handle spontaneous interactions.\u2014 TimMurtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) Fox News political analyst Brit Hume similarly criticised the format, while other users referred to the event as a \u201cprepped answer show,\u201d indicating their frustration at the lack of genuine interaction. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even went so far as to say the event was no longer pretending to hide its scripted nature.During the hour-long event, Harris took just three questions from the audience, while Shriver praised Cheney as a courageous public servant. Shriver later took to social media, expressing her view that the event embodied what prioritising the country over party politics looked like.Harris held a similar town hall with Cheney in Wisconsin, moderated by anti-Trump commentator Charlie Sykes, although it remains unclear if the questions in that forum were also pre-determined. Harris's campaign has not responded to requests for comment on the matter.The criticism surrounding this town hall ties into the broader challenge Harris has faced during media appearances. Venture capitalist David Sacks predicted a \u201cdoom loop\u201d scenario for Harris, suggesting that if she falls behind in the polls, she will be forced to give more media interviews, which could, in turn, lead to further declines in her polling numbers due to her difficulty in handling interviews. He pointed out that this could exacerbate her already existing issues with public perception.Harris\u2019s recent media engagements, including an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, have been particularly challenging. In this interview, Harris appeared unprepared on key issues such as immigration and President Biden\u2019s mental fitness. Critics argued that her inability to address these concerns effectively and her tendency to deflect difficult questions highlighted the difficulties she faces when under media scrutiny. As this cycle continues, it has become increasingly evident that engaging with the press could further harm her standing unless she manages to deliver a strong, confident performance.",

        "text": "Mysuru, Oct 22 (IANS) Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah asked people will they tolerate false allegations against him while also accusing the BJP and JD-S of making false allegations against him (Siddaramaiah) in connection with the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) and Valmiki tribal welfare cases, \n\n\u201cCan anyone point to a single instance where I took even a rupee as a bribe? Will you tolerate these false allegations against me which the BJP & JD-S is making against me in MUDA case,\u201d said the Chief Minister while inaugurating and laying the foundation for development works worth Rs 501.81 crores in the Varuna constituency, which he represents.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI have served as a minister for 45 years without a single stain on my record. Being from the backward classes, the fact that I became Chief Minister twice has caused envy in the BJP. I have been Chief Minister twice, yet I do not own a single house in Mysuru. I live in Mariswamy\u2019s house. I\u2019ve been building a house on Kuvempu Road for three years, but it\u2019s still not completed. It is you who give me the respect I have. I stand before you with honesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my masters. You are my true owners. Your blessings are my true protection,\u201d he underlined.\n\nHe added that no matter how envious the BJP and JD-S leaders are, his reputation will not be diminished. \u201c\n\n\u201cMy respect comes from the people of Varuna and the people of this state,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nHe said that as long as the people of the state are with him, he will not be afraid of the conspiracies of the BJP and JD-S.\n\n\u201cI will defeat all their plots. I will not bow down to their games, nor will I step back from the cause of social justice,\u201d said the Chief Minister.\n\nHe added that he has been blessed by the people of Varuna Constituency to become the Chief Minister twice.\n\n\u201cVaruna is a stronghold of the Congress. Even in the Lok Sabha elections, you gave more votes to the Congress than to the BJP. I am immensely grateful to the voters of this constituency for their special support,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further stated that continuous funding has been provided for the development of the Varuna constituency.\n\nHe claimed that whenever the Congress government has been in power, they have implemented programmes to empower the poor across the state, not just in Varuna.\n\n\u201cAlong with introducing many welfare schemes, we have waived off loans from several corporations. In line with Ambedkar\u2019s vision, we have created and implemented programmes to provide economic empowerment to the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe claimed that even after becoming the Chief Minister for the second time, we have introduced five guarantee schemes designed to support the poor and middle class of all castes and religions.\n\n\u201cThrough these guarantees, we are directly transferring Rs 56,000 crores into the accounts of the people every year. Our party, the Congress, is a party that does what it says,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nLashing out at the BJP, Siddaramaiah said that whether it\u2019s the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government at the Centre or former Chief Ministers B.S. Yediyurappa, Basavaraj Bommai, or Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, they looted without contributing to the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is an opponent of social justice and the poor. Can you point to a single instance where the Central government, which has come to power three times, has followed through on its promises? In all his years as Prime Minister, has the union government implemented a single scheme that benefits the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that Karnataka contributes the highest taxes to the Central government.\n\n\u201cShould we beg to receive our rightful share? Recently, the central government gave Uttar Pradesh and Bihar the largest share of taxes but only gave our state a paltry Rs 6,000 crores, which is a gross injustice. This cannot be tolerated,\u201d he said.\n\nSiddaramaiah also criticised Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, saying that she had recommended Rs 5,495 crores for irrigation projects and special grants for the state but didn\u2019t release the funds.\n\n\u201cShe also announced Rs 3,000 crores for peripheral road development and lake improvement in the state but has not released a single rupee. Is it wrong for the people of the state to speak out against this injustice? Is it wrong for us to protest,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Multiple Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) schools nationwide received hoax bomb threats late on Monday night, sources said. The schools affected by the hoax threats include two in Delhi--one in Rohini and another in Dwarka--as well as one in Hyderabad. Sources indicate that the threats were communicated through email to the management of these institutions. Authorities are investigating the incident, with the matter being reviewed by higher officials from various organizations, including the CRPF, Intelligence Bureau, and Delhi Police. The threat email specified a potential bomb blast in the classrooms of these schools at 11 am on Tuesday. However, the threat has since been determined to be a hoax. The hoax threat was received a day after the blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi's Rohini on Sunday for which a pro-Khalistani group claimed responsibility that sent shockwaves through the national capital. Delhi Police reached out to social media platforms and the messaging app Telegram, requesting details about the channel where the post was made, and the matter is being investigated. The Sunday blast in the Prashant Vihar school was so powerful that it tore through the wall of the school. No injuries were reported in the incident however some of the nearby buildings and vehicles were damaged. Such hoax bomb threats on domestic and international flights have been received for several days. So far this week, more than 90 flights have received bomb threats and most of them have turned out to be hoaxes. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) Director General Zulfiqar Hasan on Monday met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan and apprised him about the recent hoax bomb threats in domestic and international flights. In the nearly half-an-hour meeting with the Home Ministry, both the DGs informed the Home Secretary about a series of recent hoax calls threatening domestic and international flights that has created panic situations on many occasions forcing the officials in the Indian aviation sector, intelligence wing, and other departments to go through rigorous security check process. Sources said that the officials discussed the potential implications for aviation security and measures being taken to address the situation, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and coordination among security agencies.",

PM Modi arrived in Kazan earlier in the day and was welcomed at the airport by Rustam Minnikhanov, the head of the Republic of Tatarstan. The summit brings together leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa to discuss important global issues under the theme \"Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security.\" During the meeting, PM Modi emphasized the need for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. He reiterated India's stance on promoting dialogue and diplomacy as the path to resolving the war, which has been ongoing for two years. \u201cI have been in constant touch with you regarding the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As I have said earlier, we believe that the problems should be resolved in a peaceful manner. We fully support the early establishment of peace and stability. All our efforts give priority to humanity,\u201d PM Modi stated, adding that India is ready to provide any possible cooperation for peace efforts. #WATCH | Russia: Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets and holds a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Kazan on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS Summit. (Source: Host Broadcaster) pic.twitter.com/FARmZH7T0U \u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 22, 2024 The Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Kazan aims to strengthen India-Russia relations further, building on the \"Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership\" shared between the two nations. The bilateral meeting also follows last month's acknowledgment by Putin, who called Modi a \"friend\" and expressed gratitude for India's support in seeking a peaceful end to the war. The invitation to attend the BRICS Summit was extended during this time, and it comes after PM Modi had urged Putin to work towards a resolution in a call two months ago. In August, Modi had also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, underlining India's balanced diplomatic efforts to foster peace. In addition to meeting Putin, PM Modi is expected to hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other BRICS leaders during the summit. The summit offers a crucial platform to discuss global developmental issues, climate change, economic cooperation, supply chain resilience, and cultural exchanges among member nations. A significant development occurred just before the summit when India and China agreed to resume patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, marking a breakthrough in their strained diplomatic relations. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri indicated that efforts were underway to arrange a meeting between PM Modi and President Xi during the summit. This visit to Russia marks Modi's second trip to the country this year. In July, he attended the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit in Moscow, where he not only engaged in bilateral talks but was also awarded Russia's highest civilian honor, the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle. The two-day BRICS Summit provides a valuable opportunity for leaders to evaluate the progress of initiatives and explore future collaboration, especially amid ongoing global unrest, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East crisis.

The court expressed concern over the speed and manner in which Tuteja was summoned and arrested.During the hearing, the Supreme Court asked the ED to clarify the process it followed in summoning Tuteja, particularly why there was an apparent rush in serving the summons and taking him into custody. The court was responding to Tuteja\u2019s plea challenging the Chhattisgarh High Court's refusal to quash the corruption and money laundering charges against him.The court noted that Tuteja was already being questioned by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) when the ED issued its summons. The first summons was served at noon, and another followed just a few hours later. \u201cPlease explain to us this procedure. He is in the ACB office, ED issues summons at 12.00 pm and then 5.30 pm. What is this hurry?\u201d the bench questioned.The justices further asked why the ED insisted on summoning Tuteja at a specific time, despite knowing he was being interrogated by ACB officers. The court sought an explanation from the probe agency regarding why officers from the ACB escorted Tuteja to the ED\u2019s office and whether he appeared voluntarily.Tuteja\u2019s counsel informed the court that his client was questioned by the ED throughout the night. Expressing disapproval, the court remarked, \u201cWhat kind of practice is this? Full night the person is interrogated.

        "text": "Sudhakar Adapa, founder and CEO of BIA Brands, explained the difference between e-commerce and quick commerce and how quick commerce will have to be 'not so quick' to become sustainable. \"E-commerce is thriving these days while quick commerce or q commerce is probably the new version of e-commerce. The fundamentals of business are going to be the same, it's just about how we are going to deliver, that is going to change,\" Mr Adapa said at the NDTV World Summit 2024.He also said the definition of quick will have to change for the model to be sustainable.\"Is quick commerce going to be a sustainable thing? I would say yes and no. Yes, because it will be another kind of commerce which will survive but I think the definition of quick will change. Right now the consumer wants everything to be delivered in under 10 minutes and if you say 20 minutes, the consumer will say I can't wait for 10 more minutes. India has a huge population density which is why it is one of the few countries where quick commerce worked. But, I think the definition of quick will change from 10 minutes to 60 minutes because not everything can be delivered in 10 minutes time. If this model has to be sustainable it will become not-so-quick commerce,\" he said.Mr Adapa said that in today's day and age social media has become a potent weapon for brands: \"The use of social media is across all the sectors. As brands, if we have to survive then social media has become a potent weapon and the advantage of private labels is such that it is actually giving space to smaller brands to compete with Unilever and P&Gs of the world. For example, if I had to launch a cosmetics brand 10 years ago, you need to own a brand, you need to formulate yourself, you need to have a manufacturing plant, a quality control department, you need to control R&D, the whole ecosystem has huge costs and it's not feasible for a small entrepreneur to launch a company. Now today if you want to launch a beauty brand, all you need to do is maybe go to a contract manufacturer, make some sampling, get some 1,000 pieces up, put it up online and boom you have a brand. It has become so easy these days.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");He, however, also stressed that \"everything has its own advantages and disadvantages\".\"The advantage is that you could pull your company with no capital, if you have a great product, you could build a company with almost next to nothing. The flip side is the kind of competition is there in the market. Differentiation has become really difficult for us. But the good thing is that the customers are spoilt for choice. they have great products and great prices there. Customers are making merry at the time, enjoying the great discounts,\" Mr Adapa said.",

Charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) were filed, including conspiracy and promoting enmity. Gogoi was charged under UAPA Section 18 (conspiracy) and IPC Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 153A (promoting enmity), and 153B (assertions prejudicial to national integration). His associates, Dhaijya Konwar, Bittu Sonowal, and Manash Konwar, faced similar charges. However, the court rejected NIA's suggestions to invoke UAPA Section 39 (support for terrorism) and IPC Section 124A (sedition). Reacting to it, Gogoi said, \u201cThis again proves that we are with the people and this government wants us to be kept inside the jail. The fight against a fascist and communal government is a very troublesome and expensive affair.\u201d He said that all four will approach the Gauhati High Court against the framing of charges against them.

The team management will be closely examining the optimal squad composition to ensure a competitive performance.With spin all-rounder Washington Sundar being added to the squad, and Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant have been declared fit for the Pune game, the spotlight will be on the playing eleven selected for this crucial encounter, as Team India aims to level the three-match series.Young Sarfaraz Khan, who replaced injured Gill, scored a brilliant 150 in the second-innings of the first Test, while KL Rahul remained off-colour in both the innings.Will Gill is all set to return in the Pune Test, India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate categorically stated that it is a battle between Sarfaraz and Rahul as both are fighting for a place in the XI.\"Yeah, there's no point in sugarcoating it, there's a fight for a spot,\" Ten Doeschate said at the presser, ahead of India's training session, when asked if Rahul and Sarfaraz were battling for a place in the team.\"Sarfaraz was obviously brilliant in the last Test. I went to KL after the last Test (and) said how many balls do you play at (and) miss at? He didn't play at (and) miss at one ball and that's what tends to happen when you're not getting runs.\"There's certainly no concerns about KL, he's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space. But we are certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team,\" he said.Admitting that it's difficult to exclude Rahul from the Test format equation, ten Doeschate revealed that head coach Gautam Gambhir is \"eager\" to give him an extended run.\"It's not like we're worried about his form. If you go on just the past three months since Gauti has been in here, he's keen to give him (Rahul) as much rope as we can. We have a lot of faith in him,\" Ten Doeschate said.\"But at the same time, it's a very competitive environment, with Sarfaraz getting 150 plus runs (222 not out) in the Irani Trophy final.

He had already spoken thrice and wanted to get a chance again during the presentation. But BJP MP Abhijit Gangopadhyay objected. This ensued a heated exchange between them, where sources said both used abusive language. \nMeanwhile, Kalyan Banerjee picked up a glass water bottle, hit it on the table and hurt himself. After this, he threw the broken bottle towards the chairman. Due to the incident, the meeting adjourned for some time. Soon after, Banerjee was taken for medical aid, wherein he received four stitches in his hand. \nIn today\u2019s meeting, the committee is hearing views and suggestions from representatives of Justice in Reality and Panchasakha Prachar, both based in Cuttack, Odisha. \nA delegation of five MPs from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is also presenting their perspectives on the bill. \nThe committee met on Monday, inviting officials from the Ministry of Minority Affairs to provide oral evidence regarding the bill. This meeting is part of a larger national initiative to address long-standing issues related to the management of waqf properties.On Monday, discussions during the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) meeting became heated as opposition members questioned the consultative process behind the legislation. \nThey accused the government of introducing the bill for political reasons, alleging it targeted the Muslim community. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi presented a nearly one-hour critique of the bill, raising concerns about its implications. Trinamool Congress leader Kalyan Banerjee even asked whether Waqf, which exists in the name of Allah, is legally recognized by the state. Despite the tensions, BJP members defended the bill, arguing that it is necessary for reforming Waqf property management and ensuring transparency. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to bring significant reforms, including digitization of records, stricter audits, increased transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied waqf properties. \n(Note: Only the headline has been reworked by the India.com staff; the rest of the content has been taken from ANI.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "Samsung India Electronics Private Limited (SIEPL) on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) claimed it had suffered a loss to the tune of around $100 million due to the recent strike by a section of employees, who wanted their trade union \u2014 Samsung India Thozhilalar Sangam, affiliated with the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) \u2014 to be registered. \n\nAppearing before Justice R.N. Manjula, who was seized of a writ petition filed by P. Ellan, general secretary of the new trade union, senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing SIEPL, contended that trade unions could not be allowed to use the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their name since their activities would affect the company\u2019s reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, advocate N.G.R. Prasad, representing the writ petitioner, contended it was not a trademark dispute for the company to raise objections over the use of its name by a trade union. He said SIEPL was not a necessary party to the writ petition and hence, its impleading petition must be dismissed.\n\nMr. Prasad also told the court that Samsung was a South Korea-based multinational manufacturing conglomerate and that even over there, its trade unions had been using the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their names. He argued the present writ petition was only between the trade union and the Registrar of Trade Unions.\n\nHowever, Mr. Rajagopalan said SIEPL must necessarily be impleaded as a respondent to the writ petition, seeking a direction to the Registrar to register the trade union, and permitted to file a detailed counter-affidavit explaining as to why trade unions could not use the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their names.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, the judge allowed the impleading application filed by SIEPL and granted it time till November 11 to file its counter-affidavit to the writ petition. She observed that the company must be given an opportunity to make its submissions to the plea for registering the trade union.",

The statement further said that the expansion of BRICS with the addition of new members last year has added to its inclusivity and agenda for the global good. \"Building upon the Annual Summit held in July 2024 in Moscow, my visit to Kazan will further reinforce the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia. I look forward to meeting other leaders from BRICS as well,\" the PMO statement said. The 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan is being held under the chairmanship of Russia from October 22-24. During his visit, PM Modi is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from BRICS member countries and invited leaders in Kazan. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said, \"The Summit, themed 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security,' will provide an important platform for leaders to discuss key global issues.\" It further said, \"The Summit will offer a valuable opportunity to assess the progress of initiatives launched by BRICS and to identify potential areas for future collaboration.\" This visit marks, PM Modi's second visit to Russia this year. He travelled to Moscow in July to attend the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit where he held a bilateral meeting with President Putin. He was also conferred with Russia's highest civilian award, the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle at the Kremlin in Moscow. BRIC, as a formal grouping, started after the meeting of the Leaders of Russia, India and China in St Petersburg on the margins of G8 Outreach Summit in 2006. The grouping was formalized during the first meeting of BRIC Foreign Ministers...",

        "title": "Video forensics uncover loopholes in terror group's propaganda footage",
        "text": "A video circulated by the banned terror outfit, The Resistance Front (TRF)\u2014a self-proclaimed Kashmiri militant group\u2014following the gruesome attack that killed seven in Kashmir, reveals the propaganda machinery behind such terror incidents. The footage, shared widely on social media after Sunday evening\u2019s attack at the Z-Morh tunnel on the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway, bears TRF's text, \u201cWe were here,\u201d implying it was shot during the attack.However, forensic analysis conducted by India Today\u2019s Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) team reveals that the footage was originally filmed at least a month earlier. A version of the same video, without the TRF text and logo, was initially posted by a local Instagram account on September 21, who often shares travel photos and videos from that locality. It appears that the terror outfit repurposed this footage for its propaganda. The original video was likely filmed by someone driving a white SUV with an antenna on the bonnet. While the cropped TRF version doesn\u2019t show the vehicle, a brief glimpse of the antenna is visible as the footage approaches the tunnel\u2019s exit. (The video footage released by TRF was likely sourced from an earlier video posted on Instagram) SUV bonnet mounted antenna can be seen in both videos Another intriguing aspect is the software used to edit the footage. The video appears to have been edited using CapCut, a popular mobile application, though it is banned in India due to its Chinese origin. Following the June 2020 clashes in Galwan Valley between Indian and Chinese forces, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology banned over 100 Chinese apps under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. The ban was based on concerns that these apps were involved in activities prejudicial to India\u2019s sovereignty, defense, security, and public order.While it\u2019s still possible to use a VPN to access CapCut in India, the associated lag and slowness, along with the availability of alternative apps, make it an impractical choice for local users. This raises the likelihood that the video was edited outside India using a non-Indian internet service provider (ISP) to manipulate the footage and provide a different context.According to Indian intelligence assessments, TRF is a proxy for the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, providing a cosmetic local identity for the organization. An earlier India Today investigation highlighted how TRF's debunked propaganda was once shared and later deleted by Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Imran Khan. TRF emerged in the cyberspace in 2019 amid a communications blackout in the Kashmir Valley following the abrogation of Article 370 and was designated a terrorist organization by the Indian government under the UAPA in 2023.On Monday, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha confirmed that two foreign terrorists, believed to have infiltrated from North Kashmir's Bandipora area, were involved in the attack that claimed seven lives in Ganderbal district. \"According to an initial investigation, two masked individuals\u2014likely foreign terrorists\u2014entered the mess hall of the company constructing the Z-Morh tunnel and opened indiscriminate fire. Seven people were killed, and four were injured,\" he stated.The victims included a doctor and six labourers who were attacked at the tunnel-construction site along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited the home of Dr. Shahnawaz Dar on Tuesday, one of the victims of the Ganderbal attack.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024ALSO READ | Pak-based Lashkar front claims J&K attack that killed doctor, 6 others: Sources",

        "text": "In Wayanad's 3-way electoral contest, BJP's Navya Haridas is banking on her political experience to take on Congress' Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the November 13 bypoll, which also will be the AICC general secretary's maiden electoral fight.\n\nA software engineer with international experience in Singapore and the Netherlands, and a decade as a councillor in Kozhikode, Ms. Haridas is confident her background equips her to challenge Ms. Vadra, who is keen to extend the Congress' winning streak in this hilly Lok Sabha segment vacated by her brother Rahul Gandhi.\n\nMs. Haridas told PTI in an interview on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) that although Ms. Vadra holds a position in the AICC, she lacks experience as a people's representative.\n\nAlso Read: U.P. Congress welcomes Rahul Gandhi\u2019s decision to retain Rae Bareli \n\n\"Priyanka Gandhi is a national figure due to her Nehru family background, but this is her first election. I, on the other hand, have served as a councillor in the Kozhikode Corporation for two consecutive terms and contested the 2021 Assembly elections.\" \n\n\"I have been representing the people for many years, so contesting against Priyanka Gandhi doesn't feel any different to me. I believe I have more experience than she does,\" the BJP candidate said, a day ahead of the Congress leader's entry into Wayanad, where she is seeking votes with a roadshow in Kalpetta.\n\nThe by-election for the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency was necessitated after Rahul Gandhi vacated it following his victory in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\n\nEminent CPI leader and former MLA, Sathyan Mokeri, is contesting on the CPIM-led ruling LDF ticket.\n\n\"The fight is only between Congress and BJP. See, this election was necessitated due to the irresponsibility of Congress. In many parts of Wayanad, you still see flex boards asking for votes for Rahul Gandhi. However, he chose to keep the Rae Bareli seat and handed Wayanad over to his sister. This is an example of family dominance, and the BJP will highlight this issue before the voters,\" Ms. Haridas said.\n\nNavya, who is also the State general secretary of the Mahila Morcha, BJP's women's wing, believes PM Narendra Modi's development agenda will work in favour of the party in Wayanad.\n\n\"BJP always puts forward the agenda of development. There has been no intervention from the people's representatives in the issues demanded by the people here for the past several years.\" \n\nShe said Wayanad is not a constituency where the BJP has a strong organisational foothold but pointed out at its electoral gains.\n\n\"However, the party's vote share doubled compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Moreover, we saw that people voted for the BJP in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, and it showed that people want the BJP in power. We expect that kind of change will happen here also,\" she said.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, the BJP saw its vote share in Wayanad rise to 5.75 per cent, when its state president K Surendran took on Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe NDA candidate secured 1,41,045 votes, a significant increase from the 78,816 votes in 2019 when the seat was contested by BDJS, an NDA ally.\n\nMeanwhile, Rahul Gandhi's victory margin decreased to 3,64,422, down from the 4,31,770 votes polled in 2019.\n\nMs. Haridas, an engineering graduate, entered politics almost by accident.\n\nAfter earning her B.Tech degree, she worked as a software professional. In 2009, she married marine engineer Shobin Shyam and moved to Singapore, where she worked for four years.\n\nShe also worked in the Netherlands and Azerbaijan. Then, during a vacation trip to Kozhikode in 2015, she was unexpectedly nominated as a candidate in Kerala's local body elections, thanks to her family's RSS connect.\n\n\"Politics was never on my mind, and my entry into it was purely accidental. The BJP approached me with a ticket, considering my family's political background. I was fielded from Karaparamba, a ward where the BJP traditionally finishes third in Kozhikode Corporation. However, I won and have been representing the ward for the past 10 years,\" she explained.\n\nReflecting on her campaign for Wayanad, Ms. Haridas mentioned the challenges of travelling through the region.\n\n\"It takes hours to reach Kalpetta, especially crossing the Thamarassery Ghat Road, where traffic jams last for several hours. The traffic problems and the backwardness in the health sector here must be addressed immediately. Wayanad still lacks a fully equipped medical college. Currently, a district hospital has been upgraded as a medical college,\" she said.\n\n\"Another pressing issue is the upliftment of the tribal communities. The tribal people are still suffering. The funds allocated for them by the Central Government are not reaching their hands due to the lapses of the people's representatives. Besides, there are no plans for the educational facilities for the tribal students,\" she added.\n\nThe Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency consists of seven Assembly segments \u2014 Mananthavady (ST), Sulthan Bathery (ST) and Kalpetta in Wayanad district, Thiruvambady in Kozhikode district and Eranad, Nilambur, and Wandoor in Malappuram district.\n\nOf these Wandoor, Kalpetta abd Sulthan Bathery are represented by the Congress The Eranad seat is held by P K Basheer of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), an ally of the Congress-led UDF.\n\nIndependent Nilambur MLA P V Anwar, who recently parted ways with the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF, has already expressed support for Vadra.\n\nThiruvambady and Mananthavady have CPI(M) MLAs. The constituency has a significant population of minorities and tribal communities.",

It will also produce two metric tonnes of french fries per hour and the produce will be sold under the \u201cSafal\u201d brand of Mother Dairy. \n\n\u201cIn one of the NDDB board meetings, I had asked them not to limit themselves to milk and expand NDDB\u2019s scope. I am happy that they have extended themselves to processing vegetables and fruits. The farmers who grow vegetables and fruits do not get proper remuneration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey end up getting exploited after the market gets flooded with their produce. If these vegetables are processed, then farmers produce will go across the world and the profits will percolate down through the cooperative model.\u201d said Shah while speaking at the event held at Anand.\n\nAlso read: Gujarat 8th state to seek larger share from 16th Finance Commission: Dr Panagariya\n\nSimilarly, Shah also laid the foundation stone for a \u20b974 crore polyfilm plant at Narela, New Delhi. This plant with a capacity of 8400 metric tonne per annum will provide packing needs for milk, curd and ghee. It will provide employment for 100 persons and is expected to be commissioned by 2026.\n\n\u201cToday we are the biggest milk producer of the world. With a cumulative milk production of 231 million tonnes, we have left the United States behind. We will maintain the number one position for long as we are growing at six percent per annum, while the rest of the world is growing at two percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are 8 crore milk producing families in rural India. However, only 1.5 crore are within the cooperative framework, while the remaining 6.5 crore are in the unorganised sector and are being exploited. NDDB should try and see that the all the 8 crore families are included within the cooperative framework,\u201d Shah added.\n\nPointing out that a number of states have inked MoUs with NDDB, Shah said, \u201cGood work is happening, but it needs to be fast tracked.\u201d \n\nShah also laid the foundation stone for a new NDDB office building at Anand. At Anand, Shah also launched Gir Ghee from Mother Dairy and Badri Ghee from Uttarakhand Cooperative Dairy Federation. Several MoUs were also signed to highlight NDDB\u2019s continued efforts in advancing the dairy sector. \n\nKey agreements included a collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to conduct cutting-edge research in One-Health, focusing on innovation in animal health and sustainability; a partnership between National Cooperative Organics Limited, Mother Dairy and NDDB Mrida Limited to promote organic farming practices; NDDB, Suzuki R&D Center India (SRDI) and Amul/Mehsana Milk Union to establish a compressed biogas plant, enhancing sustainable energy production. \n\nFurther partnerships comprise an MoU between NDDB and the Space Applications Centre (SAC), ISRO, which will use remote sensing technology to assess fodder resources, facilitating improved resource management.\n\nAlso read: New textile policy will help attract \u20b930,000 cr investments to Gujarat: CM",

The state is positioned as a critical engine in driving India\u2019s overall economic performance.\n\nAn initial projection from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) anticipated a modest growth rate of just 4 percent for Karnataka, a figure that was later revised to a robust 13.1 percent.\n\nThe CMO noted this drastic revision as indicative of an early measurement error, underscoring the underestimated potential of Karnataka\u2019s economy.\n\nWith the final GSDP growth of 10.2 percent, Karnataka has not only surpassed the national average growth rate of 8.2 percent but also set the stage for a promising outlook.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the NSE forecasts a GSDP growth rate of 9.4 percent for Karnataka, while the Ministry of Finance has provided an even more optimistic projection of 14 percent.\n\nFurther supporting this growth narrative are strong economic indicators, including a year-on-year growth of 10 percent in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections and a notable 24 percent increase in stamp duty revenue as of September 2024. These figures reinforce the perception of Karnataka as a state in dynamic economic expansion.\n\nKarnataka's GSDP per capita remains among the highest in India, aligning closely with Telangana, both states led by Congress and showcasing robust economic performances.\n\nThe CMO emphasised that Karnataka\u2019s pro-people policies, including various welfare guarantees, ensure that the benefits of economic growth are distributed equitably among its citizens, promoting inclusive development.\n\nDespite these achievements, Karnataka faces significant challenges. The state has endured its worst drought in a decade, severely affecting agricultural productivity and contributing to negative growth in that sector.\n\nAdditionally, Karnataka\u2019s reliance on the IT and hardware sectors, which account for 28 percent of its Gross State Value Added (GSVA), has exposed it to the impacts of a global economic slowdown.\n\nIn conclusion, Karnataka\u2019s impressive GSDP growth is not only a testament to its economic strategy but also a beacon of resilience amid adversity, positioning the state as a vital player in India's economic landscape.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday received assurance from the Uttar Pradesh government that no demolition action will be taken against buildings belonging to individuals allegedly involved in the Bahraich violence on October 13 until tomorrow.This comes in the wake of communal clashes that occurred during the Durga idol immersion procession, resulting in the death of Ram Gopal Mishra (22) and heightened tensions in the area.This comes after the state's Public Works Department (PWD) issued a demolition notice on October 18 for the residence of Abdul Hameed, one of the accused in the violence, citing illegal construction on his property. Similar orders were subsequently issued against other individuals allegedly involved in the Bahraich incident.In response, three petitioners, including Hameed, filed a petition with the Supreme Court through their advocate Mrigank Prabhakar, challenging the demolition notices. They argued that the action was not about unauthorized construction but rather \"a punitive measure disguised as a legal step.\"The petitioners claimed, \"The defence of \"unauthorized construction\" is being used as a ruse to carry out punitive demolition and also to illegally overcome the interim protective orders passed by this Court on 17-09-2024.\"The petitioners further alleged that the swift initiation of the demolition process reflected malice and was directly linked to the communal violence. They said in their plea, \"The trigger for the proposed demolition notices is the close proximity of the communal flare-up and violent incident and the impugned notice, based on the perception of OR the alleged involvement of the owners/ residents/occupants in that alleged criminal activity.\"The Supreme Court has not yet made a ruling on the petition.

        "title": "BJP Demonising Rohingyas for Political Gains Harms India's International Stature",
        "text": "Amidst the ongoing assembly elections in Jharkhand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to have accused the government led by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) of promoting the \u2018infiltration\u2019 of Rohingya refugees. Even though many BJP workers have been running hate campaigns for a long time against the Rohingyas, this is the first time the Prime Minister himself has used the issue in an election campaign to garner votes. Home Minster Amit Shah and BJP President JP Nadda have done the same.India hosts many refugee communities who have arrived not only from our neighbourhood but also from other parts of Asia and far-off countries in Africa. At present, India hosts more than 92,000 Sri Lankan and 73,000 Tibetan refugees. There are more than 30,000 from Myanmar and 12,000 Afghan refugees in the country. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), about 22,000 Rohingya refugees are registered with them, while the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has claimed there are more than 40,000 of them in the country. BJP's Demographic Fear-mongering in Jharkhand Ahead of Elections25 Days On, 160 Rohingya Refugees on Boat Still Stranded, Still StarvingWhatever the number, even 40,000 Rohingyas, as claimed by the MHA, is much less than some of the other refugee communities in the country. The number is a mere fraction of not only India\u2019s population but also of Jharkhand's, which is estimated to be around\u202f40.6 million in 2023. Moreover, in none of the registries that maintain data on the presence of Rohingya in India, is Jharkhand mentioned as a major location. In the last few years, minor BJP functionaries and party workers have indulged in attacks and hate campaigns targeting the Rohingya refugees in India. Why is Prime Minister Modi singling out one just refugee community, that too in a manner bordering on xenophobia?This kind of exclusion and hate is not the only way the Rohingya refugees are being treated differently from other refugee communities. They also face mass detention and threats of being deported back to Myanmar. According to several informal sources, more than 1000 Rohingyas including about 200 children are in detention across different states of India. Most of them were charged with \u2018illegal entry\u2019 under the Foreigners Act of 1946 and the Passport Act of 1967. A majority have served the sentences they got from the local courts, and yet, they continue to be held indefinitely. Jammu, West Bengal, and Assam hold the maximum number of these refugees in indefinite detention. Though the continued detention of refugees, even after serving their sentences, is ostensibly to deport them back to Myanmar, not more than 40 Rohingyas have been sent back since 2017, while the number of detainees exceeds 1000. Some of them have been in detention for more than 12 years. While the non-refoulement of refugees back to their country where they face persecution is a part of international law, India has been bent upon sending these Rohingyas back to Myanmar where they indeed face persecution and death.A more pertinent question is \u2014 why is India unable to deport the Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar? It is simply because Myanmar refuses to accept the Rohingya as its citizens. In such a situation, what purpose is served by keeping more than 1000 Rohingyas in detention?Rohingya Refugees & Their Deaths at Sea: What Can Neighboring Countries Do?\u2018Chained Like an Animal\u2019: Rohingya Mother Brought to Baby\u2019s Funeral in HandcuffsRohingya refugees have been in India since the early 2000s. Their status determination, as persons requiring international protection, is done by the UNHCR as per the mandate under the UN Refugee Convention, 1951. The refugees are mostly concentrated in Hyderabad, Delhi, Jammu, Rajasthan and Haryana. Most of them live in shanties and eke out a living by collecting urban recyclable waste and engaging in daily wage labour. They have very little access to public health care and education facilities despite a 2018 Supreme Court interim order in Jaffar Ullah vs the Union of India in which the government gave assurances that the refugees would get the same services as Indian citizens. India being an important country in the Asia Pacific region, its treatment of the Rohingya refugees has been an issue of concern for the international community. It has remained aloof to their arrival in the country during the period between 2012 and 2015 but its treatment of the Rohingyas began to change in 2017 when the then Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said the government was planning to deport Rohingyas from India because they are \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. Since then, India has incarcerated more than a thousand Rohingyas and deported about not more than 40.India\u2019s singling out of the Rohingya refugees (on the basis of harsh treatment) was noted by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\u202f(CERD) in 2018 when it said that it was \u201cconcerned that the manifestations of racial discrimination against the Rohingya in India and [that] their return to Myanmar will infringe their rights protected under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\" In July this year, the committee again called on India \u201cto end the arbitrary detention of the Rohingyas who fled Myanmar to India and refrain from forcible deportation and returns to Myanmar, where they would risk being subjected to serious human rights violations and abuses.\u201dIt was also \u201cdeeply concerned about reports regarding the spread of racist hate speech and the dissemination of negative stereotypes against Rohingya\u201d and the \u201cracist hate speech by politicians and public figures, and the lack of information on investigations, prosecutions and convictions of public figures and politicians for hate speech.\u201d None of this bodes well for India in its quest to become a world leader. No country will accept the leadership of another country that engages in fomenting hate against a community like the Rohingyas whose situation is a major international concern.

The arrested accused are identified as Lovejit Singh alias Labba, Manjeet Singh alias Manna, Prabhjit Singh, Gurjot Singh, Ramandeep Singh, and Gurpreet Singh.\u201cA major drug trafficking operation involving smuggling of heroin from Afghanistan into India was unearthed during investigation,\u201d said the ED in a statement.The PMLA investigation was initiated on the basis of seizure of 293.81 kg of heroin from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and seizure of 352.71 kg of heroin from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana, by the Delhi Police Special Cell.Thus, a total of 646.52 kg of heroin has been seized so far. ED investigation revealed that the arrested persons, Lovejit Singh, Manjeet Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Gurjot Singh, Gurpreet Singh and Prabhjit Singh, coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi.\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran, concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder,\u201d said the ED.Accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs, informed the federal agency.ED uncovered the highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions, and operational expenses by the accused has been made. \u201cAccused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. It was also revealed that the syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local markets.\u201dFurther, the agency said the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles including Toyota Fortuner, Etios and Hyundai Verna etc in second hand market for trafficking from the storage Hubs to further distribution. The ED investigation revealed that cash was used for the purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities.\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via the Nava Sheva port in Mumbai, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. Transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies.Earlier, a property in Jandoli Village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of accused persons, and fixed deposits have been attached by ED,\u201d added the agency",

Sources indicate that the threats were communicated through email to the management of these institutions.Authorities are investigating the incident, with the matter being reviewed by higher officials from various organizations, including the CRPF, Intelligence Bureau, and Delhi Police. The threat email specified a potential bomb blast in the classrooms of these schools at 11 am on Tuesday. However, the threat has since been determined to be a hoax.The hoax threat was received a day after the blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi\u2019s Rohini on Sunday for which a pro-Khalistani group claimed responsibility that sent shockwaves through the national capital. Delhi Police reached out to social media platforms and the messaging app Telegram, requesting details about the channel where the post was made, and the matter is being investigated. The Sunday blast in the Prashant Vihar school was so powerful that it tore through the wall of the school. No injuries were reported in the incident however some of the nearby buildings and vehicles were damaged.Such hoax bomb threats on domestic and international flights have been received for several days. So far this week, more than 90 flights have received bomb threats and most of them have turned out to be hoaxes.

Subramanian.\n\nSpeaking to the media at Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on Tuesday (October 22, 2024), Mr. Subramanian said according to the National Medical Commission\u2019s rules, a non-medical person operating inside an operation theatre of a hospital was a serious offence. \n\nA notice was already served on the YouTuber, seeking an explanation from him. A police complaint would also be lodged against him as he was involved in other offences in the past, the Minister added. \n\nFurther, action would be taken against the private hospital and the woman doctor who assisted the YouTuber in performing the act, he added. \n\n\u201cIn addition to the notice issued to the female doctor, a recommendation has been sent to the Tamil Nadu Medical Council to ban her from medical practice,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said. \n\n\u201cIn the previous instance, he revealed the gender of the foetus in a video using the test done in Dubai where the law permits to know the gender ... But since it is against the law here, a notice was issued to him and he was excused only after he apologised,\u201d he noted. \n\nThe video of his newborn, uploaded on Irfan\u2019s YouTube channel, had fetched 14 lakh views in two days.

Facing Scott Boland, Smith didn\u2019t offer a shot to an in-swinging delivery and was adjudged leg before wicket for a duck.\n\nSmith had scored just 3 runs in the first innings of the match. This was Smith\u2019s first Sheffield Shield appearance in three years, having last represented NSW in the competition in February 2021.

The right hander has scored just 738 runs in 12 matches and 24 innings at an average of 35.14.\n\nWith David Warner recently retiring, the openers slot is vacant with Smith being tipped to take the role into the opener\u2019s role alongside Usman Khawaja. Whiule batting at top, Smith has scored a total of just 171 runs at an average of 28.50, with one half-century. His highest score as an opener is 91*.

        "text": "President Droupadi Murmu on Tuesday stressed the need for collective responsibility in water conservation and urged the citizens of the country to actively participate in building a water-secure India.Addressing the gathering at the 5th National Water Awards ceremony in the national capital, President Murmu said, \u201cWe must remember that conservation of water resources is a collective responsibility and building a water-secure India is not possible without our active participation.\u201d\u201cAlmost all civilizations have developed around rivers. It can be said that this relationship between water and humans has given direction to human history. But it also seems that we deliberately forget the importance of water,\u201d she said. President Murmu expressed concern over the contamination of freshwater resources. \u201cDespite it being known that freshwater resources are available in limited quantities on earth, we ignore water conservation and management. Due to man-made reasons these resources are getting contaminated and are also getting exhausted,\u201d she said. The per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. Based on the study titled \u201cReassessment of Water Availability in India using Space Inputs, 2019\u201d conducted by Central Water Commission, the average annual per capita water availability for year 2021 and 2031 has been assessed as 1486 cubic meter and 1367 cubic meter respectively. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meter is considered as water stressed condition whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition.The Centre has taken several initiatives to conserve water and provide people with safe drinking water. It is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024.The central government launched AMRUT 2.0 on October 1, 2021, covering all the statutory towns of the country to ensure universal coverage of water supply and make cities \u2018water secure\u2019.To ensure optimum utilization of water, the Centre has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) from 2015-16. Under PMKSY-Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), 99 ongoing major/medium irrigation projects and 7 phases were prioritized during 2016-17, in consultation with states.The Centre has approved the extension of PMKSY till 2025-26 with an overall outlay of Rs. 93,068.56 crore.The Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM) Programme has been brought under PMKSY \u2013 Har Khet Ko Pani from 2015-16. The Bureau of Water Use Efficiency (BWUE) has been set up for promotion, regulation and control of efficient use of water in irrigation, industrial and domestic sector. \u201cSahi Fasal\u201d campaign was launched to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which are not water intensive.The Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched on National Panchayati Raj Day in 2022 with an objective to conserve water for future. The Mission is aimed at developing and rejuvenating 75 water bodies in each district of the country",

        "text": "Stay Hydrated: The first and foremost way to manage a sore throat is to keep yourself hydrated by drinking a lot of warm fluids. Consuming fluids alleviate sore throat symptoms. Drinking warm herbal teas, water, soups, and broths provides relief from sore throat pain. Avoid drinking chilled water, alcoholic beverages, and caffeinated drinks.\n\nUse Throat Lozenges: Throat lozenges provide temporary relief from pain and irritation. They work by moistening your throat, reducing the urge to cough, and making you feel more comfortable. For more relief opt for lozenges containing soothing ingredients such as honey or menthol.\n\nInhale Steam: Steam inhalation can also offer relief for a sore throat by adding moisture to the sore throat\u2019s dry or irritated tissues. You can take a hot shower, or you can fill a bowl with hot water, lean over it with a towel over your head, and breathe in the steam. It can loosen mucus and provide relief from throat pain.\n\nGargling with Antiseptic Solutions: One of the most effective remedies for a sore throat is using a gargle liquid. Betadine Gargle is an antiseptic gargle liquid that can help alleviate throat discomfort. With its active ingredient, povidone-iodine, it helps reduce bacteria in the throat, promoting healing and providing instant relief from pain. Gargling with it can help clear out irritants and germs, giving your throat a chance to heal faster. Mix the solution as directed and gargle for at least 30 seconds before spitting it out.",

Virat Kohli and Sarfaraz added 70 and 99 runs, respectively, building on the initial momentum.

Now, the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters during a daily media briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had reflected on the longstanding issue, with a nearly identical statement.\n\n\u201cI can share with you that over the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums. And as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020. And we will be taking the next steps on this,\u201d Misri had told reporters in New Delhi.\n\nThe Indian Foreign Secretary had neither confirmed nor denied any possibility of both leaders holding bilateral discussions in Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting.\n\n\u201cThis is a multilateral event, though of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall programme of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve as soon as feasible,\u201d stated Misri, who was India\u2019s Ambassador to China during the violent Galwan Valley face-off between the soldiers of the two countries at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in June 2020.\n\nAs the Chinese side attempted to transgress the LAC in other areas of the Western Sector of the India-China border areas, the two sides have been engaged in discussions through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation.\n\nOn Monday, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar said that the latest agreement creates the basis for peace and tranquillity which should be there in the border areas and existed before 2020 \u2013 something which had been India\u2019s major concern over the past few years for the bilateral relationship to turn normal.\n\n\u201cAt various points of time, people almost gave up. We have always maintained that on the one hand, we had to obviously do the counter deployments\u2026 But, side by side, we have been negotiating since September 2020 when I met my Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow. It has been a very patient process, maybe more complicated than what it could and should have been. The fact is that if we are able to, as we now have, reach an understanding regarding patrolling and observing the sanctity of the LAC, then, I think, it creates the basis for peace and tranquillity which there should be in border areas and existed there before 2020,\u201d remarked Jaishankar while speaking at the NDTV World Summit.\n\nBeijing\u2019s confirmation on the border patrolling agreement came just after Chinese President Xi Jinping left for Kazan to attend the 16th BRICS Leaders\u2019 Meeting which is also being attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAccompanying Xi Jinping on the visit are Cai Qi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also the member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.",

The price of onion has also increased to Rs 60 per kg from Rs 40 in the market, which is one of the largest vegetable markets in Odisha.Tomatoes are being sold for Rs 80 to 100 in the local markets in Bhubaneswar, traders said.The price of other vegetables like bins, brinjal, ladyfinger, cauliflower has also increased by Rs 10 to 20 per kilogramme.There was a huge rush in the vegetable markets as consumers wanted to store sufficient amounts of vegetables, especially potato and onion in view of the cyclone, which is expected to hit the Odisha coast by October 25.\"We don't know how the market will be after the cyclone hits the state. If the supply chain is disrupted, it may lead to a further increase in price. So, I bought a sufficient amount of potato and onion for my family,\" said Nibedita Behera, a housewife from Cuttack.Local vendors have attributed the price hike to the scarcity of potato-laden trucks and the anticipation of further disruptions if the cyclone makes landfall.\"We bought potatoes at a hiked price from the wholesale market... There is a shortfall in the supply compared to the demand, so the price has gone up,\" a trader from Chhatra Bazaar said.Meanwhile, Odisha Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare minister Krushna Chandra Patra warned that strong action will be taken against traders who will indulge in black marketing and illegal hoarding of essential consumable items.\"I have directed our departmental officials to conduct raids on markets to check illegal hoarding of vegetables,\" he said.Patra said he has called a meeting with traders this afternoon to appeal to them to cooperate with the government during this period.The minister also appealed to the people not to resort to panic buying as the state has a sufficient amount of vegetables and food items.On Monday, while holding a cyclone preparedness meeting, Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi had instructed concerned officials to check the black marketing of essential goods.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024",

I went to KL after the last Test (and) said how many balls do you play at (and) miss at? He didn't play at (and) miss at one ball and that's what tends to happen when you're not getting runs.\"There's certainly no concerns about KL, he's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space. But we are certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team,\" he said.Sarfaraz scored a second-innings 150 in the Bengaluru game, while Rahul remained off-colour in both essays.While admitting that it is difficult to keep Rahul out of the equation in the Test format, ten Doeschate said head coach Gautam Gambhir is \"keen to\" give him a long rope.\"It's not like we're worried about his form. If you go on just the past three months since Gauti has been in here, he's keen to give him (Rahul) as much rope as we can. We have a lot of faith in him,\" he said.\"But at the same time, it's a very competitive environment, with Sarfaraz getting 150 plus runs (222 not out) in the Irani Trophy final. The decision will be what's best for the team, but we'll certainly back all the guys in,\" he added.Pant, who did not keep wickets for a significant part of the opening Test, and Shubman Gill, who missed the match due to stiffness in his neck, are close to attaining their full fitness.\"Rishabh is pretty good. I think Rohit (Sharmna) touched on it the other day. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee. But fingers crossed, he'll be good to keep in the Test as well,\" he said.\"He (Gill) looks so (available for this Test).

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 22 (IANS) A panel discussion of the country\u2019s leading businesswomen at the NDTV World Summit 2024 on Tuesday, highlighted the vital role of women workforce in fostering a better future, creating a new paradigm of leadership and also breaking new benchmarks on the global stage. \n\nThe panel included leading Indian businesswomen such as Kami Swaminath, President of FedEx, Preeti Bajaj, CEO and MD of Luminous Power Technologies, and Padmaja Ruparel, Co-Founder of the Indian Angel Network.\n\nFedEx President Kami Swaminath, addressed the traditionally male-dominated business sectors said that glass ceilings are being broken in every spehere.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot more work to be done. At FedEx, as a global corporation operating across multiple international markets, we recognise the power of building a global culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Currently, 36 per cent of our board is made up of women, and we have 26 per cent women in management globally. Our approach is quite structured, and we recently added more focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, rededicating ourselves to inclusive hiring, promotions, and supporting career paths,\u201d she remarked.\n\nSwaminath emphasised the challenge of increasing women\u2019s representation in logistics and supply chain sectors and said, \u201cA key area of focus is middle management, where there is often a drop-off in women\u2019s participation due to societal expectations around childcare, elder care, and other responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cFedEx is a people-centric culture, and much of our effort is aimed at building an environment where DEI thrives. Our senior team members are specifically working on being more inclusive. There is a lot more to be done, and it is an ongoing journey for us\u2014especially in bringing more women into senior management and increasing their representation,\u201d she said.\n\nOn India\u2019s expanding economy, Swaminath commented, \u201cWe see tremendous growth opportunities in India with its expanding economy. As a global connector, FedEx is focusing on optimising supply chains to better serve our customers.\u201d\n\nPreeti Bajaj, CEO and MD of Luminous Power Technologies, spoke about the importance of women in senior management. She informed that 33 per cent of Luminous\u2019 senior team consists of women.\n\nShe described the work needed in the energy sector in three stages: \u201cFirst, there is equity of access to opportunities, which is critical. Second is ambition\u2014women must aspire to reach senior-level roles and fuel their own desire to pioneer such positions. Finally, there is attainment, which involves creating supportive environments and policies that can address these challenges. My call to action for women in the energy sector is that this is an evolutionary time, and we are part of the Viksit Bharat 2047 initiative.\u201d\n\nPadmaja Ruparel, Co-Founder of the Indian Angel Network, shared her experience as an early-stage investor, saying, \u201cWhen I started, there were no women in this field, and I went through many evolutions myself. I can\u2019t be an investor if there are no entrepreneurs. In 2022, only 14.7 per cent of funding went to women, which is not encouraging. The number of women investors is also very low, and growth capital is much less for women partners. We need to create a \u2018BlackRock of India\u2019 led by women.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report, only 38 of India\u2019s 100 leading publicly listed corporations have more than 20 per cent women employees in their workforce, underscoring the need for faster inclusion to achieve gender equality in business and other sectors.",

The Sessions Court and the Gujarat High Court have already dismissed Kejriwal\u2019s petition, and now, the Supreme Court has upheld those decisions.\n\nPrasad claimed that Kejriwal had even hinted during the court proceedings that he might apologise for his remarks, but the Supreme Court noted that such an apology should have been made earlier. Now, with his petition withdrawn, the criminal defamation case against him will proceed in Gujarat.\n\nHighlighting Kejriwal\u2019s pattern of making accusations and later apologising, Prasad listed several instances where the Delhi CM issued apologies, including to late Arun Jaitley, to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, to Punjab leader Vikram Majithia, to Kapil Sibal and others.\n\nPrasad argued that while criticism is a fundamental right in politics, making false and defamatory allegations is not.\n\n\u201cThe true face of Arvind Kejriwal, who lectures the world on honesty and anti-corruption, has been revealed,\u201d Prasad remarked, adding, \u201cKejriwal has apologised on 10 separate occasions for various remarks.\u201d\n\nHe also drew a parallel between Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, suggesting that both have displayed similar carelessness in their public conduct.\n\nPrasad also addressed questions on the BJP\u2019s stance on population control and the challenges in Wayanad where Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is contesting. He dismissed concerns about Priyanka\u2019s chances of electoral success, saying the BJP and its leaders do not fear competition.\n\nHe also touched upon India-China relations, noting that sensitive diplomatic matters should be handled by experienced officials and questioned the understanding of diplomacy among some opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal.\n\nResponding to Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav\u2019s controversial remarks about the Chief Justice of India, Prasad reaffirmed the importance of respecting the judiciary, which he described as vital to the country\u2019s democracy and constitutional traditions.",

        "text": "China on Tuesday said that it has reached a resolution with India on resolving their border conflict and will work to implement solutions, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular press briefing,\"We have reached a resolution on the relevant matter, will work with the Indian side to implement the solution. We are in close communication through diplomatic and military channels.\" On October 21, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that an agreement has been reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border area. The announcement came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kazan, Russia, for the 16th BRICS summit that begins today and is scheduled to run till October 24. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media, stating, \"This agreement is the outcome of extensive discussions over the past several weeks with Chinese interlocutors at both diplomatic and military levels.\" He noted that military commanders have been involved in negotiations aimed at addressing the tensions that have persisted since 2020. Misri explained that the agreement signifies a path toward disengagement and a potential resolution of the issues that arose during the significant confrontations in 2020. Misri recalled the clashes between the People's Liberation Army of China and the Indian Army, particularly highlighting the violent encounters in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. He added that this agreement marks a critical step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations seek to manage their border disputes and prevent further military confrontations. Misri said,\"On several areas along the Line of Actual Control, we held discussions with Chinese interlocutors both at the diplomatic as well as military levels through meetings with military commanders at various levels. These discussions had in the past resulted in the resolution of standoffs at various locations. There are some locations and areas where stand-offs had not been resolved.\" \"Now, as a result of the discussions over the last several weeks, an agreement has been reached on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas. This is leading to disengagement and eventually a resolution of the issues that arose in these areas in 2020,\" he said. Earlier today, Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi addressing an event in Delhi said that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo. \"We are working to rebuild trust, and restoring that trust will take time,\" he said, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations. He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions. \"This normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that as well,\" the COAS said. The agreement marks a crucial step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations work to manage their border disputes and avoid further military confrontations.In early May 2020, troops from China's People's Liberation Army and the Indian Army clashed at locations along the LAC, the disputed boundary between China and India. The situation escalated on June 15-16, 2020, resulting in casualties on both sides. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)",

With less than three weeks to go before the election, Trump\u2019s latest viral moment has become a social media sensation.The video, which showcases Trump humorously tumbling out of the drive-thru window, has sparked a wave of reactions online. One user said, \"OMFG Who made this!?!\" while others couldn't help but notice a strange resemblance to Russian President Vladimir Putin as Trump falls dramatically from the window.\u2014 aliensupershow (@aliensupershow) A sea of humorous remarks followed, with one user jokingly questioning the authenticity of the clip: \"Wait, isn\u2019t this just a video of what actually happened?\" Others chimed in with witty observations, like, \u201cIf this were a preview for a sitcom, I would totally watch it!\u201dOne particularly hilarious comment poked fun at Trump\u2019s customer service skills: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019d just convert their windshield into Sprite like that\u2026!?

His appearance followed vice president Kamala Harris\u2019 claims of working at the fast-food giant in the 1980s to fund her college education. Seizing the opportunity, Trump cheekily declared, \"I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala\u2026 She never worked here,\" in an apparent jab at Harris\u2019s relatable narrative.After the visit, Trump took to Truth Social to post, \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala Harris is now a confirmed liar in that she never worked at McDonald\u2019s\u2026 She is a liar, not a President!\" His campaign has further fueled the debate, suggesting that there are no records of Harris ever working at the fast-food chain.",

        "text": "Donald Trump recently appeared on \"Six Feet Under,\" the podcast of retired wrestling legend The Undertaker, real name Mark Calaway, where the former president revealed his fascination with professional wrestling. Over the course of the interview, Trump also quizzed the legendary wrestler on the realities of the ring, showcasing his curiosity and deep interest in the world of sports entertainment.During their exchange, Trump bombarded Calaway with rapid-fire questions, ranging from how wrestling rings absorb impact to the physical toll on wrestlers. \"Does that ring take great absorption?\" Trump asked, diving into specifics that highlighted his intrigue. \u2014 AutismCapital (@AutismCapital) Calaway responded by explaining the harshness of earlier rings and how wrestlers had to condition themselves to take the physical punishment.The conversation also took a humorous turn, with Trump recalling his involvement in WrestleMania, notably his appearance in the \"Battle of the Billionaires\" at WrestleMania 23, where he and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon squared off in a match represented by wrestlers, leading to McMahon getting his head shaved. Trump reminisced about the event, noting it drew record pay-per-view buys, and praised The Undertaker's iconic slow entrance, calling him one of the greatest sports entertainers.As the two delved deeper, Trump inquired about behind-the-scenes tensions in the wrestling world. \"How often did someone get really angry?\" Trump asked, curious about real fights in the scripted entertainment world. Calaway likened the professional relationships in wrestling to politics, stating that while wrestlers might not always like each other, they had to maintain professionalism\u2014a sentiment Trump found relatable.The interview also saw Trump praising Calaway\u2019s endurance in the ring, with the former president questioning whether the wrestler ever had to be carried out due to injury. \"What most people don\u2019t realise, Mr President, is that although we\u2019re entertainment, in any given match, you\u2019re two inches away from something really catastrophic happening,\u201d Calaway explained, making the former US President aware of the dangers of pro wrestling despite its scripted nature.Trump\u2019s passion for wrestling, along with his personal connections to WWE through longtime friend Vince McMahon, was evident throughout the interview. He praised the athleticism of the wrestlers and fondly recalled his role in several WWE events, even expressing awe at the intensity of their performances.

        "title": "Babita Phogat used protests to pursue WFI leadership, alleges Sakshi",
        "text": "New Delhi: Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik has revealed the controversial role of wrestler-turned-politician Babita Phogat in last year's wrestlers' agitation, alleging that Phogat encouraged the protests to position herself as the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president. Malik, a key figure in the protest, stated in a recent interview that Phogat called a meeting with several wrestlers, urging them to speak out against the alleged misconduct of former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and others in the federation. \u201cBabita Phogat approached us with the idea of protesting against Brij Bhushan Singh because she had her own agenda \u2014 she wanted to become the WFI president. There are rumors that Congress supported our protest, but that\u2019s false. In fact, two BJP leaders helped us secure permission to protest in Haryana \u2014 Babita Phogat and Tirath Rana,\u201d Malik said. Despite Phogat's initiation of the movement, Malik clarified that the wrestlers did not \u201cblindly follow her.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that we blindly followed her; we were aware of serious issues like sexual harassment and molestation within the federation. We believed that having a woman in charge, especially someone like Babita Phogat, who is also a sportsperson, would bring positive change. We trusted that she would understand our struggles. But we never anticipated that she would play such a big game with us. We thought she would stand with us in the protest and raise her voice against the wrongdoing as a fellow wrestler,\u201d Malik revealed. Malik also made striking claims regarding fellow wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, both prominent figures in the movement. In her memoir, Witness, Malik alleged that those close to Punia and Vinesh began to influence their decisions, leading to a troubling shift in focus. Their acceptance of exemption from the 2023 Asian Wrestling Championships trials, according to Malik, damaged the integrity of the protest that had sparked at Delhi\u2019s Jantar Mantar and spread throughout the country. \u201cThe old way of thinking selfishly was taking over again. The people close to Bajrang and Vinesh had started filling their minds with greed. Now they were discussing exemptions from trials for the Games. Nothing good came of Bajrang and Vinesh\u2019s decision to take the exemption. Their choice hurt the image of our protest, leading many supporters to think we were in it for selfish reasons,\u201d Malik wrote. Malik emphasised that claims of Congress party supporting their protest were unfounded, highlighting the assistance from BJP leaders like Phogat and Tirath Rana in securing permission for their protests in Haryana. The movement emerged as a powerful symbol against alleged misconduct within the federation, led by Malik, Vinesh Phogat, and Bajrang Punia, but unity began to fracture as external influences led to conflicting priorities. Brij Bhushan faced allegations of sexually harassing several female athletes and financial misconduct. The six-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Kaiserganj constituency stepped down as WFI chief, along with the entire Executive Committee, shortly after protests resumed in April following earlier demonstrations in January 2023.",

        "text": "Dubai: Former England captain Alastair Cook feels Joe Root has the potential to surpass the legendary Sachin Tendulkar as the leading run-getter in Test cricket thanks to his insatiable hunger and incredible talent.The 33-year-old Root currently has 12716 Test runs and is 3205 short of the Indian icon (15921).Root occupies the fifth spot in the leading run-getter's chart at the moment with Rahul Dravid (13,288), Jacques Kallis (13,289) and Ricky Ponting (13,378) and Tendulkar ahead of him.\"I think Joe Root could set a mark, certainly on an English side, that'll be very hard to beat. But, you just never know,\" Cook was quoted as saying by the ICC.\"I hope he can get very close, if not be the first person who scores 16,000 Test runs. It'd be a great achievement.\"Root overtook Cook as England's leading run-scorer in the longest format during the Multan Test against Pakistan earlier this month.Having watched his compatriot go past him to become England's most decorated batter, the 39-year-old Cook struggled to express his feelings and called up Root to congratulate him for his massive feat.\"I watched the moment, then I rang him after the end of the play. I couldn't think of the right words to write in a text message,\" Coon said.\"So, I thought I'd just ring him, see what he was up to, and make sure he had a beer in his hand, which I think he did.\"Root's remarkable form over the past four years has seen him score more than half of his total 35 Test centuries in that period, averaging close to 60.Cook believes that he is currently the best batter in the world with New Zealand's Kane Williamson coming close to matching him.\"I think at this precise moment in time, I find it hard to see anyone playing as well as Joe Root. Over the last year or so, of the so-called 'Big Four', I think Williamson and him are probably in the best form at the moment.\"They're all wonderful, wonderful players, all very different, actually, in their methods and ways of playing. But one thing, which kind of unites them is that hunger and desire to keep improving and keep churning out the runs,\" Cook said.Root will look to continue to amass big scores and add to his tally during the third Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, beginning on Thursday.Moving to another topic, Cook has expressed his support for England's 'Bazball' style of play in Test cricket.\"I think the game has certainly made a big jump forward in what is now deemed possible in Test cricket.\"I think the jump happened in one day cricket first, probably. The fundamental change, certainly from the English point of view, is when Owen Morgan took the side forward in 2015.

        "title": "Locker-room politics: What's behind Trump's lewd story about Arnold Palmer",
        "text": "As the 2024 presidential election enters its final weeks, Donald Trump is ramping up his use of vulgar and inflammatory language at campaign rallies. During a Pennsylvania event this weekend, the former president opened with a shocking anecdote about the late golf legend Arnold Palmer's genitalia. Trump\u2019s crude remarks about Palmer's masculinity were followed by insults directed at his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. These outbursts have stirred controversy but also energized his core supporters, raising questions about whether this unfiltered approach is an intentional election strategy to galvanize his base, particularly younger male voters.Why it mattersAs per a Politico report, Trump\u2019s use of foul language and crude humor is nothing new, but the frequency and intensity of his remarks in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign are noteworthy. The former president, who has long embraced controversial rhetoric, seems to be doubling down on hypermasculine, inflammatory comments, a tactic that appears designed to appeal to male voters, especially those disillusioned with traditional political correctness. At the same time, his behavior could alienate key demographics, particularly suburban women and moderate Republicans, who might be turned off by his lack of decorum.As Trump faces off against Kamala Harris, who could become the first female president of the US, the contrast in tone and demeanor between the two candidates is stark. Harris has largely avoided engaging directly with Trump's personal attacks, instead focusing on portraying him as unfit for office. Trump\u2019s supporters, however, often praise his directness and authenticity, seeing his crude humor as a refreshing alternative to what they view as the sanitized language of traditional politicians.The big pictureTrump\u2019s controversial remarks this weekend highlight a broader theme in his campaign: an emphasis on hypermasculinity and populism. During his Pennsylvania rally, Trump shared a 12-minute story about Palmer that included graphic details about the golf legend\u2019s body, eliciting laughs from the crowd.\u201cArnold Palmer was all man...This man was strong and tough, and I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros they came out of there, they said \u2018Oh, my God. That\u2019s unbelievable,\u2019\u201d Trump said.He followed this with a vulgar insult aimed at Kamala Harris, calling her a \"shit vice president,\" to the delight of his audience. This pattern of using locker-room talk to energize his base has become a hallmark of Trump\u2019s rallies, particularly in battleground states like Pennsylvania, where he is courting working-class voters and younger men.In a podcast last week, Trump made similarly crude remarks, using a slang term for male genitalia to describe the downfall of disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein. These moments are not accidental; they are part of a broader strategy to appeal to male voters who may feel disillusioned by political correctness and progressive movements. By positioning himself as an outsider who \"tells it like it is,\" Trump is tapping into frustrations among voters who feel left behind by cultural shifts in the country, the Politico report said.However, while these comments may energize his base, they also risk deepening the gender gap in the 2024 election. Polls suggest that Trump\u2019s aggressive, masculine rhetoric appeals more to male voters, while Harris is performing strongly with female voters, particularly in suburban areas. The result is shaping up to be one of the largest gender divides in modern political history, with both campaigns focusing heavily on turnout from these key groups.What they are sayingKamala Harris and other Democratic leaders have seized on Trump\u2019s vulgar remarks to argue that he is unfit for the presidency. Harris responded to Trump\u2019s attacks by saying, \u201cI do believe that Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences of him ever getting back into the White House are brutally serious.\u201d Harris has framed Trump\u2019s behavior as emblematic of a broader pattern of instability and recklessness, suggesting that his return to power would be dangerous for the country.Arnold Palmer\u2019s daughter, Peg Palmer Wears, also reacted to Trump\u2019s comments about her late father. In an interview with the Associated Press, she expressed disappointment but not outrage, saying, \u201cI think it was a poor choice of approaches to remembering my father, but what are you going to do?\u201d Wears added that while she wasn\u2019t upset, she felt Trump\u2019s comments didn\u2019t honor her father\u2019s legacy appropriately. She noted that her father, who passed away in 2016, had believed strongly in the Republican Party, but stopped short of saying whether she would vote for Trump in the upcoming election.On the Republican side, reactions have been mixed. Some party leaders, like House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La), have avoided directly condemning Trump\u2019s remarks, with Johnson telling CNN, \u201cHe says things that are off-the-cuff.\u201d Other Republicans, including Gov. Chris Sununu (R-N H), have been more critical, saying Trump\u2019s language, particularly his profanity-laced attacks on Kamala Harris, is unhelpful and distracting. However, Sununu also noted that such remarks are unlikely to sway voters one way or the other, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just par for the course.\u201dBetween the linesTrump\u2019s frequent use of locker-room talk and crude humor may be a calculated move to solidify his support among male voters, particularly young men who have become a key demographic for the Republican Party. Over the past few years, Republicans have made a concerted effort to court younger male voters, many of whom feel alienated by progressive social movements and the perceived political correctness of the left. Trump\u2019s crass language and unapologetic style resonate with these voters, who see him as a \"real\" candidate willing to say what others won\u2019t.For Trump, his emphasis on masculinity and strength is not new. In the 2016 election, he used similar tactics to portray himself as the alpha male candidate, contrasting himself with Hillary Clinton, whom he frequently belittled with sexist and derogatory remarks. His latest comments about Arnold Palmer and Kamala Harris are a continuation of this strategy, positioning himself as a strong, decisive leader who isn\u2019t afraid to break the rules.This strategy could be effective in energizing Trump\u2019s core supporters, but it also risks alienating moderate Republicans and undecided voters, especially women. The gender gap in this election is expected to be historic, with polls showing a significant divide between male and female voters. Harris, who has focused on presenting herself as a competent and serious leader, may benefit from Trump\u2019s controversial remarks, particularly among women who find his behavior off-putting.What\u2019s nextAs the November 5 election approaches, both candidates will continue to sharpen their closing arguments. For Trump, this likely means more rallies filled with unfiltered language and humor aimed at energizing his base. His team hopes that by appealing to male voters, particularly in swing states like Pennsylvania, he can overcome the deficits he faces with women and suburban voters.Harris, meanwhile, will likely continue her strategy of focusing on Trump\u2019s character and fitness for office, hoping to persuade undecided voters that his behavior makes him unfit for a second term. She will also seek to turn out women and moderate voters, who are critical to her path to victory.The final weeks of the campaign are set to be a battle of contrasting styles: Trump\u2019s brash, masculine rhetoric versus Harris\u2019s more reserved, policy-focused approach. The outcome could hinge on which message resonates more with voters in key battleground states.(With inputs from agencies)",

        "text": "As the 2024 presidential election approaches, many US Jews like Rona Kaufman, observe signs that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump. Jewish voters form a small segment of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u2014key states for Democrats. Any shift could have substantial implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes have determined past elections. Many Jewish voters consider the upcoming election unprecedented, especially in light of Hamas\u2019 recent attacks on Israelis.As per the news agency AP, she notes discomfort at a recent Democratic campaign event in Pittsburgh and reflects on her family\u2019s changing political views. \u201cThe family that is my generation and older generations, I don\u2019t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we\u2019ve never voted Republican, ever,\u201d 49-year-old Kaufman said, highlighting her sister's Trump sign as a significant shift.Surveys indicate most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, although Kaufman acknowledges her viewpoint is unusual. In a close election, their votes can be pivotal, prompting campaigns from both Harris and Trump to recognise the risk of losing support. This dynamic has led Harris to navigate complex sentiments among traditional Democratic constituencies regarding the Gaza conflict, trying to balance support for Israel with concerns about civilian casualties.Trump has aimed to exploit this situation, suggesting that Harris \u201cdoesn't like\u201d Jewish people and claiming he\u2019ll be the \u201cbest friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\u201dHistorically, Jewish voters have largely supported the Democratic Party; a recent Pew Research Center poll showed about two-thirds back Harris.However, rising antisemitism in the US and anti-Israel protests have made many feel unsafe. The 2018 massacre of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh remains a painful reminder. This election, campaigns have reported unprecedented outreach to Jewish voters, with Republicans emphasising divisions within the Democratic Party regarding Israel.Many Jewish voters, like Jeremy Kazzaz, feel scared and uncertain. Kaufman, a progressive, never imagined considering Trump but now sees him as a defender against threats posed by Iran.Conversely, Harris\u2019 supporters view Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to his past comments and actions, including praise for Hezbollah and criticism of Israeli leadership.",

We are in close communication through diplomatic and military channels.\u201dOn October 21, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that an agreement has been reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border area.The announcement came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Kazan, Russia, for the 16th BRICS summit that begins today and is scheduled to run till October 24.Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media, stating, \u201cThis agreement is the outcome of extensive discussions over the past several weeks with Chinese interlocutors at both diplomatic and military levels.\u201d He noted that military commanders have been involved in negotiations aimed at addressing the tensions that have persisted since 2020.Misri explained that the agreement signifies a path toward disengagement and a potential resolution of the issues that arose during the significant confrontations in 2020. Misri recalled the clashes between the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China and the Indian Army, particularly highlighting the violent encounters in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. He added that this agreement marks a critical step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations seek to manage their border disputes and prevent further military confrontations.Misri said,\u201dOn several areas along the Line of Actual Control, we held discussions with Chinese interlocutors both at the diplomatic as well as military levels through meetings with military commanders at various levels. These discussions had in the past resulted in the resolution of standoffs at various locations. There are some locations and areas where stand-offs had not been resolved.\u201d\u201cNow, as a result of the discussions over the last several weeks, an agreement has been reached on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas. This is leading to disengagement and eventually a resolution of the issues that arose in these areas in 2020,\u201d he said.Earlier today, Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi addressing an event in Delhi said that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo.\u201cWe are working to rebuild trust, and restoring that trust will take time,\u201d he said, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations.He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions. \u201cThis normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that as well,\u201d the COAS said.The agreement marks a crucial step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations work to manage their border disputes and avoid further military confrontations.In early May 2020, troops from China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and the Indian Army clashed at locations along the LAC, the disputed boundary between China and India. The situation escalated on June 15-16, 2020, resulting in casualties on both sides.",

Bharatiya Janta Party leader Nalin Kohli took a jibe at the Congress party and its allies. He said this alliance is not born organically with any kind of commonality of agenda. Speaking to ANI on the MVA seat sharing in Maharashtra assembly elections, BJP leader Kohli said, \u201cAs far as the Congress and its so-called alliance partners are concerned, one has noticed a consistent trend not just in Maharashtra and Jharkhand presently, but in the Lok Sabha elections earlier as well. This is not an alliance born organically with any kind of commonality of agenda. It\u2019s an opportunistic political understanding that we will now oppose the BJP and we can therefore fight for power and seats\u2026\u201d\n\nKohli further added that the agenda for BJP-NDA is to serve the people and an agenda of positivity in terms of governance. \n\n\u201cThis is completely different to the model of BJP-NDA, where there is an agenda of serving people, an agenda of positivity in terms of governance and there is no war of words\u2026\u201d, he said.Earlier, Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole told ANI senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat had met Sharad Pawar and everything was on track.\u201cThe situation in Mahayuti is more messed up than MVA\u2026 Seat sharing takes time because we have to keep our party workers in mind. Our issue will be resolved in a day or two. Balasaheb Thorat held a meeting with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray and now I will meet Balasaheb Thorat. MVA seat-sharing meeting will be held after that. The problem lies in 25-30 seats but it will be resolved soon\u2026\u201d, he said. Meanwhile, on October 20, the Bharatiya Janyta Party released its first list of 99 candidates for the Maharashtra assembly elections. Maharashtra will vote in a single phase on November 20.

        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 21 (IANS) Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar says the Mahayuti-led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) remains unified with a clear and mutually-agreed seat sharing formula, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Congress, Shiv Sena(UBT) and NCP(SP) is facing internal squabbles over constituency allocation.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with IANS, Shelar claims that the Mahayuti government will come back to power after the elections. Here are some excerpts:\n\nIANS: Although the BJP has announced the first list, talks for seat sharing among the Mahayuti are not yet concluded. Is it due to differences? The MVA is also struggling to arrive at an understanding. What is your take?\n\nShelar: There is remarkable unity and discipline within the Mahayuti alliance. We have finalised our seat-sharing proportions and accordingly our list of candidates has also been declared. There is also clarity that the elections will be contested under the leadership of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. However, within the MVA, there is no consensus, no balanced seat-sharing arrangement and all their allied partners are embroiled in internal debates. Either before arriving at a consensus over seat sharing or immediately after the results, the MVA is sure to be in tatters after November 23. The MVA\u2019s expiry date is arriving soon.\n\nIANS: How confident are you about the Mahayuti forming the government once again in Maharashtra?\n\nShelar: Absolutely confident. Every election is different in terms of the prevailing issues, subjects, developments and the overall ecosystem. We, as the Mahayuti, are confident of winning the elections as we have only focussed on working for the development of the state. We have decided to go out to the people of Maharashtra with the list of development works and initiatives undertaken.\n\nIANS: Do you fear fake narratives will impact the results like during the Lok Sabha elections?\n\nShelar: Fake narratives were spread during the Lok Sabha elections which had impacted us. Today, once again, conspiracies to spread lies and fake narratives are being made. It is our job to stop the fake narrative and to speak in the interest of the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray alleged that 1,000-odd acres of land has been transferred in the name of Adani. I challenged him to give evidence to prove his statement. If Aaditya Thackeray has the courage, he should come forward for an open discussion and counter our questions. He is behaving like a spokesperson of urban Naxals and deliberately trying to spread lies, disturbance and unrest and create an image that there is anarchy in the state.\n\nIANS: You have been targeting the MVA over \u2018Vote Jihad\u2019. What is your comment?\n\nShelar: The MVA leaders are resorting to doing politics of appeasement. We have always believed in \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019. Our Hindutva also revolves around development of all elements of society. We believe in taking everybody together in our march of progress. Why should Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya get worried about it? The Mahayuti government is working towards ensuring homes for the poor in Dharavi. But they are making attempts to incite Dharavikars and spread fear in the minds of the poor Marathi, Muslim, Dalits making them believe that they will never get their rightful homes in Dharavi.\n\nIANS: What is the Mahayuti\u2019s agenda for the forthcoming Assembly elections?\n\nShelar: Our agenda is development. The Mahayuti government believes in delivering on its promises. The government launched the Coastal Road, the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg, the Mumbai-Delhi corridor, bullet train and much more. Through schemes like the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, the government started transferring money in the bank accounts of women, made ST travel free, deposited money in the bank accounts of senior citizens, and gave waivers to farmers over electricity bills. Today, the common citizen is concerned about the development of his city, state and the nation and we believe in favour of development.\n\n(Sanjay Jog can be reached at sanjay.j@ians.in)",

The clash led to the tragic death of Ram Gopal Mishra, a 22-year-old who succumbed to gunshot injuries.Following the incident, the area descended into chaos, with mobs engaging in widespread vandalism and arson, targeting homes, shops, showrooms, hospitals, and vehicles.Local authorities have responded by registering multiple FIRs against both unidentified rioters and some named individuals. As of now, the police have detained 55 suspects and increased security measures in the town, which has a mixed population.This marks the third major communal incident in Bahraich, following previous outbreaks in 2009 and 2014.In October 2009, violence erupted in the same area after rumors circulated about objectionable materials being thrown at a religious site, leading to arson and destruction.

They have circulated false information suggesting that many people are making significant profits through these apps, thereby cheating the public under the guise of online share trading,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\nThe police said the complainant in this case was contacted via WhatsApp by a member of the gang in April, introducing himself as someone who represented an institution called Black Rock Asset Management Business School. He falsely claimed that investing in Black Rock would yield a 500% profit within two months, while also stating that the company was SEBI-approved. \n\nThe man convinced the complainant to invest with a stipulation that he must pay a 20% service charge on the profits generated from the investment. The complainant was then persuaded to download a mobile app through a link and subsequently invested \u20b914 crore into various bank accounts, the police said. \n\nWhen the complainant realised that the invested money was not being returned, he filed a complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. Based on this, an FIR was registered at Cyber Crime Wing Headquarters, Chennai \u2013 SCCIC (State Cyber Crime Investigation Centre), and the police retrieved the money from 13 bank accounts. \n\nAfter analysing the call records and money trail, the special team of police arrested V. Subramanian, 39, from Chengalpattu, who is the first-layer beneficiary ICICI Bank account holder of the fraudulent transaction of \u20b921.5 lakh. \n\nBased on his confession, the other suspects were arrested. They are: M. Madan, 43, from Neelankarai, who owns a chit company in T. Nagar; R. Saravanapriyan, 34, from Thiruvallur, who is an associate producer in the film industry; Sathish Singh, 46, from Avadi, who is an associate of Saravanapriyan; Shafahed, 38, from Pulianthope, who owns a shop that converts currency; and D. Manikandan, 30, from Madurai, who previously worked at a cine producer\u2019s office in Chennai.\n\nAdditionally, two cryptocurrency wallet accounts were frozen. Action is being taken to arrest a gang based in north India that allegedly masterminded these cybercrimes and recover the defrauded money, said Mr. Mittal.",

Similar to earlier reports, the House findings do not pinpoint any specific individuals responsible for the failures.The preliminary findings are based on thousands of pages of documents, nearly twenty transcribed interviews with state and local officials, and a range of briefings\u2014both classified and unclassified\u2014from senior officials at the Secret Service and FBI.Meanwhile, the task force has initiated an investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump from last month, involving an individual with a rifle who was found camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.",

This arrangement could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started back in May 2020 and moving towards peace.\n\n BREAKING: India, China agree on patrolling along LAC, leading to disengagement ahead of BRICS meet in Russia \n\n New Delhi: In a major development, India and China have agreed on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas of the Himalayas, informed Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday. This development has come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia to attend the crucial BRICS summit. The patrolling arrangement between both countries can lead to disengagement and could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started in May 2020.\n\nWhile addressing the media during a special MEA briefing, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that diplomatic and military officials from both countries were in talks with each other. \u201cOver the last few weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums and as a result of these discussions, an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border area, leading to disengagement and resolution,\u201d he stated. \nResponding to a media question on possible meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS in Russia, Misri stated that there are chances of a bilateral meeting between both the leaders. \n\u201cAs far as the question on the bilateral meetings is concerned, this is a multilateral event, though there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking over the overall program of the prime minister. There are a lot of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update on the bilaterals as they evolve,\u201d Misri stated. \nPM Modi, will attend the BRICS summit in Kazan this week. Starting from Tuesday, his short, two-day journey comes as a response to the invitation extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a recent statement on Friday, Denis Alipov, who represents Russia as its ambassador to India, teased the possibility of welcoming new entrants into the BRICS assembly. Such an addition could hugely amplify the group\u2019s capacity as an influential frontier, upholding the interests of the Global South. \nAt an online \u2018BRICS 2.0 meet: New Members, New Horizons\u2019, this comment was made looking forward to the soon-to-be-held BRICS convention in Kazan, next week. At the moment, the holding of BRICS\u2019 chair position is in Russia\u2019s hands. This significant alliance brings together the advanced developing economies of the world. Initially, the four original countries were Brazil, Russia, India, and China, hence the name BRIC. South Africa hopped on board in 2010, sparking the change to the currently known name, BRICS. \n(Note: This is a developing story and further details will be added.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Friday rejected the bail and anticipatory bail applications filed by suspended Janata Dal (S) leader Prajwal Revanna, who is accused of rape and sexual assault. The HC also dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking legal action against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged comments against former Hassan MP Prajwal during a Lok Sabha campaign speech in Karnataka earlier this year.\nThe All India Dalit Action Committee had filed the PIL, requesting the court to direct Gandhi to issue an unconditional apology to women for his statements, and disrespecting the Constitution. The petition claimed that Gandhi made the remarks on May 2 during election rallies in Shivamogga and Raichur, just prior to the polls on May 7, 2024.\nThe bench stated that the court must uphold a standard when determining whether a matter qualifies as a public interest issue, noting that not every grievance can be raised in court via a PIL. They acknowledged that Gandhi\u2019s remarks, while potentially controversial, do not meet the criteria for a PIL.\nIn dismissing the case, the court reiterated the importance of careful consideration regarding what constitutes a public interest issue, affirming its discretion in handling such petitions.\nAdditionally, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on the petitioner while dismissing the case.\nThe counsel representing the All India Dalit Action Committee argued that Gandhi\u2019s statements outraged the modesty of women and constituted fabricated accusations against Revanna. They contended that such speeches were damaging in a small town like Hassan, creating mistrust among households.\nThey sought the court to impose a token fine on Gandhi for the supposed misuse of his public position, breach of public trust, and violations of various legal provisions, including the Model Code of Conduct for the 2024 Parliamentary elections and the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\nDuring the hearing, the bench, consisting of Chief Justice N V Anjaria and Justice K V Aravind, indicated that the case did not qualify as a public interest litigation. The court stated, \u201cWe have not said anything on the merits; we are not saying anything on the merits of the speech. We have only said this cannot be the subject matter under public interest litigation,\u201d according to Live Law.",

        "text": "A budget of Rs 10 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Baoli Sahib temple in the Punjab province to address the long-standing demands of the Hindu community in Pakistan. This marks the first phase of reconstruction, 64 years after the temple was rendered dysfunctional.The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a federal body responsible for overseeing minority worship sites in Pakistan, has commenced work on restoring the Baoli Sahib temple, located in Zafarwal town in Narowal, a city along the western bank of the Ravi River. The temple has been out of service since 1960, according to Dawn News.Currently, there is no functional Hindu temple in the entire Narowal district, forcing the local Hindu population to either conduct religious ceremonies at home or travel to temples in Sialkot and Lahore. Ratan Lal Arya, the former president of the Pak Dharamsthan Committee, explained that the temple became non-functional after the ETPB took control of it. The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time. The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million. The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population resides in Sindh province, where they share cultural and linguistic ties with their Muslim neighbors.",

The patrolling arrangement agreement extends beyond the areas along the LAC where there has already been a disengagement of military personnel over the past few years, and include the so far unresolved areas of Demchok and Depsang, sources told The Hindu, indicating that the India-China standoff since April 2020 is now expected to be resolved.\n\nWhile the MEA did not give further details of the agreement, and whether there would be a reversion to the status quo pre-2020, and whether the \u201cbuffer zones\u201d more recently created would continue to exist for patrolling purposes\u201d, Mr. Misri said that the two sides had \u201creached an agreement on the issues that were being discussed\u201d\n\nThe announcement, by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, came amidst a media briefing on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit on Tuesday which he will attend along with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cOver the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums, and as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the line of actual control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists adding that the two sides would now take the \u201cnext steps\u201d on this.\n\nThe timing of the India-China agreement announcement, just a day before the BRICS Summit indicates that a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi on the side-lines, that has been speculated about is now expected to take place. Although the two leaders met as many as 18 times prior to the Galwan clashes in June 2020 , where 20 Indian soldiers were killed, they have spoken only twice since then, on the side-lines of the G-20 summit in Indonesia in 2022, and the BRICS summit in South Africa in 2023.\n\n Mr. Misri did not confirm a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi , he said that government is discussing the scheduling of a number of bilateral meetings in Kazan, the venue of the BRICS summit.\n\n\u201c[BRICS] is a multilateral event, though, of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall program of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings, and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve, as soon as feasible,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists when asked, not denying that a meeting with the Chinese leader was among those.\n\nMr. Misri, who was previously India\u2019s Ambassador to China, and was no doubt, a key part of the recent negotiations, did not give further details of the agreement between both sides. He referred to recent meetings that had led to the breakthrough, which include two meetings between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Chinese FM Wang Yi in June-July, two meetings of the WMCC mechanism of diplomatic and military officials in July-August, followed by a meeting between NSA Ajit Doval and Mr. Wang, who is also the Special Representative on border talks in September. These were followed by intense negotiations of military commanders and MEA officials in the last few weeks.

For this, they further agreed for intensified contact through diplomatic and military channels,\u201d the Indian side had said after the August 29 meeting in Beijing.\nThere were total of 31 rounds of talks of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) and 21 rounds of India-China Corps Commander Level meetings over the past four years.\nThe opposition could now ask for more details about the said disengagement agreements arrived at between India and China. Meanwhile, the Modi government has attacked the Congress for squandering thousands of square kilometers of land to China under the Nehru rule.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal is facing criminal proceedings in a defamation case over his alleged remarks over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification after the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed his plea to quash summons. A Gujarat Metropolitan court had summoned Kejriwal and AAP's Sanjay Singh in the defamation case over their alleged \"sarcastic\" and \"derogatory\" statements related to PM Modi's educational degrees. Gujarat University Registrar Piyush Patel had filed the defamation case against the politicians over their alleged comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the chief information commissioner (CIC) for providing information about Modi's degrees under the Right to Information Act. A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S V N Bhatti noted that a separate bench of the apex court had junked the plea filed by AAP leader Sanjay Singh on April 8 in the same case, who is a co-accused in the case. \"We must have a consistent approach. Having regard to that view, we would not like to entertain the present plea. The same is dismissed,\" said the bench. The top court, however, said all contentions were left open to be decided in the trial and it was expressing no opinion on the merits of the case. Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, submitted Patel was not an aggrieved party in the matter. \"If at all the statement was defamatory, it is for Modi to file a criminal defamation case and not for the Gujarat University registrar,\" he said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the University, said a separate bench of the apex court had already dismissed Singh's petition on April 8. Mehta said the degree had been uploaded on the university website and referred to the dismissal of the CIC order by the Gujarat High Court. Arguing that no case of defamation was made out, Singhvi stated that Kejriwal merely asked why the university was not publishing Modi's degree. The bench, however, rejected Kejriwal's plea. The high court had on February 16 dismissed the pleas by Singh and Kejriwal seeking quashing of the summons issued against them in the defamation case. Both had challenged in the high court the summons issued by a trial court in the case filed by the Gujarat University and the subsequent order of the sessions court dismissing their revision pleas against the summons. According to the complainant, the two politicians made \"defamatory\" statements at press conferences and on microblogging platform X, targeting the university over Modi's degrees. Their comments against the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the institution, which has established its name among the public, he alleged. \"Their statements were sarcastic and intentionally made to hurt the prestige of the university,\" he added. On March 31, 2023, the high court quashed the 2016 order of the CIC asking Gujarat University to provide information on Modi's degrees to Kejriwal, and observed the AAP chief's RTI plea appeared to be \"politically vexatious and motivated\" instead of being based on \"sound public interest considerations\".",

We have concluded that there are two areas we can explore - 1) Amendment to Aircraft Security Rules... one of the ideas we wish to implement through these rule changes is that once we apprehend the perpetrator behind these threats, we aim to place them on the no-fly list... 2) Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Civil Aviation Act... Naidu explained.Bomb threats cripples Indian aviationOn Sunday alone, more than 20 flights from IndiGo, Akasa Air, and Vistara were disrupted by bomb threats.This led to a meeting between BCAS officials and airline CEOs, as the threats continue to cause alarm and necessitate extensive security checks.Additionally, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and BCAS Director General Zulfiquar Hasan met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan on Monday to discuss the recent surge in hoax calls.During the half-hour meeting at the Home Ministry, both director generals briefed the home secretary on the recent wave of hoax bomb threats, which have caused widespread panic and prompted exhaustive security measures by Indian aviation authorities, intelligence agencies, and other departments.",

The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary by-election.\n\n\"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.\n\nCongress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said.\n\nWith the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.\n\nSoon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate for the seat in Kerala.\n\nWith the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.\n\nDays after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.\n\nIf elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.\n\nThe EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies.\n\nThe bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.\n\nSince her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.\n\nHowever, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nShe emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year.\n\nAfter her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both constituencies.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

But this would not suffice. The veil of morality has been lifted just for the election time. After polls, such goons will be inducted again,\" Sule tweeted on X.Lankesh was shot dead outside her home in Bengaluru on September 5, 2017.A probe by police in Karnataka with assistance from agencies in Maharashtra led to the arrest of several persons.Pangarkar, a Jalna municipal councilor of the undivided Shiv Sena between 2001 and 2006, was arrested in August 2018.

        "text": "Tata Consumer Products, one of the leading FMCG majors in India, witnessed its share prices tumble nearly 10% in yesterday's trading after reporting lackluster financial results for the second quarter of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe company's revenues from operations grew by a modest 13% to Rs. 4,214.5 crores compared to the same period last year. However, operating margins declined by 30 basis points to 14.9% due to rising input costs. Net profits increased by 6% to Rs. 359 crores year-on-year, but fell short of street expectations.\n\nWeak demand, especially in the urban markets, impacted the volume growth for Tata Consumer during the quarter. The tea business, which contributes over half of total revenues, registered muted sales. Rising inflation has also constrained discretionary spending by consumers.\n\nCommenting on the results, analysts at Elara Securities highlighted the competitive pressures in the FMCG sector and slowing demand trends in urban regions as near-term headwinds. Although they remain optimistic about the company's diverse portfolio and broader growth prospects, earnings estimates for the next two fiscal years have been cut to factor in the pressure on revenues and margins.\n\nWhile Tata Consumer looks well-positioned in the long run with its brands and distribution expansion plans, investors seem concerned about the soft demand environment squeezing profits in the immediate quarters. The company will need to efficiently manage costs and urgently revive volume growth in key categories to allay such concerns. For now, uncertainty over the macroeconomic outlook continues to impact sentiment around fast moving consumer goods players.",

It has been a very patient process, though more complicated than how it should have been,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV.\n\n\"The important thing is if we have reached an understanding, I think what it does is it creates a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border, which were there before 2020. That was a major concern. If there is no peace and tranquillity, how can other areas of bilateral ties improve?\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nWhile he agreed people may speculate on the LAC development, the External Affairs Minister said he would use \"caution\" in responding on whether this positive development would spread to trade ties.\n\n\"It (LAC breakthrough) has just happened. I would not go so fast at the moment,\" Mr Jaishankar said, referring to trade.\n\nThe last meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs was held on August 29 in Beijing. The two sides then had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the LAC to narrow down differences and find early resolution of outstanding issues.\n\nIt was agreed that restoration of peace and tranquillity, and respect for the LAC are the essential basis for restoration of normalcy in bilateral relations.\n\nEarlier this month, Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had said the two sides have resolved the \"low-hanging fruits\" and now need to address difficult situations, adding there was \"positive signalling\" from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries.\n\nIndian and Chinese military commanders too had been meeting regularly seeking complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh as an essential basis for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.\n\nSome areas still remained to be de-escalated after Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from Gogra-Hot Springs in Ladakh in September 2022. The Chinese forces in this area had returned to pre-2020 positions. Even then, Chinese soldiers were still believed to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north in the Depsang plains.\n\nFierce clashes between soldiers of both sides took place in eastern Ladakh's Galwan in June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action. Over 40 Chinese soldiers were killed or injured.",

However, there is no official confirmation of such a meeting. The most recent meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs took place on August 29 in Beijing. Both sides engaged in a frank and constructive exchange of views regarding the situation along the LAC. The purpose was to bridge differences and expedite the resolution of outstanding issues. It was agreed that restoring peace and tranquillity, as well as respecting the LAC, are essential for normalising bilateral relations. Indian and Chinese military leaders have been meeting regularly to pursue complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, viewing this as crucial for restoring peace and tranquillity in the border regions.\n\nIndia and China relations became tense following the violent border clashes in 2020 in Eastern Ladakh, resulting in the death of about 20 Indian soldiers and more than 20 fatalities in the Chinese PLA. Despite several rounds of talks at the military and diplomatic levels, a solution had remained elusive so far.",

Manjunath by more than two lakh votes. Manjunath had contested Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket. Suresh worked hard but we still lost by a huge margin. Had we lost by a smaller margin, we could have improved our performance. We lost the Lok Sabha badly,\u201d said the Deputy Chief Minister. \n\nHe added that if we start to think that JD-S is weak, then \u201cwe will be the biggest fools\u201d. \n\n\u201cWe have discussed and gathered opinions of the ministers. Instead of a meeting of the election committee, we have discussed with the election in-charges. The decision on the party\u2019s candidates has been made.

Yogeshwar, he said, \u201cI have not met or spoken to Yogeshwar. There has been no meeting or discussion between us.\u201d\n\nHe added that Yogeshwar is a sitting member of the Legislative Council and since the MLA position from Channapatna became vacant, Congress has been working to organise the workers. \n\nOn the alleged rift between BJP and JD-S, the Deputy Chief Minister said that he is not aware of any conflicts between them and the media has not reported anything about it.\n\n\u201cChannapatna is naturally a JD-S stronghold.

We are moving towards forming a committee for this,\u201d the Deputy Chief Minister claimed.\n\nHe added that the citizens should also provide information about which areas are facing such problems. \n\n\u201cI have discussed this with the chief engineer and have been in touch with the BBMP control room since last night and received information.

One star who is most likely to be not picked for the Tour of Australia is Cheteshwar Pujara. The veteran batter, known for his dogged resistance in the face of strong challenge, has a proven record in Australia. The 36-year old has been overlooked from international matches, and the last match he played for India was in June, 2023.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Pujara has now surpassed the great Brian Lara's tally of 65 first-clas tons with a century for Saurashtra against Chhattisgarh in a Ranjji Trophy match. Pujara has 66 tons now. He also went past the 21000-mark in first-class run tally. Regarding his absence, Australia star Pat Cummins said: \"It comes down to who wants to outlast each other, which I quite like that aspect of Test cricket. It's going to be a shame that he is not there, but I'm sure they'll pick someone else who's in a similar kind of style.\"\"It was always great playing (against) Pujara. He was one of those guys who never really felt like he was getting away from you. But then he would (just) bat, bat, bat and bat. I really enjoyed the contest against him. Some days he won, other days I won. It's going to have a bit of a different feel without him. Pujara is a great player.\" He also said that the India vs Australia rivalry is now at par with Ashes. I do think it is. Particularly, after the Indian team won the last couple of series at (our) home. We've had more success against England over the past decade. I think it's right up there,\" he said.\"You know when you play against India, you've got a few Indian fans that are watching. It's a slightly different rivalry to England-Australia rivalry. But again, now having a five-Test match series, it does mirror the Ashes series very closely,\" he said.",

        "text": "In a surprising move, Indonesia's new President Prabowo Subianto has unveiled the country's biggest cabinet to date, with a whopping 109 ministers appointed. The cabinet, dubbed the \u201cRed and White Cabinet\u201d after Indonesia's national colors, dwarfs the 34-member team under predecessor Joko Widodo.\n\nSubianto, who was sworn in as Indonesia's eighth president last week, stated the cabinet's large size was necessary to create a \u201cstrong government\u201d that could unite the diverse nation and represent its many political voices. Analysts noted it allows him to reward the seven-party coalition that backed his election victory in February. Several ministers from Widodo's cabinet were also retained.\n\nA key reason for the cabinet's enormity appears to be Subianto's stated goal of accelerating Indonesia's economic growth to 8% annually through ambitious spending plans. These include salary hikes for civil servants, free school meals for 83 million children, and defense budget increases. To implement such broad programs, a huge team of ministers will be required.\n\nSome familiar faces staying on include respected Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the first person to hold the post under three separate presidencies. Other returnees are the ministers of trade, energy, state firms and interior. Indrawati's stewardship of the economy through various crises has made her a key stabilizing presence.\n\nInterestingly, Subianto had been a political rival of Widodo for years but did not contest his 2019 reelection defeat, even serving as his defense chief later.

Later, they filed a revision application in the Sessions court challenging the Metropolitan court\u2019s summons in the case. However, the Sessions court had declined their plea for an interim stay on trial, after which they approached the Gujarat High Court. According to the University, AAP leaders\u2019 comments targeting the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the university which has established its name among the public.Earlier, the Gujarat High Court had quashed a 2016 order of the Central Information Commission which directed the Gujarat University to provide information on Modi\u2019s degree to Kejriwal",

With nearly all votes counted, around 50% of Moldovans voted \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether to amend the constitution to state that the nation\u2019s strategic goal is to join the EU.\n\nThis positive outcome puts Moldova on a path towards eventually applying for EU membership, a significant step considering the country\u2019s complex geopolitical situation. Nestled between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova has faced political influence from neighboring Russia for decades. However, the referendum results indicate that many Moldovans now favor deeper links with the West instead.\n\nThe referendum took place alongside a tightly contested presidential election, where pro-EU incumbent Maia Sandu claimed victory in the first round over her main challenger. Sandu had strongly advocated for the \u201cyes\u201d vote, and her continued presidency will help maintain Moldova\u2019s westward direction. However, the referendum passed with only a narrow margin, highlighting the country\u2019s internal divisions on this challenging foreign policy issue.\n\nAllegations of electoral meddling and voter intimidation marred the democratic process. Fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor was accused of trying to \u201cbuy\u201d hundreds of thousands of votes against the referendum through social media propaganda and illicit payments.

The people of Delhi want to know the reason behind this, and I tell them, the real reason is the dirty politics of the BJP. Everyone is aware that stubble burning is a major contributor to rising pollution levels in Delhi during winter. The AAP government in Punjab has significantly reduced stubble burning over the past two years. According to the Centre's statistics, incidents of stubble burning have been halved since the AAP took charge in Punjab. In contrast, if you look at Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, stubble burning has increased,\" she told the media.\n\n\"If the Punjab government can reduce stubble burning, why can't the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana do the same? In Delhi, we have only CNG and electric buses, whereas 100% of the interstate buses coming from UP and Haryana are diesel-powered. Why can't the governments of Haryana and UP introduce electric buses? It's because they want to play dirty politics with the people of Delhi. While Delhi has no brick kilns, there are 3,800 brick kilns in the NCR region, contributing significantly to pollution levels in the capital,\" the Chief Minister added.\n\nOn the water pollution in Yamuna, she said, \"BJP leaders have been visiting Kalindi Kunj for photoshoots, but the real cause of the toxic foam in the Yamuna is industrial waste being dumped into the river by factories in Haryana. The UP government also contributes to the problem by releasing polluted water into the Yamuna.\"\n\nOver the past several winters, Delhiites have gasped for breath as stubble burning in neighbouring states, among other causes, has pushed up air pollution in the capital. With election in the city due in February, air pollution has now emerged as a key talking point.\n\nIn power for 10 years, AAP is pushing hard for a third term. AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, now out on bail after he was arrested in a corruption case linked to Delhi's now-scrapped liquor policy, stepped down as Chief Minister last month and said he would return to the top office only after the \"people's court\" elects him again. Senior party leader Atishi took over the job after Mr Kejriwal's exit.",

        "text": "Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court on Monday rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) petition demanding that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi apologise for allegedly tarnishing the dignity of Indian women.The PIL stemmed from a claim that Gandhi had falsely accused former Janata Dal (Secular) MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of rape and sexual abuse, of \u201craping 400 women and filming the act,\u201d describing it as \u201cmass rape\u201d and not a sex scandal.A bench comprising Chief Justice NV Anjaria and Justice K Aravind dismissed the petition, stating that it was a waste of judicial time.The Court also imposed a Rs 25,000 fine on the petitioner, the All India Dalit Action Committee, for filing the plea.The petitioner's counsel argued that Gandhi's remarks, made during a public speech, were highly irresponsible and offensive, particularly to the women of Hassan. He pleaded the Court to issue a notice to Gandhi, compelling him to respond to the allegations.\u201cGandhi is a serial offender,\u201d the counsel contended, referencing past statements made by Gandhi, including comments regarding individuals with the surname Modi.'The petitioner also cited Gandhi's alleged citizenship issues, which are pending before the Delhi High Court, as further evidence of his misconduct.However, the Karnataka HC found no merit in the petition and dismissed it along with a fine.The petitioner's counsel sought waiver of the fine and argued that he should not be penalized for taking rightful action.The PIL highlighted that Gandhi's allegations, made without evidence, misled the public and disrespected the modesty of Indian women, particularly in light of the provisions under the new Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita.The plea argued that Gandhi's statement amounted to hate speech and promoted gender-based hatred. It also sought a directive from the court requiring Gandhi to issue a public apology and called for the National Commission for Women to take appropriate action against him.Despite the petitioner's appeal, the Court concluded that the matter did not warrant further consideration.",

Among the southern states, only Karnataka could see a measurable increase - from 28 seats to 36 - in representation in the Lower House.\n\nTamil Nadu's Lok Sabha share will likely only inch up - from 39 to 41, a five per cent increase, and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana may be given only three extra seats each.\n\nNDTV Explains | What India Will Look Like After 2026 Delimitation\n\nAnd Kerala - the state that has best controlled population growth, a critical factor as the country and world battles climate change, unemployment, and resource scarcity - could lose one of its 20 seats.\n\nThe opposition has been fiercely critical about the marked disparity between possible revised Lok Sabha representation for the northern states - a majority of which voted for the BJP in the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections - and for those in the south.\n\nAnd Mr Stalin's government has been among the most vocal in this regard.\n\nTamil Nadu's Anti-Delimitation Move\n\nIn February Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK adopted a resolution against the proposed delimitation, arguing that states that have best controlled population levels ought not to be penalised.\n\nREAD | In Tamil Nadu Assembly, A Challenge To Delimitation Exercise\n\nConversely, the DMK said, states that had failed to do so should not be rewarded.\n\nChandrababu Naidu's Remark\n\nMr Stalin's comment - in jest, yes, but with a definite edge - came shortly after his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, Chandrababu Naidu, also 'advised' people to have more children.\n\nMr Naidu's comment, however, was in the context of an aging state population.\n\nHe warned that a disproportionate number of elderly people could affect the state's finances and offered Japan as an example. \"In many villages, only elderly people remain... as the young have migrated to cities or overseas,\" he said, adding his government would pass laws in this regard.\n\nCentre Says...\n\nThe Narendra Modi government will be considerate of the fact southern states have, on average, controlled population better than the north, sources told NDTV in September last year. Fears southern states will be penalised by their Lok Sabha seats being affected, will be allayed, sources said.\n\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

There were no clues available from the spot and analysis is going on,\u201d they said.\nThe sources added: \u201cThe place is insignificant in terms of being picked as a target for a bomb blast. This is a busy area in terms of car parking and residential locality but the logistics ensured that no damage occurred. What is most surprising is that no bomb blast material is available and neither was any device found. In this case, it becomes a crude bomb.\u201d\nCrude bomb is used in Bengal and other parts of India, sources said, adding that they had never been used in the national capital.\n\u201cThe CCTV footage examination is crucial. There is no clue in CCTVs so far as no one is seen going closer to the spot where the blast took place.\u201d\nOn Monday, Delhi Police said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to the blast. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform.\nThe purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents. The claim was made by Justice League India using a clip of the blast with a \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d watermark at the bottom, and circulated on social media platforms.\nThe blast, which destroyed a portion of the school wall, window panes of nearby shops, and damaged a few cars parked nearby, was captured in a CCTV camera. Police suspect that the bomb might have been placed late at night as local residents said it went off between 7.35 am and 7.40 am.\nThe sound of the blast was heard several hundred metres away. Videos from the spot showed thick plumes rising from the site. Residents called the explosion \u201cintense\u201d and reported a foul smell in the area.\nPolice have filed a case under sections of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on charges of \u201cmischief through explosion\u201d and under the Explosives Act.",

He vacated the Budgam seat and retained the Ganderbal constituency, the pro-tem speaker announced in the House on Monday. The Ganderbal seat is considered an Abdullah family stronghold.\n\nThe 54-year-old leader was an MLA from Ganderbal from 2009 to 2014 during his first tenure as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nWith this, the strength of the National Conference in the 95-member House has been reduced to 41 but the party still enjoys a comfortable majority with the support of six Congress MLA, five Independents and one MLA each of the AAP and the CPI(M). The BJP with 29 seats is the second-largest party - its best-ever performance in J&K.\n\nOmar takes pledge in Kashmiri\n\nOmar Abdullah, son of Farooq Abdullah and his British wife Mollie Abdullah, had often faced criticism for not being able to speak his native language.\n\nWhile the third generation politician from the Abdullah family is fluent in English, his fluency in vernaculars like Hindi, Urdu and Kashmiri was poor at the start of his political career in the late 1990s.\n\nHowever, during his first tenure as Chief Minister from 2009 to 2014, Mr. Omar Abdullah took lessons to improve his speaking skills in these three languages. And on Monday, he took the oath as MLA in Kashmiri.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Surinder Kumar Choudhary took oath in English.\n\nThe oath-taking ceremony of the MLAs marks an end to the six-year-long legislative hiatus.\n\nThere are 51 first-time members including BJP MLA from Kishtwar Shagun Parihar, who is the youngest member at 29. The NC veteran and MLA from Chrar-e-Sharief, Abdul Rahim Rather, is the oldest at 80.\n\nMr. Rather and party colleague Ali Mohammad Sagar (MLA Khanyar) have been elected to the Assembly for a record seven terms. While Mr. Sagar has been a member of the Legislative Assembly since 1983, Mr. Rather started his long stint as a legislator in 1977. However, the former finance minister lost the 2014 Assembly elections.",

        "text": "Maputo: Police in Mozambique fired tear gas on Monday to disperse a small crowd in Maputo, where shops were closed ahead of a planned protest against alleged electoral fraud. Tensions escalated after attackers killed two Opposition figures\u2014a lawyer and a party official\u2014who were shot while traveling in a car, prompting condemnation from the EU and human rights groups.The new Opposition Podemos party and its presidential candidate, Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, have rejected provisional results that indicate a probable win for the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for half a century. They called for a nationwide strike in response to the results.Mozambique Elections: Police fire tear gas at Mondlane, journalists \u2013 Watch | O Pa\u00eds #Mozambique #Mo\u00e7ambique #Mocambique #MozambiqueElections #News https://t.co/BeZrRxo0NA\u2014 Club of Mozambique (@clubOmozambique) October 21, 2024 \">Also Read: The Mozambican civil society election observer group More Integrity reported that the shooting occurred in the Bairro da Coop neighborhood of Maputo, resulting in the deaths of Podemos lawyer Elvino Dias and party representative Paulo Guambe. Several dozen people, including journalists, scattered as heavily armed police patrolled the area, according to videos posted on social media. Adriano Nuvunga, director of Mozambique\u2019s Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD), described the killings as \u201ca cold-blooded murder,\u201d noting that around 10 to 15 bullets were fired. The EU condemned the violence, demanding an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation. \u201cIn a democracy, there is no place for politically motivated killings,\u201d the EU's diplomatic service stated, adding that its election observers are still assessing the electoral process. As of now, Frelimo leads in all 11 provinces, with Daniel Chapo expected to win the 9 October election, despite external observers raising concerns about the poll's integrity due to reports of vote-buying and intimidation. Full results are due on 24 October, but fears mount that Monday\u2019s protests could turn violent, given the history of police brutality against political dissent. The city of Maputo resembled a ghost town, with shops closed and helicopters hovering above, as the nation awaits official presidential and parliamentary results.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed that secularism has long been regarded as an integral part of the Constitution's basic structure. The top court made the statement orally while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the removal of the terms 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Preamble to the Constitution.\"You don't want India to be secular?\" Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked, while hearing the plea alongside Justice Sanjay Kumar. The Supreme Court bench said that the term 'socialism' should not necessarily be interpreted in the western context and the term can also mean that there has to be an equal opportunity for all. \"There are a number of judgments of this court which hold that Secularism was always part of the basic structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and word fraternity used in the Constitution as well as the rights under Part III, there is a clear indication that secular has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,\" Live Law quoted Justice Khanna as saying. Khanna also pointed out that, unlike the French model of secularism, India adopted a new model of secularism.The plea, filed by senior BJP leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy and one Balram Singh, challenged the 42nd amendment to the Indian Constitution that was made by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi-led government during the Emergency.Responding to the top court judge, Advocate Jain said, \"We are not saying that India is not secular, we are challenging the amendment\". Jain further argued that Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar had opined that the inclusion of the word 'socialism' would curtail personal liberty.In response, Justice Khanna said, \"Socialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of country should be distributed equally. Let's not take the Western meaning\".It was also argued by the petitioner that the Preamble of the Constitution, as it stood on November 26, 1949, was a definitive declaration, contending that any subsequent amendment adding words such as 'socialist\" and 'secular' was arbitrary, according to Live Law.To this, Justice Khanna highlighted that the words introduced by the 1976 amendment were clearly indicated by brackets, making it evident that they were additions. Khanna also pointed out that terms such as 'unity' and 'integrity' of the nation were also incorporated through this amendment.The bench then agreed to examine the issue in detail and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Oct 21, 2024ALSO READ | Supreme Court dismisses Arvind Kejriwal's plea in case over remark on PM's degreeALSO READ | Supreme Court junks plea to replace 'Hindutva' with 'Indian constitutionalism",

        "text": "In Madhya Pradesh, a significant debate has emerged regarding the use of loudspeakers in temples, ignited by a recent social media post from IAS officer Shailbala Martin. The 2009-batch officer, currently serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department, raised pertinent questions that garnered widespread attention.\nWho Is Shailbala Martin?\nShailbala Martin, originally from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, was born on April 9, 1965. According to the state government website, she began her career in the State Civil Service (SCS) before being promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) on June 12, 2017. With a BA and an MA in Arts from Holkar Science College in Indore, Martin joined the State Civil Service in 2009.\nThroughout her career, Martin has held various positions, including roles in the Health Department in 2014, Municipal Commissioner of Burhanpur in 2019, and Collector of Niwari district the same year. Since January 25, 2022, she has been serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department.\nThe Loudspeaker Controversy\nThe recent controversy can be traced back to guidelines issued by the state government last year to mitigate noise pollution, which specifically aimed to regulate loudspeakers in religious venues. A journalist on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) questioned the disparity in enforcement, focusing on the use of loudspeakers in mosques and the prevalence of DJs playing music outside these spaces.\nIn response, Martin highlighted the noise pollution caused by loudspeakers in temples, questioning why such disturbances, which can be heard several streets away and continue late into the night, are often overlooked. Her tweet sparked a mix of reactions, with some users supporting her stance while others criticised her for raising the issue.",

        "text": "Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra on Monday (October 21, 2024) ruled out the possibility of an alliance with any regional party for the upcoming bypolls to seven assembly seats.\n\nTalking to reporters after a meeting of the Congress Coordination Committee, Mr. Dotasra said the State unit has made panels of probable candidates for the seven seats and the final announcement will be made by the party's high command in Delhi.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha election held this year, the Congress entered into an alliance with the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) for the Nagaur seat and with the CPI(M) for the Sikar seat.\n\nRLP convener Hanuman Beniwal, who had won the Khinvsar assembly seat in Nagaur district in last year's assembly election, emerged victorious from the Nagaur parliamentary constituency this year. As a result, the Khinsvar assembly seat fell vacant.\n\nThere was speculation about a Congress-RLP alliance for the bypoll to the Khinvsar seat but Mr. Dotasra said the Congress' State unit was not looking for a tie-up.\n\nHe said the Congress' Rajasthan in-charge Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa would take the panels for all seven seats to Delhi and candidates would be declared after a discussion with the high command.\n\nDungarpur's Chorasi assembly seat fell vacant after Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) MLA Rajkumar Roat won the Lok Sabha election from the Banswara-Dungarpur district.\n\nThe Congress did not announce any alliance with the BAP in the general election but asked its candidate to withdraw their nominations from the Banswara-Dungarpur constituency. The move was aimed at supporting the BAP.\n\n\"There are no talks of alliance with any party in the assembly bypolls in Rajasthan. We have prepared panels for all seven seats in the meeting today,\" Mr. Dotasra said.\n\nHe also exuded confidence that the party would win all seven assembly seats.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Assembly Tikaram Jully, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, former assembly Speaker CP Joshi and other party leaders attended the meeting chaired by Randhawa.\n\nVoting on seven assembly seats -- Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Deoli-Uniara, Khinvsar, Chorasi, Salumbar and Ramgarh -- will be held on November 13 and the results will be declared on November 23.\n\nBypolls on two seats are being held due to the death of the MLAs -- Congress's Zubair Khan from Ramgarh and BJP's Amritlal Meena from Salumbar.\n\nIn the other five constituencies, the MLAs were elected as MPs, necessitating the bypolls.\n\nCongress MLAs Brijendra Ola (Jhunjhunu), Harish Chandra Meena (Deoli-Uniara) and Murari Lal Meena (Dasau) were elected as MPs in the Lok Sabha election. The other two are Beniwal and Roat.\n\nFour of the seven seats where bypolls will be held were with the Congress, while the BJP, BAP and the RLP held one each.\n\nThe BJP has declared candidates for all seats except Chorasi.\n\nThe BAP has already declared its candidate for the Chorasi seat.\n\nCurrently, the 200-seat state assembly has 114 MLAs of the BJP, 65 of the Congress, three of the BAP, two of the BSP, one of the Rashtriya Lok Dal and eight Independents.",

It's mind-boggling - you are one nation but you are speaking different languages and even the written languages are different. The first thing he (PM Modi) did was unify the tax system. This is an incredible accomplishment. This is something that probably would have taken a century.\"The investor said India's diversity results in incredible creativity and the future belongs to those who are creative.\"I definitely think India is going to become a leader or the leader in semiconductor production in the future. One reason I say that is the demand - you have got a market here that is one of the biggest in the world. Secondly, it is a relatively open economy, so you are going to be able to take technology from Taiwan, China, the United States, wherever. Thirdly, you have got an incredible software industry already, you are the largest exporter of software in the world,\" Mr Mobius said, adding that many large semiconductor companies already have software bases in India.The investor said semiconductor fabrication will happen in India because the country has the labour force. \"I remember I was meeting an Indian friend of mine a few years ago and I said India will become a big semiconductor manufacturer. He said Indians are not as patient and not so good with small things like the Chinese are and I asked him if he had seen the places where they are polishing these tiny diamonds in India. They will do a very good job here, no questions about it. But it will require a huge amount of capital,\" he added.In terms of return on capital, it's \"India, China and the US\", Mr Mobius said, adding that India still presents plenty of opportunities despite stock prices climbing. As the conversation moved to lighter topics, the investor said he likes the 'Baahubali' movies and also had a picture taken with a statue of the villain from the movies in Hyderabad. &nbsp",

What came instead was the pronouncement of his death \u2013 Shashi Abrol had been killed in a terror attack in Kashmir's Ganderbal district.\n\nNews of his death came late on Sunday night, long after the moon had risen, the sight millions of Hindu women look out for to break their daylong fast on the day. Fate could not have dealt Ruchi Abrol a crueller blow.\nShashi Abrol, an architectural designer, was among the seven people killed when terrorists attacked a tunnel construction site on the Srinagar-Leh national highway on Sunday.\nThe attack took place when the team had returned from work to their camp late in the evening. The morning after, his wife held on to their three-year-old daughter, angry, anguished and bewildered at the same time. The couple also has a son studying engineering.\n\u201cI spoke to him in the evening. He didn't mention any threats. I was going to the temple as part of my Karwa Chauth fast, and we had a brief conversation. I tried calling him after I returned but he didn't pick up.

Our dear Shashi Ji was killed in a cowardly act by terrorists,\u201d she said.\nAnxiety mounted as the hours passed by.\nRuchi had completed her rituals and was waiting for a video call from her husband, everyone unaware of the magnitude of the tragedy that had befallen them.\n\u201cWe tried to comfort Ruchi as we grew worried when his phone switched off late at night. We only learned about his death through the media, which shocked us all,\u201d Divya said.\nShashi was the family's sole breadwinner.\n\u201cWhat have they gained from this? How will she feed her children now?

Seven people were massacred. We lost our brother,\u201d Shashi's sister Urvashi said after the incident that came just four days after Omar Abdullah was sworn in as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe family called on the government to provide financial assistance.\nJ L Abrol, Shashi's father, said they had never anticipated any danger in Kashmir. \u201cWe demand a job for my daughter in law to feed the family,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is no breadwinner left in the family. How will his wife, who is a homemaker, feed the children? She should be given a government job.

If you look at our history with Russia after Independence, Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively. Among the major countries, there are not many about who we can say this. Today Russia's situation is different, I think Russia's relationship with the West has broken down, so you have a Russia which is turning much more towards Asia. Should Russia not have multiple options in Asia? Should we not take what is good for us in national interests?\"\"And clearly, Russia as a major natural resources power has a complementarity with India at this stage of development where we are big resource consumers. It isn't just Russian oil, it could be fertilisers, metals, coal. There is a whole economic logic to it. There is also a basic strategic logic, if you look at the Eurasian landmass, there are three big countries. You always keep a balance, a relationship,\" the minister said.New Delhi's ties with Moscow have been a key geopolitical talking point over the past few years, especially after the Ukraine War began. With the West siding with Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia, India's decision to buy Russian oil had come under scrutiny.India has consistently refused to take sides in the conflict and said it is on the side of peace. This was also reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Earlier, articulating the Indian position over the decision to procure Russian oil, Dr Jaishankar had said New Delhi has a right to prioritise the interests of its people.\"I understand that there is a conflict situation (in Ukraine). I also understand that Europe has a point of view and Europe will make the choices it will make that is Europe's right. But for Europe to make choices which prioritises its energy needs and then ask India to do something else..,\" he had said.",

So far, six doctors on hunger strike had been hospitalised due to deteriorating health, while eight others remained on indefinite fast.\n\nBanerjee spoke with the protesting doctors over the phone on Saturday, urging them to end their fast, asserting that most of their demands had been met. She requested an additional three to four months to address their remaining concerns.\n\nChief Minister meeting live: Dr Asfakulla Naiya, a protesting doctor of the West Bengal Junior Doctors\u2019 Front and 3rd year postgraduate trainee of ENT at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, highlights to the Chief Minister that the demands posed by junior doctors include the welfare of patients who seek medical treatment in State-run hospitals\n\nDr Debasish Halder, a senior resident of anaesthesiology at Medical College, Kolkata, says that of the ten-point demands which were demanded to the government earlier, were a centralised referral system and live bed vacancy monitor. He highlights that a State task force was promised for the fulfilment of infrastructural demands. \u201cYou had earlier said that 5-7 junior doctors should be part of the State Task Force, but we had suggested more representatives be present from WBJDF on a rotational basis. However, if a SoP is formed for the State Task Force formation and a monthly meeting of the task force ensured, along with directives for the same, we believe our earlier agreements can be realised more constructively,\u201d he says\n\n\u201cWe want RDAs and MBBS student unions to be statutory bodies authorised by the government via a statute by West Bengal University of Health Sciences, and elected representatives from these bodies be elected into the aforementioned committees,\u201d one of the protesting doctors suggest\n\nThe junior doctors launched their protests after the recovery of the body of a woman medic from a seminar room at RG Kar Medical Hospital on August 9, an incident that sparked outrage nationwide.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)",

Common sense seems to be lacking. What the coach or captain is trying to prove, is beyond my understanding,\" Tiwary said, speaking on the Cricbuzz YouTube channel.\"I feel like, whenever there is a new coach or new captain, they try to prove something, and take such decisions,\" said Tiwary.Tiwary pointed out that Rohit had even admitted to misreading the pitch. He stated that three pacers should've played, while Ashwin should've bowled more. He also said that Rohit should've been better guided by coach Gautam Gambhir.\"I knew that one of the spinners would be under-bowled, but I never imagined that it would be Ashwin. He has over 500 Test wickets. When you are defending 107, why didn't you bring him in the attack alongside Jasprit Bumrah?\" Tiwary continued.\"Good captains also make mistakes, because a lot of things go through your mind. Here, the role of the coach to give constant guidance is very important, but I don't know why that did not happen,\" he added.Tiwary also said that pacer Akash Deep's confidence may have been affected after he was dropped from the XI.\"Akash Deep's confidence must've suffered a big blow when he found out he wasn't part of the playing XI against Bangladesh,\" said Tiwary.\"He was outstanding in the Bangladesh series, and his confidence would've been sky-high. Having seen the conditions on Day 1, he would've been shocked to find out that he'd been dropped from the team,\" Tiwary added.India have two more Tests remaining in the series against New Zealand to make a comeback.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Batting maestro Virat Kohli and head coach Gautam Gambhir were seen sharing light moments during Team India's net session on Tuesday ahead of the second Test against New Zealand in Pune.The former teammates, who have had their share of on-field rivalries during the IPL in the past, seemed to enjoy each other's company as their casual interaction was a refreshing sight for fans, as India look to bounce back against the Kiwis after losing the first Test by 8 wickets in Bengaluru.With both legends bringing immense experience to the table, the team appears relaxed yet focused. Kohli and Gambhir's light-hearted exchange added a positive vibe to the session.\u2014 mufaddal_vohra (@mufaddal_vohra) Team India is optimistic that Rishabh Pant will be able to continue as the wicketkeeper in the second Test, despite sustaining a knee injury during the first match, according to assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate.In the opening Test, which marked New Zealand's first victory in India since 1988, Pant played a courageous innings, scoring 99 runs. However, while performing his wicketkeeping duties, he suffered an injury in the same knee that had undergone surgery following a severe car accident in December 2022, which had kept him out of action for over a year.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkTDl5kZ55EAs the home team aims to equalise the three-match series in the upcoming Test in Pune on Thursday, Pant's fitness remains a key concern. Ten Doeschate addressed reporters, saying, \"Rishabh's pretty good. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee. But fingers crossed he'll be good to keep in this Test as well.\"India faced a challenging start in the opening Test, being dismissed for a mere 46 runs. However, a remarkable comeback was staged, led by Pant and Sarfaraz Khan, who formed a formidable 177-run partnership. Sarfaraz, who replaced Shubman Gill in the lineup, showcased his prowess by scoring an impressive 150 runs.With Sarfaraz's maiden Test century, Team India now faces a selection dilemma as Gill is expected to return for the second match. The team management has expressed support for senior batsman KL Rahul, despite his recent inconsistent batting performances. \"There's certainly no concerns about KL,\" affirmed ten Doeschate, \"He's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space, but yeah, we're certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team.\"",

Meanwhile, Team India remains hopeful about Rishabh Pant's recovery from his knee injury. Sarfaraz Khan's performance in the previous Test creates a selection dilemma.",

        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team is currently in a rebuilding phase. Since the last few months, the Pakistan team has been suffering some big losses. Be it the ODI World Cup or the T20 World Cup, Pakistan have dealt some big losses. They even lost a Test series at home to Bangladesh recently. The Pakistan cricket team is desperate for a turnaround and coach Jason Gillespie is part of that process. A video is going viral on social media, where the former Australia star can be seen picking up water bottles at a stadium after a training session. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");After the video went viral, several users commented that Pakistan players should learn from him. \r\nThis is one of the main reasons why Aussies are better than us\r\n\u2014 Zulfi (@zulfitahir) October 22, 2024\r\n\r\nBut we will not learn. @TheRealPCB please teach players so manners.\r\n\u2014 S M Chishty (@Chishty_2014) October 22, 2024\r\n\r\nThis video should highlight the fact that the players who trained have not got the basic decency to clean up after themselves, instead of praising Gillespie for doing it, which everybody understands is very nice of him.\r\n\u2014 Rick James B.(@RickJamesBiiih) October 22, 2024\r\nAs the third and final Test between Pakistan and England approaches, Pakistan's intentions for the Rawalpindi pitch are clear. By taking extreme measures, such as using giant heaters and industrial fans to accelerate the drying process, the team hopes to defy Rawalpindi's natural favouring of fast bowlers and turn it into a spinner-friendly surface\u2014one that could prove decisive in the series.Vice-captain Saud Shakeel noted that, unlike Multan, Rawalpindi is not naturally inclined to take turn. Shakeel explained the climatic differences between the cities, with Multan being warmer and more humid, factors that contribute to quicker wear and tear on the surface. The stakes are high for Pakistan, who are coming off a much-needed win in Multan on a spinning wicket. After victory in Multan, slipper Shan Masood, openly expressed his desire for a turning track, the team is focused on replicating the conditions that helped them level the series.\"If you look at the difference between Multan and Pindi, there's a difference in climate,\" Shakeel said in the press conference. \"Multan is warmer than Pindi, Multan is warmer and more humid compared to Pindi. Pindi favours fast bowlers slightly and has more bounce, compared to Multan. The groundsman prepares according to that, and I think that's what causes the changes in the pitch.\"But the way the pitch looks and the success we got in the second Test, we'll try for a similar kind of pitch that favours us and helps us win this game,\" he said.Pakistan's effort to manipulate the pitch, however, has not gone unnoticed by England. English batter Harry Brook speculated that the Rawalpindi surface had been \"raked\" to encourage early deterioration, a tactic designed to bring spinners into play from the start.In response, England announced their XI early, opting for just one specialist seamer, Gus Atkinson, and relying heavily on their spin trio, including leg spinner Rehan Ahmed. This strategic move signals that England is prepared to face another spin-heavy battle and could be a direct response to Pakistan's efforts to reshape the pitch to their advantage.Pakistan's struggle to figure out the best use of home conditions has been ongoing since their return from playing in the UAE. Initially, the team experimented with seam-friendly pitches to capitalize on the talents of fast bowlers like Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, leading to early successes against Sri Lanka and South Africa.With IANS inputs",

New Zealand\u2019s other major wicket-takers at the T20 World Cup have also moved up the standings, with Eden Carson closing in on the top 10, up to 12th, and Rosemary Mair climbing 10 spots to 27th. Mair\u2019s impressive run in the UAE earned her a spot in the ICC Team of the Tournament. Elsewhere among the bowlers, Australia\u2019s Annabel Sutherland is up into the top 10 with her highest rating to date, moving up to eighth, above teammate Ash Gardner. England\u2019s Sophie Ecclestone retains the top spot. Other stars of the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup have also made significant gains in the Batting Rankings. South Africa\u2019s Anneke Bosch, who stunned Australia in the semi-final, is up seven spots to 13th, while veteran Suzie Bates has leapfrogged Alyssa Healy into sixth in the only change in the top 10. Deandra Dottin\u2019s extraordinary return to international cricket with West Indies has seen her climb 36 places, but she remains lower down the standings due to her extended absence from the game. New Zealand\u2019s Brooke Halliday (up 21 spots) and West Indies pinch-hitter Qiana Joseph (up 46) have also seen sizeable climbs due to their fast-scoring contributions in the UAE. Beth Mooney, Tahlia McGrath and Laura Wolvaardt remain the top three batters. Pakistan\u2019s captain Fatima Sana has reached a career-best rating in the T20 All-Rounders Rankings, moving up two spots to 11th following her impressive performances in the tournament. There is no movement in the top 10 of the All-Rounders Rankings, with Matthews, Kerr and Gardner the top three. (ANI)",

        "text": "Hyderabad: A recent study shows that 60 per cent of women investors in Hyderabad opt for conservative investments like bonds and fixed deposits, while only 25 per cent prefer high-risk assets such as equities.According to a paper \u2018Impact of Psychological Factors on Individual Investment Decisions: A Case Study of Women Investors in Twin Cities of Telangana\u2019 written by D. Sujatha, Dr A. Krishna Sudheer, and Achini Neha, the factors like risk tolerance, overconfidence, and regret aversion significantly shape these investment decisions.Risk tolerance emerged as the most influential factor, with 75 per cent of women with higher risk tolerance choosing equities, while nearly 90 per cent of those with lower tolerance preferred safer options. \u201cI\u2019ve always preferred secure investments. Bonds and fixed deposits feel safer to me, especially with the economic uncertainties we face,\u201d said Anita Rao, a 45-year-old teacher.The study found that regret aversion bias played a significant role, with 50 per cent of women preferring safer investments to avoid future regret. This conservative stance, while reducing risk, also limited their potential for higher returns. The findings throw light on the need for financial advisors to offer personalised advice, helping women navigate these psychological biases.The study also highlights overconfidence bias, which affected over 30 per cent of women. These investors tend to overestimate their decision-making abilities, resulting in frequent trading. Confirmation bias, which led 40 per cent of participants to favour information that supported their existing beliefs, often resulted in missed opportunities for diversification. \u201cI used to think my decisions were foolproof, given my qualifications and a little research that I did, but later I have realised the need to consult experts,\u201d said Meghana Reddy, a 34-year-old IT professional, who has since diversified her portfolio after seeking professional advice.Trend-chasing bias was found among 35 per cent of the women surveyed, making them susceptible to market volatility. Many followed market trends without thorough analysis, leading to potential losses during downturns. \u201cI used to follow the crowd, but after a few setbacks, I\u2019m more cautious. Now, I focus on long-term stability rather than quick gains,\u201d Priya Jain, 29, a fashion entrepreneur, told Deccan Chronicle.\u201cThe idea that women can\u2019t process numbers or money was a crazy lie made up to keep women away from accountability and independence. Tailored guidance can empower women to make more informed, balanced, and diversified financial decisions,\u201d said Madhava R.K., a chartered accountant-turned-financial adviser",

After facing Atletico Madrid and Juventus, the 2023 German Cup winners will now host Liverpool FC this Wednesday evening.\n\nWhile Leipzig recorded narrow defeats against Atletico Madrid (2-1) and Juventus (3-2), their match against Liverpool offers another opportunity for the German side to make an impact. Despite the two losses, coach Marco Rose\u2019s team pushed both giants to the brink, with both games decided in the dying minutes. Liverpool, the current Premier League leaders, present a formidable challenge, but Leipzig\u2019s top scorer, Slovenian international Benjamin Sesko, will once again step into the spotlight, reports Xinhua.\n\nSesko has scored all three of Leipzig\u2019s Champions League goals so far, adding to his two goals and two assists in the 2024/25 Bundesliga campaign, which was a clear sign of the 21-year-old\u2019s rising form.\n\nLeipzig\u2019s defensive stability makes them a serious contender. Unbeaten in the Bundesliga and conceding just two goals in seven games, they pose a strong challenge for Liverpool. Sesko, often compared to Manchester City\u2019s Erling Haaland due to his similar physical attributes (Sesko: 1.95 meters, Haaland: 1.94 meters), has largely avoided the spotlight. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to compare me to Haaland,\u201d Sesko has said, adding, \u201cI have my own path.\u201d\n\nSesko\u2019s potential has drawn interest from top European clubs, with Arsenal, PSG, and Milan rumoured to have been tracking him. Despite reports of a 65-million-euro exit clause, the 37-time capped forward extended his contract with Leipzig until 2029.\n\nLeipzig\u2019s strong defensive record six clean sheets in seven league games and Sesko\u2019s goal-scoring prowess position them as serious contenders in Europe. For Sesko, the upcoming duel with Liverpool\u2019s Virgil van Dijk, one of Europe\u2019s top defenders, could be decisive in Wednesday\u2019s clash.\n\nPundits and coaches have predicted a bright future for Sesko. Bayern Munich\u2019s sporting director Christoph Freund and RB Leipzig CEO Marcel Schafer have closely followed his progress, discovering him, like Haaland, in the Red Bull system. Though Sesko may not yet match Haaland\u2019s physical dominance, his technical skills continue to develop as he adapts to the faster pace of the Bundesliga.\n\nWhile Haaland currently has the edge in terms of efficiency, Sesko is closing the gap. It\u2019s no bold prediction to say he could soon be playing for one of Europe\u2019s top clubs.",

The selectors are expected to announce the squad on October 28. Pujara could get the selectors' nod if Ajit Agarkar and his team decide to fall back on his experience. The 36-year-old was the leading run-getter in the 2018-19 series with 521 runs off 1258 balls and was once again the backbone of Indian batting three years later when he accumulated 271 runs off 928 balls.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Across the two teams, the 103-Test veteran by far faced the most number of balls to wear out the opposition attack comprising Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. Pujara has not played for India since the World Test Championship final in June last year.His appetite for big runs hasn't satiated yet as he scored 234 off 383 balls against Chattisgarh in the last Ranji Trophy round.Reddy being prepared as a seamer all-rounderDespite his good performances in the Bangladesh series, Nitish Reddy won't be a part of the T20s in South Africa after being picked in the India A squad for the shadow tour of Australia.While Shardul Thakur's experience can come in handy, he hasn't done anything worth taking note of since his comeback from injury.

        "text": "John McGinn said there is no limit to Aston Villa's ambition in the Champions League after beating Bologna 2-0 to go top of the table in a dream return to the competition. Villa last played in the top tier of European football back in 1983 but Unai Emery's transformation of a sleeping giant knows no bounds as they became the only side to register three wins from three Champions League games so far. McGinn's free-kick flew beyond everyone into the far corner to open the scoring in the second half before Jhon Duran kept up his prolific strike rate on a rare start for the Colombian.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"We don't want to stop here. It puts us in a great position,\" said McGinn, who joined the club when they were still in the second tier of English football in 2018.\"What we are building here is amazing.\"This is home for me. It is my seventh season here, we've had ups and downs. It has been a rollercoaster. Hopefully we can keep climbing.\"Bologna, by contrast, have just one point from their opening three games and one win in 11 games in all competitions this season.The Rossoblu were one of the stories of European football last season as they finished fifth in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 60 years.However, they have struggled since losing star players Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirkzee to Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United, while coach Thiago Motta left to take charge of Juventus.Emery said on the eve of the game he wants to \"break barriers\" at a club that has not won a trophy since 1996.And the Spaniard showed the impressive strength in depth at his disposal with a comfortable win despite making four changes.\"We are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and maturing in everything,\" said Emery.Duran was finally handed his first start in either the Premier League or Champions League after scoring five times as a substitute this season.Set-piece specialistsMcGinn and England international Ezri Konsa returned from injury, while 35 million pounds ($46 million) signing Ian Maatsen came in at left-back.French international Boubacar Kamara made his return from a serious knee injury as a late substitute, while club captain Tyrone Mings was on the bench for the first time since suffering an ACL injury in August 2023.Villa's strength from set-pieces has been one of the keys to Emery's transformation of the club from battling relegation to beating off Europe's finest over the past two years.McGinn's enticing delivery did not even need a touch from the cluster of bodies in the box as the Scotland midfielder's strike found the bottom corner to break the deadlock 10 minutes into the second half.Nine minutes later, Duran made sure of the points with a clinical near-post finish from Morgan Rogers' cross.The combustible striker then showed his displeasure at being replaced by Ollie Watkins moments later as he punched the bench in frustration.But that did not take the shine off another memorable night for Villa in their meteoric rise since Emery arrived in Birmingham.Nine points may already be enough to secure a playoff place with five games to spare.Only the bottom 12 in the 36-team table will be eliminated, but Villa's sights are now on trying to secure a top-eight finish and automatic qualification for the last 16.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Paris Saint-Germain's stuttering start in this season's Champions League continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw by PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday, leading coach Luis Enrique to admit he was \"worried\" about his team's prospects. The Dutch champions led through a Noa Lang strike just after the half-hour mark at the Parc des Princes, but Achraf Hakimi equalised early in the second half. Nevertheless, this was a game PSG should have won given the chances they created, but once again they struggled to put the ball in the net, a recurring problem in Europe.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"It is difficult to accept the result after a game like that but we already knew that football is often unfair,\" Luis Enrique said. \"We played well throughout and were better than PSV.\"PSG's frustration was summed up when they were awarded a penalty in injury time after a challenge on Marco Asensio, only for the decision to be overturned on review. The French giants had 26 attempts on goal to their opponents' eight. They have now scored just twice in their last five matches in the Champions League, with the other an own-goal against Girona last month.That run goes back to last season's semi-final against Borussia Dortmund which they lost 2-0 on aggregate.\"I think it is obvious that we created a lot more chances than our opponents and we deserved to win the game,\" Luis Enrique added.After a narrow 1-0 victory against Girona and a 2-0 defeat away to Arsenal in their first two matches in the new-look format of the competition, PSG have just four points from a possible nine.There are still five games to play but they have Atletico Madrid at home next followed by Bayern Munich away, suggesting things will not get any easier.\"It is the worst group (fixtures) and we need to be prepared to improve what we can and keep going. But yes, it is difficult and of course I am worried,\" the coach added.PSV, meanwhile, are still winless having previously lost away to Juventus before drawing with Sporting.That shows how big a step up playing in Europe is for the Dutch side, who have a perfect record after nine games in this season's Eredivisie.\"The players did a great job tonight and I am really proud of them to be leaving here with a point,\" said PSV coach Peter Bosz.Rested in Ligue 1 last weekend and controversially dropped against Arsenal, Ousmane Dembele was back in the starting line-up for PSG.Dembele missesThe France winger has never been a deadly finisher and was guilty of missing a couple of big chances in the first half.Lee Kang-in, preferred to Randal Kolo Muani in PSG's attack, was first to force a save from visiting goalkeeper Walter Benitez.Dembele then should have scored in the 19th minute when he arrived unmarked at the back post to meet an inviting cross from the left, but his effort on the half-volley clipped the bar.That was followed by another miss on the half-hour mark as Dembele was played in by a clever Joao Neves pass off the chest, but he blazed over the bar.Having offered little going forward, PSV went ahead on 34 minutes.An Olivier Boscagli interception left the home team exposed, and Ismael Saibari supplied Lang who blasted in a low shot from the edge of the area.PSG were now in danger of a seventh defeat in 15 games in the Champions League since the start of last season, but they found an equaliser on 55 minutes.Hakimi tried a speculative shot from 25 metres which was simply too powerful for Benitez as the ball passed through the goalkeeper's legs.The same player came close to putting PSG ahead before drama ensued in injury time.Swedish referee Glenn Nyberg pointed to the spot in the 93rd minute when Boscagli lunged into a tackle on Marco Asensio, but the defender played the ball and the penalty was cancelled after a VAR check.Benitez then saved PSV with a brilliant save from a Marquinhos header, and the final whistle was met with boos by the home fans.The Qatar-owned club's prospects of finally landing a first ever Champions League title this season currently seem remote.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Veterans Roy Krishna and Mourtada Fall found the net as Odisha FC beat East Bengal 2-1 at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday to register their second win of the Indian Super League season. \n\nKrishna and Fall scored either side of a first-half penalty from East Bengal striker Dimitrios Diamantakos to climb to seventh in the table.\n\nWith this loss, the Red & Gold Brigade succumbed to their sixth successive loss this ISL season and a second consecutive one under new head coach Oscar Bruzon. \n\nThe stage for the same was set up by Krishna in the 22nd minute, as the Fijian forward scored his fourth goal against East Bengal FC in the competition. Livewire youngster Isak Vanlalruatfela was given plenty of space on the left flank when he launched a slightly long-ranged through delivery for Krishna. \n\nThe striker was in the right place at the right time to pierce through the visitors\u2019 backline. He collected the ball at ease, marched forward and mastered the 1v1 situation with East Bengal goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Singh Gill to land the ball in the bottom right corner.\n\nOdisha held on to that lead dearly until midfielder Thoiba Singh floundered and handled the ball in the penalty area as the first half was about to draw to an end. Diamantakos stepped up to snap his scoreless streak and net for the first time in five ISL matches. With his left foot, he deposited the ball into the bottom right corner, past a fully stretched Amrinder Singh.\n\nIn the second half, Odisha had to regain control back over the proceedings, and Lobera\u2019s trusted lieutenants \u2013 Fall and Ahmed Jahouh, yet again answered his call. A free-kick on the inside channel of the right flank, at distance, was sufficient for the duo to turn the tables as Jahouh\u2019s impeccable delivery was directed accurately to Fall, who nodded the ball home and secured the lead back for his team in the 69th minute.\n\nMatters got further complicated for East Bengal when Provat Lakra was sent off for a second yellow card in the 76th minute for a tackle on Jahouh. Being a man down, they were unable to catch up with a well-coordinated Odisha FC unit, who walked back with three points in their bag. \n\nWith this defeat, East Bengal FC have now become the second team in ISL history to lose their first six matches of the season after NorthEast United FC in 2022-23, who had faced defeats in all of their opening 10 games.",

        "title": "Beyond Biryani, Hyderabad is a tech hub",
        "text": "Beyond Biryani: The Making of a Globalised Hyderabad, is not a book about other foods one can try in the city. It is a book where author Dinesh C Sharma attempts to break the stereotype about Hyderabad. In his book he portrays the city as a hub of science and technology. The non-fiction narrative delves into Hyderabad\u2019s journey from being a proto-colonial city under a quasi-Mughal princely state in the 1940s to a thriving, modern metropolis. \n\nDinesh is an award-winning journalist and author with over 30 years of experience in reporting on science, technology, innovation, medicine and environment-related issues for national and international media outlets. Though he has lived away from the city for the past 34 years, Hyderabad is his home as he was born and educated here. \n\nThis is Dinesh\u2019s fifth book, the idea of which germinated while penning his first book about Bengaluru. Dinesh says, \u201cIn my first book The Long Revolution (2009) on the tech craze, Hyderabad was not a significant chapter, it was a story in the passing. As someone who wrote about science, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Hyderabad beyond biryani and presenting its other lucrative and technological side. My book challenges stereotypes, and talks about Hyderabad\u2019s evolution from being a heritage city to a technological hub. The book aims to create a new perspective on Hyderabad, one that transcends the stereotypes of the Nizams and biryani and presents an alternative history. I see Hyderabad as a preferred destination for leading scientific and technological institutions and companies around the world.\u201d\n\nDinesh mentioned that he started working on the book in 2020 after he received the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund. Even though he had been collecting information and doing his research since his first book, he started working full-time on this one in 2020. \u201cFrom missiles and satellites to affordable HIV drugs and COVID-19 vaccines, Hyderabad delivers everything that today\u2019s India is known for. These successes are a result of a long journey of building key institutions over the decades. Despite all this, any mention of Hyderabad goes straight to discussions on biryani.\u201d\n\nAnother reason that prompted Dinesh to focus on the new avatar of Hyderabad is the exponential growth that one could witness and the reasons that made Bengaluru and Hyderabad develop a knowledge-based industry, and giant tech clusters, something that other cities with similar trajectories could not.\n\nHe adds, \u201cMy research was never-ending. Every time I visit, I chance upon something new; every month, there is something new coming up. In the process, I also discovered interesting facts and facets: how the Nizams laid the foundation for inculcating a scientific temper under British rule; how they set up India\u2019s first vernacular university in the city; and how a newly independent India pushed forward on the path of industrial laboratories as well as nuclear fuel and missiles. The book also looks at the last 30 years when Hyderabad has taken a giant leap towards becoming a modern preferred destination. An alternative history.\n\n Why did the author choose the title? \u201cNo one refuses biryani,\u201d he laughs.",

        "title": "Champions League: Vinicius treble fires title holders Real Madrid to Dortmund comeback",
        "text": "Madrid: Vinicius Junior scored a sublime hat-trick as Champions League holders Real Madrid came back from two goals down to hammer Borussia Dortmund 5-2 on Tuesday. After a shock stumble at Lille in their previous European match, Madrid crushed Dortmund, in a repeat of last season's final, with a superb second half display. Carlo Ancelotti's side claimed a record-extending 15th Champions League crown at Wembley and, as in that match, struggled in the first half against the Bundesliga side, who went two goals up through Donyell Malen and Jamie Gittens. However Antonio Rudiger and Vinicius pulled Madrid level with two goals in two minutes and Lucas Vazquez fired home the third after 83 minutes. Vinicius produced a brilliant solo goal for Madrid's fourth and slammed in the fifth as Los Blancos ended Dortmund's 100 percent start to the competition by producing another comeback to add to a vast collection in Europe. \"We know that when we are at home, with our fans, anything can happen,\" Vinicius told Movistar. \"We went in (at half-time) very quiet and just listened to the coach, we said just one thing. \"If we scored the first, we would come back once again, and we made another comeback, thanks to the fans and the whole team who gave everything.\" Madrid coach Ancelotti brought Rodrygo into the attack alongside Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius, reverting to a 4-3-3 formation after a brief experiment with three at the back in the narrow La Liga win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. After midfield maestro Toni Kroos' retirement and while trying to bed Mbappe into the team, Madrid have struggled to find balance and consistency this season. They were frustrated for the first half an hour of the game by the visitors, unable to create clear cut openings before the game burst open. Malen opened the scoring with a cool finish after Julian Brandt won the ball back on the edge of the area and Serhou Guirassy squeezed a pass through a tight gap to find the Dutch winger. Four minutes later Malen created the second, using his explosive pace to escape Ferland Mendy and crossing for Gittens to gleefully finish. Madrid responded by carving open Dortmund before the break but without finding a killer finish. Bellingham, without a goal in 10 games this season, headed straight at Gregor Kobel when he ran onto a scooped pass into the area. The England international, facing his former club, then struck the crossbar from close range on the rebound after team-mate Rodrygo had also hit the woodwork, with Madrid fans barely able to believe they had not scored. Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made a fine save to thwart Brandt before the break when the midfielder let fly from outside the area.'We'll fight for everything' The hosts turned the screw in the second half and Kobel saved well at the near post from Lucas Vazquez but could not keep out Rudiger's powerful header from Mbappe's cross after an hour. Two minutes later Madrid were level when Mbappe was tackled in the area but the ball fell invitingly for Vinicius to stroke home with ease. Dortmund coach Nuri Sahin, formerly a Madrid player, took off goalscorers Gitten and Malen but his team could not keep the insatiable hosts at bay. Madrid's comeback was completed by Vazquez after Rodrygo did well to keep the ball from going out of play, and Vinicius added shine with his fine fourth. The Brazilian, expected to claim a first Ballon d'Or on Monday in Paris, carried the ball forward without support and produced a lethal low finish. Vinicius then added a fifth by bursting into the area and rifling past Kobel, also issuing a warning to La Liga leaders Barcelona who visit the Bernabeu on Saturday in La Liga. \"We'll go for it, in our stadium, with our fans, and we will fight for everything this season like always,\" added Vinicius.",

        "title": "Champions League: Arsenal grind out win over Shakhtar",
        "text": "London: Arsenal bounced back from their embarrassment at Bournemouth as an own goal from Shakhtar Donetsk keeper Dmytro Riznyk gave the Gunners a 1-0 win in the Champions League on Tuesday. Mikel Arteta's side crashed to a damaging 2-0 defeat against the Cherries in the Premier League last weekend. That was Arsenal's first loss in all competitions since the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Bayern Munich in April. Their response against Shakhtar was unconvincing, but they did enough to claim three points thanks to Riznyk's first half own goal from Gabriel Martinelli's strike. Leandro Trossard missed a late Arsenal penalty that would have put a flattering gloss on the scoreline at the Emirates Stadium. Worryingly for Arteta, Riccardo Calafiori was forced off in the second half after appearing to injury his knee in the latest injury blow for a team currently missing Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Jurrien Timber. Arteta is already without suspended French defender William Saliba for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool. Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice admitted his side let their \"standards slip\" after Saliba's red card against Bournemouth set them on the way to their first Premier League defeat this season. Arteta had urged his players to use the \"pain\" of that setback as motivation against Shakhtar, but the response was tepid. The Gunners have seven points from their opening three Champions League games, yet this was a far cry from the impressive 2-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain in their previous tie. With one point from three games, Shakhtar remain without a goal in the Champions League this term. The Ukrainian champions spent 17 hours travelling to north London by bus, train and plane, setting off from Kiev on Friday and stopping in Lviv before reaching Poland for a flight to England. Unable to play home European fixtures in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, Marino Pushych's side competed gamely but lacked a cutting edge. Lethargic ArsenalArsenal midfielder Mikel Merino compared his side to an NBA basketball team after nine of the starting line-up at Bournemouth stood over 6ft tall. That imposing strength is key to Arsenal's set-piece prowess and they should have taken an early lead from Trossard's corner, only for Calafiori to shoot wastefully over from close-range. Shakhtar had managed just one shot on target in their first two Champions League games, but they threatened a shock opener when Eguinaldo's goal-bound shot was blocked by Gabriel Magalhaes. Arsenal were in control without ever looking dominant before their fortuitous opener in the 29th minute. Martinelli teased the Shakhtar defence with a menacing raid before cutting inside to unload a low drive that hit the post and rebounded into the net off the unlucky Riznyk's back. Kai Havertz came within a whisker of doubling Arsenal's lead when Mykola Matviyenko made an agile goal-line clearance as the German prepared to head in Gabriel Jesus's cross. Jesus had the captain's armband as Arteta tried to give him a confidence boost following 22 games without a goal. But Jesus was guilty of a poor finish, taking Havertz's pass and shooting too close to Riznyk from close-range. Arsenal right-back Ben White, fortunate to avoid a second booking late in the first half, was replaced at the interval, with Thomas Partey moving from midfield to fill in. Trossard headed wide from Martinelli's cross before Riznyk plunged to his right to keep out Martinelli's blast. Unusually subdued in attack, Arsenal squandered a golden opportunity in the closing stages when Valerii Bondar blocked Merino's cross with an out-stretched arm. Trossard took the penalty but his tame effort was easily saved by Riznyk, a miss that sparked a nervous finale for lethargic Arsenal. Pedrinho's powerful strike from 18 yards was pushed away by Arsenal keeper David Raya before Marlon Gomes' header was gratefully clutched by the Spaniard as the Gunners held on.Arsenal's Brazilian striker #09 Gabriel Jesus (L) shoots the ball but misses to score during the UEFA Champions League football match between Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk at the Emirates Stadium in north London on October 22, 2024.

        "text": "New Delhi: Sanju Samson recently opened up about his struggles during the Bangladesh T20I series, where he felt the pressure to perform and justify the faith shown in him by India\u2019s head coach, Gautam Gambhir. After disappointing performances in the first two T20Is, Samson admitted he found it hard to make eye contact with Gambhir, who had been consistently backing him. However, he turned things around in the third T20I, smashing 111 runs off just 47 balls, including 11 fours and eight sixes. Samson said, \u201cI didn\u2019t score big in the first two matches, and I was hesitant to make eye contact with Gambhir sir. But I kept telling myself 'apna time aayega' (my time will come). When I got that hundred in Hyderabad, and I saw him clapping, it was a great feeling.\u201d Samson highlighted the importance of the coach-player relationship, acknowledging that Gambhir's trust motivated him to perform. \"I desperately wanted to show Gauti bhai that if you are backing me, I won\u2019t disappoint you,\u201d he said. Reflecting on another missed opportunity, Samson shared his emotions after being left out of the playing XI for a World Cup final. Despite being ready to play, the team decided to go with the same XI. Samson recalled how captain Rohit Sharma took the time to explain the decision, even though he wasn\u2019t part of the final lineup. \u201cRohit came to me during the warm-up and explained why they chose the same team. I told him, let us win the match, then we can talk.\u201d Samson appreciated Rohit's approach, particularly how the captain spent time with a non-playing member before such a crucial game. \u201cHe gave me 10 minutes before the toss, explaining the decision. At that moment, I realised this person has a unique quality. He wasn't just thinking about the players who were in the XI; he took the time to explain to me why I wasn't playing. That gesture won my respect for a lifetime.\u201d Samson also expressed his regret about not playing in the final, saying it would be a moment he would carry with him, especially missing the chance to play under Rohit in such a crucial match.",

        "text": "It will be a trial by fire for skipper Harmanpreet Kaur as India begin preparations for next year's World Cup with the three-match ODI series against New Zealand starting on Thursday, having recently endured another failure at claiming an ICC title. The series will be vital for Kaur who has faced flak for her captaincy during the recently-held T20 World Cup in the UAE, where India failed to clear the group stage even though the skipper emerged as the team's highest scorer in the tournament.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");While India look to get their act right after the forgettable outing in the UAE, New Zealand will be on a high having lifted the T20 World Cup trophy with a clinical performance throughout the tournament, barring their group game against Australia.Kaur, 35, retained her place as captain despite questions about her leadership in recent times, and in the series against New Zealand, she will have to manage without the services of big-hitting wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh, who is due to appear in her 12th standard board exams.The skipper was criticised for her actions in the final over of the group match against Australia in UAE, with experts and fans questioning her decision to take a single on the first delivery of the last over, leaving it to Shreyanka Patil to hit two consecutive sixes.Experienced all-rounder Asha Sobhana will also miss out as she nurses an injury and was unavailable for selection, while seamer Pooja Vastrakar, who injured herself during the tournament in UAE, has been rested for this series.The squad comprises a few uncapped players as there were maiden call-ups for Tejal Hasabnis, Saima Thakor and Priya Mishra.There will be a lot of expectations from the opening duo of Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana with the duo only managing to succeed in patches in the T20 showpiece.It is important from India's point of view that the elegant Mandhana and the swashbuckling Shafali fire at the top of the order and set the tone.Like always, the onus will be on Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues to helm the middle-order but India will miss Ghosh's ability to hit fours and sixes at will.With Harmanpreet going through a rough patch as far as captaincy is concerned, her deputy Mandhana will be expected to help the skipper with her inputs.All three matches will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium.Teams (from): India Women: Harmanpreet Kaur (capt), Smriti Mandhana (vc), Shafali Verma, D Hemalatha, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Yastika Bhatia (wk), Uma Chetry (wk), Sayali Satgare, Arundhati Reddy, Renuka Singh Thakur, Tejal Hasabnis, Saima Thakor, Priya Mishra, Radha Yadav, Shreyanka Patil.New Zealand Women: Sophie Devine (capt), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Lauren Down, Izzy Gaze (wicketkeeper), Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Polly Inglis (wicketkeeper), Fran Jonas, Jess Kerr, Melie Kerr, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.Match starts at 1.30 pm IST.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "India vs NZ \u2013 Gautam Gambhir backs KL Rahul, but will he play in Pune?",
        "text": "India coach Gautam Gambhir has vehemently backed KL Rahul to come good amid mounting scrutiny on his recent form in Test cricket. After making a duck in India's 46 all out in the first innings of the Bengaluru Test, Rahul was dismissed for 12 in the second as India lost to New Zealand by eight wickets.\"You don't pick players on social media because of social media or for that matter even what the experts are saying,\" Gambhir said on while addressing Rahul's form on the eve of the second Test in Pune. \"What the team management thinks and what the leadership group thinks is very, very important. Ultimately, everyone is judged.\"International cricket is all about being judged, to be honest, because everyone's performance will be judged eventually. But I feel that he [Rahul] is batting really well. Obviously, he has had a decent knock in Kanpur [against Bangladesh] obviously, on a difficult wicket. And obviously, he played according to the plans as well. And I am sure, I think, he would also be knowing that he wants to score big runs and he has that capability of scoring runs. That's why he has been backed by the team management.\"While Rahul has built a strong body of work overseas - he has hundreds in South Africa, England and Australia - his average of 33.87 is the lowest among all specialist batters to have played at least 50 Tests for India.With Shubman Gill, who missed the first Test because of neck stiffness, set to bat at No. 3 in Pune, India will have to make a choice between Rahul and Sarfaraz Khan, who scored his maiden Test century in Bengaluru. Sarfaraz, who took a short break after the first Test because of the birth of his child, rejoined the India side and trained in Pune on Wednesday.While Sarfaraz might have the edge over Rahul after his 150 in Bengaluru, Gambhir did not reveal which way the team was leaning.India also have another choice to make between left-arm wristspinner Kuldeep Yadav and offspin allrounder Washington Sundar, who was added to squad after the defeat Bengaluru. Apart from boosting India's spin stocks on a dry, black-soil surface, Washington could add depth to the batting line-up. In his most recent red-ball game, in the second round of the Ranji Trophy, he made 152 at No.3 for Tamil Nadu against Delhi.\"We just felt that probably they [New Zealand] have four or five left-handers in the playing XI,\" Gambhir said of Washington's inclusion in the squad. \"That if we want to have another bowler who can take the ball away from the left-handers, it is always going to be useful for us. But we haven't still decided what is going to be the playing XI.\"We believe that probably there are two [left-hand] opening batters and Rachin [Ravindra] in the middle order. So, we feel that if Washy can give us more control in the middle, it is always going to be good for us.\"While managing the workload of the fast bowlers remains a priority for India's team management heading into a five-Test tour of Australia, Gambhir suggested it won't be done when the series is on the line against New Zealand in Pune and when crucial World Test Championship (WTC) points are at stake. For India to seal their place in the WTC final, irrespective of other results, they need at least four wins and one draw (52 points) in their remaining seven Tests, which will give them 65.79 percentage points.Gambhir, though, said the team was monitoring the workload of Jasprit Bumrah, who has played each of India's three Tests so far in this home season.\"Once the [New Zealand Test] series is over, we still have around 10 or 12 days before the Test starts in Australia,\" Gambhir said. \"So, that's enough break for our fast bowlers. But we will still monitor after the Test match where Jasprit Bumrah is. But it's not only about Jasprit Bumrah. It's about all the fast bowlers. We want to keep them fresh. We know that obviously we've got a long tour and an important tour of Australia.\"But workload management will definitely depend on what the outcome of this Test match is and how much have they bowled in this Test match.\"\r\n\r\nSource link",

Lee has high expectations from the young Indian pace sensation, particularly on the true and bouncy pitches in Australia.India, who are aiming to secure a spot in their third consecutive World Test Championship (WTC) final, will be traveling to Australia next month to defend the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, there are uncertainties surrounding the selection of experienced seamer Mohammed Shami for the five-match Test series.\"I can tell you that batters are okay when you bowl that 135-140 kmph speed, but when you bowl high 150s, I don't care who it is, no one wants to face that.\"He looks like someone who is a complete package, if Mohammed Shami is not ready, at least get him (Mayank) in the squad. I think he would do pretty well on these Australian wickets,\" Lee told Fox Cricket.Shami's last appearance was in the ODI World Cup final in November, and despite his recent intense training sessions the Indian captain Rohit Sharma is reluctant to include him in the squad for Australia if he is not fully prepared.Lee is well-versed in the challenges batsmen face when confronting high-speed deliveries.Lee said, \"The great thing is with me that I get to work on the IPL and see a lot of good young Indian cricketers. Mayank Yadav, to watch his first IPL game recently, hit 157 kmph first up in his first game.\"Unfortunately, his franchise probably brought him a little early and he did his side again.\"They put him in cotton wool for a bit. The great thing about India is that they are not worried about how much cricket someone has played or hasn't played, if he is ready to go, get him in there. I actually love that theory,\" Lee added.India possess a formidable bowling lineup capable of challenging Australian batsmen on their home turf. Lee recognized the potency of the Indian bowling unit.\"Ashwin is approaching 600 wickets, he has got that beautiful shape when he bowls spin. He can bowl with the new ball as well but I think if India have to win there, then Shami (provided he is fit) can definitely hold the key.\"Jasprit Bumrah, we all know how good he is, he can bowl both ways, he is a great exponent of reverse swing. Mohammed Siraj knows how to make the new ball talk.\"On wickets like Perth, Adelaide, for me it's the combination, these three fast bowlers with Ashwin as the spinner. Then they have got options with guys like who are part-time spinners. But you need to have those three quicks firing if India wants to win,\" Lee said.'India don't want to bow down'Lee described the Indian team as a \"powerhouse that refuses to bow down\" to any opponent, issuing a warning to his fellow Australians ahead of their clash with the Asian giants starting on November 22.His comments followed India's eight-wicket loss to New Zealand in the Bengaluru Test earlier this week.\"This day and age, India is a powerhouse that don't want to bow down. They know how to win, and they know they can beat Australia; they know they can beat the Kiwis. They know they can beat anyone on any given day,\" Lee said.Reflecting on India's performance in the Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, Lee suggested that they might have been influenced by the 'Bazball' approach, which led to some loose shot selection.\"India just didn't go into their shell. Maybe it's Bazball brushing off on other cricketers around the world,\" he noted.\"I know that India won't be proud of the way they played. They played some pretty loose shots.\"India's decision to bat first in overcast conditions raised concerns, as the team was dismissed for just 46 in the first innings of the opening Test - their lowest Test score at home.Lee remarked that the team needs to \"weigh up the risk factor\" and emphasized that the Indians should have assessed the conditions more carefully.\"But, you've got to weigh up the risk factor as well. There are times when you've got to go, 'Okay, well, maybe the big shots aren't working today'.\"Maybe, just rein it in a little bit. I don't think they sort of summed up the conditions as quickly as what they should have done,\" Lee said.India play two more Tests against New Zealand -- Pune (October 24-28) and Mumbai (November 1-5) -- before leaving for Australia.",
        "summary": "Brett Lee advocates for including Mayank Yadav in the Indian squad for the Australia tour if Mohammed Shami is unavailable. Lee highlights Yadav's impressive pace and the need for a strong bowling lineup to succeed on Australian pitches. He also reflects on India's tactics and recent performance against New Zealand.",

        "text": "Big pictureIndia have been here before. It hasn't happened all that often in the recent past, but they've been 1-0 down in a home Test series. It happened against Australia in 2017, and then against England in 2021. Both times, they came back to win the series.Both those series, however, were four Tests long. India's current generation have never really been in the situation they are in now against New Zealand: 1-0 down at home, with only two Tests to go.It puts them under immense pressure. Beating India in India remains the toughest challenge in Test cricket today, but away teams over the last two years have been winning Tests here more frequently than they used to. It's a sign, perhaps, of one era transitioning into another, a reminder of the cricketing mortality of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.This doesn't change the fact, however, that India remain overwhelming favourites when the second Test begins on Thursday. New Zealand won in Bengaluru, yes, but they won via the perfect storm brewed up by the weather and a deceptive pitch that led India to make what turned out to be the wrong toss and selection calls for those conditions. New Zealand were themselves poised to make the same toss call had Tom Latham called correctly.It isn't often that a visiting side shows up for a Test match in India and finds conditions that suit them more than the home side. Before Bengaluru 2024, it had perhaps happened twice in this century: Nagpur 2004 and Ahmedabad 2008.Pune will not be like Bengaluru. India have made every effort possible to restore to this series the one major ingredient it had lacked up to this point: home advantage. The specifics of how the Pune pitch will behave will only become clear when the match begins, but the broad outline is likely to be a lot less help for New Zealand's quicks, and a lot more room for India to maximise the superior skill and control of their spin attack. It won't guarantee the result they want, not against this superb New Zealand side, but whether they win, lose or draw, India will journey to their fate on something like their own terms.Form guideIndia LWWWW (last five Tests, most recent first)New Zealand WLLLLIn the spotlight - Shubman Gill and Glenn PhillipsShubman Gill has found a new level as a Test batter since his move to No. 3 last year, averaging 43.23 across 11 matches and scoring three hundreds (https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/1070173.html?class=1;spanmin1=12+jul+2023;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=innings). He got through a regular workload in the nets in the lead-up to the second Test, suggesting he will return to India's line-up after missing the Bengaluru Test with a stiff neck. With Gill back at No. 3, India's batting order will wear a far more settled look, with the names below his back in their natural habitats.Since his return to New Zealand's Test side in December 2023, Glenn Phillips has taken 23 wickets in nine Tests at an average of 26.47. Of all spinners with at least 15 wickets in this time, only Keshav Maharaj, Nathan Lyon and India's big three have better averages. It's quite a record for an offspinner who was until recently considered a part-timer. Phillips bowled 15 second-innings overs in Bengaluru and picked up the wicket of Virat Kohli. He may have to get through a bigger workload on a more helpful pitch in Pune, even if New Zealand bolster their spin attack, and could have quite an influence on the game if he can chip in with a big wicket or two. His ability to score quickly down the order could be handy too, handier still if it's a low-scoring Test.Shubman Gill is likely to make a comeback in the Pune Test\u2022AFP/Getty ImagesTeam news - Sarfaraz vs Rahul, Southee vs O'Rourke?India have two major decisions to make with regards to their XI. With Gill set to return, they will have to leave out either KL Rahul, who has fairly good returns across a small sample size - a century and two fifties in six Tests - since his middle-order move late last year, and Sarfaraz Khan, who scored a rollicking second-innings hundred in Bengaluru. There's also the question of the second seamer: should Akash Deep, who has looked like a natural in Indian conditions in his brief Test career so far, come in for Mohammed Siraj, whose 13 home Tests have brought him just the 19 wickets at 36.15? A dry pitch is expected to provide ample assistance to the spinners, so India will most likely stick to playing three of them. They have no major reason yet to look beyond the trio of Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav, even if Washington Sundar and Axar Patel make compelling cases as allrounders.India: 1 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 2 Rohit Sharma (capt), 3 Shubman Gill, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Rishabh Pant (wk), 6 KL Rahul/Sarfaraz Khan, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 R Ashwin, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Jasprit Bumrah, 11 Mohammed Siraj/Akash Deep.Despite being 1-0 up, New Zealand may have the more difficult selection to make than India, because it may involve a change in the make-up of their Bengaluru attack. Conditions in Pune are set to be far less conducive to swing and seam bowling, which means New Zealand may have to think of leaving out one of their three quicks - potentially Tim Southee, their ex-captain, or Will O'Rourke, who took seven wickets in Bengaluru - and bring in an extra spinner. This could either be the left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner or the legspinner Ish Sodhi, who has come into the squad with Michael Bracewell released on paternity leave.New Zealand 1 Tom Latham (capt), 2 Devon Conway, 3 Will Young, 4 Rachin Ravindra, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Tom Blundell (wk), 7 Glenn Phillips, 8 Mitchell Santner, 9 Tim Southee/Will O'Rourke, 10 Matt Henry, 11 Ajaz Patel.Pitch and conditionsAfter losing in entirely un-Indian conditions at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, India have gone to great lengths to prepare a track that theoretically minimises the damage New Zealand's quicks can cause. A slow, low turner is in the offing, and spinners can expect increasing help as the Test match progresses with sunny weather expected on all five days in Pune.Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli share a light chat\u2022AFP/Getty ImagesStats and trivia\n After losing just two home Tests in the ten years from 2013 to 2022, India have lost three in the next two years.\n KL Rahul is 19 runs away from the 3000 mark in Test cricket. Of all batters to have scored at least 3000 runs since his debut, only Mominul Haque and Kraigg Brathwaite have lower averages than Rahul's current figure of 33.87.\n Before 2023, Matt Henry had 53 wickets in 17 Tests at an average of 40.24. Since the start of 2023, he has transformed his Test career, taking 50 wickets in just nine Tests at 21.26.\nQuotes\"No, we are not even thinking of giving anyone game time. All we are concentrating on are these two Test matches [against New Zealand]. And these two Test matches are very, very important to us. As important as any other Test match, be it in India or in Australia.\"India head coach Gautam Gambhir when asked if India would pick Akash Deep in order to give him game time ahead of the Australia tour\"It's important that we take the focus, the confidence from that [Bengaluru] game, and bring it into this game, but realise that we both start on zero, both teams start on zero tomorrow.\"New Zealand captain Tom LathamKarthik Krishnaswamy is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "Sangareddy: Bird lovers and birding communities in the city have united to create the first of its kind Hyderabad City Bird Atlas (HBA).\r\n\r\nCoimbatore, Mysore and Pune cities already have such bird atlases while Kerala and Goa have a complete State bird atlas. With the move, the birding communities here aim to systematically document the bird species in and around Hyderabad to create the Hyderabad Bird Atlas. The survey will cover 11 per cent of the area inside the Outer Ring Road (ORR) documenting birds in various habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, natural open areas and urban landscapes. The places will be randomly selected for the survey.\r\n\r\nWhile Hyderabad Birding Pals (HBP) and Deccan Birders are leading the effort, many more organisations including the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) are expected to join the survey. The registration for voluntary enrolment of the participants started on Wednesday. It received an overwhelming response as the number crossed 100 on the first day. The members of the HBA project say the number of participants would be anywhere between 300 to 500. The survey needs to be done twice a year during winter in February and post-summer in July. The first survey of the HBA will be taken up in February 2025. The members have selected some 180 sub-cells (areas) for the survey.\r\n\r\nHowever, they say the State government should extend all the support to birdwatchers to carry out the exercise without any issues. The government should allow birdwatchers into public places, parks, reserve forests, universities, schools, colleges, office campuses, and residential campuses. A systematic survey for the next three to five years would help to create an authentic bird atlas for Hyderabad. HBA would act as a valuable tool for scientists, conservationists, and policymakers to understand bird populations, monitor changes over time, identify important bird areas and strategise conservation efforts, they said.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Telangana Today, a key member of HBA project, Sriram Reddy said the creation of the HBA would help to educate citizens on biodiversity besides encouraging bird watching. The birding atlas would also help in building the Hyderabad brand, he added.",

Pakistan have kept the same playing eleven from their second Test against England, which have defeated the Three Lions by 152 runs in Multan.PCB\u2019s announcement came a day after England announced their starting eleven for the third Test of the series. The Three Lions have made changes in their bowling attack as the visitors will be playing with a triple-spin attack.Under Shan Masood\u2019s stint as the skipper, this is the first time Pakistan will be fielding an unchanged playing eleven. Before the second Test of the series against England, PCB made a firm decision when they dropped Babar Azam from the playing eleven and Kamran Ghulam was handed his maiden Test cap and placed to fill the former skipper\u2019s position.Despite a tough time, Ghulam showed grit and resilience against a fierce English bowling line-up to keep Pakistan in the thick of the action. With an array of shots, he kept the opposition on their toes and smashed 118 off 124 deliveries in the second Test.While Ghulam\u2019s knock set the tone of the Test for Pakistan, it was Noman Ali and Sajid Khan who dictated the outcome with their spin prowess. The duo took all 20 wickets in the second Test, leaving England completely baffled in the process. While Sajid starred with his figures of 7/111 in the first innings, the plaudits belonged to Noman in the second innings for his splendid effort of 8/46.Pakistan will be eyeing to clinch their first series at home since February 2021, when they defeated South Africa.

        "text": "Jose Mourinho says struggling Manchester United \"will succeed sooner or later\" as the Fenerbahce boss prepares to take on his former club in the Europa League on Thursday. United manager Erik ten Hag is under pressure after a poor start to the season, which has included draws in their first two European matches -- against Twente and Porto. But Mourinho, who has also managed a string of other high-profile clubs including Chelsea, Real Madrid and Tottenham, said United had potential and he wants them to succeed. \"Maybe you English guys think I'm bluffing, think I am playing mind games,\" he said at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. \"I'm not playing anything -- they have a better team than the results are showing.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"I studied them the maximum I could with my staff and my analysts.

Hopefully sooner and hopefully before one day I go back to the Premier League and they become my opponents. \"At this moment they are just my opponents for one match.\"Mourinho, who managed United between 2016 and 2018, winning the League Cup and Europa League, was asked why his former club had struggled over the past decade.\"Honestly, I didn't lose one minute thinking about it,\" he said. \"I wish the best to Man Utd since the moment I left.\"I left with a good feeling for the club, with a good feeling for the fans and I want the best for them, so if things are not going amazingly well for them it's not something that makes me happy, but at the same time I have no time.\"The 61-year-old suggested that during his own reign at Old Trafford, the United hierarchy had not had the same patience they were showing towards Ten Hag.\"What happened for sure, because it's very objective, is that they kept faith with the coach, they support the coach, who is staying season after season and that means stability, means trust and they are giving him conditions to keep developing his job,\" he said.\"That was a difference in relation to me because as you know we won the Europa League, we finished second in the Premier League.\"Mourinho, who was named as the new Fenerbahce coach in June following his sacking by Roma, said United would be at \"maximum strength\" for the match in Istanbul.\"One thing are the results that Manchester United are having and another thing is the potential of the team,\" he said. \"The potential of the team is high.\"He added: \"If I have to say now which are the two biggest candidates to win the Europa League, I think it's easy -- Manchester United and Tottenham.\"The Premier League is a different level of quality, intensity, pace, tactical culture -- a different level of everything.\"Tomorrow, I think we are going to play against one of the two strongest teams.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

From tennis player Serena Williams to actors Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Anushka Sharma, Sanjana Sanghi, and Manushi Chhillar to model Emily Ratajkowski, celebrities are busy hand-building \u2014 thanks to its mindfulness benefits that are backed up by science. Celebrities are embracing this trend, constructing their own pottery studios in their opulent mansions and eloquently discussing the meditative act of throwing with their Instagram followers. They believe it\u2019s a perfect medium to convey one\u2019s imagination, encompassing sensual, textural, and cognitive activities.Manu Randhawa, a ceramic artist who works mainly in stoneware and has recently explored terracotta, is someone who swears by pottery. When she was in midlife, she felt a little lost. Manu tried many different things to alleviate that feeling. \u201cI was always a sports enthusiast, so I started running marathons! People complimented me on my writing skills, which led me to attempt writing for a collection of short stories. Finally, I ventured into the world of pottery. I never thought I had a creative bone in my body, but the first time I sat on the wheel, I knew I had found my peace,\u201d smiles Manu.Centring the clay came easily to her, and she slowly felt her soul calming peace. \u201cThe touch of the clay and the focus that it required to center the piece created a sort of calmness. She says, \"I slowly felt my anxiety fade away, and I became hooked for life.\"Her ceramics feature unique textures, along with a mix of colors and organic forms. \u201cClay has a therapeutic effect on the body, mind, and soul, and I am proof of that fact. No wonder it\u2019s become the hottest passion for all the lost souls of the world,\u201d she says.Artist Mudita Bhandari echos similar views. Being an artist whose medium is ceramics, she strongly feels pottery helps her be in sync with life. \u201cAny creative or organic process, whether it's gardening, dancing, or cooking, can be extremely de-stressing and healing, and yet when one is working with clay, it seems to somehow feel like you are directly communicating with your subconscious intuitive self,\u201d she says.Clay is one of the most basic natural materials which has its own process of maturing, it responds to all the weathers just like we humans do. \u201cIt will absorb the moisture from the air in rainy season and dry very slwoly and would dry really fast in the summers. Short cuts dont work with it.\u201d She says, clay has a character of its own and it responds beautifully when you work with it and not try to control it. \u201cWorking with clay and life has many parallels. Just like in life you try contolling something it never works but when you let go and work with it spontaniously, one encounters the most amazing experiences,\u201d informs Mudita.For her, everything about the process of working with clay resonates with a very basic and organic life lesson. \u201cThe material is direct in a very subtle way and tactile. Whatever you make, your hand impression of that moment in time is recorded along with your subcouncious feelings of that moment. It helps me go inwards peacefully away from the hustle bustle of this world,\u201d she adds.",

The preparations were revealed in an ICC meeting on Monday, during which the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, was also present. Sources told Geo News that during the meeting, the PCB officials assured the ICC board members that the upgradation of the three stadiums that will host the matches of the marquee event will be completed within the stipulated time.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Naqvi has also invited ICC board members to Pakistan to review the preparations made for the tournament. The Champions Trophy will begin next year in Pakistan, but there are certain challenges that need to be addressed.Uncertainty continues to loom over India going to Pakistan for the mega event. Since 2008's Asia Cup, India has not played any cricket tournaments in Pakistan due to tense relationships between both nations because of terrorism.A series played from December 2012 to January 2013 in India marked the final bilateral series between the two nations. Since then, both nations have only clashed at ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. On the other hand, Pakistan travelled to India on three occasions since the 2008 Asia Cup.Recently, reports started to surface about the International Cricket Council (ICC) looking at three options regarding hosting the Champions Trophy.According to sources, ICC is either looking to have the tournament go ahead in Pakistan as planned or take place in both Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a part of the hybrid model.As per this hybrid model, matches for India and knockout stage games will take place in Dubai. The third option is the entire tournament, taking place outside Pakistan, with Dubai, Sri Lanka or South Africa as possible hosts.Pakistan have not hosted any major International Cricket Council (ICC) event since the 1996 ODI World Cup, which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The Catalans had lost their last six games against Bayern but outplayed the six-time winners at the Olympic Stadium with Robert Lewandowski also on the scoresheet, while England star Harry Kane struck for the visitors. Hansi Flick, who was in charge of the Bundesliga side in a humiliating 8-2 romp over Barca in 2020, led the Catalans to an emphatic triumph which indicated they may be capable of winning the trophy for the first time since 2015 after a decade of disappointment.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Defeat leaves Bayern with only one victory from their opening three group games and in the bottom half of the table, while Barcelona have two wins and are in the top third.\"In my opinion this game could have been a (Champions League) final, to be able to win it in this way, so well, in front of our fans, is quite special and I leave here happy,\" Raphinha told Movistar.\"Getting the second victory in the Champions League was important and now we have to think about the game on Saturday.\"Barcelona visit European and Spanish champions Real Madrid in a La Liga Clasico this weekend and warmed up for it in spectacular style.\"If you win this type of game you have to celebrate it, and for the team it's incredible,\" said Flick.\"It gives us confidence to believe in ourselves ahead of Saturday.\"Barcelona had not scored in their last four matches against Bayern but were ahead inside one minute, with Fermin Lopez playing Raphinha in behind the visitors' high line.The Brazilian winger, on his 100th appearance for the club since joining from Leeds, and proudly sporting the captain's armband, stayed cool to dribble around Manuel Neuer and roll home.Bayern poured forward in response and after having a goal ruled out for a tight offside, Kane struck in the 18th minute to level.The striker finished acrobatically from Serge Gnabry's inviting cross with Barcelona's defence all at sea.Relentless RaphinhaBarcelona recovered their composure and began to threaten, with former Bayern striker Lewandowski firing wide and Lamine Yamal sliding in to tackle Neuer but seeing the ball roll beyond the post.Joshua Kimmich was booked for taking out Lopez, who was charging into space in Bayern territory.The Barcelona midfielder, a ball of energy, created his team's second for Lewandowski. Lopez left Kim Min-jae for dead with a clever nudge, which Bayern complained about to no avail, before knocking the ball across for Lewandowski to turn home.The veteran Polish striker, 36, has been the chief beneficiary of Flick's arrival after struggling last season and now has 15 goals in 13 appearances.The unstoppable Raphinha rattled home a superb third before the interval, driving into the area after Marc Casado spread the play out to the left flank and arcing a shot through Dayot Upamecano's legs and beyond the reach of Neuer at full stretch.Raphinha completed his hat-trick 10 minutes into the second half, controlling Yamal's ambitious pass brilliantly on his chest while on the sprint, before planting a rasping effort into the bottom right corner from the edge of the box.Bayern coach Vincent Kompany reacted with a quadruple substitution, bringing on four household names in Jamal Musiala, Kingsley Coman, Leroy Sane and Leon Goretzka.At 4-1 up Barcelona's fans began to cheer their team's passes as Bayern chased the ball.\"For the fans, I think it was revenge,\" said Raphinha, looking back at Barca's defeats by Bayern.\"As a fan I suffered through those games too.\"The winger was thrown up in the air by his team-mates at full-time, clutching his match ball.Having not reached the Champions League semi-finals since 2019, belief is starting to grow in Catalonia that Flick could help restore their position among Europe's elite.Bayern, semi-finalists last season, were left licking their wounds.\"The whole team gave 100 percent. So there's no question about effort, but 100 percent was not enough today,\" admitted Kompany.\"(In the first half) it felt like we could edge this game, that it could turn for us.\"But in key moments we got outdone and for that reason the result is fairly heavy.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "A 27th minute tap-in from Darwin Nunez took Liverpool to a controlled 1-0 win at RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday, continuing their excellent start under new coach Arne Slot. Liverpool broke through some early Leipzig pressure just before the half-hour mark when Mohamed Salah hit a perfect header across his body. Nunez sprang forward to prod home the goal-bound ball, grabbing his first Champions League goal since February 2023. Despite a late Leipzig flurry, Liverpool again showed the control and resilience that has taken them to the top of the Premier League table just days out from Sunday's clash at Arsenal. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"We're really happy for the win. We played a difficult away game. We controlled the game in large parts apart from the last few minutes,\" said Slot. \"I asked for a goal. He (Darwin) gave us one but in the lead-up to the goal, Cody Gakpo was important and Mo Salah with an assist. It was a team goal. It's pleasing to see that Darwin did a really good job today.\"Slot has won 11 of his first 12 games in charge in all competitions, the best start of any manager in Liverpool history, while Leipzig are now zero from three in Europe this season.\"With a bit of luck, maybe we could have taken a point,\" Leipzig goalie Peter Gulacsi said, adding: \"In the Champions League, we've had no luck at all.\"Both sides had impressed domestically this season on the back of strong defensive records, with Liverpool conceding three in eight Premier League games and Leipzig just two in seven. Slot made three changes to the side which beat Chelsea 2-1 at home on Sunday, benching Andy Robertson and Curtis Jones for Kostas Tsimikas and Alexis Mac Allister, while Nunez replaced Diogo Jota. Leipzig coach Marco Rose's starting XI made his intentions clear, the coach going for the all-out attack of Lois Openda, Xavi Simons, Benjamin Sesko and Antonio Nusa. Rose's set-up worked early, with Leipzig pressing Liverpool hard and hitting them on the counter. Sesko went close after 19 minutes, pouncing after Caoimhin Kelleher surged out of his box and failed to clear, but the big Slovenian's long-range effort curled just wide of the post. Openda scored from well outside the box on the 26-minute mark but the Belgian's stunner was ruled out for offside.Liverpool made Leipzig pay immediately, Nunez tapping in a goal-bound Salah header, just his second strike in nine appearances this season. Nunez went inches from doubling up shortly after but his point-blank header was well saved by Gulacsi. With one eye on Sunday's match at Arsenal, Liverpool tried to take the sting out of the game in the second half, controlling the match and keeping Leipzig at bay. Salah was upset to be subbed with half an hour remaining, but by then Slot clearly had Arsenal in mind.The home side rallied late, Openda again having a goal struck off for a clear offside, but Liverpool held on to make it three from three in the Champions League.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Erling Haaland's spectacular acrobatic effort lit up Manchester City's 5-0 win over Sparta Prague on Wednesday to move into third place in the Champions League table. The Norwegian scored twice, including a backheel at shoulder height, as City ran riot against the Czech champions. Phil Foden, John Stones and Matheus Nunes were also on target for Pep Guardiola's men, who remain unbeaten in all competitions this season.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"He's a freak isn't he,\" said Foden of Haaland's athleticism.\"If I tried to do that I'd pull my groin. I don't know how he did it, I just think it's just his long legs.\"Sparta had taken four points from their opening two Champions League games against Salzburg and Stuttgart, but City were a step up in class too far for the visitors.\"It became painful in the second half after it went to 2-0. It became very difficult and we had difficulty coping with it,\" said Sparta coach Lars Friis.Foden's struggle for form and fitness has compounded City's injury problems with Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne sidelined.But there were encouraging signs for Guardiola as, restored to the starting line-up, the England international drilled home the opening goal after just three minutes.Haaland had nine efforts on goal in total but was frustrated in the first half as Sparta refused to let the floodgates open before the break.Peter Vindahl produced a stunning save low to his right to parry a powerful downward header from Haaland on 10 minutes.Vindahl also denied Foden, while Haaland had another towering header hacked off the line.Haaland did finally deliver City's second with an effort reminiscent of his strike against old club Borussia Dortmund two years ago that won Champions League goal of the season.\"It was an amazing goal. I was speechless after he shot,\" said Nunes.\"When he scored against Dortmund I was watching on TV and to see this live was amazing.\"Savinho's chipped cross was slightly behind the 24-year-old, who contorted his body to strike the ball martial arts style and fire it past Vindahl.Stones nodded in a vital stoppage time winner against Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday and continued his hot streak in front of goal with a looping header from Nunes' cross.\"When Erling is not available, John can play as a striker,\" joked Guardiola.Haaland then completed a three-goal blitz in 10 minutes at the end of a scintillating City counter-attack.Slick passes from Rico Lewis, Foden and Nunes teed up Haaland to slot home his 44th Champions League goal in just 42 appearances in the competition.Guardiola could afford the luxury of replacing his star number nine, along with Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva in the closing stages with City in the midst of a run of seven games in 21 days.However, that robbed Haaland of the chance to complete his third hat-trick of the season when Nunes was felled inside the box.The Portugal international stepped up himself to blast in his second City goal and round off the scoring.City are now unbeaten from open play in 26 Champions League matches, setting the longest unbeaten streak by any club.Victory takes Guardiola's men onto seven points from their opening three Champions League games, behind only Premier League rivals Liverpool and Aston Villa.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' CNN town hall",
        "text": "With less than two weeks until the election, Vice President Kamala Harris held a town hall in Pennsylvania\u2014a crucial battleground state\u2014while her rival, Donald Trump, addressed a rally in Georgia. During the CNN event, Harris tackled a wide range of pressing topics, from immigration and the economy to the contentious issues of abortion and US foreign policy.Throughout the town hall, Harris maintained her jovial demeanor while clarifying her positions and distinguishing her policy priorities from those of President Biden, suggesting a new approach if she were to assume the presidency. The border issue, which has been a persistent challenge for her, once again took center stage. When pressed on whether she would continue building the wall along the Mexico border, she wants \"strengthen our border\" but did not provide further clarification.During the town hall, Harris also called Trump a \"fascist\" and a threat to America's democracy.\u2014 KamalaHarris (@KamalaHarris) CNN anchor Jake Tapper noted that Harris tended to sidestep direct questions, focusing instead on critiquing Trump. \u201cShe concentrated much more on Donald Trump than on the specifics of her own plans,\u201d he observed. Additionally, Dana Bash remarked that Harris\u2019s performance did not quite \u201cclose the deal\u201d with undecided voters.5 key takeaways from Kamala's CNN TownhallStrengthening border securityWhen asked about her stance on former President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, Harris was critical of the previous administration's efforts. \u201cRemember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. They didn\u2019t,\u201d she remarked with a laugh. Despite her critique, Harris defended her support for a bipartisan bill that allocates $650 million for border security, including physical barriers. She emphasised that her focus is on practicality rather than ideology: \"We need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes. Let\u2019s just fix this thing.\" Although Harris has shifted her view on the wall, she clarified that her objective is to \u201cstrengthen our border,\u201d distancing herself from Trump\u2019s approach while acknowledging the need for compromise to address the broken immigration system.Tackling rising grocery prices and the economyOn the economy, Harris was asked about soaring grocery prices, a concern many Americans feel deeply. She agreed that prices remain too high and highlighted her background in fighting corporate price gouging as a potential solution. \u201cPart of my plan is to create a national ban on price gouging,\u201d she said, explaining that companies exploiting consumers would face new consequences. Harris also addressed the housing crisis, advocating for collaboration with the private sector to cut red tape and increase affordable housing options. In her response, Harris criticised both parties for not doing enough to tackle housing affordability but stressed that her administration would take a \"new approach\" focused on tax incentives for home builders and ensuring accountability for corporate monopolies in the housing market.\u2014 CalltoActivism (@CalltoActivism) Defending abortion rights Harris firmly reiterated her pro-choice stance, criticising the Trump-era Supreme Court appointments that led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade. \u201cWhen Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended,\u201d Harris stated. She described the ripple effects of the decision, highlighting how some states have introduced draconian abortion bans with no exceptions for rape or incest. Harris also mentioned conversations with pro-life individuals who were shocked by the unintended consequences of these laws, including women dying from lack of access to essential reproductive care. \"Women have died because of these laws,\" she added, making a passionate plea for bipartisan action on the issue of reproductive rights.Distancing herself from Biden administrationPerhaps one of the most striking moments of the town hall was when Harris made it clear that her administration would not simply be a continuation of Biden\u2019s policies. When asked how she would differentiate herself from the current administration, she responded, \u201cI bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. I represent a new generation of leadership.\u201d Harris highlighted issues like housing, health care, and support for small businesses, noting that her approach would focus on practical solutions rooted in her personal experiences.While acknowledging that much had been accomplished under Biden, Harris was also clear that \"there\u2019s more to do\" and that her leadership would bring a fresh perspective to ongoing challenges.Conflict in IsraelAddressing a question on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Harris called the situation \u201cunconscionable,\u201d particularly the loss of innocent Palestinian lives. She expressed hope that with the death of Hamas leader Sinmar, there was a chance to bring an end to the war and secure a two-state solution. Harris advocated for peace efforts that ensure both Israel\u2019s security and Palestinian dignity, saying, \u201cWe are now at a place where... I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, and work toward a two-state solution.\u201dHarris acknowledged the strong emotions tied to this issue, but urged voters to consider the bigger picture, including the importance of democracy, practical governance, and personal freedoms.",

        "text": "The timing couldn\u2019t have been more coincidental. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first bilateral meeting in five years on Wednesday, where they underscored that a \u201cstable, predictable and amicable\u201d bilateral relationship between New Delhi and Beijing is important \u2014 a refreshing break since the Galwan days. On the other hand, a Lutyens Star in Modi 1.0, who held two crucial portfolios separately \u2014 Information and Broadcasting as well as Sports \u2014 is now back in Rajasthan as a Cabinet Minister of some meaty portfolios like commerce, where his long-term goal is rather ambitious \u2014 match the economic might of China. Col Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore would smile and ask News18, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cChina is already out there. But today we talk about China plus one. Who will be that one? My goal, our goal is to make Rajasthan that entity matching China. Rajasthan is no less than a country and has the expertise, human resources and wherewithal to beat Vietnam, Bangladesh or other similar countries. That is my limited point,\u201d Rathore told News18. One thing he is very clear about is that Rajasthan is not competing with other states.\nBut what about specifics? Right now, Rajasthan economy\u2019s size is a little above Rs 15 lakh crore. Rathore wants to double it to Rs 30 lakh crore, which eventually needs a hunger to match the scale of China.\nThe upcoming Rising Rajasthan has been packaged and marketed much like Vibrant Gujarat but on a much smaller scale. But the discipline is intriguing. Not only has a young Chief Minister toyed with the idea in his very first year of governance, but there has been a well-orchestrated global outreach before the main event in December this year.\n\u201cWhat sets Rising Rajasthan apart is the thrust on communication. We have deputed 23 IAS officers for 23 countries for the next 5 years as points of contact for ease of doing business. We have deputed one RAS (Rajasthan Administrative Service) officer each for every state of India as a communication officer for business investment purposes,\u201d he said.\nDuring the three-day event, one day will be dedicated for non-resident Rajasthanis. The Rajasthan government has already created 21 investment policies, such as a textile park or land aggregation policy.\nA state that was so used to the \u2018revdi\u2019 culture of free mobiles, free ration kits, free electricity and the Chiranjeevi scheme, is now getting used to a new way of expenditure. In her budget this year, Rajasthan Finance Minister Diya Kumari, committed to making the state a $350 billion economy as part of the action plan for \u2018Developed Rajasthan @ 2047\u2019, which comprises 10 resolutions. The commitments included investment promotion.\nChina or no China, how does life away from Lutyens Delhi feel like? When asked if he missed Delhi, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore broke into laughter before carefully choosing his words, \u201cIt was a privilege for me to spend 10 years in Delhi. I would often interact with friends in the media there who I would find intellectually stimulating, which I miss. But coming to the state has been a great deal of administrative and political education for me.\u201d",

        "text": "Microsoft Corp.'s female, Black and Latinx employees are leaving at an increasing rate, a trend that's complicating the company's efforts to build a more diverse workforce.Globally, women accounted for 32.7% of departures for the fiscal year that ended June 30, up from 31% in 2023, according to Microsoft's diversity and inclusion report, which was released Wednesday and measures voluntary and involuntary departures. Black workers accounted for 10% of US exits, compared with 8.7% the previous year, while Latinx departures rose to 9.8% from 8%. By contrast, fewer male and Asian employees left last year than in 2023. The software giant attributed the trends to poaching by rivals, as well as a continued shift away from its physical and online retail business, which has typically had a more diverse workforce.Microsoft continues to hire people from more unrepresented groups but must work harder to retain them, Microsoft Chief Diversity Officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre said in an interview. \"Once that talent arrives at Microsoft we know that we've got to do more,\" she said. That includes providing mentors and career options \"that give them an ongoing reason to invest and stay at Microsoft.\" (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");An increasing number of jobs in cloud-computing data centers, which are widely distributed geographically is giving Microsoft opportunities to boost diversity in hiring, she said. Diversity is increasingly important for Microsoft, which is keen to ensure that its new artificial intelligence products are free from racial, gender and other biases. \"It's going to take lots of perspectives to birth a trusted AI that everybody wants to engage with,\" McIntyre said. Few companies disclose retention statistics along racial and gender lines. Last year BlackRock Inc. released the results of an audit by former US Attorney General Eric Holder that showed Black and Latinx leaders were departing so quickly it was nearly offsetting the Wall Street firm's efforts to diversify its ranks.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "UEFA Champions League: Raphinha hat-trick helps Barcelona thrash Bayern Munich 4-1",
        "text": "Barcelona: Raphinha scored a stunning hat-trick as Barcelona hammered Bayern Munich 4-1 on Wednesday in a riveting Champions League clash. The Catalans had lost their last six games against Bayern but outplayed the six-time winners at the Olympic stadium with Robert Lewandowski also on the scoresheet, while England star Harry Kane struck for the visitors. Hansi Flick, who was in charge of the Bundesliga side in a humiliating 8-2 romp over Barca in 2020, led the Catalans to an emphatic triumph which indicated they may be capable of winning the trophy for the first time since 2015 after a decade of disappointment. Defeat leaves Bayern with only one victory from their opening three group games and in the bottom half of the table, while Barcelona have two wins and are in the top third. Hansi Flick brought Spanish midfielder Fermin Lopez in for his first start of the season after injury, while his Bayern counterpart Vincent Kompany opted for Serge Gnabry in place of Jamal Musiala, who was only fit enough for the bench. Barcelona had not scored in their last four matches against Bayern but were ahead inside one minute, with Lopez playing Raphinha in behind the visitors' high line. The Brazilian winger, on his 100th appearance for the club since joining from Leeds, and proudly sporting the captain's armband, stayed cool to dribble around Manuel Neuer and roll home. Former Tottenham striker Kane had a similar chance to equalise at the other end but took a heavy touch and Inaki Pena raced out of his goal quickly to deny him. The Englishman, who ended a four-game drought with a hat-trick against Stuttgart on Saturday, beat Pena with a header moments later but was ruled marginally offside. Bayern kept pouring forward and Kane found the net once more after 18 minutes, and this time it counted. The striker finished acrobatically from Gnabry's inviting cross with Barcelona's defence all at sea, like Bayern playing high and inviting the Germans to break in behind. Relentless Raphinha Barcelona recovered their composure and began to threaten, with former Bayern striker Lewandowski firing wide and Lamine Yamal sliding in to tackle Neuer but seeing the ball roll beyond the post. Joshua Kimmich was booked for taking out Lopez, who was charging into space in Bayern territory. The Barcelona midfielder, a ball of energy, created his team's second for Lewandowski. Lopez left Kim Min-jae for dead with a clever nudge, which Bayern complained about to no avail, before knocking the ball across for Lewandowski to turn home. The veteran Polish striker, 36, has been the chief beneficiary of Flick's arrival after struggling last season and now has 15 goals in 13 appearances. The unstoppable Raphinha rattled home a superb third before the interval, driving into the area after Marc Casado spread the play out to the left flank and arcing a shot through Dayot Upamecano's legs and beyond the reach of Neuer at full stretch. Raphinha completed his hat-trick 10 minutes into the second half, controlling Yamal's ambitious pass brilliantly on his chest while on the sprint, before planting a rasping effort into the bottom right corner from the edge of the box. Kompany reacted with a quadruple substitution, bringing on four household names in Musiala, Kingsley Coman, Leroy Sane and Leon Goretzka. At 4-1 up Barcelona's fans began to cheer their team's passes as Bayern chased the ball, the style of the victory continuing the team's potential redemption arc after nearly 10 years of hurt in the competition. Having not reached the Champions League semi-final since 2019, belief is starting to grow in Catalonia that Flick could help restore their position among Europe's elite. Another test of that theory soon follows -- Barcelona's next match is a visit to face reigning Spanish and European champions Real Madrid in a tantalising La Liga Clasico on Saturday. Brazilian winger Vinicius Junior netted a treble for Madrid on Tuesday against Dortmund but his compatriot Raphinha matched him in style against Bayern as Barca sent a message of their own.",

        "title": "UEFA Champions League: Haaland scores outrageous goal for Manchester City",
        "text": "Manchester: Erling Haaland scored an outrageous backheel volley in the Champions League on Wednesday to issue a timely reminder of his own credentials as a potential Ballon d'Or winner. A day after Vinicius Junior hit a hat trick for Real Madrid , Haaland scored an early contender for goal of the season with his acrobatic effort in Manchester City's 5-0 win against Sparta Prague. Vinicius Junior is the favorite to win soccer's most prestigious individual prize when it is presented at a gala ceremony in Paris on Monday. But Haaland, who came runner-up to Lionel Messi for last year's award, once again showcased his scoring prowess with two goals as City set a new Champions League record of 26 games unbeaten. Haaland's volley in the 58th minute at the Etihad Stadium was a moment of individual brilliance. From around six meters and with his back to goal, the Norway striker leaped in the air and flicked the back of his foot to meet Savinho's cross from the right. Connecting powerfully with his heel, the ball shot down into the turf and bounced high into the top corner beyond Prague goalkeeper Peter Vindahl. \u201cIf I tried to do that I\u2019d pull my groin. I don\u2019t know how he did it, I just think it\u2019s just his long legs. He\u2019s a freak isn\u2019t he?\u201d Haaland's City teammate Phil Foden said. City manager Pep Guardiola said the goal was not normal \u201cfor a human\u201d and likened the forward to Sweden great Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable this talent that this guy has and of course he made a fantastic goal,\u201d he said. Haaland scored his second in the 68th to take his season's total to 13 goals in 12 games in all competitions. His record in the Champions League is now 44 goals in 42 games. Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer in European club soccer's elite competition with 141 goals. Messi is second on 129. Haaland is 17th and rising quickly. But he is expected to miss out on this year's Ballon d'Or with Vinicius Junior as the man to beat, ahead of Haaland's City teammate Rodri. Haaland, however, is likely to contend for years to come if he continues his goal scoring exploits, with Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe leading a new generation after Messi and Ronaldo dominated the award for more than a decade. Neither of those soccer greats, who won 13 titles between them, were nominated this year, appearing to usher in a new era.",

        "title": "Champions League: Liverpool sink Leipzig to continue strong start under Slot",
        "text": "Leipzig: A 27th minute tap-in from Darwin Nunez took Liverpool to a controlled 1-0 win at RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday, continuing their excellent start under new coach Arne Slot. Liverpool broke through some early Leipzig pressure just before the half-hour mark when Mohamed Salah hit a perfect header across his body. Nunez sprang forward to prod home the goal-bound ball, grabbing his first Champions League goal since February 2023. Despite a late Leipzig flurry, Liverpool again showed the control and resilience that has taken them to the top of the Premier League table just days out from Sunday's clash at Arsenal. \"We're really happy for the win. We played a difficult away game. We controlled the game in large parts apart from the last few minutes,\" said Slot. \"I asked for a goal. He (Darwin) gave us one but in the lead-up to the goal, Cody Gakpo was important and Mo Salah with an assist. It was a team goal. It's pleasing to see that Darwin did a really good job today.\" Slot has won 11 of his first 12 games in charge in all competitions, the best start of any manager in Liverpool history, while Leipzig are now zero from three in Europe this season. \"With a bit of luck, maybe we could have taken a point,\" Leipzig goalie Peter Gulacsi said, adding: \"In the Champions League, we've had no luck at all.\" Both sides had impressed domestically this season on the back of strong defensive records, with Liverpool conceding three in eight Premier League games and Leipzig just two in seven. Slot made three changes to the side which beat Chelsea 2-1 at home on Sunday, benching Andy Robertson and Curtis Jones for Kostas Tsimikas and Alexis Mac Allister, while Nunez replaced Diogo Jota. Leipzig coach Marco Rose's starting XI made his intentions clear, the coach going for the all-out attack of Lois Openda, Xavi Simons, Benjamin Sesko and Antonio Nusa. Rose's set-up worked early, with Leipzig pressing Liverpool hard and hitting them on the counter. Sesko went close after 19 minutes, pouncing after Caoimhin Kelleher surged out of his box and failed to clear, but the big Slovenian's long-range effort curled just wide of the post. Openda scored from well outside the box on the 26-minute mark but the Belgian's stunner was ruled out for offside. Liverpool made Leipzig pay immediately, Nunez tapping in a goal-bound Salah header, just his second strike in nine appearances this season. Nunez went inches from doubling up shortly after but his point-blank header was well saved by Gulacsi. With one eye on Sunday's match at Arsenal, Liverpool tried to take the sting out of the game in the second half, controlling the match and keeping Leipzig at bay. Salah was upset to be subbed with half an hour remaining, but by then Slot clearly had Arsenal in mind. The home side rallied late, Openda again having a goal struck off for a clear offside, but Liverpool held on to make it three from three in the Champions League.",

        "text": "Indian spin veteran Ravichandran Ashwin overtook Australian legend Nathan Lyon to become the leading wicket-taker in the history of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC). Ashwin accomplished this feat during the second Test against New Zealand at Pune\u2019s Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) stadium.During the game in the first innings, Ashwin has so far taken three wickets for 48 runs in 19 overs at an economy rate of 2.50.Now in 39 matches since the tournament started taking place in a league format in 2019, Ashwin has picked up a massive 189 wickets at an average of 20.71, with best figures of 7/71. He has taken nine four-wicket hauls and 11 five-wicket hauls in the competition. In 2019-21 and 2021-23 cycles, Ashwin ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 71 wickets in 14 matches and the fourth-highest wicket-taker with 61 scalps in 13 matches (with Lyon being at the top with 88 wickets in 20 matches) respectively. In the ongoing 2023-25 cycle of the competition, Ashwin is a chart-topper yet again currently, with 57 scalps in 12 matches. Lyon on the other hand has taken 187 wickets in 43 wickets at an average of 26.70, with best figures of 8/64. He has taken 11 four-wicket hauls and 10 five-wicket hauls in the championship\u2019s history. Ashwin also overtook Lyon (530 wickets in 129 matches) in the all-time Test cricket list to become the format\u2019s seventh-highest wicket-taker, with 531 scalps in 104 matches at an average of 23.75, with best figures of 7/59. He has taken 25 four-wicket hauls and 37 five-wicket hauls in his career. During the highly-anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy starting in Australia on November 22 at Perth, these two legends will duel for spin bowling supremacy, most likely for the last time on Australian soil. Coming to the match, half-centuries from Devon Conway (76 in 141 balls, with 11 fours) and Rachin Ravindra (65 in 105 balls, with five fours and a six), took NZ to 201/5 at the end of the second session. Ashwin has so far taken three wickets while Washington Sundar has two. New Zealand skipper Tom Latham won the toss and elected to bat first in the second Test of the three-match series against India on Thursday. Pacer Matt Henry misses action due to a niggle with spinner Mitchell Santner coming to the playing eleven. For India, pacer Mohammed Siraj, batter KL Rahul and spinner Kuldeep Yadav sat out. Shubman Gill returns to the playing eleven after missing the first Test due to neck stiffness. Akash Deep took Siraj\u2019s place while Washington Sundar took Kuldeep\u2019s spot for his first Test appearance since March 2021.This game is a must-win for Team India, as they are 1-0 down in the series. The Rohit Sharma-led team will have to win this game to keep their 12-year-long home supremacy alive and solidify their chances of making a hat-trick of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) finals as a tougher Australian challenge awaits them.India (Playing XI): Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Sarfaraz Khan, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Akash Deep, Jasprit BumrahNew Zealand (Playing XI): Tom Latham(c), Devon Conway, Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell(w), Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ajaz Patel, William ORourke.

        "text": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the Women's T20 World Cup 2024 Team of the Tournament on Monday and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur is the only player from India who was included in the side. In an otherwise disappointing campaign for India, skipper Harmanpreet was the standout performer for the Women in Blue. She finished as India's top scorer and the fourth-highest overall in the tournament, amassing 150 runs in four innings.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");With two fifties to her name, she boasted an incredible average of 150. Her strike rate of 133.92 was the fifth-best in the tournament. Kaur's quickfire 52 off 27 balls against Sri Lanka was crucial in keeping India's hopes alive for a semifinal spot.South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt was a solid presence for her side at the top. Wolvaardt passed 30 in all but one of her games, with four scores of over 40. While her highest score came in South Africa's first game, it was her resilient 42 in the semi-final that set up a strong base during her team's successful chase against Australia.In pursuit of 135, Wolvaardt helped put her team ahead of the game, scoring at a brisk pace with three fours and a six to her name, allowing Anneke Bosch to settle in and launch a stupendous counter-attack.South Africa's opener formed a strong partnership with captain Laura Wolvaardt at the top of the order, driving the team to the final. Brits amassed 187 runs in six innings, with an impressive average of 37.40, making her the second-highest run-scorer, just behind Wolvaardt. She surpassed 40 runs in three innings, including a match-winning unbeaten 57 in South Africa's opening fixture against the West Indies.Danni Wyatt-Hodge was a firecracker at the top of the order for the England side, notching up the most runs for them at the World Cup. The right-hand batter notched up scores of 40+ in each of England's first three games.Wyatt-Hodge started off her tournament with a brisk 41 against Bangladesh, following it up with a crucial run-a-ball 43 to get past eventual runners-up South Africa. Her best performance was against Scotland in their penultimate game, where she slammed an unbeaten 26-ball 51, to guide England to a 10-wicket win in a record partnership alongside Maia Bouchier.The Player of the Final and the Player of the Tournament, Melie Kerr starred in New Zealand's title-winning campaign. She contributed both with the bat and ball, scoring 135 runs in six innings, with her high score of 43 coming crucially in the final. She took 15 wickets in the competition, becoming the tournament's leading wicket-taker.Her impressive 3 for 24 in the final, including the crucial wickets of Wolvaardt and Bosch, was pivotal in New Zealand's victory, securing their second ICC tournament title.Deandra Dottin shone for the West Indies on her return to international cricket, scoring 120 runs in five innings at an average of 40, playing a crucial role for the team in the middle order. Her tournament-high nine sixes were unmatched, with the next-best being teammate Qiana Joseph's three.Dottin also contributed with the ball, taking five wickets, including a standout performance of 4 for 22 in the semifinal against New Zealand. Her explosive power-hitting was key in West Indies' victory in the virtual quarterfinal against England, securing their spot in the semifinals. The Bangladesh wicketkeeper had a standout performance for the Tigresses, excelling both behind the stumps and with the bat.She scored 104 runs in four innings at an average of 34.66, with a top score of 39 against the West Indies. Yet her best contributions came with the gloves, where she made six stumpings and took one catch. Her total of seven dismissals was the highest among wicketkeepers in the tournament.Afy Fletcher came up clutch with the ball for the West Indies, finishing off with the third-most wickets at this T20 World Cup. Despite not picking up a wicket in their opening game against the Proteas, the 37-year-old returned with strong performances, taking 10 wickets in total, including two 3-wicket hauls against Scotland and England.She picked up her best figures of 3-21 in the West Indies' defining match - their final group stage game against England, which paved their way into the last four. In the semi-final, she scalped two crucial wickets and a laudable 17* as well, with her side knocked out by eventual winners New Zealand.New Zealand's impactful pacer Rosemary Mair bookended her tournament with two outstanding displays. It was the 25-year-old who returned the best figures for the White Ferns in their crucial opening win over India, taking 4/19 from her four overs - dismissing Harmanpreet Kaur with a hooping inswinger in the powerplay and then returning to clean up the tail in the death overs.And Mair was excellent again in the final, taking 3/25 and once more playing the important role of bowling key overs in the powerplay and at the back-end of the innings. With probing accuracy combined with big movement, Mair proved an important weapon for the champions. No pace bowler took more wickets than her ten, and she finished as the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, behind only fellow finalists Nonkululeko Mlaba and Melie Kerr.South Africa's pocket-sized dynamo made her team's tournament come to life with a brilliant 4/29 in their very first game against the West Indies.Mlaba remained crucial for the Proteas throughout the event, varying her speeds and lengths to great effect against opposition batters. Whenever a partnership threatened South Africa, captain Wolvaardt would turn to Mlaba for a breakthrough, and the left-armer didn't disappoint.Her scalp of Tahlia McGrath ended a promising stand for Australia in the semi-final, and Mlaba also removed the well-set Suzie Bates (32) and Melie Kerr (43) in the final.Australia's reliable pacer Megan Schutt had a typically impactful outing in the UAE, troubling the batters throughout the innings.

The 57-year-old will not be there at the Red Bull Arena on Wednesday but his shadow still looms over the contest. Klopp stepped down as Liverpool manager in the summer citing exhaustion after a successful nine-year spell which included lifting the Champions League and Premier League. In October, Klopp announced his return to football, not as a coach but running Red Bull's football operations, which oversees clubs in several cities including Leipzig, Salzburg and New York.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");He will be absent from the game, choosing to wait to attend a match after starting the role in January.While the appointment was a surprise in Germany and in England, the focus on Leipzig has been particularly acute. In a strange quirk of the fixture list, Leipzig's five fixtures after the announcement includes games against each of Klopp's former clubs: Mainz, Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund. 'Klopp in Mallorca'Klopp was again a topic of conversation after Leipzig's 2-0 win at Mainz on Saturday, by fans and media alike.Some fans held banners protesting the appointment, while reporters asked if Leipzig coach Marco Rose had asked Klopp for tips on how to beat the Reds on Wednesday. Rose played under Klopp for several years at Mainz and the two maintain a good relationship. He said he would \"not be phoning up\" his former coach for tips on how to beat Liverpool. \"Kloppo is in (Spanish island) Mallorca, looking after his dog, his wife and his children. \"I will do everything (to beat Liverpool) but I won't call Klopp. \"He needs his peace and quiet and needs to rest a bit.\"And I'll grant him that.\"Born and raised in Leipzig, Rose took the ambitious club to the 2023 German Cup title in his first season. The 48-year-old followed it up with a run to the Champions League last 16, where Leipzig were narrowly eliminated by eventual champions Real Madrid. This season, Leipzig have managed to hold onto most of their young talent, giving rise to hopes of a shot at the league title and a long run in Europe.Although Leipzig are second to Bayern Munich on goal difference in the Bundesliga, the Champions League is another story, albeit with a tough draw. Leipzig conceded late goals to lose away at Atletico Madrid and at home against Juventus. The Saxon side have yet to claim a point in Europe this season, making Wednesday's clash with the Premier League leaders even more important.'Extremely stable'Like Liverpool, Leipzig's strong league form this campaign has been built on a miserly defence.Leipzig have kept clean sheets in six of seven league games. The two goals they did concede came against Bayer Leverkusen in a game Leipzig won 3-2, the defending champions' first defeat on German soil in 15 months. Starting the campaign under Klopp replacement Arne Slot, Liverpool have conceded just three goals in eight league games this season, by far the best mark in the Premier League.Peter Gulasci, Leipzig's goalkeeper, on Saturday recognised the similarities. \"Liverpool are extremely stable and don't allow much at the back -- just like us.\"That's why it won't be easy. \"Their style of play has changed a bit (under Slot), they play a bit more with the ball and are very structured. \"We've shown in the first two games we're on par with our opponents, but now we have to finally reward ourselves for our hard work.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Puneri Paltan and UP Yoddhas secured contrasting wins in their first match Pro Kabaddi League on Monday at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, Gachibowli, Hyderabad.\n\nDefending champions Paltan beat the Patna Pirates 40-25 while the Yoddhas began their season with a 28-23 win over Dabang Delhi KC. \n\nPaltan started off strongly, as Aslam Inamdar and co quickly stormed into a 4-0 lead in the first few minutes of the game. Soon after though, the Patna Pirates started to fight back with Ankit\u2019s Super Tackle on Inamdar cutting down the deficit to one point in the early exchanges. \n\nWith just under ten minutes to go in the first half, the Paltan had surged ahead and were looking to consolidate on a three-point lead. After that, a flurry of solid defensive tackles further extended the Paltan\u2019s lead, who were dominating proceedings at this point in time. \n\nFor the Paltan, captain Inamdar led by example with seven points and had fantastic support from Aman with five points and Mohit Goyat, who bagged three points. At the half-time break, Puneri Paltan led 20-10.\n\nAfter the break, the Paltan continued to dominate the contest, keeping the Pirates at an arm\u2019s length. At the midway point in the second half, the Paltan had a 13-point lead to their name. \n\nThe Pirates were giving it their all to mount a comeback, but the likes of Goyat, Inamdar and Aman were having none of it. \n\nIn the final minutes, the Pirates\u2019 Jang Kun Lee was introduced and his arrival triggered a round of rapturous applause from the crowd. However, there wasn\u2019t enough time to turn the tide, as the Paltan came away with a comfortable win to wrap up an entertaining Monday evening.\n\nYoddhas edge past Delhi\n\nThe Yoddhas kicked off proceedings when they picked up the first points of the game through a Surender Gill raid. After that, it was a tight battle, as the two competitors traded raids and points without conceding an inch to each other. Neither side could take an outright lead in the early exchanges in what was turning out to be a close battle. \n\nHowever, as the first half reached the midway stage, Bhavani Rajput took charge as the Yoddhas started to settle in, and edged ahead of their opponents. As the half wore on, Ashu Malik and Nitin Panwar helped Dabang Delhi KC fight back and bring the contest back on level terms. The first half ended with the scores tied at 12-11. \n\nThe second half was also a cautious start with both sides taking their time to strike. Both sides were finding it tough to break each other down despite multiple well thought out moves in the early exchanges. At the end of the first phase of the second half, there was hardly any difference between the two sides. The Yoddhas led by 18-16, with the game very much on a knife-edge. \n\nBy now Naveen Kumar had picked up the baton from Ashu Malik, and was leading the charge for the Delhi as they looked to fightback. However, in the final phase of play, the Yoddhas cranked up the intensity as Sahul Kumar inflicted an all out on Delhi and the raiders also picked up crucial points. \n\nThat helped the Yoddhas take a five-point lead with less than five minutes to go. Eventually, the Yoddhas came away with the win in what was a closely fought game. Rajput top scored for the UP Yoddhas with seven points.",

        "text": "India's victorious T20 World Cup 2024 campaign didn't feature wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson in any many. Despite the fact that Rishabh Pant was making his return to the national side after a long injury layoff, Team India decided to stick with him over picking an in-form Samson. However, right before the final against South Africa, India captain Rohit Sharma had asked Samson to be ready as there was a big chance he would be playing in the title clash. However, it all changed just minutes before the toss.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In an interview, Samson revealed that he was preparing to play in the final for India before Rohit informed him that the team was going with the same XI.\"I had a chance to play the final. I was told to stay ready. I was ready. However, they decided before the toss that we would go with the same team. I was like, no worries. I was in that type of mood,\" Samson told journalist Vimal Kumar during a chat.After the playing XI was decided Rohit spent a good amount of time with Samson explaining the decision.\"During the warm-up, Rohit took me to the side and started to explain to me why he was making that decision. He was like, You understood, na? You know his way, very casual? I told him, 'Let us win the match and then talk.' You focus on the match.\"He later said, \"He came back one minute later and said, 'I know you are cursing me in your mind.' I think you are not happy. I feel like you have something on your mind. Then we had a discussion. I told him, 'As a player, I want to play'.\"Samson even informed Rohit that he didn't want to let go of the opportunity to not feature in a final under his captaincy. This is a regret he would have to live with for the rest of his life.\"Since childhood, I wanted to come here and do something. Then he was like, 'My pattern is like this' and all that. I said I totally respect that you came and explained me. I said, 'I will have a regret; I could not play a World Cup final with a leader like you.' This will be a regret in my heart that I missed a World Cup final with a leader like Rohit Sharma. That will stay in my life.\"However, a thought that changed Samson's mind was the fact that instead of giving the selected XI members his time, Rohit chose to spend time with the player who wasn't even part of the team for the final. This side of Rohit made Samson respect him even more.\"After this, I thought, such a big thing like a World Cup final. Before the final, you have changed your decision. You spent 10 minutes with the player that is not playing just before the toss. He gave me 10 minutes before the toss. After that, I got to know this person has some other qualities.\"If I were in their place, I would be thinking about the players who are playing or my batting. I will explain to Sanju later; that is what normally you think. At that point, he thought 'I have to explain to Sanju, why I took that decision.' At that point, he won a place in my heart that will stay for a lifetime.\"",

He came off the bench 369 days later for the four-time Asian champion with 13 minutes remaining at Al Ain. He almost scored immediately when his low shot from left of the area shaved the post.In a thrilling match between Al-Hilal and the defending champion, Renan Lodi gave Al-Hilal the opener after 26 minutes.

        "title": "How Bumrah, Shami had helped India win maiden Test series in Australia",
        "text": "NEW DELHI: India pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami form one of the most potent fast-bowling partnerships in world cricket. Their combination is highly effective due to a blend of contrasting but complementary skills.While Bumrah is known for his unorthodox action and ability to bowl consistently at high speeds, excelling in hitting yorkers, especially at the death, and generating seam movement, Shami offers similar pace but focuses more on seam position and swing, both conventional and reverse. His accuracy with both new and old balls makes him dangerous across formats.Both Bumrah and Shami had played pivotal roles in India's historic Test series triumph in 2018-19 - India's first ever Test series win in Australia.Also See: Cricket Live ScoreWith India set to play their first Test against Australia exactly one month from now, here's a look back at the roles Bumrah and Shami played in helping Virat Kohli's team make history.Jasprit BumrahBumrah took 21 wickets from 4 Test matches with a best of 9/86 that came at an average of 17.00 and a strike rate of 44.9.Bumrah was not the spearhead of the Indian bowling attack at the time but left the Aussie shores as the bowling mainstay of the Indian team. The strong shoulder of his that allows him to send thunderbolts at over 140 kmph even from a short run-up led to then Indian captain Virat Kohli saying that he wouldn't like to face Bumrah in a Test match. Some compliment that.And Bumrah had the figures to match Kohli's words. And the guile too. The slower delivery that he bowled to dismiss Shaun Marsh LBW at the stroke of lunch on Day 3 of the Boxing Day Test, not only displayed his accuracy and control but also his maturity.Recall the 147.7 kmph delivery that Bumrah bowled to then Australian captain Tim Paine in Perth. The good length delivery had slight lateral movement, squared up Paine and zoomed past the stumps and over a jumping Rishabh Pant to race to the boundary. Now Paine was not the best batsman in the world but that delivery would have bamboozled any batsman worth his salt.It was not surprising that Bumrah finished as the leading wicket-taker for India with 21 scalps to his name. With his then career-best figures of 6/33 in 15.5 overs at the MCG, Bumrah became the first bowler from the sub-continent to register a five-wicket haul in South Africa, England and Australia in the same year. With match figures of 9/86, Bumrah was India's hero in the Boxing Day Test victory. Bumrah ended his debut Test season with a record 49 wickets by any pace bowler.Mohammed ShamiMohammed Shami took 16 wickets in the four-Test series with a best of 6/136 at an average of 26.18 and a strike rate of 51.2.Shami took 5 wickets in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval which India won by 31 runs. And when Virat Kohli opted to field four pacers in the second Test in Perth, it was Shami, at his furious best, who shone the brightest amongst the Indian seamers.Shami went wicketless in the first innings but in the second innings ripped through Australia's lower middle-order. He was on a hat-trick at one point - having dismissed Tim Paine and Aaron Finch off successive deliveries.It was thanks mainly to Shami's career-best haul of 6/56 that India were able to bowl out Australia for 243 runs in their second innings. But the match slipped from India's grasp due to the lack of a balanced bowling attack - a glaring lapse even Shami had admitted to.The ability of Bumrah and Shami to bowl in tandem makes them one of the most feared fast-bowling duos in modern cricket, especially in Test matches where they have consistently delivered for India both at home and abroad.So the whole of India would be keeping their fingers crossed for Shami to be fit for the Australia tour.",
        "summary": "India's fast-bowling duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, played crucial roles in India's historic Test series win in Australia in 2018-19. Bumrah's consistency and Shami's precision complemented each other perfectly. With both players showcasing exceptional skills, they collectively took 37 wickets, leading India to a memorable victory Down Under. India would be keeping fingers crossed for Shami to be fit for the Australia tour.",

        "text": "Hyderabad FC head coach Thangboi Singto acknowledged his team\u2019s need for improvement at both ends of the pitch after the club suffered their third defeat in the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 season.The Yellow and Black managed to score their first goal of the season against Jamshedpur FC, with Cy Goddard finding the net early in the second half. But it wasn\u2019t enough as first-half goals from Rei Tachikawa and Jordan Murray secured another three points at home for Khalid Jamil\u2019s squad.The visitors started the match positively but couldn\u2019t maintain the momentum for long, allowing the home side to gain control after the initial phase of play.Singto discussed his players\u2019 performance and the issues they faced during their defeat in the post-match press conference.\u201cThe first 30 minutes were one of the best football matches we have played by far. But what happened after the first 30 minutes is a different story. Before Jamshedpur FC scored, we were controlling (the game), and pushing Jamshedpur FC back,\u201d Singto said as quoted from ISL.\u201cBut maybe football is about concentration, and a lack of communication led to that cross happening and from there, with that movement and not tracking Rei (Tachikawa), who was running for a tap-in. We can do better defensively and we need to be sharper,\u201d he added.The long wait for their first goal of the season ended, and while Hyderabad FC showed moments of sharpness, the hosts used their experience overall to secure the three points.\u201cWe scored our first goal of the season at least, though we lost in terms of performance. I think we were happy with the first half and in patches, but, you know, we\u2019re going to churn out the results. We need to win for everybody around us. So yeah, we have to keep working hard,\u201d Singto opined.The visitors actually gained more possession and had more shots on target, with eight compared to Jamshedpur FC\u2019s five.Singto praised his players for their efforts on the pitch, particularly the young winger Ramhlunchhunga, who troubled Jamshedpur FC on several occasions but couldn\u2019t help secure their second point of the season in the end.\u201cSome of the boys really stepped up today. Ramhlunchhunga: what a game he had today! The shortest guy (on the pitch), but he was all around the pitch with some good shots on target,\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut we need to be more clinical; football is about goals. If you want three points, you need to score goals. We scored, but Jamshedpur FC scored two, so hopefully in the next match, we go better prepared and don\u2019t concede and score,\u201d the head coach commented.",

The incident unfolded at VV Pride Hotel in Annapurna Enclave of Chandanagar on the intervening night of October 20 and 21, where he was attending a birthday celebration with a group of friends. \n\nAccording to the police, the man stepped out in the lobby around 12.30 a.m. where he saw a dog and started playing with it. \u201cUday ran behind the dog across the lobby and lost control of his speed.

The preparations were revealed in an ICC meeting on Monday, during which the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, was also present. Sources told Geo News that during the meeting, the PCB officials assured the ICC board members that the upgradation of the three stadiums that will host the matches of the marquee event will be completed within the stipulated time. Naqvi has also invited ICC board members to Pakistan to review the preparations made for the tournament. The Champions Trophy will begin next year in Pakistan, but there are certain challenges that need to be addressed. Uncertainty continues to loom over India going to Pakistan for the mega event. Since 2008\u2019s Asia Cup, India has not played any cricket tournaments in Pakistan due to tense relationships between both nations because of terrorism.A series played from December 2012 to January 2013 in India marked the final bilateral series between the two nations. Since then, both nations have only clashed at ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. On the other hand, Pakistan travelled to India on three occasions since the 2008 Asia Cup.Recently, reports started to surface about the International Cricket Council (ICC) looking at three options regarding hosting the Champions Trophy.According to sources, ICC is either looking to have the tournament go ahead in Pakistan as planned or take place in both Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a part of the hybrid model.As per this hybrid model, matches for India and knockout stage games will take place in Dubai. The third option is the entire tournament, taking place outside Pakistan, with Dubai, Sri Lanka or South Africa as possible hosts.Pakistan have not hosted any major International Cricket Council (ICC) event since the 1996 ODI World Cup, which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka.

All were unable to do so, but Verstappen left it late to put his Red Bull into P1.\r\n\r\nRussell will join Verstappen on the front row, with Leclerc and Norris behind in third and fourth ahead of Sainz and the Haas of Nico Hulkenberg in fifth and sixth places.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton lines up in seventh for Mercedes, alongside Haas\u2019s Kevin Magnussen in a solid eighth, while RB\u2019s Yuki Tsunoda and the Williams of Franco Colapinto round out the top 10.\r\n\r\nSergio Perez found himself eliminated in SQ2 after his sole effort proved not to be enough to see him through, putting the Red Bull in P11. Joining him on the sixth row will be the Alpine of Pierre Gasly.\r\n\r\nAston Martin had a disappointing day, with Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso ending the session in 13th and 14th respectively. Behind them was Liam Lawson in 15th for RB as the New Zealander makes his return to the grid in place of Daniel Ricciardo.\r\n\r\nThere was drama in SQ1 when Oscar Piastri had his final lap time deleted due to exceeding track limits at Turn 19, dropping the McLaren driver down to P16 and putting him out of the session. Alex Albon, meanwhile, had a spin in the Williams as he approached the line, leaving him unable to improve in P18.\r\n\r\nAlso exiting in the first segment of Sprint Qualifying were Alpine\u2019s Esteban Ocon in 17th, Valtteri Bottas in 19th and the Finn\u2019s Kick Sauber teammate Zhou Guanyu in 20th place.",

        "text": "New Zealand's golden generation, led by the inspirational Sophie Devine, will have one last chance to lay hands on a global ICC trophy when it meets a gritty South Africa in the summit clash of the T20 World Cup which is set to throw a new champion, here Sunday. New Zealand's women's team had won the ODI World Cup back in 2000 but none of the current squad members were part of that historic title triumph. Before this event began, New Zealand were in the trenches having lost 10 matches on the trot in the format but under Devine this bunch, comprising of the venerable Suzie Bates and the assuring Amelia Kerr, has done wonders, bringing the side in contention for the ultimate prize.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");It is most probably the last time the Black Shirts will have Devine, Bates and Lea Tahuhu playing of the national side in a global tournament.Devine, 35, has more than 7000 runs under her belt in white-ball formats while the 37-year-old Bates has more than 10,000 runs to her name.Pacer Tahuhu, 34, has 112 wickets in ODIs and 93 in T20Is.They won't leave any stone unturned to ensure that they have a World Cup trophy in their cabinet.South Africa on the other side will be equally determined to complete the unfinished business as they had lost the 2023 World Cup final to Australia at home. They have an opportunity to erase painful memories as they had lost by a mere 19 runs in the close contest.New Zealand have one or other player to rise the occasion in the tournament and in the semifinal against the West Indies, if they failed to set a target big enough to daunt the free-flowing Caribbean batters, their bowlers responded with tidy spells throughout the game to eke out a memorable win.Kerr's wicket tally has swelled to 12 in the tournament as she found apt support from the other end in the likes of Eden Carson (8), Rosemary Mair (7) and the experienced Lea Tahuhu.New Zealand announced their intentions with a big win against India first up and followed that up with consistent performances across departments.A 60-run loss to Australia, arguably the strongest team in the competition, notwithstanding, the Kiwis weren't unnerved as they went on to pip the West Indies in the final over of their low-scoring semifinal to make their third final.When the tournament began towards the end of the first decade of this century, New Zealand appeared to be the team to beat as they made two consecutive finals but got pipped by England and Australia once each.Bates and Devine, the survivors from those campaigns, will thus get a third crack in winning the first ICC trophy for New Zealand in white-ball cricket since 2000 when the men's team won the Champions Trophy in Kenya.But against them will be the formidable South Africa who scripted history of sorts to have stopped the all-dominating Australian team from reaching their eighth consecutive final in the last 15 years and seven editions of the T20 World Cup.If New Zealand has Kerr topping the charts for most successful bowlers, South Africa have two of their top-order batters \u2014 Laura Wolvaardt (190 runs) and Tazmin Brits (170 runs) \u2014 lodged at the top of the batting charts in this tournament.South Africa's all-round might will pose the sternest challenge as the Proteas side is coming off a comprehensive eight-wicket thrashing of Australia, having restricted them to a mere 135/5 and knocked off the target with more than two overs to spare.While a lot will depend on the pair of Wolvaardt and Brits at the top, SA will need the likes of Anneke Bosch and Marizanne Kapp to chip in with the bat too.Similarly, Nonkululeko Mlaba (10 wickets) would also need the rest of the bowlers to replicate their performance from the semifinal, in which they collectively kept it tight to not allow Australia to get away with the bat.Squads:New Zealand: Sophie Devine (captain), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Isabella Gaze (wk), Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Amelia Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder (wk), Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon.Time: 7:30PM IST.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Sprint qualifying is always difficult. You never know how much you can push, but the car was working well.\"Of course I'm very happy to be first, it's been a while.\"The Dutchman added: \"It's always very hectic and you know this track is amazing to drive.\"Norris was left frustrated after struggling for set-up balance with his car.\"That was not very good. We are struggling. And my lap was shocking,\" said the Briton.\"I hope I can go forward in the sprint, or at least that's the plan, but honestly for pace we are where we deserve to be.\"'In the mix' Russell said: \"I'm happy and it's been a while since we were on the front tow and my last run was strong.

        "title": "Bigg Boss Telugu 8 Day 47 Highlights: Gautam Takes the Lead as Mega Chief",
        "text": "The current season of Bigg Boss Telugu, aptly titled \"Limitless Entertainment,\" has been delivering a blend of drama and excitement week after week. The entry of wildcard contestants, known as the Royals, in the fifth week has added a new layer of competition, often overshadowing the original housemates, referred to as the OG clan. This week\u2019s main task, \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers,\" tested the participants' concentration, strategy, and resilience. Here are some highlights from Day 47 of Bigg Boss Telugu 8:\r\n1. The Cushion Challenge:\r\nThe day began with the continuation of the \"Over Smartphones VS Over Smart Chargers\" task. Bigg Boss introduced the Cushion Challenge, a twist on the Memory game. Contestants were required to match images displayed on a screen with cushions placed in the garden area, carrying the cushions to a designated grid to score points. \r\n\r\nDespite facing early setbacks, the Over Smartphones team emerged victorious, earning the advantage of eliminating two players from the Over Smart Chargers from the Mega Chief race. They chose to remove Nabeel and Nikhil from the competition.\r\n2. The Conclusion:\r\nThe weekly challenge concluded with four contestants from the OG clan and eight from the Royals still in the game. After the weekly task concluded, Teja and Prithvi were released from their punishment as the week's worst performers, regaining access to their suitcases.\r\n3. Comic Relief from Bigg Boss:\r\nBigg Boss humorously reprimanded Mehaboob and Avinash for napping during the day. The housemates were then summoned to the garden, where they found miniature coffee cups, bun masks, and a violin cutout\u2014a playful nod to Avinash\u2019s earlier requests for coffee and pain relief spray. Both the housemates and viewers enjoyed this lighthearted moment.\r\n4. A Hair-Raising Opportunity:\r\nDuring breakfast, Gautam playfully challenged Prithvi to shave his beard, which Prithvi declined. Bigg Boss then introduced a unique chance to add money to the winner's prize by offering Avinash and Prithvi cash rewards of \u20b925,000, \u20b950,000, or \u20b91 lakh for various haircuts. \r\n\r\nAlthough Prithvi declined, Avinash accepted the \u20b950,000 haircut after much deliberation, adding humour to the situation. He sportingly underwent the haircut, entertaining the audience with his witty remarks.\r\n5. Additional Reward:\r\nIn recognition of Avinash's spirit and courage, Bigg Boss added \u20b950,000 to the winner's prize pool. Furthermore, the house was granted an extra two hours of kitchen time as an additional reward.\r\n6. Selection of the Mega Chief:\r\nThe competition for the prestigious Mega Chief position was through a task called \"Pattuko ledha thappuko,\" in which contenders had to grab a bone placed in a circle before others. The first to seize the bone gained the advantage of eliminating one or two competitors from the race. Gautam ultimately secured the Mega Chief role after a fierce fight.\r\n7. A Slight Commotion:\r\nAt one point, Manikanta grabbed the bone and initially decided to eliminate Hariteja and Teja, citing a pre-game agreement with Gautam to stay in the competition until the end. \r\n\r\nHowever, Gautam denied having made any such deal, leading Manikanta to reconsider his choice and decide to eliminate Teja and Gautam. The situation was resolved by Nikhil, who, as the task Sanchalak, upheld Manikanta's original decision to remove Teja and Hariteja, despite Hariteja's objections.\r\n8. Gautam\u2019s Tribute for Women:\r\nAs the newly appointed Mega Chief, Gautam declared the upcoming week for the women in honour of the female audience. He announced that the women in the house would be exempt from performing household chores unless they volunteered, which garnered appreciation from the housemates and the audience.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the week's episodes, viewers eagerly await the weekend's special broadcasts, during which the host will analyze the housemates' performances\u2013 the weekend episodes air at 9 pm, half an hour earlier than the weekday schedule, on Disney+ Hotstar and Star Maa. \r\n\r\nBased on the above highlights of Day 47 and the promos, a compelling critique of the contestants' strategies and gameplay can be expected in Bigg Boss Telugu 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStay tuned to Yo!

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan's first century in Test cricket and Rishabh Pant's magnificent 99 may not be enough to stop New Zealand from securing their first Test victory on Indian soil in 36 years, with only 107 runs needed on the final day of a captivating series opener.As bad light and subsequent rain forced an early end to the fourth evening, Tom Latham (0) and Devon Conway (0) remained at the crease. The last time New Zealand emerged victorious in a Test match in India was in 1988, when Sir Richard Hadlee claimed 10 wickets at the Wankhede Stadium, ensuring a resounding 136-run triumph.114376004Latham's team is on the verge of making history, despite a valiant comeback by India, who scored 462 in their second innings. This was largely due to Sarfaraz's penchant for scoring big hundreds, which he carried from first-class to Test cricket with a brilliant 150 off 195 balls, and a partnership of 177 with a partially fit Rishabh Pant, who fell short of his seventh Test century by just one run.114376403India's resilience in Test cricket has been exemplified by remarkable second-innings performances, resulting in some of the most significant improvements in team scores between the first and second innings. 114373829The highest such improvement occurred during the iconic 2001 Kolkata Test against Australia, where India improved by 486 runs, going from 171 all out to declaring at 657/7. In 1999, India witnessed a 422-run improvement against New Zealand in Mohali, from 83 to 505/3 declared.114366921In a recent 2024 Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, India bounced back from a dismal 46 in the first innings to score 462, an improvement of 416 runs. A 375-run improvement took place in 1965 at Brabourne Stadium, where India posted 88 and then 463/5 declared, also against New Zealand. Finally, in Headingley, 1967, India turned the tables against England, improving by 346 runs, going from 164 to 510 in the second innings.",

        "text": "Dubai [UAE], October 19 (ANI):Both teams will be eying their first Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title as neither have won a Women\u2019s ODI World Cup earlier.South Africa, however, will be playing their second successive Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final after losing to Australia in the summit clash of the 2023 edition.The Protea women, however, knocked out three-time defending champions Australia, also record six-time Women\u2019s T20 WC winners, in the semi-finals this year.After defeating West Indies by 10 wickets in their opening Group B encounter, South Africa endured a seven-wicket defeat against England.Laura Wolvaardt\u2019s charges, however, bounced right back by beating Scotland and Bangladesh by 80 runs and 7 wickets, respectively, to make the semis, where they shocked Australia by eight wickets to earn a title shot.New Zealand, who were on a 10-match losing streak in T20Is heading into the tournament, followed a similar path to the final. The White Ferns beat India by 58 runs in their Group A opener but succumbed to a 60-run loss to Australia in their second outing.An eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and a comfortable 54-run win against Pakistan saw Sophie Devine\u2019s team cross paths with 2016 champions West Indies in the top four.A narrow eight-run win over the Windies saw New Zealand make their first summit clash since 2010. The White Ferns reached the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final in the first two editions but lost to England in 2009 before coming up short against Australia the following year.The 2024 Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final promises to be a fascinating contest between bat and ball with South African captain Laura Wolvaardt leading the run-scoring charts in the tournament while New Zealand spinner Amelie Kerr is the top wicket-taker.South Africa, though, seems the more balanced of the two sides ahead of the contest with Tazmin Brits, the tournament\u2019s second-highest run-scorer, and Nonkululeko Mlaba, the tournament\u2019s second-highest wicket-taker, also in their ranks. Head-to-head record, however, tilts the scale in New Zealand\u2019s favour, who have won 11 of the 16 meetings between the two sides. South Africa have four victories under their belt. \n\nSquads: South Africa-Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe Tryon.Travelling Reserve: Miane Smit.New Zealand-Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.

        "text": "Jordan Cox is poised to make his Test debut as England's wicketkeeper during their upcoming tour of New Zealand. This opportunity arises as Jamie Smith is set to miss part of the series due to paternity leave. Cox, who will turn 24 on Monday as per ESPNcricinfo, has been England's reserve batter for the last five Tests and now has the chance to make his mark in December. Smith and his partner are expecting their first child in mid-December, coinciding with either the second or third Test against New Zealand.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"Being at the birth of my son is not something I want to miss,\" he told the Daily Mail recently, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\"It will be a memory that I cherish more than any in cricket anyway, so if I lost my place because of it, so be it,\" he added.Cox made his international debut in England's T20I series against Australia last month and will soon join the squads for their upcoming white-ball tour to the Caribbean. Although he was unable to keep wicket for Essex this summer due to a severe finger injury sustained in the Hundred last year, he has been refining his wicketkeeping skills with Brendon McCullum in Pakistan.\"It's life, right?\" McCullum, who is the head coach of the England Cricket team said of Smith's absence.\"People have kids and we wish them all the best, to be there and support their partners. At this stage, it looks like Jamie will probably play the first [Test in New Zealand] and may miss the next two. We're not totally sure - it's up to Mother Nature a little - but we know we've got Jordan Cox in the squad here,\" McCullum said, as per quoted by ESPNcricinfo.England is confident in Cox's abilities, despite his limited recent experience behind the stumps, a belief reinforced by Smith's own selection earlier this summer while being second-choice at Surrey. McCullum, drawing from his own experience, considers New Zealand to be a comfortable place for wicketkeeping and is eager to evaluate Cox's performance at the Test level. McCullum describes Cox's glovework as \"solid.\"Cox, known for his self-assured nature, admitted that he would get \"bored\" after reaching 40 runs while playing for a struggling Kent side last year. Seeking a change to reignite his passion for four-day cricket, he moved to Essex, where he scored four centuries and averaged 65.57 in his first County Championship season.He took over the No. 4 spot at Essex, vacated by Dan Lawrence's move to Surrey. Lawrence's own recent experiences underscore the challenges of being England's spare batter. After performing well in the Caribbean in March 2022, Lawrence waited over two years for another opportunity in the middle order, only to be placed as an opener with predictable results. Consequently, Cox has now moved ahead of Lawrence in the selection order.Unless England loses a batter to injury or illness before Thursday's third Test in Rawalpindi, Cox will be added to the white-ball squads and travel to the Caribbean, likely alongside Rehan Ahmed. Marcus Trescothick, serving as interim white-ball coach for the three ODIs and five T20Is against the West Indies, has already departed Pakistan in preparation for that tour.Cox is expected to make his ODI debut during the Caribbean series, providing him with an opportunity to stake a late claim for a spot in England's squad for next year's Champions Trophy. However, it is the prospect of a Test debut later this year that could truly satisfy his ambitions and validate the extensive travel he will undertake in the first half of the English winter.\"He's annoyingly good at everything he does - particularly on the golf course,\" McCullum said.\"He's one of those guys that you look at and say he's got a high ceiling in terms of talent, particularly with bat in hand. There's a fair chance that he'll get the opportunity in New Zealand, if Jamie does return home, to bat down the order and take the gloves,\" he noted.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

This is in addition to speeding up the renovation works of rainwater-holding structures. As part of this effort, HYDRAA commissioner A.V. Ranganath, GHMC Khairatabad zonal commissioner Anuraag Jayanti and additional commissioner of city traffic P. Vishwaprasad inspected stormwater drains at the Lakdikapul area. The officials commenced the works to end waterlogging on the roads of the Lakdikapul area within a week.For this, the GHMC would renovate the stormwater drains, which are in a dilapidated condition, in and around the Lakdikapul area. The drain under the Lakdikapul railway bridge will also have to be renovated. The HYDRAA, in a press release, highlighted that due to the renovation of the rainwater-holding structure at the Raj Bhavan Road, the roads are not getting waterlogged even when that area receives 5 cm of rain. Earlier, the water used to stagnate on these roads even for a 2-cm rain.",

        "text": "Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) pipped their arch-rivals East Bengal FC (EBFC) by 2-0 in the high-octane Kolkata Derby of the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 campaign at the Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Saturday.As per the media release by ISL, Mohun Bagan Super Giant controlled the tempo of the match from start to finish, as a goal each from Jamie Maclaren and Dimitrios Petratos in either half was enough for Jose Molina\u2019s men to secure their eighth win against the Red and Gold Brigade (EBFC) in ISL.It was the 400th meet between both the sides overall.The players took their time to settle into the electrifying atmosphere of 60,000 odd fans buzzing at the stadium. It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. However, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.Despite the frustration, the Mariners (MBSG) maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.Their relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.The second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.Looking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.The 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.The Scottish midfielder was adjudged the player of the match and he continues to be Mohun Bagan Super Giant\u2019s main man in midfield. Stewart created three chances on the night while registering eight crosses. He also completed 31 out of his 35 attempted passes as per the media release by ISL.East Bengal FC will travel to Bhubaneswar to face Odisha FC in search of their first win of the season on October 22. On the other hand, Mohun Bagan Super Giant will be back in action again on October 30 when they will lock horns against Hyderabad FC away from home.",

        "text": "Manchester United eased the pressure on beleaguered boss Erik ten Hag as they fought back to beat Brentford 2-1, while Tottenham got back on track with a 4-1 rout of West Ham on Saturday. Ten Hag had defiantly slammed \"fairy tales and lies\" about his United future on Friday as the Dutchman insisted he was not in danger of the sack.

It is only one win, we have to build on this.\"United's first win in six games in all competitions was only their third victory in eight Premier League matches this term.They sit 10th in the table ahead of an intriguing week, featuring a Europa League trip to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce and a visit to West Ham.Tottenham scored three goals in eight second-half minutes against West Ham to ease the pain of their recent collapse in a 3-2 loss at Brighton. Mohammed Kudus' opener for West Ham was cancelled out before the break by Dejan Kulusevski.Tottenham ran riot after the interval thanks to Yves Bissouma's strike, an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and a fourth from Son Heung-min.It was a third win in four league games for Ange Postecoglou's men, heaping pressure on new West Ham coach Julen Lopetegui after his side's spluttering start to the season.\"Second half was outstanding from the lads -- good energy, good goals, good football,\" Postecoglou said.Leicester's great escapeBrighton moved up to fifth place with a 1-0 victory at Newcastle on a day of mixed emotions for Danny Welbeck, who scored the 35th-minute winner but was later stretchered off with a back injury that left him needing an oxygen mask.Leicester staged a stirring fightback to snatch a dramatic 3-2 victory at winless Southampton.Cameron Archer struck in the eighth minute before Joe Aribo's 28th-minute goal increased the lead for the bottom-of-the-table hosts.But Leicester's Facundo Buonanotte bundled home in the 64th minute before Ryan Fraser was sent off for conceding a penalty with a foul on Jamie Vardy.Vardy stroked in the 74th-minute leveller from the spot and Jordan Ayew drilled into the bottom corner in the eighth minute of stoppage-time.Fourth-placed Aston Villa have made their best start for 26 years after a 3-1 win at Fulham.Raul Jimenez netted in the fifth minute, but Villa's Morgan Rogers equalised four minutes later.Andreas Pereira had a penalty saved by Villa 'keeper Emiliano Martinez before the interval.Ollie Watkins' 59th-minute header completed the comeback and Fulham's Joachim Andersen was sent off for a professional foul on the Villa striker five minutes later.Issa Diop's 69th-minute own-goal sealed the win, although Villa had Jaden Philogene sent off for two yellow cards in three minutes.Everton clinched their first away win in 16 games in all competitions with a 2-0 victory against Ipswich.Iliman Ndiaye and Michael Keane scored to leave fourth-bottom Ipswich without a win in eight league games.Third-placed Arsenal will go top of the table if they win at Bournemouth in Saturday's final match.On Sunday, Liverpool, currently in pole position, host sixth-placed Chelsea, while champions Manchester City travel to Wolves.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Using a play on words with Klopp's last name, the home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and used a quote from their side's former boss: \"I like people until the point they disappoint me.\" A larger banner, in big red letters, asked Klopp if he had \"forgotten everything we gave you?\". A former player at the club, Klopp coached Mainz for seven years, taking the team to the top flight for the first time before moving to Borussia Dortmund and later Liverpool. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Klopp stepped down as Liverpool manager in the summer having won several titles, including the Premier League and Champions League. In October, Klopp announced he would join energy drink company Red Bull, which owns clubs in Leipzig, Salzburg and New York, as their global head of football from January 2025.His decision to take up the job at Red Bull has annoyed supporters in Germany -- particularly at ex-clubs Dortmund and Mainz -- who have a long-standing dislike of RB Leipzig.Some fans believe Leipzig, founded in 2009, are not consistent with Germany's 50+1 rule, which requires member control of clubs, while others have hit out at the multi-club ownership model used by Red Bull.Leipzig's win at Mainz sent the club, who are yet to lose in the league this season, top of the table -- at least until Bayern Munich's match against Stuttgart at home later on Saturday.Leipzig coach Marco Rose, who played under Klopp for several years at Mainz, dismissed the fans' criticism as a minority opinion. \"There are 35,000 people in the stadium, many of whom have an opinion. I believe that around 34,936 people love Kloppo for the fact that he shaped an era here, that we achieved something great together,\" said Rose. \"He was here in Mainz for a long time.\"Everyone has their own life somewhere and the right to decide things freely and for themselves. Not everyone has to love it.\"Rose added that: \"(He) didn't even notice (the banner), so it can't have been that wild.\"(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Omar Marmoush sent Frankfurt 1-0 up, before Robert Andrich equalised for the champions midway through the first half and Boniface completed the comeback in the second period.

Marmoush showed Boniface how it is done, blasting a low shot left to give the visitors the lead on 16 minutes. The Egyptian now has an incredible nine goals and five assists in just seven league games this season.Andrich made good on his error soon afterwards, combining expertly with Adli and Martin Terrier to flit through the penalty area for a superb one-touch goal in the 25th minute.Boniface would also redeem himself, giving Leverkusen the lead inside the final 20 minutes, heading in a deflected cross from substitute Florian Wirtz to put the hosts on course for victory.Andrich told Sky Germany \"we were focused and played good football -- and there was a nice goal from me.\"The 30-year-old midfielder, who made his Germany debut last season after a career largely spent in the lower divisions, said of his performance: \"I always have fun playing football, but I maybe have to work a bit harder than the rest.\"Days out from their home Champions League clash with Liverpool, Leipzig beat Mainz to go top of the table, at least until Bayern Munich's home match against Stuttgart later on Saturday.At kick-off, the Mainz fans unveiled a series of banners critical of former coach Jurgen Klopp's decision to take over as football boss at Leipzig's parent company Red Bull. The home fans asked \"Are you crazy?\" and accused Klopp, who coached Mainz to a debut promotion before joining Borussia Dortmund and later Liverpool, of \"forgetting everything we gave you\".Still unbeaten this season in Germany despite two Champions League losses, Leipzig took the lead after 20 minutes thanks to an excellent solo effort from Xavi Simons. Leipzig captain Willi Orban tapped in a rebound from a Lois Openda cross to put his side 2-0 up.Orban told Sky: \"We could have finished things off earlier but we're happy with the win.\"Elsewhere, Freiburg continued their impressive start to the season with a 3-1 home win over Augsburg to go into outright second. Freiburg were three goals up at half-time, with Vincenzo Grifo, Philipp Lienhart and Christian Guenter scoring, before Augsburg's Phillip Tietz pulled one back in the second period.Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Tim Kleindienst scored a double, days after making his Germany debut, in a 3-2 home win over former club Heidenheim.Hoffenheim won their first game since their season opener, with Andrej Kramaric, Marius Buelter and Haris Tabakovic scoring in a 3-1 win over lowly Bochum, who sit last with just one point from seven games.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Samuel Chukwueze's 13th-minute strike looked like being the first of a comfortable win but ended up being the winning goal as Milan held on for the points.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Their task was made difficult by Tijjani Reijnders being sent off in the 29th minute for a clumsy foul on Sandi Lovric who would have been clean through on goal had the Netherlands midfielder not clipped his heels.Tammy Abraham should have sealed the points for Milan with 15 minutes remaining when he somehow managed, moments after replacing Alvaro Morata, to both fluff a golden chance on the rebound and injure his shoulder at the same time.The hosts looked to have been sucker-punched when Christian Kabasele bundled home for Udinese in the fifth minute of stoppage time, but a huge roar rang around the ground when, after a long VAR check, the goal was ruled out for Jurgen Ekkelenkamp's toes straying offside.Milan's win came in front of a flat San Siro following the decision of Milan's hardcore \"ultras\" supporters to stand in silence for most of the match in protest at what they claim is a law enforcement and Italian media campaign against them.Leading ultras from both Milan and local rivals Inter -- at Roma on Sunday night -- were arrested last month and are accused of a variety of crimes raging from criminal conspiracy and extortion to assault.Earlier this week Milan's ultras groups refuted allegations by investigators of any involvement in ticket touting, control of parking and sales from concession stands near the San Siro.In the meantime police banned the ultras' large \"Curva Sud Milano\" from being hung out in that section, leading to supporters around the whole stadium, not just ultras, from leaving their own banners and flags at home.Instead fans in the Curva Sud held a banner in support of their arrested allies which read, loosely translated, \"Stay strong boys\".Later Juventus can move level with Napoli with a win over in-form Lazio, although Thiago Motta's side have been hit by series of injuries.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Hyderabad: In medical advancement, documentation of medical history and heritage plays a very important role. Unknown to many, Hyderabad houses a national institute that documents the history of Indian medical systems. Hidden away in the lanes of Gaddiannaram, Dilsukhnagar, the National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH), is a rich resource for historians and researchers studying traditional Indian medical systems like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and several components of modern medicine. The institute was formerly known as the National Centre of Indian Medical Heritage.The institute came into existence as the upgraded Department of History of Medicine in 1956 under the government of Andhra Pradesh and was handed over to the government of India in 1969. It was earlier housed on the third floor of Osmania Medical College and shifted to its present premises in 2009. Currently functioning under the administrative control of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), ministry of AYUSH, the government of India, it houses a medical history library with over 10,000 books, including rare publications dating back to the 15th century. Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) designated NIIMH as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Fundamental and Literary Research in Traditional Medicine. Shedding light on the rich medical history of Telangana, director of the institute G. P. Prasad said, \"One of the earliest inscriptions, dating back to 400 AD, was found in Phanigiri, Mulugu. It mentions Agrabhisaja, a chief physician, who served under King Devasena. This inscription highlights the reverence for medical practitioners, who were even allowed to erect Dharmachakras (sacred pillars) as a symbol of their importance in society.\" \"Another key piece of medical history is the Sirur inscription from 1,100 AD in Medak. It references Aggalayya, a Jain scholar, Ayurvedic physician and surgeon. Known for his surgical expertise, Aggalayya taught the art of surgery to students from across India and served under four different dynasties. His contributions earned him the title of 'Samanta Raja', a subordinate king, underscoring his stature in society,\" Dr Prasad highlighted. In Yaragudi (currently in Andhra Pradesh), Ashoka inscriptions mention the establishment of both veterinary and human hospitals, along with the importation of medicinal plants from surrounding regions. During the era of the Nizams, we see the rise of Unani medicine alongside Ayurveda. The Nizams supported the development of Unani, and the region became a hub for both systems of medicine. \"Today, more than 200 medical inscriptions have been collected by our institution,\" Dr Prasad informed. Furthermore, the records from Tirumukkuddal in Tamil Nadu even detail the establishment of a 15-bed inpatient department with designated surgeons, physicians, and staff, providing a clear picture of early hospital management, the director explained. Housing two museums dedicated to medical history, the NIIMH showcases some original and thematic art and artifacts. The certificates of the first woman anaestheologist, Lady Rupa Bai Furdoonji; the first batch of students of Hyderabad Medical School; some paintings showing Edward Lawrie's Chloroform Commissions; replicas of surgical instruments mentioned in Susruta Samhita, the first surgeon of India, are some of the exhibits dedicated to Hyderabad. Through initiatives like the AYUSH Manuscripts Advanced Repository (AMAR) portal, the NIIMH has cataloged an impressive 16,000 AYUSH manuscripts, with 4,249 digitised. The Institute\u2019s digital endeavours also include the Showcase of Ayurvedic Historical Imprints (SAHI) portal, which features nearly 800 medico-historical artifacts and the e-books of the AYUSH project, offering digital versions of classical textbooks. The Journal of Indian Medical Heritage run by the NIIMH has published writings that mention how Ayurveda dawned during the reign of Nizams, some manuscripts from the Qutub Shahi period, a history of Anaesthesia and Hyderabad Chloroform Commission, list of Arabic, Persian and Urdu Medical Manuscripts, growth of the hospital system in Hyderabad and many more topics, providing readers with insights into Hyderabad's rich medical heritage.",

        "text": "Survey to Identify High-Risk Areas; Will Run from October 21 to November 21\n\nIn response to the rising incidents of landslides and land subsidence in Himachal Pradesh\u2019s capital, Shimla, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) is set to launch a drone-based LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) survey. This survey, which will run from October 21 to November 21, aims to thoroughly assess the city\u2019s geographical conditions and identify areas most vulnerable to landslides. The initiative comes at the recommendation of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), reflecting growing concern over Shimla\u2019s environmental stability.\n\nTo ensure the smooth operation of the survey, necessary formalities for drone usage in Shimla\u2019s no-fly zones have been completed, and permission has been granted for areas under the army\u2019s control. A consultancy firm has been tasked with carrying out the LIDAR survey and is expected to submit its comprehensive report by November 21.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Anupam Kashyap emphasized the importance of this initiative, noting that the survey\u2019s primary goal is to accurately assess the instability of Shimla\u2019s terrain and prepare for future risks. \u201cThis survey will not only enhance the safety of Shimla\u2019s residents but will also contribute to the city\u2019s infrastructure development,\u201d he added.\n\nHow the Survey Will Work\n\nThe LIDAR technology used in this survey will create a detailed 3D image of Shimla\u2019s geographical features through laser pulses emitted from drones. These pulses reflect off the ground and return to sensors, providing precise data on the depth, height, and surface of the terrain. This information will be critical in identifying areas prone to landslides and will help pinpoint the underlying causes of these dangerous incidents. With this knowledge, the SDMA hopes to implement effective preventive measures to minimize future risks.\n\nLandslides: A Growing Threat in Shimla\n\nShimla has seen a sharp increase in landslides over the past few years, particularly during the monsoon season, when heavy rains destabilize the already fragile terrain. These landslides have led to widespread destruction, including blocked roads, damaged homes, and the displacement of numerous families. Experts attribute the worsening situation to unchecked construction on the hills and environmental imbalances, further straining the city\u2019s stability.\n\nThe implementation of drone-based LIDAR technology is expected to be a game-changer in tackling Shimla\u2019s landslide crisis. By enabling a more accurate understanding of the city\u2019s topography and vulnerabilities, authorities will be better equipped to devise sustainable solutions to mitigate the impact of landslides. With the increasing threat of climate change and urban expansion, such advanced technological interventions are becoming essential in ensuring the safety and long-term sustainability of hill cities like Shimla.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Pakistan\u2019s young fast bowler Ihsanullah sparked debate with his recent statement on the Public Digital News podcast, where he claimed that Naseem Shah is a better bowler than India\u2019s star pacer Jasprit Bumrah. He remarked, \u201cAgar dekha jaaye toh Jasprit Bhumrah se accha bowler Naseem Shah hai (If you look at it, Naseem Shah is a better bowler than Jasprit Bumrah).\u201dWhen the host countered Ihsanullah by pointing out that Bumrah\u2019s performances have been superior on paper, the young bowler remained steadfast. The 22-year-old pacer defended his stance, saying, \u201cNaseem Shah also performed well in the 2022 World Cup. Sometimes players can go through a rough patch for a year, but Naseem is still better.\u201dWatch:\u2014 Varungiri0 (@Varungiri0) This bold statement comes amid comparisons between two of the most talented pacers in world cricket today. Bumrah, known for his pinpoint yorkers and ability to thrive under pressure, has been a vital asset for India across formats. Naseem Shah, on the other hand, has showcased his raw pace and swing, becoming a key figure for Pakistan at a very young age.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyghnymvkF8&pp=ygULSWhzYW4gVWxsYWg%3DInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time Pakistani players have preferred Naseem Shah over Bumrah. In an earlier podcast appearance, former Pakistan captain Babar Azam was asked whom he would trust for the final over in a high-pressure T20 match with 10 runs to defend. Without hesitation, Babar replied, \u201cNaseem Shah.\u201d Bumrah\u2019s track record, however, speaks for itself. In the 2024 T20 World Cup, he finished as the third-highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets and was named Player of the Tournament for title-winning Team India. His brilliant two-wicket haul in the final helped India defeat South Africa, securing their first major ICC trophy in 11 years.",

        "text": "Mumbai City FC grabbed their first victory of the Indian Super League 2024-25 season with a 2-1 win in a closely-fought encounter against FC Goa at the Fatorda Stadium on Saturday. \n\nThe Islanders extended their unbeaten streak to 13 games against the Gaurs to reaffirm their upper hand in the recent history of the fixture. Two strikes in the first half from Nikalos Karelis and Yoell van Niff were sufficient for the Islanders with Armando Sadiku spot-kick ending up as a consolation goal for the home side.\n\nMidfielder Van Nieff was the best player on the pitch as he repeatedly penetrated the hosts\u2019 well-organised defence with his range of passing. Hmingthanmawia Ralte, commonly known as Valpuia, was an energetic presence for Mumbai City FC and it was he who earned a free-kick for them from the right flank in the 21st minute that led to the Karelis' opener.\n\nVan Nieff stepped up on the set-piece and delivered a perfectly dipping curled ball inside the box that met an onrushing Nikolaos Karelis at the centre of the 18-yard area. Karelis thundered the ball into the back of the net through his head, getting the Islanders an important lead in the contest. \n\nSeven minutes later, former Mumbai City FC midfielder Rowllin Borges came close to helping Sadiku secure the equaliser for FC Goa. Now with the Gaurs, Borges squared up a pass to Sadiku from the right flank, and the striker twice attempted to score but to no avail.\n\nVan Nieff ensured to capitalise on a moment in the 40th minute, driving an attack forward with his sheer pace and trickery on the ball. He dazzled ahead from the middle, but instead of taking the passing route, the 31-year-old opted to test his fortunes from distance. The ball landed into the bottom left corner and helped Mumbai City FC head into the half-time break with a comfortable two-goal lead.\n\nIn the second half, Valpuia committed a foul on Sadiku inside the 18-yard box in the 54th minute. He was shown a yellow card for the same and Sadiku made sure that he didn\u2019t fluff this time, hammering the ball into the top right corner a minute later to give FC Goa a sneak back into the proceedings. \n\nMumbai City FC held their nerves impressively thereafter though, as FC Goa could not turn the tides despite coach Manolo Marquez making some inspired substitutions with Dejan Drazic and Nim Dorjee coming on late into the game",

It was a tight start, with both teams wrestling for the authority in midfield. However, the first chance fell to Maclaren in the 18th minute when Greg Stewart found the Australian with a beautiful cross. \n\nHowever, Prabhsukhan Gill brilliantly denied Maclaren from point-blank range. A minute later, Mohun Bagan Super Giant had the ball in the back of the net from a corner but the goal was chalked off as Manvir Singh was flagged offside.\n\nDespite the frustration, the Mariners maintained a high momentum and tested the Red and Gold Brigade with a barrage of attacks. In the 25th minute, they came close to scoring when Stewart found Manvir in the box. The Indian forward tested Gill with a telling header but once again the East Bengal custodian stood up to the task.\n\nTheir relentless attacks finally bore fruit in the 41st minute when Manvir Singh with a sensational cross, found Maclaren in space. The Australian tucked it past Gill to hand Mohun Bagan Super Giant the lead.\n\nThe second half saw more of the same as Mohun Bagan Super Giant enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also had more teeth in their attacking moves. In the 59th minute, the Mariners had a brilliant chance to double their lead when Liston Colaco found space on the right flank. He started a vicious counter-attack but he decided to pull the trigger from long range due to lack of support in the penalty area. His effort didn\u2019t have enough venom to beat Gill under the sticks.\n\nLooking at East Bengal FC\u2019s situation in attack, head coach Oscar Bruzon turned to star forward Dimitrios Diamantakos to add more panache upfront. The new tactician also brought on youngsters like Jesin TK, Lalchungnunga and Sayan Banerjee to add more energy. Reacting to East Bengal\u2019s changes, Jose Molina also turned to Dimitrios Petratos.\n\nThe 31-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint his fans as he earned a crucial penalty in the 89th minute following a reckless tackle from Gill. Petratos made no mistake from the spot to double the lead for the Mariners. Eventually, the two goals were enough for Molina\u2019s men to hold the fort for the last few minutes.",

        "text": "Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior's goals earned Real Madrid an entertaining 2-1 win at Celta Vigo on Saturday to pull them level with La Liga leaders Barcelona. France striker Mbappe started and sent the Spanish champions ahead amid reports he is being investigated for an alleged rape during a visit to Sweden. The 25-year-old was criticised in his homeland for not appearing in his country's recent Nations League matches before the Swedish media reports emerged following his trip during the international break, which Mbappe labelled \"fake news\".\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Williot Swedberg levelled for Celta, who might have snatched a draw, but Vinicius tucked home what proved Madrid's winner after 66 minutes.Madrid, unbeaten in 42 La Liga matches, host Barcelona next weekend in the Clasico, after the Catalans welcome Sevilla on Sunday.\"I'm happy because we won after the international break which is not always easy,\" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told Real Madrid TV.\"When they equalised our changes gave new energy to the team and it was a very important win.\"(Mbappe and Vinicius) trained very well in the break, improved their conditions, and they started today's game very well and they have to continue.\"With captain Dani Carvajal sidelined for months to come, Ancelotti replaced the Spanish right-back with Lucas Vazquez.The Italian set up with a three centre-back system, breaking away from his favoured four-man defensive line to accomodate Vazquez as a wing-back.Celta Vigo midfielder Swedberg missed a fine opening in the first half with Thibaut Courtois tipping his effort wide when the Swede ran through on goal.Madrid's new look defence gave Celta plenty of breathing room in attack but the visitors also looked dangerous at the other end, without carving out clear-cut chances.Mbappe slammed Madrid ahead with a long-range effort, which flew into the top corner after Fran Beltran gave the ball away and Eduardo Camavinga laid it off to the striker.It was the forward's first strike from outside the area for Madrid, his sixth league goal and his eighth in 12 appearances across all competitions since joining from Paris Saint-Germain this summer.Celta striker Borja Iglesias rolled home from an offside position as Claudio Giraldez's mid-table side searched for an equaliser.It was a scrappy yet lively clash and Vinicius headed over Fede Valverde's cross and fired a near post effort off-target before the break.Swedberg pulled Celta level with a calm finish in the 51st minute after a fine move from the Galicians, with former Barcelona defender Oscar Mingueza curling in a low cross for the midfielder to stroke home.Vinicius had a goal ruled out for offside against Mbappe in the build-up as the second half continued with the same openness as the first.'A top professional'Javier Manquillo made a brave block to deny Mbappe before Ancelotti sent on veteran midfielder Luka Modric to try and regain control of the match.The 39-year-old Croatian, who became Real Madrid's oldest ever player ahead of 1950s and 1960s Hungarian great Ferenc Puskas, made an instant impact.Less than three minutes after coming on, Modric produced a superb low pass to play in Vinicius, who slid Madrid in front past Vicente Guaita.\"It's a pleasure to coach Modric, to work with him, everything he's been able to achieve and is achieving, he deserves -- he's a top professional and a great guy,\" said Ancelotti.Courtois thwarted Jonathan Bamba after the midfielder darted in behind Antonio Rudiger and tried to prod home.Celta substitute Anastasios Douvikas should have levelled in stoppage time but rolled wide with just Courtois to beat.\"It's bittersweet because we went toe-to-toe with Real Madrid and we were better for much of the game, but we're left with the feeling once more that for our mistakes we let in two goals,\" said Celta midfielder Beltran.\"It would be easy to say 'this is Real Madrid', but (our) team was better... we lost three points, but I think we played a very good game.\"Earlier, Athletic Bilbao moved provisionally fourth by thumping Espanyol 4-1.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "A new champion will emerge in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium, as South Africa and New Zealand face off in the final.Both teams have exceeded expectations to reach this stage, demonstrating resilience, skill, and determination throughout the tournament.South Africa, runners-up in the 2023 edition, are aiming to go one step further and lift the coveted trophy. Meanwhile, New Zealand, who were runners-up in both 2009 and 2010, are equally determined to break their finals curse and claim their first T20 World Cup title.Both sides have been exceptional during the tournament, and the final promises an exciting clash between two teams eager to secure their maiden T20 World Cup crown.If the rest of the tournament is any indication, cricket fans are in for a thrilling conclusion.Full of twists and turns, the tournament\u2019s bragging rights and trophy will once again head south of the equator\u2013this time to either South Africa or New Zealand\u2013after the Proteas\u2019 emphatic win over defending champions Australia.On the other side of the draw, New Zealand made headlines by thrashing India in their opening match and holding their nerve in a semi-final win over the West Indies.New Zealand are looking to claim their second ICC trophy, their first being the ICC Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup in 2000. South Africa, on the other hand, are hoping to break their title drought and secure their first-ever ICC trophy.Reflecting on the potential victory, Chloe Tryon said, as quoted by the ICC, \u201cIt would mean so much. We\u2019ve had incredible support back home, and we really want to unite the country. We wish the whole nation could be here with us, but we\u2019ve got plenty of South Africans cheering us on from the stands. Honestly, I don\u2019t think words can describe how much it would mean to us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re playing for everyone\u2013our families, friends, and all those back home gathering in different places to watch and support us. It would be such a special moment. Hopefully, we can make it happen on Sunday,\u201d she added.Suzie Bates also reflected on the significance of winning, saying, \u201cTo be honest, ever since 2009, as a cricketer, when you play team sports, your ultimate goal is to be a world champion. I think all those tournaments have motivated me, and I know they\u2019ve motivated Sophie as well. Some of the younger girls, fortunately or unfortunately, don\u2019t have that same extra motivation.\u201d\u201cBut yes, it feels like everything has built up to this moment, and we get one more opportunity tomorrow to have a good game. The most overwhelming thing is that it\u2019s felt like a really long journey to get back to this point,\u201d Bates added.Squads:South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe TryonNew Zealand: Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.

        "title": "The storm that wasn\u2019t: how Chennai fared",
        "text": "When this year\u2019s first rain spell of northeast monsoon arrived with a downpour a few days ago, scenes of inundation from previous years were indeed repeated. But many areas of the city recovered within a day, partly because of the concerted efforts and immediate preparation of Tamil Nadu government agencies to face extreme situations and weather warning, and also because the rain stopped earlier than expected.\n\nAlso Read: In Pictures | Aftermath of Tamil Nadu rains\n\nSeeking lessons from last year\u2019s Cyclone Michaung that spelled disaster, the government had prepared for disaster management and planned for flood-relief and rescue operations. About 300 flood-relief centres were opened and food was distributed through 98 community kitchens. The field reviews by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, Ministers and officials helped accelerate flood-management work in different parts of the city.\n\nAlso Read: How Cyclone Michaung formed, intensified, rained, and dissipated | Explained\n\nSanitation workers and Greater Chennai Corporation workers persevered round the clock, bailing out stagnant water with heavy-duty pumps and clearing garbage and sewage. The appointment of nodal officers to coordinate among agencies helped to monitor the work.\n\nAlert downgraded\n\nAlthough Chennai recorded an average rainfall of 13 cm-14 cm on October 15, parts of the city and those on the fringes received more than 20 cm. Cholavaram, with the heaviest rainfall of 30 cm, Red Hills with 28 cm, and Avadi with 25 cm, bore the brunt. In contrast to the extreme weather event predicted for over two days when the Regional Meteorological Centre issued a red alert, rainfall ceased on October 16 as the depression changed its trajectory and weakened. S. Balachandran, Additional Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said, \u201cThere is no perfect forecasting system, and not all systems are fully understood. Each depression behaves differently due to thermodynamical conditions. When the system was in the ocean, there was a risk involved; which is why, we issued the alert. It was to caution people not to panic. Understanding weather systems is a continuous process.\u201d\n\nWeather experts suggested that extension agents be trained in assisting disaster management agencies in translating forecasts into alerts. Raghu Murtugudde, professor at IIT Bombay, said, \u201cThe extension agents will be experts in communicating the alerts in regional languages and guiding people to appropriate actions. There are some systematic biases in extreme rainfall predictions since the tropical systems explode rapidly and are hard to predict.\u201d\n\nThe Chennai Corporation estimated that about 540 localities reported waterlogging, including TNHB Colony at Korattur, Venus Colony at Alwarpet, and G.K.M. Colony at Kolathur. Korattur and Red Hills were among the worst-affected places, where localities were marooned well after the rainfall abated. People had to be rescued in boats at Korattur and drones were deployed to deliver relief materials to residents of Kumaran Colony at Red Hills. Water receded quickly in many inundated areas of south Chennai by the morning of October 16. Geeta Padmanabhan of Thiruvanmiyur said that while a few avenues escaped as drains were desilted, residents had to endure water stagnation for two days in areas like Kamaraj Nagar as the storm-water drain was not desilted.\n\nIn areas around Old Mahabalipuram Road, which get engulfed in water every monsoon, residents like Raj Natarajan of Semmencheri expressed concerns over recurrence of waterlogging in some areas unless Okkiyum Maduvu and the marsh opposite the ELCOT SEZ are cleaned. But it was also true that areas prone to flooding showed visible changes following interventions. The interventions and infrastructure improvements since last year did bring about a change in areas including parts of Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Tansi Nagar, S.V.S. Nagar at Valasaravakkam, Porur junction, Poonamallee High Road near St. Andrew\u2019s Church, and Narayanapuram.\n\nAlso Read: Chennai Rains: Volunteers for the season\n\nExtensive desilting of storm-water drains and construction of a new drain network to a distance of 785 km, out of the planned 1,135 km across the city, have made the difference this time, say Corporation officials. The reconstruction of the Thanikachalam Nagar drain, which was in a shambles for years, seems to have resolved the recurrent issues of flooding at Kolathur and Madhavaram. The storm-water drain built by the Highways Department helped 12 stagnation points on the East Coast Road.\n\nHiccups persist\n\nHowever, there were hiccups in terms of the tardy implementation of the storm-water drain and flood-mitigation projects, missing and incomplete links in the drains, and lack of connectivity between the drains and the water channels. A delay in getting approval from the Highways Department held up the construction of a channel linking the Narayanapuram lake to the Pallikaranai marsh through the 200-Feet Radial Road. The Chennai Corporation has identified nearly 50 locations, including Vembuliamman Koil Street at K.K.Nagar, for gaps in the drain network.\n\nThe Metro Rail construction poses a major challenge this monsoon. It has aggravated the waterlogging in south Chennai where residents say the drains get clogged by debris. Nearly 22 locations in the vicinity of the Metro Rail construction sites in various zones were flooded. For instance, the Corporation installed 19 pumps to bail out water from Millers Road and Purasawalkam High Road, but water drained only after a few days. \u201cWorkers dump debris clogging the drains. They are unaware of the consequences. Excavation at the construction site takes away road space and obstructs the natural flow of water,\u201d says a source at Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). The situation remains grim in some localities of north Chennai that stare at imminent waterlogging owing to incomplete civic projects. Pulianthope, Pattalam, Perambur, Choolai, and Vyasarpadi, which have faced inundation for years, remained flooded even after the rain stopped on October 16.\n\nDevelopment projects executed at Madipakkam, another flood-prone area, had open ends, making the locality vulnerable to inundation. Kuberan Nagar Extension, Ram Nagar South Extension, LIC Nagar, and Govindasamy Nagar were affected, owing to incomplete road projects and storm-water drains and the absence of link to waterways. P. Saravana Kumar, founder of Madipakkam Social Service Trust, points out that rain in the days to come would determine the impact of the storm-water drain. The surplus water channel from the Keelkattalai lake needs to be improved to end flooding at Madipakkam.\n\nHowever, Corporation officials say that compared with last year, water stagnation has come down at Madipakkam after the storm-water drain was built and roads were restored. A few streets suffered from minor issues. Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Works) V. Sivakrishnamurthy says the work to prevent inundation near the Ganesapuram subway in north Chennai will be completed in a few weeks as Southern Railway has agreed to permit line block to build a culvert beneath the tracks.\n\nIn neighbouring Tiruvallur district, which was battered by massive rain, officials of the rank of Deputy Collector supervised the work in taluks and ensured better coordination. \u201cWe have no control over water release as the Araniyar and Kosasthalaiyar originate in Andhra Pradesh. This time, we got live updates from Andhra Pradesh through our engineers,\u201d says Collector T. Prabhushankar.\n\nThe space for buffer storage in major reservoirs saved the city from riverine flooding this time and the rivers\u2019 capacity has been improved by 30%. The projects implemented by the Water Resources Department (WRD) to improve major waterways and surplus courses and the controlled water release from the lakes instilled confidence in officials of managing a rainfall of up to 30 cm-40 cm. The department implemented additional projects costing Rs. 2.30 crore to desilt the major waterways. However, Virugambakkam and Anna Nagar residents point to the insufficient carrying capacity of canals, including Virugambakkam-Arumbakkam canal and Otteri Nullah, and lack of desilting. They flag the risk of floodwater spillover and malfunctioning of the drain network during the rain.\n\nPermanent solution?\n\nThe government had been preparing for three months to tackle the monsoon, said Mr. Stalin. He also said a permanent solution to water stagnation would be found soon. The pending projects, based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee for Mitigation and Management of Flood Risk in the Chennai Metropolitan Area, led by former IAS official V. Thiruppugazh, would be finished soon.\n\nMayor R. Priya said, \u201cWe shortlisted the issues faced last year, constituency-wise, and started sorting them out since July. We had plans for 35 low-level areas and installed 100-HP motors in flood-prone locations. A coordination committee was formed to address issues of waterlogging where the Metro Rail project is in progress.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are working to remove the floating garbage from the canals and clean the silt catch pits. We are planning to resolve issues in areas where we have faced problems so far this year.\u201d\n\nTwo government agencies that managed to function almost seamlessly were Chennai Metrowater and Tangedco. Power shutdown was averted except at a few places like west Velachery and T. Nagar where water stagnation on roads and leakage of underground cables resulted in the outages. The sewers carried nearly 953 million litres of sewage on October 15, as against the daily load of 650 million litres. Additional sewer equipment, replacement of sewers in vulnerable locations, and monitoring of leaks through the GIS command centre helped the water agency.\n\nSources in the WRD note that unless the 29 macro drains, including Otteri Nullah, Veerangal Odai, and Captain Cotton Canal, are made free of encroachments and desilted, the scope of flood control will be limited. A wholistic, long-term flood management plan for the entire Chennai Metropolitan Area, instead of Chennai in isolation, would make the city flood-proof. The government must frame a policy to freeze development near waterbodies and waterways.\n\nExperts say the city is not fully prepared for flood management and mitigation. Chennai is largely involved in firefighting rather than finding comprehensive solutions for urban flood resilience. S. Thirunavukkarasu, former Public Works Department official who specialises in hydraulics and hydrology, says, \u201cWhat we are doing now, including construction of storm-water drains, is crisis management. We need to find the root cause of flooding in each watercourse. A comprehensive policy for restoration of waterbodies, with stringent strategies to increase storage to match their annual run-off, and re-establishing the missing links is needed.\u201d Deepening waterbodies would be one of the strategies to shield Chennai from floods and droughts, he adds.\n\n(With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez, Sunitha Sekar, R.

        "summary": "The first \u2018storm\u2019 this monsoon season, for a variety of reasons, did not drown the city as it was feared. The primary reason was that the actual forecast was off the mark, the low pressurein the Bay of Bengal did two things \u2014 it veered off course and lost power, stopping short of the pounding rain forecast. Further, work in terms of building storm-water networks within the city, the constant presence of Ministers and officials overseeing relief work on the ground, and the partnership with a vast network of civic volunteers, all influenced the outcome positively. However, some areas still struggled with water stagnation for a couple of days at least even after the rain ceased. K. Lakshmi finds out more.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has consistently expressed his deep love for Test cricket, which he views as the pinnacle of the sport. Throughout his career, Kohli has often spoken about the unique challenges that the longest format of the game presents, emphasizing that it tests a player's character, mental strength, and skill across different conditions. What adds to Kohli's superstar aura is his energetic and passionate interaction with crowds during matches. One of his signature gestures on the field is when he turns toward the stands and pumps up the crowd, urging them to cheer louder. This act of rallying the crowd is typical of Kohli's aggressive and enthusiastic approach to the game, whether he's batting, fielding, or captaining. It shows his deep connection with fans and his ability to channel the energy of the crowd into his own performance and that of the team.And when that crowd belongs to his IPL team RCB, then they will surely respond to Virat's calls.With India needing quick wickets in a bid to defend a low score of 107 against New Zealand on Day 5, Virat, standing in the slips urged the crowd to make some more noise.A clip of the moment was shared by the official broadcaster:\u2014 JioCinema (@JioCinema) Kohli often makes this gesture during pivotal moments in matches, especially in high-pressure situations. Whether it's urging support during a crucial partnership, celebrating a key wicket, or raising the energy during tense periods, Kohli's ability to involve the fans plays a significant role in creating an intense atmosphere. His charisma and emotional expressions on the field not only lift the morale of the team but also amplify the excitement in the stadium.This crowd interaction is one of the many reasons Kohli has such a strong bond with Indian cricket fans, who see him as not just a player but a passionate leader who thrives on the collective energy of the team and the spectators.",

        "text": "New Zealand survived a hostile Jasprit Bumrah spell to foil India's attempt to add a final-day twist to an absorbing series-opener, slaying the cricketing giants at home by eight wickets and ending a 36-year long wait to taste Test success in the country, here Sunday This is Kiwis' first Test win on the Indian soil after the John Wright-led outfit towelled India by 136 runs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, way back in 1988. Even hunting a modest 107 on the fifth day against a world-class attack could be nervy, and New Zealand did that after some initial scares. Will Young (48 not out) and Rachin Ravindra (39 not out) fuelled their chase with a 75-run stand for the third wicket, handholding their side a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");However, the Indians will not be an entirely despondent lot despite the defeat as they showed admirable spunk to claw back from the depths of getting bowled out for 46 in the first innings.They will need to build on it and pretty quickly too as the second Test at Pune starts on October 24.The Rohit Sharma-marshalled side will also have to think deeply about retaining Sarfaraz Khan, who made a 150 in the second dig, as Shubman Gill is poised to return after recovering from a stiff neck.The other point they will moot long is whether to go back to the three-pacer strategy or continue three spinners, a move which backfired here spectacularly, in Pune.New Zealand victory did not come without its share of drama once the day's play started at 10.15am, a wet outfield pushing back the proceedings by an hour.Bumrah (2/29), operating from the dressing room end, found appreciable movement and Tom Latham fell in the first over of the day itself for his overnight naught.Latham was behind the ball to cover the in-dipper but it swung back further to thud on to his pads as umpire Michael Gough raised his finger after vociferous appeal from the bowler and the crowd.The New Zealand captain reviewed the decision more in hope than in conviction and the DRS confirmed his worst fears as well, and he had to walk back.India might just have felt the absence of a third pacer as both Bumrah and Siraj found movement and carry to trouble the Kiwi batters under a largely overcast skies.Kuldeep Yadav, who gave away 26 runs in three overs, had replaced Akash Deep in the eleven for this Test after India went with a three-pronged pace attack against Bangladesh recently.Devon Conway, the other overnight batter, was shaky throughout his stay and would consider himself fortunate to have found a last-minute edge on a Bumrah skidder that otherwise would have trapped him plumb in front.But as luck would have it, the ball beat the gully fielder and raced to the fence.However, the left-hander eventually reached the road's end when Bumrah, operating from around the stumps, caught him right in front of the wicket with another one that skidded and swung back into him.The on-field umpire did not relent but the DRS upheld India's appeal to send Conway (17) back.New Zealand were 35 for two at that point, and one would say the match in balance as a couple of more strikes could have left the cat among the pigeons.But Young and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, found some solidity to resist the Indian charge.Once the sun came out for a while, the ball-movement was much more predictable and the Kiwi batters used favourable conditions to rack in a few boundaries to ease the pressure.Ravindra Jadeja, who started with a no-ball, too did not make much of an impression, conceding 14 runs in his first two overs.There was not much on the Chinnaswamy pitch for him to exploit either as the 22-yard track did not disintegrate on the final day, courtesy rain and cooler climes here.With the margin getting reduced alongside each run, the New Zealand batters became more daring and brought out their shots from the shelf, such as a clean hoist over mid-wicket for a six off left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep.The defining moment came when Will Young turned Jadeja for two to collect the winning runs as Kiwis dressing room turned into a hub of celebration.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Under overcast skies, the ball seamed around appreciably, Jasprit Bumrah threatened to pick a wicket every second delivery, and the crowd appealed almost every ball, but New Zealand absorbed it all to ease their way to the target of 107 once things settled down a touch.Will Young was the calming influence after Bumrah got Tom Latham second ball of the day, but Devon Conway did his bit - jumping around, wearing blows on the body, but not playing loose shots. By the time Bumrah finally got Conway for 17 off 39 balls, he was at the fag end of his spell and New Zealand had got 35 on the board already. The fielders did their bit, having saved at least 11 runs by then.Thereupon, though, India's misreading of the pitch came back to hurt them. They didn't have a third seamer to use the conditions, and Young and Rachin Ravindra knocked off the remaining runs with relative ease.While Bumrah bowled, though, you struggled to see where the next run would come from. He drew 22 false shots in eight overs, consistently drawing movement off the surface. Latham might have thought he had the accurate inswinger covered, but the ball pitched and nipped in even further to get him. Conway thought he had the angle covered from around the wicket, but this one swung after pitching, beginning to change its path halfway between pitching and reaching Conway, beating the outside edge and trapping him in front.Bumrah was in his seventh over now, and Ravindra, the first-innings centurion, all but sealed the deal when he got two boundaries off the first three balls he faced. He steered the first one behind square, and then got the rare loose ball from Bumrah - a full one on the pads.Young then paddled and punched Ravindra Jadeja for boundaries in his first over to get the package ready. Not trusting the Bengaluru weather to hold up after lunch, the two batters attacked the spinners to put a nice little bow on the top. Young's drop-kicked six off Kuldeep Yadav was even Mark Waugh-like.India made a remarkable comeback from being bowled out for 46 in the first innings, but in the end, New Zealand hung in long enough to seal only their third Test win in India.\r\n\r\nSource link",

We knew what lies ahead, get as many as possible. A couple of guys stood out, was great to watch. When you're 350 behind, you can't think too much.

Both teams have surpassed expectations, displaying resilience, skill, and determination throughout the tournament.Bates, Devine, and Tahuhu collectively boast an impressive 402 Women\u2019s T20I appearances between them.Moments after New Zealand\u2019s stunning win over West Indies in the semi-finals of the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024, there was a heartwarming moment as three of New Zealand\u2019s most experienced players embraced and posed for the cameras.\u201cWe are the grandmas of the team,\u201d Bates remarked a day ahead of the final, referring to herself, Sophie Devine, and Lea Tahuhu, as quoted by the ICC.\u201cWe are still standing, I think.

Bates delivered the final over, with 14 runs to defend, after contributing a crucial knock at the top of the order, while Tahuhu claimed the vital wicket of Hayley Matthews when the match was on a knife-edge.Devine, as captain, has been outstanding and will step down from the role after the tournament, hoping to sign off on Sunday with the trophy in hand.\u201cI think she has been absolutely brilliant in her captaincy,\u201d Bates said.\u201cShe\u2019s been so calm.

It\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s stepping down, but thankfully it\u2019s just as captain,\u201d she added.A title win would not only be a fantastic way for the trio to cap off a successful tournament, but it would also send an inspiring message to women in their 30s, says Bates, who is set to become the most-capped player in women\u2019s international cricket.\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m over 35 and still competing, and that I\u2019ve never given up on my dream, I think, sends a message. As women, there\u2019s often societal pressure to give up on pursuing your dreams,\u201d Bates said.\u201cPeople expect you to do other things at a certain age, and that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about women\u2019s sport\u2013it\u2019s growing every day, breaking down barriers. It\u2019s not just young players; we have players in our team returning after having children,\u201d she concluded.Sunday\u2019s final is scheduled for 18:00 local time at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

        "text": "Fort Lauderdale: Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will feature in next year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced on Saturday. Messi and his team-mates will kick-off the tournament in the opening game at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, on Sunday, June 15, Infantino added. The FIFA president was speaking on the field at Inter's Chase Stadium moments after Messi scored a hat-trick as the team broke the MLS regular season points record with a 6-2 win over the New England Revolution. Miami, who this month won Major League Soccer's Supporters' Shield for the best regular season record, will take the qualification slot designated for the host nation. \"Inter Miami qualifies as the host country representative team on the basis of the club's outstanding and consistent 34-match campaign that saw them secure the shield with two MLS matches to play,\" FIFA said in a statement. The official champions of MLS are determined by the MLS Cup playoffs which begin next week and conclude with the final on December 7. Miami are the favourites to win the playoffs but the FIFA decision to select the regular season winners ensures the involvement of the Argentine superstar. The participation of the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi is a much-needed boost to the profile of the new-look tournament, which FIFA hope will capture the imagination of the global television audience as well as fans in the United States ahead of the World Cup in 2026. The competition could pit Messi against top European club opposition for the first time since he left Paris Saint Germain last year to move to Miami. The 32-team tournament will feature title winning teams from each of FIFA's continental confederations. Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich are among the 12 European teams who have qualified for the tournament while Argentina's River Plate and Boca Juniors and Brazil's Flamengo are among six South American teams. FIFA has yet to announce any broadcast deals or sponsorship contracts for the tournament and the competition has faced some opposition within the game. Players union FIFpro and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar. Opponents of the new tournament have said it adds further congestion to an already crowded schedule and increases the workload of players. The last version of the Club World Cup featured seven teams in a knockout format and was won by Manchester City who beat Brazil's Fluminense in the final in Saudi Arabia. FIFA plan to hold the expanded tournament every four years although no host as yet to be chosen for the 2029 edition.",

With Steve Smith returning to number four after a mixed outing as an opener and all-rounder Cameron Green ruled out of the Test summer due to back issues for which he has opted to undergo a surgery, Australia could see a new opening partner for Usman Khawaja, be it Head or all-rounder Mitchell Marsh from within the team or anyone from trio of Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw, who have been scoring well in domestic cricket. Speaking as quoted by cricket.com.au Head said, \u201cI think it is going to be an old-fashioned bat-off (the BGT series) and I am looking forward to seeing what everyone thinks over the next couple of weeks. From my side of things, I have got no favourite position. I have only got a position that is best for the team and what the team needs from me. I could not care less if I bat (anywhere) from one to seven, if I bat at nine, I do not care. I have said that in the past, I just want to play in the Australian cricket team and any position in the Australian cricket team you take.\u201dHead is one of the contenders to take the opening spot due to the success he has witnessed as one in white-ball cricket. His opening contributions in Tests have been decent, making 223 runs in five Tests and five innings with a fifty to his name. With Head set to miss the upcoming ODI series of three matches against Pakistan starting from November 4 due to paternity leave, Head said that he will make his decisions around his family more and it is his teammates and family who drive him to play. \u201cI am not really interested in the individual stuff or where my career might go to, aspirations from an individual perspective. I want to provide for my family, I want to play with my mates and I want to enjoy what I am doing. I think I have done that really well over the last couple of years,\u201d Head concluded.

        "text": "Hyderabad: Fernandez Hospital Educational and Research Foundation organised a symposium on advanced gynaecological ultrasound titled \u201cUltrasonography of the Adnexa and Endometrium: Optimising Diagnosis in Everyday Practice\u201d on Sunday.The event was facilitated by Dr Mala Sibal, a renowned expert in gynaecological ultrasound, and focused on how modern ultrasound techniques are transforming the diagnosis and treatment of gynaecological conditions. Over 200 practising gynaecologists, radiologists, pathologists, postgraduates in obstetrics and gynaecology, and trainees in gynaecological ultrasound attended the symposium from across India.Ultrasound plays a critical role in identifying and managing a wide range of conditions, including gynaecological cancers. By using high-resolution imaging, doctors can accurately detect abnormalities in the reproductive system, such as ovarian cysts or growths in the uterus, which may indicate early signs of cancer. This early detection is crucial because it allows for timely intervention, significantly improving patient outcomes.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mala Sibal said, \u201cUltrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice in gynaecology, including detecting gynaecological cancers. Despite advances in ultrasound technology, emerging literature in the field, and the tremendous impact of accurate and early diagnosis on appropriate medical management, quality ultrasound services are still scarce in many parts of the world. There is significant potential for its expanded use in improving women's healthcare both nationally and globally\u2014 a goal that can be achieved through dedicated teaching, training, and knowledge sharing, which was the key objectives of today\u2019s symposium.\u201dThe symposium highlighted the importance of using ultrasound to differentiate between benign and malignant growths. Specialists discussed how specific markers, visible on ultrasounds, can indicate whether a mass is likely to be cancerous. This level of detail helps doctors make faster, more accurate diagnoses, reducing the need for more invasive procedures.",

Meanwhile, uncertainty continues to loom over MS Dhoni's involvement in the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL) with the Chennai Super Kings. Concerns over Dhoni's participation remain due to his age, knee injury and being tight-lipped about his possible plans of retirement after CSK suffered an exit in the group stage. There has been no word in the rumour mill about Dhoni still wanting to compete in the top T20 league.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Top former and current stars have shown their class in the T10 format, including former Australia star David Warner.With the likes of former India stars including Robin Uthappa, Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan and many more, taking part in the different T10 leagues, the prospect of seeing Dhoni in the format remains a possibility.\"Absolutely, I think outside of the top level of international cricketers playing, current India internationals are not allowed to play outside of the Indian Premier League. The recently retired players, almost all the big names of India, have come to play T10. So yes, we can expect MS Dhoni to be playing T10 when he makes up his mind,\" Shaji told ANI.The ten franchises, including the two new ones, Bolts Ajman and UP Nawabs, joined the other eight featuring New York Strikers, Deccan Gladiators, Northern Warriors, Morrisville Samp Army, Delhi Bulls, Bangla Tigers, Team Abu Dhabi and Chennai Brave Jaguars - to complete their rosters.A total of 179 international megastars will participate in the 2024 Abu Dhabi T10, making it the biggest season ever.Players from 11 different nations were drafted, showcasing the truly global nature of the Abu Dhabi T10. Leading the selections were 20 players from the West Indies, 17 from the UAE, 15 from Sri Lanka, and 14 from Pakistan. Afghanistan contributed 11, while nine English, five Zimbabwean, three Bangladeshi, three Australian, and two each from New Zealand and South Africa were also picked, highlighting the tournament's international appeal.Matthew Boucher, Abu Dhabi Cricket CEO, believes that the format can take off on a global level and said, \"It seems like T10 is having a fantastic couple of years.

It is apparently a tradition to do a photo ceremony on a newly-weds\u2019 first Karwa Chauth.Karwa Chauth is a Hindu festival celebrated largely by Hindu women coming from the northern and western parts of India. Most women observe a fast without consuming any food and water and the fast is mainly done to seek divine blessings for their husband\u2019s long life and prosperity.However, while the tradition initially involved just women fasting, praying for the long life of their husbands, now even the husbands fast for their wives. A newly-wed couple said, \u201cMy husband has been fasting because he believes both of us should be blessed with good health and long life. Also because he has grown up seeing his mother wait for hours together for the moon to come to break her fast, he feels fasting together will decrease the burden a bit.\u201dA 45-year-old woman put a completely different view forward. She said, \u201cAfter a certain age, ensuring that one has to do a fast despite not being in a position to, is not possible.

        "text": "Following New Zealand\u2019s historic eight-wicket win in the first Test match against India in Bengaluru, Kiwi skipper Tom Latham heaped praise on youngster Rachin Ravindra for his ability to calm the dressing room. During New Zealand\u2019s first inning, Ravindra displayed a stupendous performance. The 24-year-old played a 134-run knock from 157 balls at a strike rate of 85.35. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Latham hailed Ravindra for making a 137-run partnership with a number 9 batter Tim Southee. \u201cThe way he [Ravindra] played the situation of the game was really important for us. A 137-run partnership with a No. 9 batter is awesome. I think the way he played leading up to that [second] new ball was really important. Even this morning, the way he came out with the game in the balance where another couple of wickets there and it could have been a nervy 50-60 runs, but I think the way he calmed the dressing room with his composure out there for a young guy in his ninth or tenth Test to play in that fashion is obviously exciting,\u201d Latham was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying. The Kiwi skipper also praised pacer William O\u2019Rourke for his \u201coutstanding\u201d bowling in the Bengaluru Test.\u201cWe\u2019re blessed with a couple of guys on our side, a couple of young guys that have stepped up in this match. I think the way Will [O\u2019Rourke] bowled was outstanding, but I think I also look at the other two seamers, Tim Southee and Matt Henry, the pressure they were able to apply with that new ball on day one was outstanding. Matt got the rewards and Will got the rewards in that first innings,\u201d he added.He added that the victory over India in Bengaluru was a proud moment for the Kiwi side and they will celebrate it.\u201cIt was a combination of everything. [It is] a really special feeling to be in this position. I think the work we did in the first and second innings with the ball and then obviously with the bat, really set the game up for us. It\u2019s obviously a proud moment for this group and the one we will celebrate,\u201d he further added.Chasing a total of 107 runs, Jasprit Bumrah (2/29) showed some fight for India, but Will Young (48*) and Rachin (39*) helped the Kiwis complete a comprehensive win. Earlier, India had taken a 106-run lead in the second innings, scoring 462/10 in response to New Zealand\u2019s total of 402/10 in the first innings. Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (35 from 52 balls, with six fours) and skipper Rohit Sharma (52 from 63 balls, with eight fours and a six) gave India a solid start with a 72-run opening stand.Sarfaraz then took charge, first forming a 136-run partnership with Virat Kohli (70 from 102 balls, with eight fours and a six) and later a 177-run stand with Pant (99 from 105 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) to put India in the lead. However, the introduction of the new ball saw India lose seven wickets for just 54 runs, with the middle order failing to contribute significantly. William O\u2019Rourke (3/92) and Matt Henry (3/102) took full advantage of the new ball, dismantling the Indian batting line-up just when a massive lead seemed likely. Spinner Ajaz Patel took two wickets, while Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee chipped in with one each. In their first innings, New Zealand posted 402 in response to India\u2019s 356. A magnificent century from Rachin Ravindra (134 from 157 balls, with 13 fours and four sixes) and a quickfire 65 from Southee (73 balls, eight fours, and four sixes) helped lift New Zealand from 233/7 to 402, thanks to a 137-run stand for the eighth wicket. Devon Conway (91 from 105 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes) also made a valuable contribution at the top. Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99) bowled well for India, while Mohammed Siraj picked up two wickets, and Ravichandran Ashwin and Bumrah took one each. Earlier, after electing to bat, India had a nightmare start under overcast, pace-friendly conditions. Henry (5/15) and O\u2019Rourke (4/22) ran through the Indian batting order, bundling them out for just 46 runs in 31.2 overs. Only Jaiswal (13) and Pant (20) managed to reach double figures. (ANI)",

        "text": "Hyderabad: The Jaipur Pink Panthers and the Bengal Warriorz played out a very tightly contested and highly entertaining game at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, Gachibowli, Hyderabad. The Jaipur Pink Panthers had to work hard, and eventually managed to win the contest with a 39-34 scoreline. For the Jaipur Pink Panthers, captain Arjun Deshwal scored 15 points, while Nitin Dhankar registered 13 points of his own for the Bengal Warriorz.Fazel Atrachali and the Bengal Warriorz began the game very well, with the defensive unit working in tandem to foil a flurry of Jaipur Pink Panther attacks in the early exchanges. Both sides were patient in the first phase of play, with the Bengal Warriorz working hard to hold onto a slender lead.But at the midway stage of the first half, the Jaipur Pink Panthers captain Arjun Deshwal wrestled the momentum away from the Bengal Warriorz. Shortly after, a solid tackle by Abhijeet Malik helped inflict an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers storm into the lead. And even though the Bengal Warriorz fought hard after that, it was the Jaipur Pink Panthers who finished the first half with a 3-point lead. At the half-time break, the Jaipur Pink Panthers led 21-18.The two sides began cautiously in the second half as well as they weren\u2019t keen on conceding any ground. While Fazel Atrachali led the Bengal Warriorz defence brilliantly, Arjun Deshwal was his talismanic self for the Jaipur Pink Panthers.With just under 10 minutes left in the contest, Abhijeet Malik inflicted an ALL OUT on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers extend the lead to a 4-point one. At this point, the score read 29-25 in favour of the Jaipur Pink Panthers. It was an action-packed final phase of the game as Nitin Dhankar brought Bengal Warriorz right back into the contest. The Jaipur Pink Panthers, who seemed to be one step ahead all through up until then, were suddenly on the backfoot.But it was Abhishek KS\u2019s super tackle that sealed the contest for the Jaipur Pink Panthers, who walked off the mat with a closely contested win.",

        "text": "Following India\u2019s disappointing eight-wicket loss against New Zealand in the first Test match in Bengaluru, former cricketer Madan Lal believes that the hosts will \u201cbounce back\u201d in the three-game long-format series.Chasing a total of 107 runs, Jasprit Bumrah (2/29) showed some fight for India, but Will Young (48*) and Rachin (39*) helped the Kiwis complete a comprehensive win. Speaking to ANI, Madan Lal said that India has a strong side. However, the former cricketer also warner Rohit Sharma and said that the Kiwis are not like other teams and are a good fighter.\u201cI think the Indian Team is very very strong, but you know New Zealand is not like other teams, they are a good fighter, they always come back. They have a good bowling lineup and they have the best fielding side but now the only thing is India has to be very careful how they can manage the game and that is very important,\u201d Madan Lal told ANI.He added that now the pressure will be on the visitors to stop New Zealand from winning the remaining two Test matches of the series.\u201cYou have to go through all these things when you play a sport\u2026 when you\u2019re down by 1-0 that\u2019s the time when you have to show your character that you\u2019re the best team. I believe India will definitely bounce back\u2026 the pressure is not on India but it\u2019s on New Zealand to stop the hosts from winning the next Test match,\u201d he added.Earlier in the Bengaluru Test, India had taken a 106-run lead in the second innings, scoring 462/10 in response to New Zealand\u2019s total of 402/10 in the first innings. Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (35 from 52 balls, with six fours) and skipper Rohit Sharma (52 from 63 balls, with eight fours and a six) gave India a solid start with a 72-run opening stand.Sarfaraz then took charge, first forming a 136-run partnership with Virat Kohli (70 from 102 balls, with eight fours and a six) and later a 177-run stand with Pant (99 from 105 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) to put India in the lead. However, the introduction of the new ball saw India lose seven wickets for just 54 runs, with the middle order failing to contribute significantly. William O\u2019Rourke (3/92) and Matt Henry (3/102) took full advantage of the new ball, dismantling the Indian batting line-up just when a massive lead seemed likely. Spinner Ajaz Patel took two wickets, while Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee chipped in with one each. In their first innings, New Zealand posted 402 in response to India\u2019s 356. A magnificent century from Rachin Ravindra (134 from 157 balls, with 13 fours and four sixes) and a quickfire 65 from Southee (73 balls, eight fours, and four sixes) helped lift New Zealand from 233/7 to 402, thanks to a 137-run stand for the eighth wicket. Devon Conway (91 from 105 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes) also made a valuable contribution at the top. Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99) bowled well for India, while Mohammed Siraj picked up two wickets, and Ravichandran Ashwin and Bumrah took one each. Earlier, after electing to bat, India had a nightmare start under overcast, pace-friendly conditions. Henry (5/15) and O\u2019Rourke (4/22) ran through the Indian batting order, bundling them out for just 46 runs in 31.2 overs. Only Jaiswal (13) and Pant (20) managed to reach double figures. (ANI)",

        "text": "The Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 season will see an intriguing face-off between the in-form Jamshedpur FC (JFC) and a determined Hyderabad FC (HFC) at the JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.With Jamshedpur FC aiming to sustain their impressive start and Hyderabad FC eager to secure their first win of the season, both teams have much at stake in this anticipated clash.Both teams have plenty to fight for, with Jamshedpur FC looking to continue their strong start and Hyderabad FC hoping to turn around their season.Jamshedpur FC have been lethal in front of goal, scoring in each of their last seven ISL matches. Their current form sees them sitting on nine points after four games, their best-ever start to a season.\n\nThe Red Miners (JFC) have had the upper hand in recent meetings, winning their last three encounters against Hyderabad FC. A victory in this match would see them equal their record of four consecutive wins against any team in ISL history, matching their streak against NorthEast United FC.On the other hand, Hyderabad FC secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC, breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on this, aiming for back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023. However, their attack will need to step up as they remain winless this season.Hyderabad FC is in need of consecutive positive results to build momentum this season. After securing a draw against Chennaiyin FC, Thangboi Singto\u2019s side now has the chance to go unbeaten in back-to-back ISL matches for the first time since their four-game streak from December 2022 to February 2023.The two teams have played 10 matches against each other in the ISL. Jamshedpur FC have won five games and Hyderabad FC have emerged victorious once. Four games have resulted in a draw.Jamshedpur FC head coach Khalid Jamil acknowledged the importance of this match and also the improved strength of Hyderabad FC of late. He backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.\u201cIt is a very important game for us. We are playing in front of our home crowd. They\u2019re a good team. They\u2019re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,\u201d Jamil said in the pre-match press conference, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.Hyderabad FC tactician Thangboi Singto mentioned that the team has become better collectively in the last couple of weeks. He is hoping for that to translate into positive results on the field.\u201cThe players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,\u201d Singto said, as quoted by the ISL Media Team.\n\nJamshedpur FC\u2019s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leads the charts for producing most goal-scoring chances (9) amongst Indian players in ISL 2024-25. With all of his opportunities coming from open play, Jamil\u2019s men have never had to deal with a paucity of chances to convert upfront.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s striker Devendra Murgaonkar stands on the brink of a personal milestone as he could complete the feat of 50 ISL appearances in the coming match. His expected goal value of 0.65 is the highest amongst the team\u2019s players this season, reflecting that he\u2019s consistently at the centre of their goal-scoring endeavours.\n\nJamshedpur FC defender Stephen Eze has averaged 7.5 clearances in every appearance in ISL 2024-25. His ability to be vigilant and aware of any offensive moves transpiring in their backline and responding in a timely manner to the same has ensured that the home team has managed to have a disciplined defence.\n\nHyderabad FC\u2019s Leander D\u2019Cunha has won the possession back 5.5 times on average per match in the defensive third this season. He has single-handedly helped Hyderabad FC break plenty of attacks in the backend, and the Jamshedpur FC attacking unit will have to come up with rather unique, coordinated efforts to get past him.\n\nBoth teams will be eager for three points \u2013 Jamshedpur to solidify their top-tier form, and Hyderabad to break their winless run.",

        "text": "Dubai, Oct 20 (IANS) Clinical bowling by Amelia Kerr and Rosemary Mair helped New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs to lift their maiden title in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Stadium here on Sunday. Kerr and Mair picked three wickets each to restrict the Proteas to 126/9 in the second innings after New Zealand had posted a challenging 158/5 after they were asked to bat first in the final.\n\nNew Zealand women erased the bitter memories of the heartbreaks of their past T20 World Cup finals as they eventually triumphed in their third trip to the finals. The Proteas on the other hand have lost in the final for a second year running after having lost to Australia in the 2023 Women\u2019s T20 WC.\n\nAsked to bat first, Amelia Kerr, Brooke Halliday, and Suzi Bates helped New Zealand post 158/5 in 20 overs. Georgia Plimmer and Bates opened with a strong start, but Plimmer\u2019s attempted six off Marizanne Kapp was caught by Sune Luus. Bates soon followed, bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba. Captain Sophie Devine was removed for six after a successful review by Nadine de Klerk.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s bowlers tightened control, with no boundaries hit between overs 5.4 and 13.5. Halliday (38) broke the shackles, raised a 57-run stand with Kerr before being caught by Anneke Bosch. Kerr hit consecutive boundaries before falling in the penultimate over to Nonkululeko Mlaba, the only bowler with multiple wickets. Maddy Green\u2019s late six helped New Zealand set a 159-run target for SA.\n\nWith a massive target ahead of them and with the pressure at an absolute high, skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33) and Tazmin Brits (17), the two highest scorers of the edition, gave South Africa a great start.\n\nThe team racked up 47 runs in the powerplay and looked to build on the great start until Tazmin was dismissed by Fran Jonas in the very next over. In attempts to help her skipper continue the onslaught, Tazmin attempted to go big but a miscue of her shot saw Green take a simple catch at long on which rejuvenated the New Zealand side.\n\nThe fall of the wicket saw the Kiwis regain control of the game and built heavy pressure on their opponents in the following overs which saw the required run rate climb past nine runs an over. The ninth over saw New Zealand concede only one run and had five dot balls in the row which saw Wolvaardt try and relieve pressure on the first ball of the next over. In her attempts to take on Kerr, the South Africa skipper was caught at extra cover with Suzie taking the simple catch.\n\nThe removal of the skipper sprung life into the New Zealand bowling attack as a mini-collapse followed soon after. Kerr ended up removing Anneke Bosch (9), on the last ball of the same over in which Wolvaardt was dismissed when she missed an attempt to sweep the ball which resulted in a loud appeal that was rejected by the umpire. Upon further review, Bosch had indeed nicked the ball to reduce South Africa to 64/3 at the halfway mark.\n\nWhat followed was a mini collapse as Marizanne Kapp (8), Nadine de Klerk (6) and Sune Luus (8) fell in quick succession.\n\nKerr, who set the record for most wickets in a single edition of the women\u2019s T20 World Cup on the night, returned to take the scalp of Annerie Dercksen to further add to a historic campaign. With the game going out of South Africa\u2019s reach with each passing over, Mair struck twice in the penultimate over before Carson wrapped up the victory for New Zealand.\n\nThe Proteas once again suffered heartbreak and lost by 32 runs.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nNew Zealand 158/5 in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 43, Brooke Halliday 38, Suzie Bates 32; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2-31) beat South Africa 126/9 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 33; Amelia Kerr 3-24, Rosemary Mair 3-25) by 32 runs.",

Victory takes Liverpool one point ahead of City and four clear of Arsenal, who they face at the Emirates next weekend.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Chelsea are now seven points off the top down in sixth, but there was plenty cause for optimism for the Blues from a performance that stretched Liverpool to their limits.Liverpool's only defeat under Slot came to Nottingham Forest following September's international break.The Dutchman responded by this time leaving all of his South American internationals -- Alexis Mac Allister, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez -- on the bench after their exertions in recent days across the Atlantic.The decision to hand Jones just his second league start of the season proved an inspired one as the England international won Liverpool's penalty and scored the decisive goal.Chelsea were fortunate still to have 11 men on the field after just six minutes when Tosin Adarabioyo hauled down Diogo Jota.The Portugal international was still a long way from goal but the incident was almost identical to the one that saw Arsenal defender William Saliba sent-off in a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday.Having survived that scare, Chelsea settled nicely into their rhythm and pushed the home side back by dominating possession.However, Liverpool's pace on the break was a constant threat and Chelsea were caught out when Salah fed Jones, who was chopped down by Levi Colwill.Salah slammed home his 10th goal against his former club from the resulting penalty.Moments later, Cody Gakpo slotted in at the end of a lightning Liverpool counter-attack, but Salah had strayed offside before delivering the assist.At the other end, Jackson smashed off the angle of post and bar in the first sign that Chelsea had some punch to their possession football.Chelsea, though, had another escape just before half-time when referee John Brooks intially pointed to the spot once more when Jones went down under a challenge from Robert Sanchez.VAR intervened, however, as the Spanish goalkeeper got a touch on the ball before making contact with Jones.Within three minutes of the restart for the second half, the Blues were back level as VAR played another helping hand for the visitors.Jackson latched onto Moises Caicedo's through ball and coolly slotted past Caoimhin Kelleher for his fifth goal in eight Premier League games.The Senegalese striker was ruled offside on the field, but was shown to be played on by Ibrahima Konate on replay.Liverpool took just three minutes to restore their lead as Jones timed his run perfectly to control and flick in Salah's cross.Chelsea forced Slot's men to defend their lead for the final 40 minutes but struggled to create clear-cut chances for the equaliser until seven minutes of stoppage time.Renato Vega headed over Cole Palmer's free-kick before Christopher Nkunku failed to get a telling touch to Pedro Neto's teasing cross.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Diego Simeone's team struggled against the minnows from the south of Madrid but after Yvan Neyou blasted the visitors ahead Sorloth levelled with a fine finish and Antoine Griezmann slid home the second.

        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC (KBFC) achieved a remarkable 2-1 victory against Mohammedan SC (MSC) at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday. This win marks the first time in 27 games that Kerala Blasters have triumphed in an away match after conceding the first goal in the Indian Super League (ISL). Two second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition. Mirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory, as per a press release by the ISL. The visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan SC backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match\u2019s tempo.In the 20th minute, Mohammedan SC\u2019s pillar in defense, Joseph Adjei had to be substituted after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian.The next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters FC\u2019s debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan SC. Mirjalol Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.Mikael Stahre\u2019s men didn\u2019t bog down after conceding the goal infact they were more spurred on to equalize. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to do so as Jesus Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan SC defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s long-range effort was denied by the crossbar.The second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield but the game swayed in the favour of KBFC by Kwame Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Noah. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, leaving his marker, Zodingliana Ralte in complete awe before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal.Riding on the positive momentum of scoring an equalizer, the Blasters (KBFC) enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri.Mohammedan SC\u2019s best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala Blasters FC home as they clinched their second win of the season, as per a press release by the ISL.While Kwame Peprah just played 26 minutes, his impact from the bench was such that it helped the team secure a great comeback win. He scored a crucial goal and completed 11 out of his 14 attempted passes. His introduction also allowed Jimenez more space in the box, resulting in the second goal. He was adjudged the Player of the Match.Mohammedan SC will host Hyderabad FC at home on October 26 while Kerala Blasters FC will be in action on October 25 against rivals Bengaluru FC in Kochi.",

Brooke was outstanding against the West Indies. Spoke about backing our strengths, she backed her strengths, found those pockets, and ran hard. Helped us get to a competitive total.\n\n\u201cWe all know she is a once-in-a-generation player. What she was able to do tonight was incredible. Physically to do what she did with the bat, I think she can\u2019t feel her legs. She is not a bad cricketer but the person that she is, the world is her oyster and is great. South Africa were great, and the semifinal against Australia was unbelievable,\u201d said the New Zealand skipper.\n\nShe also highlighted the performance of bowler Lea Tahuhu, who kept things quiet for South Africa in the middle overs.\n\n\u201cI have spoken about her at length. You want a person like her in the team, she will scrape and fight for you. It is not always about the wickets, but it is about the work that goes behind it and working hard for your mates,\u201d Devine said.",

        "text": "Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot. McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth. Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season. \r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane. Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams. For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006. \"It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race,\" said Leclerc.\"I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better.\"Verstappen said: \"It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer. It was a tough battle and tough to keep him (Norris) behind but it's a great result. \"I have my opinion about his move, but I'll leave it to the stewards. I dont need to say anything here.\" Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. Norris fell to fourth as Sainz also passed him on an eventful opening lap that saw Lewis Hamilton rise from 17th to 12th before he went off at Turn 19 on lap three, prompting an early Safety Car intervention. The Mercedes star had never previously failed to finish in 11 races in Austin. The race resumed on lap five, Leclerc pulling away to build his lead to three seconds by lap 10 with Verstappen resisting Sainz, who reported possible fuel problems and a loss of power. Norris stayed fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Piastri. By lap 20, as first the pit-stops began, Leclerc was 8.3 seconds clear of Verstappen with Sainz third, 1.3 adrift of the Dutchman. Norris was 3.6 adrift In fourth. Sainz came in on lap 21 for hards, rejoining sixth. Verstappen stayed out until lap 26 rejoining fifth, Ferrari having executed their undercut. Leclerc then came in on lap 27 for hards, leaving Norris and Piastri leading the way. He was third. As Norris pulled clear, Piastri frustrated Leclerc until lap 31 when Norris pitted. He rejoined fifth behind Verstappen and ahead of sixth-placed Russell who had not stopped. A lap later, Piastri pitted and order was restored with the Ferraris, led by Leclerc, in control ahead of Verstappen and both McLarens. \"These tyres aren't good, I can't brake or attack,\" reported Verstappen.Russell finally pitted on lap 41, rejoining eighth on mediums for the final stint as Norris closed in on Verstappen and they fought for third and vital points in their title scrap. The duo battled fiercely for a dozen laps, the champion defending adroitly each time Norris attacked until lap 53 when, pushed wide and off-track, the Briton finally made his move stick to take third. \"He needs to give me it back,\" complained Verstappen on team radio as they battled on and the stewards studied the move before hitting Norris with a five-second penalty for gaining an advantage.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Jude Bellingham's first season at Real Madrid started with a glut of goals and ended with a dream double, but his second is yet to take off. The England international faces his former side Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu in a rematch of last season's Champions League final, which Bellingham and Los Blancos triumphed in to win the competition for a record 15th time. The 21-year-old has shown signs of frustration in his sophomore year at Madrid, tasked with more defensive responsibility in midfield than at many times last season following the arrival of French superstar Kylian Mbappe.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti used the hard-working Bellingham on the right of midfield in a 2-1 La Liga win at Celta Vigo on Saturday, another new role for the 103 million euro ($112 million) man.Bellingham started last season as a key figure in the centre of Madrid's attack, scoring 10 goals in his first 10 games across La Liga and the Champions League.Thrust into the position after Karim Benzema departed with Madrid still waiting for then Paris Saint-Germain striker Mbappe to arrive, Bellingham thrived.After nine games this season in all competitions, Bellingham is yet to find the net.During the win over Celta, Bellingham appeared furious with Brazilian team-mate Vinicius Junior after the forward did not pass him the ball when he was well placed to score and instead lashed over.\"I haven't seen that (moment) you're talking about, but if it happened, it means that he has balls, character, and seems good to me,\" said Ancelotti on Saturday, defending Bellingham.\"Honestly, I didn't realise (it had happened), I'll watch it, but if he has reacted... let's be calm, after the game they were talking, laughing -- they have no problems.\"What's to our merit is that we always compete well, until the end.\"Ancelotti looked to shore up Madrid's defence during the second half of last season by getting Bellingham to play a hybrid role which saw him drop to the left of midfield at frequent intervals.The midfielder looked exhausted in the final months of the campaign and struggled with shoulder and ankle issues.Sharp riseBellingham was also below his best for England at Euro 2024 despite the Three Lions reaching the final, with the exception of his stunning bicycle kick goal against Slovakia in the last 16.He has been on a sharp upwards trajectory since breaking into the Birmingham City first team as a teenager, with the club retiring his number 22 shirt after he joined Borussia Dortmund at 17.Bellingham became the club's youngest captain at 19 and led them to the brink of the league title before Bayern Munich claimed victory on the final day of the 2022-23 campaign.He was named player of the season and also shone for England at the 2022 World Cup before elimination by France in the quarter-finals.Madrid fans quickly fell in love with Bellingham as he proved their saviour time and time again, including with a brace in his first Clasico against Barcelona.His goals turned him into the sort of star it might have otherwise taken years at Madrid to become and that has proven a hard bar to consistently live up to.Ancelotti has repeatedly emphasised Bellingham's job has changed and he should be appreciated for what he is still bringing to the team, in a midfield role now similar to what he was accustomed to before joining Los Blancos.With Mbappe, Vinicius and sometimes Rodrygo Goes selected in attack, Ancelotti and Madrid have struggled to find the perfect balance this season.New England coach Thomas Tuchel will also have to decide how best to fit Bellingham in with Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer vying for attacking midfield positions behind Harry Kane.Madrid are still searching for the right formula ahead of a vital week, facing Dortmund and then La Liga leaders Barcelona, and Bellingham will be determined to contribute whether that includes him scoring or not.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "McLaren team chief Andrea Stella blasted as \"inappropriate\" a controversial penalty handed to Lando Norris at the United States Grand Prix which could shatter his world title dream. Race stewards penalised Norris and relegated him to fourth behind three-time world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull after the pair clashed and ran off-track in the closing laps. A five-second penalty given to Norris, who finished third on track at the flag, pushed him back to fourth behind the series leader and dealt a blow in his bid to catch and pass the Dutch driver in this year's title race.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Norris was adjudged to have gained an advantage by running off the track when he swept outside Verstappen on lap 53 or the 56-lap race.The incident cost Norris valuable points and helped lift Verstappen to a 57-point lead in the title race with 354 to Norris's 297 with five races left.\"My view is that the way the stewards interfered with a beautiful piece of motorsport was inappropriate because both cars went off track so both cars gained an advantage,\" said McLaren team chief Andrea Stella.\"It's a shame because it cost us a podium, it cost us a race where we stayed patient after we were pushed off in the first lap, at the first corner. We accepted it.\"Having said very clearly our position, this kind of position by the stewards, this kind of decision cannot be appealed. For us the chapter is now closed and we move on to the next race.\"But both cars went off track so for us there was no doubt that the manoeuvre was correct.\"Norris was philosophical about his plight after a feisty drive, having recovered from a poor first lap when he wasted his fourth pole in five races and fell to fourth.\"Not my best race,\" he said. \"With the loss in turn one and just the racing at the end, it clearly wasn't enough -- so that's life. I didn't do a good enough job, but I gave it a good shot so I'm doing my best.\"My best isn't good enough sometimes. It just wasn't our day today.\"He added that he was considering talking to the stewards about their decision, but felt \"there's plenty of scenarios where people wouldn't get a penalty in cases like what happened.\"He said it was difficult to know if he should have given his place back immediately during the race.\"It's tough to know, but maybe that was my one opportunity that I had. Max was defending well and it wasn't easy to overtake.\"Verstappen said he had endured a difficult race without the pace in his car to attack.\"It was tough, a tough battle and I tried everything to keep him behind me. But it was fun, too,\" he said.'Worked like crazy'\"A podium is a good result. I have my own opinion on the move, but I dont need to say anything. I'll let the stewards do their thing.\"The race was won buy Charles Leclerc who led home Carlos Sainz in a Ferrari one-two. Leclerc's win lifted him to 275 points in third place in the championship.\"We did a great job and the pace of the car was really good and that's thanks to the engineers and the team,\" said Leclerc.\"They've worked like crazy for the upgrades and it is paying off now. We could not have dreamed for anything better.\"It all worked and we are very happy. Now we are targeting the constructors title.\"It was Leclerc's first win in America, his third this year and the eighth of his career as Ferrari revelled in their first US Grand Prix one-two since 2006.Ferrari's success at the Circuit of the Americas lifted them to 496 points in the teams' title race behind McLaren on 544 and Red Bull on 504 with the Mexican and Brazilian Grands Prix to come on the next two successive weekends.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Despite limping due to the effects of cramp, her second over began with the vital wicket of Wolvaardt, caught by Bates at cover for 33, and ended with Bosch caught behind on review.\n\nAnother quickfire double breakthrough then all but decided the outcome as New Zealand turned the screw.\n\nMarizanne Kapp picked out Plimmer at deep square leg off Eden Carson from the final ball of the 12th over and the 13th started with de Klerk swiping Rosemary Mair to Kerr at backward point.\n\nKerr returned to dismiss Annerie Dercksen, taking her tournament tally to 15, and Mair picked up two wickets in the penultimate over to finish with three for 25.\n\nIt was left to Carson to bowl the final over and conclude a historic weekend for cricket in New Zealand, with the men\u2019s team securing a first Test win in India for 36 years earlier in the day.\n\nNew Zealand: 158/5 in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 43, Brooke Halliday 38; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2/31, Nadine de Klerk 1/17)South Africa: 126/9 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 33, Tazmin Brits 17; Amelia Kerr 3/24, Rosemary Mair 3/25)\n\nContent courtesy: ICC Business Corporation FZ LLC 2020 via Online Media Zone.",

When I was at primary school in creative writing, I wrote about winning a World Cup with Sophie and Suzie.\"I don't necessarily believe you deserve things in sport, but if any two people do, it's Sophie and Suzie.\"Devine, 35, and Bates, 37, are two of the elder stateswomen in the side along with 34-year-old Lea Tahuhu.Each of them made their mark on the final. Bates made 32 and took three catches while fast bowler Tahuhu squeezed the South African middle order.Devine only made six but her leadership was outstanding, bringing out the best in the younger players in the team, like Kerr.'Heartbreak and happiness'\"We joke about being grandmas and mums and whatnot but you feel a real sense of pride at seeing them stand up and take opportunities. Melie (Kerr) today was unbelievable,\" said the skipper.\"For us to be able to win it, it's just nice to have that. It's always something that you want to have when you finish your career.\"Devine's first action after winning was to embrace her fellow 'grandma' Bates who has now played 334 white ball internationals since making her debut back in 2006.\"Me and Suze have been through a lot together,\" she said.\"We've been through a lot of hairstyles together, hers a lot worse than mine.\"But to be able to share it, to be fielding close together as well and to share that moment, that embrace, that's 17, 18 years of joy and heartbreak and happiness shared in that moment. It's just been awesome to share that with her.\"With the men's cricket team also completing a spectacular win in Bengaluru earlier in the day, their first Test win in India since 1988, Sunday was arguably New Zealand's finest ever day on the cricket field, although Devine hopes there is more to come.\"I'm really hopeful that tonight's victory can inspire that next generation of not just young girls but young boys as well to pick up a cricket bat, a cricket ball,\" she said.\"It still feels pretty surreal at the moment and hopefully the impact of what we've been able to achieve is going to be long-standing and long-reaching.

        "text": "Kerala Blasters FC pulled off a memorable 2-1 victory over Mohammedan SC at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday, marking the first time in 27 games that they have won an away match after conceding first in the Indian Super League. \n\nTwo second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre\u2019s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition.\n\nMirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory.\n\nThe visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match's tempo. \n\nIn the 20th minute, Mohammedan defender Joseph Adjei had to be substituted out after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian. \n\nThe next ten minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan. Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts.\n\nThe Blasters weren\u2019t bogged down after conceding the goal. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to level the scores as Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard\u2019s effort was crashed onto crossbar. \n\nThe second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield. But the game swayed in the favour of the Blasters by Peprah\u2019s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Sadaoui. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, evading his marker before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal. \n\nThere was controversy in the 70th minute as Mohammedan were denied a penalty after Franca was bundled over from behind by Hormipam Ruivah after being put through on goal. The home crowd was furious with the decision and expressed their displeasure by throwing water bottles on the pitch.\n\nThe Blasters enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri. \n\nMohammedan best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala BlastersFC home as they clinched their second win of the season.",

        "title": "Australian star Perry congratulates NZ\u2019s trio of Suzie, Devine, Tahuhu for T20 WC win",
        "text": "Star Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry congratulated New Zealand\u2019s veteran trio of Suzie Bates, skipper Sophie Devine, and pacer Lea Tahuhu for finally securing the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title, beating South Africa in the final. For three of the most experienced White Ferns stars, it was a Sunday to remember as they ended a 15-year wait for their first-ever ICC Women\u2019s T20 WC title. The hard work, pain, blood, sweat, and tears worth 410 T20Is combined finally proved to be worth it as they made key contributions to this historic title win. Perry took to Instagram and posted in a story that she could not think of a group of players more deserving of success for their country and congratulated them. Notably, Australia\u2019s title defence ended in the semifinals after an eight-wicket loss to South Africa. This marked the first T20 WC after 2009 in which Australia was not in the finals. NZ reached the finals after a thrilling eight-run win over West Indies in the other semifinal. The White Ferns veterans made key contributions throughout the tournament. Bates was the fourth-highest run-getter with 150 runs in six innings at an average of 25.00, with a strike rate of around 93 and best score of 32. Despite not scoring a half-century, she made important contributions up the order in every match. She also took a wicket. Skipper Devine made 114 runs in six innings at an average of 28.50, with a strike rate of 107.54. Her best score of 57* came against India in the opening clash and set the tone for the Kiwis\u2019 brilliant run in the tournament. Tahuhu took five wickets in six games at an average of 22.80, with best bowling figures of 3/15 that came against India. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*. She has also taken 59 wickets with the best figures of 4/26. Devine is the sixth-highest run-getter in women\u2019s T20Is and White Ferns\u2019 second-highest run-maker, scoring 3,391 runs in 143 matches and 139 innings at an average of 28.25, with a strike rate of 120.93. She has scored a century and 21 fifties, with the best score of 105. She has also taken 117 wickets with the best figures of 4/22. Tahuhu is also an established veteran with 96 T20I appearances, in which she has taken 93 wickets at an average of 19.79, with the best figures of 4/6. Coming to the match, SA won the toss and elected to field first. Bates played a crucial knock of 32 in 31 balls, with three fours at the top. After being reduced to 70/3, it was a 57-run stand between Amelia Kerr (43 in 38 balls, with four boundaries) and Brooke Halliday (38 in 28 balls, with three fours) that played a crucial role in NZ reaching 158/5 in their 20 overs. Nonkululeko Mlaba (2/31) was the pick of the bowlers for White Ferns. In the run-chase of 159 runs, despite a brisk start by skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33 in 27 balls, with five fours), SA and a 51-run stand with Tazmin Brits (17 in 18 balls, with one four), SA lost wickets quickly and never found their rhythm following the dismissal of their openers. They were restricted to 126/9 in their 20 overs, with Kerr (3/24) and Rosemary Mair (3/25) shining the most with the ball for NZ. Kerr was given the \u2018Player of the Match\u2019 award for her all-round show. (ANI)",

        "title": "ICC Women\u2019s T20 WC: \u201cThree grandmas\u201d of New Zealand team finally get their crowning moment",
        "text": "New Zealand veteran Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine and Lea Tahuhu, the three \u201cgrandmas\u201d of their team, finally got the crowning moment of their T20I career on Sunday as an all-round White Ferns side defeated South Africa by 32 runs to secure their maiden ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup title. NZ captain Devine had described the trio as \u201cthree grandmas\u201d, and it was the veterans who finally got their moment on Sunday.For 37-year-old Bates and 35-year-old skipper Devine, this was the third time lucky, with the long-serving pair both having played in their country\u2019s previous two appearances in Women\u2019s T20 World Cup finals, way back in 2009 and 2010, ending in losses to England and Australia. Those defeats at Lord\u2019s and in Bridgetown threatened to be the closest the pair came to World Cup glory, but Dubai 2024 has proved a fitting finale for two of the game\u2019s greats.Bates, who had bowled the crucial final over against West Indies in the semi-final, was at her belligerent best with the bat in the first innings against South Africa.It was Bates (334 international matches) who got the ball rolling for her team in the final, showing her class on the day when she surpassed Mithali Raj (333 international appearances) as the most-capped player in the history of women\u2019s international cricket.Her 32 from 31 deliveries gave the White Ferns the perfect platform on which to build, which her teammates duly did to reach a winning total of 158/5.\u201cIt is just outstanding, and just speaks to the volume of who Suzie is as a player,\u201d Devine said of her teammate. \u201cShe is now the most capped player in the history of the game on the woman\u2019s side, and it is unbelievable to think that she can go out there and play with such aggression and such fearlessness. I think it set the tone for the rest of the batting lineup. I think everyone knows how special I find Suze and what she has been able to achieve. So, I am just so stoked for her that we are able to lift it for her,\u201d she added, Devine captained her side with aplomb throughout the tournament, even lightening the mood just moments before the final began by telling some jokes to relieve some tension \u2013 jokes that she later said \u201cshe was not sure she could repeat,\u201d. And while her own individual contribution with the bat in the final (6) was not her best, it was her simply brilliant 57* from 36 balls right back at the start of the tournament against India that had got her team off to the perfect start in their winning campaign.\u201cI started to dream last night about what it would feel like to hold the trophy with this team, but I did not want to get to ahead of us,\u201d said Devine after the title win. \u201cThe great thing about this group is we know what we have been trying to achieve in the last 15, 18, 24 months. We kept taking steps in the right direction. You want momentum and we came to the World Cup on the back of 10 successive losses, but everyone starts on zero,\u201d she added. The 34-year-old Tahuhu often flies under the radar compared to her two experienced teammates, but bowled tidily in the final once again, and has now moved up to 93 career wickets in T20 Internationals, second only to Devine for New Zealand and up with some of the legendary names of the sport.\u201cI have spoken about it at length before, Lea\u2019s the sort of person that you want in your team, because you know that she is going to get in the fight, she is going to compete and scrap for you, and I knew if I threw her the ball, that she is going to make something happen. And she did just that,\u201d said Devine. \u201cIt is not always the person that takes the wickets or the catches. It is the work that goes on behind it, the teamwork. It is sort of working hard for your mate out in the middle there. And Leah was fantastic today, and helped change the outcome of the game I thought,\u201d she concluded. These three stars have plenty of memorable statistics and records to their name in women\u2019s T20I cricket. Bates is the top run-getter in the format, with 4,584 runs in 171 matches at an average of 29.38 and a strike rate of 108.39, with a century and 28 fifties. Her best score is 124*. She has also taken 59 wickets with the best figures of 4/26. Devine is the sixth-highest run-getter in women\u2019s T20Is and White Ferns\u2019 second-highest run-maker, scoring 3,391 runs in 143 matches and 139 innings at an average of 28.25, with a strike rate of 120.93. She has scored a century and 21 fifties, with the best score of 105. She has also taken 117 wickets with the best figures of 4/22.

My heartfelt condolences to bereaved families. Praying for speedy recovery of the injured. The entire nation stands in solidarity with the families in this hour of grief,\u201d he added.\n\nChief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the incident as dastardly and cowardly on the part of the militants. \u201cThe casualty figure from the Gagangir attack is not final as there are a number of injured labourers, both local and non-local. Praying that the injured make a full recovery as the more seriously injured are being referred to SKIMS, Srinagar.\u201d\n\nImmediately after getting news about the attack, Omar said earlier on Sunday, \u201cVery sad news of a dastardly & cowardly attack on non-local labourers at Gagangir in Sonamarg region. These people were working on a key infrastructure project in the area. 2 have been killed & 2-3 more have been injured in this militant attack.

Barely 48 hours ago, a non-local labourer was killed in Shopian. These despicable attacks appear to be deliberate attempts to disturb peace. Culprits must be brought to book and punished.

This is an insane act of madness. My thoughts with families of these two families.

This module was doing recce of the crime spot for the last one month.

This is a big change in the strategy of this module, which is simultaneously targeting non-local and local on development projects.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) are visiting the terror attack site on Monday to make their own assessment of the attack. Officials said that the death toll in the terrorist attack on a private company's labourers' camp in Gagangir area reached seven after another injured labourer succumbed in hospital.\r\n\r\nThose killed by the terrorists include both locals and non-locals working to build a tunnel between Gagangir and Sonamarg to make Srinagar-Sonamarg an all-weather road.

        "text": "Wellington: Members of the New Zealand White Ferns cricket team which beat South Africa by 32 runs in the final of the women's Twenty20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday will split prize money of around USD 2.3 million.That works out at around USD 155,000 or NZD 256,000 per team member, a life-changing windfall for players who for years have struggled for years to achieve financial parity with their male counterparts.New Zealand's first-ever victory in the World Cup of cricket's shortest format was a massive surprise. The White Ferns had lost 10 consecutive T20 matches before beating South Africa in a warm-up match.That pre-tournament success proved a turning point for New Zealand who beat India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing only to Australia on the way to the semifinals.South Africa ousted six-time champion Australia in a massive upset in the semi in which New Zealand beat the West Indies.New Zealand made 158-5, batting first in the final, helped by Suzy Bates who made 32, Amelia Kerr who made 43 and Brooke Halliday who made 38. Kerr then took 3-24 and Rosemary Mair 3-25 as New Zealand restricted South Africa to 126-9.\"Pretty unbelievable to be honest,\ufffd Mair said. \ufffdComing into the tournament all the odds were against us so for the group to bounce back like they have is unbelievable.\"We just care so much about each other. We've been through a lot of lows in the last 18 months, and we've just stuck by each other and kept working hard for each other.\"Captain Sophie Devine was leading the New Zealand team for the last time. She and Bates have played in all nine T20 World Cups since the first in 2009. New Zealand reached the final of the first two tournaments in 2009 and 2010, losing to Australia on both occasions.\"This means everything to us,\" Bates said. \"When you play team sport, you want to be a world champion.\"We've fought our way back to the top. (Devie) has been so outstanding leading this team... so calm and believing in us. We'll probably have a cuddle for even longer later because there's been some dark times that only the people in the (locker room) understand.\"New Zealand was coached to victory by Australian Ben Sawyer and former Black Caps batters Dean Brownlie and Craig McMillan.The White Ferns' success was praised Monday by New Zealand Sports Minister Chris Bishop. It came at the end of a weekend in which New Zealand also retained sailing's America's Cup and in which the New Zealand men's cricket team beat India in a test in India for the first time in 36 years.\"And then to round out a truly amazing sporting weekend, at 3am Monday morning (NZT) the White Ferns, led by Sophie Devine, stepped up to face South Africa in the women's T20 World Cup final in Dubai and absolutely smashed it, bringing home their first World Cup since the One Day International in 2000,\" Bishop said.\"Amelia Kerr's 43 runs off 38 balls and then taking 3 wickets for 24 set our team up for their magnificent performance.\"",

        "text": "CropLife India, an association of 17 R&D driven member companies in crop protection, has announced the change in leadership in the board of directors. \n\nThe 44th annual general meeting of CropLife India elected Ankur Aggarwal, Managing Director of Crystal Crop Protection Ltd, as the new Chairman of the board recently. Aggarwal succeeds KC Ravi, who served as the Chairman for the past four years. \n\nPivotal leader\n\nAnil Kakkar, Vice President of Sumitomo Chemical India, continues his role as Vice-Chairman for the fourth consecutive year. \n\nMohan Babu, Chief Operating Officer of Bayer CropScience for India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, has been inducted as the second Vice-Chairman of the board. \n\nA media statement said Ankur Aggarwal\u2019s extensive experience positions him as a pivotal leader in the crop protection industry. \n\nHe is committed to advancing innovative technologies that empower farmers to enhance productivity sustainably, all while addressing the crucial environmental challenges the country faces today. \n\nHis leadership will be essential in shaping a more resilient and responsible agricultural future, it said. \n\nQuoting Aggarwal, the statement said, \u201cIndia is confronted with a pressing challenge: decreasing agricultural landholdings alongside a growing population, which is increasing at about 0.8 per cent annually. This scenario heightens the demand for food production, putting pressure on food systems and necessitating innovative solutions for food security. To address this, the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, efficient resource management, and responsible use of crop protection solutions will be essential for maximising productivity on existing farmland. As the Chairman of CropLife India, we remain committed to improving the lives of Indian farmers. We are dedicated to providing them with science-based solutions that ensure effective and sustainable crop protection.\u201d\n\nDurgesh Chandra, Secretary General of CropLife India, said: \u201cIt will be our earnest endeavour in collaborating closely with Mr Ankur Aggarwal and the board of directors, to fulfil our responsibility in delivering the latest and safest innovations.

        "text": "Indian Premier League (IPL) defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are in a precarious position ahead of the upcoming season as they would be without the services of previous season's mentor Gautam Gambhir, assistant coach and academy head Abhishek Nayar and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate. The trio have joined the Indian cricket team as head coach and assistant coaches respectively, and certainly leave a void in the KKR dugout. While Dwayne Bravo has joined the side as mentor, other positions need to be filled.In addition to the backroom staff, early indications are that the captaincy role is not straightforward either. Shreyas Iyer joined KKR when he was bought for Rs 12.25 crore at the 2022 auction and it's understood that the franchise is willing to retain the Mumbai batter but not as their top retention.Ahead of October 31 deadline, Andre Russell is the front runner to be retained with a hefty price tag. The all-rounder was earlier retained for Rs 12 crore by KKR and is very likely to get a substantial raise.If things don't go per Iyer's liking, will he explore different options? In case he looks that way, the right-hander is expected to set the auction on fire because many teams - Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings, Delhi Capitals - are in the need of a captain. And an Indian captain is always sought after.Punjab won't mind loosening their purse strings for the right-hander considering he had a successful partnership with Ricky Ponting, now PBKS head coach, at DC and the two were together when they reached the final in 2020.Equally, don't be surprised if DC explore the Iyer option, too, because he was a proven leader for them and Rishabh Pant has asked to not be considered as skipper.Even last year, when Iyer was returning from injury lay-off, there was a section in the KKR camp which wanted to continue with Nitish Rana, who was standby captain in Iyer's absence, as leader for 2024 season.The franchise, however, \"announced\" Iyer as captain before the tournament got underway. The statement did raise a few eyebrows as Iyer was the original captain and Rana was only doing the job in his absence, and many felt the announcement was absolutely unnecessary.Shah Rukh Khan co-owned KKR are one of the franchises who advocated for a smaller auction, and pushed for more Right to Match (RTM). It's a strategy they are likely to use at the upcoming auction.There are more tempting retention options in Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana (uncapped), Mitchell Starc and Varun Chakravarthy but it will be interesting to see how much the defending champs are willing to spend.They have a problem of plenty on that front but it's their captaincy piece which would be keenly followed by other franchises too.",

Shreyas Iyer's captaincy is uncertain, with all-rounder Andre Russell likely to be retained, as other teams explore the possibility of acquiring the KKR skipper.",

        "title": "EA Sports FC 25 Review: Minor League Upgrades",
        "text": "It's difficult to recognise granular changes in seemingly constant things. You don't really notice a tree growing every year, but when you put those years together, the difference becomes apparent to the naked eye. The erstwhile FIFA series of football sims is somewhat like that. With a new edition released every year, the changes to the long-running and ridiculously popular sports franchise can be imperceptible over a year, or even more. These games only start feeling new after three or four subsequent editions when Electronic Arts is compelled to re-energise the series after a run of games becomes undeniably stale. To me, FIFA has always existed in eras. A spate of games follows the same language with minor improvements and tunings, before EA decides to freshen things up.\n\nThe franchise's latest era began last year when it shed its decades-old FIFA identity and rechristened itself as EA Sports FC. But a new name didn't bring a promised new beginning with FC 24. There was a new coat of paint, but underneath, the game was very much carved out of the same wood that has long been showing cracks. No one expected EA to upend a successful formula and re-imagine the game in a new light, but EA Sports FC 24 was desperately lacking fresh ideas. One year later, EA Sports FC 25, the second entry in EA's new football video game timeline, is still very much a fruit from the same tree. But there are a few new ideas this time around, some of which elevate the game from its swamp of familiarity. On a visual level, there's not much that differentiates FC 25 from its predecessor. You could boot it up and your flatmate might walk in on you playing and think its FC 24. But if they'd pick up the controller and jump in a game, the differences are likely to become a little more apparent.\n\nTo begin with, EA Sports FC 25 is harder, especially for those who are used to running at defences with a pacy winger, cutting through the entire opponent half and scoring a worldie \u2013\u2013 that's harder to pull off here. There's a greater (and much needed) emphasis on defending in FC 25 that hands players a little more power to dictate play when they are off the ball. Defenders and defensive midfielders have more of a commanding presence and are clearly more empowered to disrupt quick offensive moves. At first, this is a bit jarring. When attacking, you tend to lose the ball often and quickly if you're not carefully constructing your passes and relying on a single player to break down the defence. Defenders pick your pocket or win the second ball before you have the time to adjust, turn or take a second touch. This forces you to craft more considered plays and graft for your goals.\n\nDefenders can now also make a tactical foul in a last-ditch attempt to nullify an attack. These are fun to pull off in the game and of course will result in your player being penalised, but the new ability is only useful in certain circumstances and doesn't strengthen defences as a whole. Even with their newfound powers, however, defenders still seem to be playing with their hands tied behind their backs. When facing up to an oncoming attacker, big centre-backs are potent in their tackling. But if a pacy forward slips past them, you could kiss defensive recovery goodbye. There's little that's stopping the forward from scoring at that point as defenders are woefully inept when chasing down attackers and making recoveries. This has long been an issue in EA's football games, and FC 25 doesn't address the glaring defensive weakness either.\n\nDefenders still struggle to make recoveries against pacy forwardsPhoto Credit: EA\n\nEA's football franchise has always favoured an arcade-style recreation of the world's game. It's faster, leaner, and meaner. For a more authentic on-pitch gameplay, purists like me have preferred the more deliberate playstyle and pacing of Pro Evolution Soccer (rest in peace). But EA Sports FC25, to its credit, attempts to bring a bit of realism to its otherwise hyper-kinetic simulacrum of football made for 16-year-olds brought up on TikTok and Twitter (also, RIP). EA has burned in a Simulation Settings master switch in the game this time, that lets you swap out the classic FIFA experience \u2013\u2013 akin to a run-and-gun sort of playstyle \u2013\u2013 for a more grounded simulation of the sport \u2013\u2013 much like a tactical shooter. EA says that the Simulation gameplay type is \u201ccloser to what you'd see in a live football match.\u201d While that's an exaggeration, the option does slow down things on the pitch, underscoring the action with real-time decision making. Once I toggled the Simulation mode on, I never went back.\n\nThis change isn't just apparent on the defensive third of the field; attacking now seems beholden to gravity and you can't simply fly around with the ball glued to your toes. Players are more prone to bad touches, more susceptible to losing one-on-one battles, and more unlikely to knock the ball past the opponent in a sudden burst of pace. Passing, too, is now a little less video gamey. It doesn't seem hard coded to be precise, and I found myself struggling to pass my way out of tight spaces in the midfield early on. With time, however, you grow into the rhythms of the sim and find solutions that help you build up efficient plays. This experience, of course, is subject to user customisation. If you prefer the manic intensity of classic FIFA gameplay, then you can stick to the default simulation setting or fine tune it the way you like by adjusting individual sliders for different gameplay elements.\n\nWith the simulation setting on, the gameplay is more realistic and consideredPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe altered on-pitch experience is underpinned by an overhaul of tactical foundations across FC 25. This applies to how you tactically set up your team, assign player roles, and decide how they will play together on the pitch. When you head to team management in any mode, you're greeted by a revamped and streamlined tactics menu, where you can choose a tactical preset, pick a formation, a build-up style, and a defensive approach. All of this is a neater, but also a leaner experience. Some specific tactical adjustments present in past games have been stripped away, in essence giving you less control over your team's tactical set up. You also can't manually adjust the position of your players on the pitch and create your own formations like you were able to in previous games. These changes make for a less flexible, more guided tactical experience in FC 25.\n\nThe tactical streamlining, however, is counter-balanced by a deeper focus on individual player roles in your starting XI. Each position on the pitch comes with distinct positional role that can be assigned to the player. These player roles govern how individual members of your team will think, act and move on the pitch. For instance, you could set up you right-back as a Falseback; this role will task your right-back to push into the central midfield rather than staying out wide \u2014 Pep Guardiola style. Or you could play them as an Attacking Wingback, prioritising wide attacking output over defensive duties. Each Player Role comes with its unique benefits and drawbacks; you may get an extra pair of legs on the offensive side of the pitch to provide options when attacking, but that player will likely be stranded out of position when you lose the ball, making you susceptible to counters.\n\nPlayer Roles add depth to the tactical set up of your teamPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nEach player on your team also comes with specific level of Role Familiarity, denoted by \u2018plus' signs. A player's familiarity to a position and its corresponding roles and responsibilities guides how good they will be when starting from that position. A single plus sign next to a role indicates the player has mastered the position, while a double plus sign \u2014 only available for certain players \u2014 tells you that they are one of the world's best in that role. These options are quite helpful in guiding player-level behaviour on the pitch and offer you the freedom to tweak around and see what's working for you. The more role-familiar players you have in your starting XI, the more your team is likely to actually play like team.\n\nBeyond menus and inputs, the AI-driven tactical core of EA Sports FC 25, however, remains annoyingly broken. EA says there's a new AI model guiding positional awareness and player behaviour in the game that utilises real-world data. And the new iteration of the Hypermotion technology claims to bring more authentic on-pitch player interactions, animations and visuals. But, when playing a match in FC 25, these changes are frankly imperceptible. There's barely any noticeable shift in visual fidelity from FC 24, and while there are newer animations for player actions in the game, AI player behaviour remains woeful. Despite spending hours setting up your tactics, it is often a struggle to get your team to behave like a real-life football club. You see glaring gaps in the midfield, AI-controlled defenders not rushing to mark attackers in space, and AI players constantly failing to adapt to evolving situations in a match.\n\nFC 25 features Smart Tactics options that can be accessed with the D-padPhoto Credit: EA\n\nAnd it isn't just the on-pitch flaws that are carried over from previous games; general UI clunk, unresponsive inputs in menus, and stuttering transitions between screens are alive and well in FC 25. These recurring frustrations point to a callous approach from EA that mandates rushing out a new edition in time for a new football season over hammering out the dents in the chassis to deliver a polished product. You can also never quite shake the feeling that EA Sports FC 25 is residing under the skin of its predecessor. The main menu here is the clone of the new one seen last year. As is the lazy tradition, this will continue for a few editions before EA knows it's time to switch things up. The familiar DNA pervades every other screen in the game, with only a few strands swapped around to make sure players can see what's changed if they bring a magnifying glass.\n\nLet's talk about the manager mode. The trademark Career mode, where I've sunk most of my time in my decades of playing FIFA, is as usual split between Manager and Player careers \u2014 I'll mostly be talking about the former. In FC 24, the Career mode felt largely ignored, with EA only bringing minor and cosmetic changes to the tired formula. In FC 25, the changes, unfortunately, remain aesthetic and stop way short of overhauling the manager mode experience. The ability to set an overarching tactical vision for your club, introduced last year, has been retained, and there are some tweaks across different aspects of the mode, but little is new in terms of impactful additions. The Career mode homepage now shows a rolling list of your tasks as a manager and a social media feed on the side providing updates on player transfers from football gossip god Fabrizio Romano and club and player news from The Athletic. After the initial novelty of checking every item off your list before you head to matchday, you start to groan at the repetitive tasks and eventually start ignoring them.\n\nThe new manager mode homescreen comes with a task list and a social media feedPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nThe new tactics system makes its way to the Career mode, changing the way you set up your club to win matches, but the all-important transfer hub remains the same for practical purposes. The way you set up your scouts, find players you need, engage in transfer negotiations is completely unchanged, following the set formats we've seen for years now. And there is still no VAR in EA Sports FC 25. I understand that implementing a video review system in online matches is not feasible, but playing manager mode in 2024 without VAR affecting matches and their outcomes seems outlandish. There is a greater focus on youth development and scouting; manager mode even lets you play bi-monthly five-a-side youth tournaments to accelerate the growth of your youth team. And now there's an option to embark on a manager career for a women's team from some of the top licensed leagues. While these additions are appreciated, EA has frustratingly again overlooked a core overhaul of the manager mode that fans have long demanded.\n\nAs expected, however, the money-spinning Ultimate Team mode gets the spotlight again. EA's biggest addition this time around is a quickfire 5v5 Rush mode, that in essence replaces the Volta street football mode. Rush comes with its own set of rules for offside, player penalties and set pieces, all of which fit naturally within the seven-minute match format. The new feature, available across different game modes, strips away the contrived \u201ccoolness\u201d of Volta with simple, fun five-a-side matches that truly shine in the Ultimate Team mode. With Rush, EA is basically cribbing from Rocket League. In Ultimate Team Rush, you can either team up with friends or play with strangers online \u2014 each user controlling a player \u2014 and take on other teams of five online. As a former Rocket League addict, I can confirm that Rush has the same effect. It's fast, engaging and often frustrating \u2014 but never not fun.\n\nRocket league-style five-a-side Rush mode is fun and addictivePhoto Credit: EA\n\nPlaying with friends online naturally brings more cohesion to your game, but jumping into a match with strangers is as unpredictable as you'd expect it to be. If you're lucky, you'll match with players who want to work as a team, construct selfless plays and win together. Most of the time, however, you'll find yourself playing with pre-pubescent idiots who're in the habit of shouting \u201cSiuuuuu\u201d after eating their morning cereal. Nevertheless, Rush is cool, if derivative addition to EA Sports FC 25, and I found myself playing quickfire games online again and again. In fact, despite getting a good Ultimate Team together on paper, I played more Rush games than the traditional 11v11 matches in Ultimate Team Rivals.\n\nThe familiar stuff from Ultimate Team, like squad-building challenges and online competitions, are all here \u2014 and so is in-your-face case for microtransactions. The new tactical system and player roles make their way into mode, too. In addition to introducing the all-new Rush mode, FC 25 expands the Evolutions feature, which brings cosmetic and stat upgrades to your player cards in Ultimate Team. You can select an eligible player from your team and graft to complete challenges that upgrade your player cards. Or you can give EA more money and spend in-game currency to buy upgrades.\n\nUltimate Team remains the focus for EAPhoto Credit: EA/ Screenshot - Manas Mitul\n\nAside from Ultimate Team, other familiar modes like online Seasons, Clubs and Co-op Seasons are all here in the same form we've seen for years. As with all EA Sports football games, the comfort of consistency remains key. There are no radical changes, no upending of norms, no risk-taking. But one can hardly begrudge EA to rip apart things that have continued to work for years for reasons as flimsy as creativity and innovation. But it's the minor visual upgrades that leave a bad taste in the mouth. EA Sports FC 25 runs and looks as we've come to expect games in the series to run and look for the past few years.\n\nAs I mentioned, when it comes to the naked eye test, there's little that differentiates the game from its predecessor. Sure, certain player faces are more detailed now, as is the norm with every new edition, and a fresh set of animations try and add a bit more realism to player movement, but these don't amount to a perceptible visual upgrade on the pitch. Annoyingly though, cloth physics gets an upgrade that makes player kits comedically bouncy. Shirts and shorts look like they are going through a panic attack, wiggling as if they have a mind of their own. The ever-present general layer of visual glitches and jank hasn't been ironed out, as well. Whether you're on the pitch or in the menus, EA Sports FC 25 will often refuse to follow your lead.\n\nCertain player faces and animations are improved in FC 25Photo Credit: EA\n\nWhen you put all of its new tricks and familiar frustrations into a bag, EA Sports FC 25 fails to offer an experience that makes you look at the series in a new light. And that seems to be the recurring problem with the franchise as a whole. EA has constantly favoured reiteration over rejuvenation, and sadly that approach has only led to regurgitation. Every new edition of its annual football sim feels like meeting an old friend, asking \u201chow you've been\u201d and getting \u201csame old, same old\u201d in reply. There are some new ideas, most notably the Rocket League-style Rush mode that adds a much needed, well, rush to an otherwise stale table of contents. And while the tactical overhaul brings a new way to engage with team strategy and player instructions, it does so at the cost of mechanical flexibility.\n\nThe on-pitch gameplay takes a few steps forward in the right direction, empowering the defensive side of the game, but FC 25 stops short of taking necessary strides towards meaningful upgrades that could change the game for good. The continued apathy towards career mode, however, remains the biggest complaint. Gaping cracks in the quintessential mode have repeatedly been ignored for surface-level improvements \u2014 as if a new coat of paint would change the fact that the underlying wall is rotting. EA Sports FC 25, disappointingly, opts to do the same, even though a foundational change is long overdue. Over the past few years, EA's long-running football franchise has essentially embraced a live service strategy, with minor seasonal upgrades rolled out annually to an audience hooked to its unethical commercial model. The only difference is that EA asks you to pay full price every year for a \u201cnew\u201d game.\n\n Engaging and addictive Rush mode Deeper tactical control with Player Roles Greater emphasis on defending Focus on realism with Simulation setting Improved animations\n\n Minor changes to career mode UI and gameplay jank Lack of noticeable visual upgrades Rigid new tactics system Frustrating AI player behaviour\n\nRating (out of 10): 6\n\nEA Sports FC 25 released September 27 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X and Nintendo Switch.\n\nPricing starts at Rs. 3,999 for the Standard Edition on Steam and Epic Games Store for PC, and Rs. 4,499 on PlayStation Store for PS5 and PS4, and Microsoft Store for Xbox Series S/X and Xbox One.",

        "text": "A recently published Ordinance effecting an amendment to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955, enables the government to assign the powers of the the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation or its Commissioner to any officer or agency or authority in order to protect public assets. Approval of the Ordinance by the Governor is perceived as an effort on part of the government to clear the legal hurdles for the Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) which is entrusted with the responsibility of protection of lakes and government lands in and around the State capital. The Telangana Ordinance No. 4 of 2024 published in the Telangana Gazette on October 3, inserts a Section 374B, which stipulates that the government can empower any officer/agency/authority to exercise the powers vested with the corporation/the commissioner for protection of public assets such as roads, drains, public streets, water bodies, open spaces and public parks and preserve them from illegal encroachments. The government sought to justify the amendment by saying unforeseen contingencies and disasters necessitated the requirement of specialised agencies whose services can be roped in by GHMC to strategise and implement effective resilient systems for natural calamities and disasters. While the Ordinance legally accords enforcement powers to HYDRAA with regard to GHMC Act, it also restricts its authority to GHMC alone. As per the government order constituting HYDRAA, the authority\u2019s jurisdiction includes area under GHMC and all urban and rural local bodies up to the Outer Ring Road. The government may be specifically include or exclude areas from HYDRAA\u2019s purview from time to time as per the orders. Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 already has provisions for the government or the municipal commissioner to empower district level task force/agency towards enforcement with regard to removal of unauthorised structures. As per the sources, a government order has already been issued empowering the HYDRAA to take action in the urban local bodies too. However, the same is not available in public domain.",

The BSE index slid by over 900 points, while the Nifty fell below the 24,500 mark, marking an erratic day for Indian equities. \n\nAt 3:10 PM, Sensex plunged by 902 points, or 1.11%, to 80,249, and Nifty succumbed to a fall of 1.25%, losing 310 points at 24,471. The sharp fall at both Sensex and Nifty deprived the market of its nearly Rs 8.9 lakh crore in market capitalization, which clearly signifies how turbulent today\u2019s market has been.\n\nFactors Affecting Stock Market Today: Sensex and Nifty in Pressure Zone\n\nThis led to an increase in the stock market today mainly due to profit booking after a strong rally witnessed in the recent sessions. The analysts claimed that the share market was seen witnessing the Sensex and as well as Nifty dip today as there is huge profit-taking going on, which had been spurred by high market valuations. Market experts predict possible corrections and hence Sensex and Nifty saw their reaction to both local and global economic cues.\n\nFII selling hits the stock market today\n\nThe greatest spoiler for the downward slide in the equity market today has been sustained selling by FIIs, seeming to be making the Sensex and as well as Nifty take the downward road. \n\nFIIs have been selling at record levels, offloading Rs 88,244 crore worth of shares alone in October, putting pressure on both indices. The FII selling thus caused appears to be balanced out to a certain extent only by DIIs and not sufficiently to prevent the Sensex and the Nifty from sliding.\n\nGlobal Markets Add to the Woes of Securities Market Today\n\nAgain echoing the woes of the stock market, poor Asian market performances also reflected poorly on the Sensex and as well as Nifty. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi witnessed jarring dips that went through their due share of reverberations in Indian equities. The stock market today saw heavy selling pressure as Sensex and Nifty followed the global trends downwards.\n\nAs the volatile nature of the stock market continues to gain momentum, analysts believe that Sensex and Nifty are unlikely to recover in the short term. Corrections remain in the pipeline.\n\nAlso, see: Bengaluru police arrest Axis Bank manager in Rs 97 crore stock market fraud",

        "title": "Boost for Kashmir apples",
        "text": "Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s (J&K\u2019s) apple industry, the backbone of its agrarian economy, has shaped the region\u2019s social and economic fabric for centuries. As the largest producer of apples in India, the valley\u2019s orchards not only support thousands of livelihoods but also position the region on the global fruit market map. Apple farming is the largest employment generator in J&K, with nearly 3.5 million farmers \u2014 27 per cent of the region\u2019s population \u2014 involved in growing the fruit, whose export contributes more than 8 per cent to the region\u2019s GDP. However, behind this thriving industry lies a crisis of fluctuating market forces, geopolitical tensions, and environmental challenges.\n\nThreats and challenges\n\nKashmir\u2019s apple growers are increasingly relying on cold storage units to navigate fluctuating demand. With over 40 cold storage facilities, mostly in SIDCO Lassipora, capable of holding more than 2.5 lakh tonnes, these controlled-atmospheric units provide a crucial buffer. However, with limited cold storage in Kashmir, many apple growers are left with no choice but to sell early at low prices, or risk watching their produce go to waste.\n\nThe influx of foreign apples has driven down prices for Kashmiri apples, leaving local growers struggling against a tide of cheaper imports. The flood of Iranian, Washington, and South African apples has sharply eroded the dominance of Kashmiri apples. J&K\u2019s apple industry is hindered by the region\u2019s rugged terrain and insufficient infrastructure. The fragile transportation network, often blocked by political instability or harsh weather, further impedes the timely distribution of produce. Erratic weather patterns, particularly frequent hailstorms, devastate orchards.\n\nReviving the orchard\n\nA growing demand for organic and premium apple varieties is reshaping the market, driven by health-conscious consumers. The apple growers in Kashmir are unable to produce organically grown apples. Promoting traditional apples grown organically in Kashmir is essential to safeguard health and preserve the region\u2019s agricultural heritage and enhance sustainability. Hanabi \u2014 an innovative solution (advanced pesticide) to boost apple farming in Kashmir \u2014 must be used in the early stage of rat infestation.\n\nThe National Conference, now at the helm in J&K, must turn their promises into action, especially when it comes to the apple industry. The new government must craft a robust natural farming policy, and must enhance the quality of Kashmiri apples through better farming practices, pest management, and post-harvest handling to meet international standards.\n\nFarmers must be encouraged to diversify their crops or invest in value-added products like apple juice, cider, or dried apples to reduce dependence on fresh apple sales. The Modified High Density Plantation Scheme, set to span 5,500 hectares in J&K from March 2021 to March 2026, embodies a vision for agricultural revitalisation. This scheme could serve as a force for economic growth, empowering farmers and boosting the apple industry through increased productivity and sustainability.\n\nKashmir\u2019s apple growers face triple burden \u2014 spurious pesticides that threaten crops, an erratic climate disrupting yields, and the glaring absence of insurance coverage. This leaves them vulnerable, with little protection for their labour or livelihood. The Market Intervention Scheme for apple procurement in Jammu and Kashmir addresses the needs of perishable agricultural and horticultural commodities excluded from the Minimum Support Price. By stabilising market prices and ensuring timely procurement, this initiative can safeguard farmers\u2019 livelihoods and reduce post-harvest losses.\n\nJ&K\u2019s economy hinges on a single national highway, its vital lifeline to the rest of the country. Yet, this crucial route is often blocked, leaving the region\u2019s trade at a standstill. The highway must be operational round the year, or alternative routes must emerge.\n\nBilal teaches politics at Government Degree College, Beerwah.

        "title": "Coral craze that guided business interests",
        "text": "Working on the history of Coral Merchant Street recently, I mused on how this marine invertebrate has had an importance far exceeding gems. Though the Sephardic Jewish merchants in Madras of the 17th and 18th Centuries traded in many precious stones, it is as coral merchants that they are remembered. And interestingly, it is one of two marine animal products used in jewellery that are commemorated in area names in George Town. After all, the eastern end is still known as Muthialpet (the pearl district), while just to the rear of it, where Coral Merchant Street is, was Pagadalupet (the coral district), though that name is largely forgotten. Of course, pearl and coral make for a good combination in Indian jewellery, but the importance of coral, over and above diamonds and emeralds, is intriguing to say the least. \n\nIn demand since Roman times \n\nIt was corals from the Mediterranean that Indians hankered after, and they were in demand from Roman times. The red variety was much sought after, and Indians were willing to pay high prices. Centuries later, when the colonials came along, the demand was undiminished. In fact, it had multiplied. And the Europeans saw an opportunity. A proper network was established and Portuguese Jewish dealers in London began sending out coral in large quantities to Madras. The proceeds from the sale were invested in diamonds, which were exported from here. Eventually, they sent representatives to settle here and carry on the Indian end of the business. \n\nCompany records are full of references to coral. As I have written in The Hindu dated October 23, 2015 (A Temple and Its Builder), it was by secretly selling a consignment of coral worth 1,200 pounds that Samudra Mudali, dubash to Governor Francis Hastings, made his fortune. In Ananda Ranga Pillai\u2019s diary, Governor Dupleix keeps asking him about the quantity of coral in stock and what prices it would fetch. And, in the 1760s, the enormously corrupt and wily George, Lord Pigot, managed to convince the Company that the Governor of Madras ought to get a 2 \u00bd percent cut on proceeds of all coral sales in the region. The money he made on this was one of the bones of contention with his council, which led to a coup against him and his mysterious death. The commission on coral would last till 1801, when Edward, the Second Lord Clive, as Governor, relinquished it. Having written all the above, I am yet to fathom what was the reason for such a high demand for coral. That it was in use for jewellery is certain, and it was also probably used as a constituent in aphrodisiacs, but what else could have contributed to the craze? By the 19th Century, it was on the wane and had become yet another item on ornaments. But while it lasted, it had a good run, and many in Madras did well out of it. \n\nNew light on New Street \n\nLast week\u2019s article on New Street had M.S.R. Ravichandran writing to me. He has been living there for five decades, he says, and his ancestors have been residents there for four generations. Though they always referred to it as Pudu Theru (New Street), he says land records from 1880 carry the name Sengazhuneer Pillaiyar Koil Street and there is a temple to Ganesha at the end of the thoroughfare. That had me checking my street directory of 1932 and sure enough, that is the correct name. Why did it become New Street and when remains a mystery. \n\n(V. Sriram is a writer and historian.)",

        "title": "Opinion: Save Indigenous languages",
        "text": "By Geetartha Pathak\r\n\r\nOn October 3, the Centre approved five new classical languages: Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali. This increased the total number of recognised classical languages in India to 11, which includes Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia. Some critics said political motivations could be behind such a move.\r\n\r\nThe Shiv Sena-BJP-led government in Maharashtra formed a \u201cpersuasion\u201d committee, led by former diplomat Dnyaneshwar Muley, a few months ago to get Marathi recognised as a classical language. The demand was raised many times by MPs from Maharashtra in Parliament, and the Centre gave assurances at least three times in the last 10 years that Marathi was being considered for according classical status.\r\n\r\nOdia was declared a classical language in 2014 after much political persuasion. Interestingly, Odia, which is viewed by many as a dialect of Bengali, got recognition as a classical language ten years before Bengali was recognised as a classical language. The Assembly elections in Maharashtra is next month and the timing of recognising Marathi as a classical language indicates the political angle to it. The inclusion of Bengali and Assamese too may have some link with the nearing of Assembly elections in these two States.\r\n\r\nDropping Key Provision\r\n\r\nThe Union Cabinet\u2019s decision to accord classical language status to these five languages came after a key provision, which mandated that a language must have an original literary tradition, was dropped. The Linguistic Expert Committee discussed and understood that it was very difficult to prove or disprove (original literary tradition) as all ancient languages borrowed from each other.\r\n\r\nThe initial criteria evolved by the government to determine the declaration of a language as classical are: it should have high antiquity of its early texts, recorded history of over 1,500-2,000 years, a body of ancient literature or texts that is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers, the literary tradition should be original and not borrowed from another speech community. Another criterion is that the said language and literature should be distinct from its modern format; there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots.\r\n\r\nOnce notified, the Education Ministry provides certain benefits to promote the language, which include two major annual international awards for scholars of eminence in the said languages. Apart from this, a centre of excellence for studies in the classical language is set up, and the University Grants Commission is requested to create a certain number of Professional Chairs in central universities for the languages that get the classical tag. These measures may help to some extent but to ensure the survival and growth of such languages much more efforts are needed. Moreover, all the 11 recognised classical languages are dominating languages in their respective States. The languages of the indigenous and tribal people need more attention as many such languages are vanishing fast.\r\n\r\nEndangered Language\r\n\r\nThe UNESCO recorded that 2,469 languages are at risk of extinction. With globalisation, major languages like English are pushing the languages with few speakers to the deathbed. Migration, cultural fusion and absence of written script are some of the reasons for the disappearance of languages. One of the examples of endangered language is Irish, which is also known as Gaeilge. It is an official language of the Republic of Ireland but is endangered due to historical factors and language shifts. Half of the languages that exist today worldwide will disappear over the next century. In Latin America and the Caribbean, one in every five indigenous people has already lost their native tongue \u2014 44% now speak Spanish and 55% Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThere are 7,000 documented languages currently spoken across the world, but half of them could be endangered, according to a new study. It is predicted that 1,500 known languages may no longer be spoken by the end of this century. Researchers from The Australian National University analysed thousands of languages to identify factors that put endangered ones at risk. The findings highlight a link between higher levels of schooling and language loss, as regionally dominant languages taught in class often overshadow indigenous languages.\r\n\r\nThe link between the endangering of language and more roads or climate change may sound like an absurd likelihood, however, it is real. \u201cWe found that the more roads there are, connecting country to city, and villages to towns, the higher the risk of languages being endangered. It is as if roads are helping dominant languages \u2018steamroll\u2019 over other smaller languages,\u201d said Professor Lindell Bromham, co-author of the above-mentioned study. Climate changes oblige the communities to relocate, creating climate change refugees. The catastrophes caused 23.7 million internal displacements in 2021, most of which were due to meteorological consequences.\r\n\r\nWith the material development, indigenous people are losing their land which is often appropriated by corporations vying to get a hold of natural resources. When biodiversity disappears, they lose access to their only source of livelihood. They are then forced to migrate to other rural or urban areas. When these communities split up, their languages begin to face a slow death. The split communities are often compelled to communicate with the dominant language of their new homes and over generations, the traditional tongues become extinct.\r\n\r\nPreserving Them\r\n\r\nWith each indigenous language that disappears, thinking, culture, tradition and the knowledge it encompasses is lost. Allowing a language to disappear is like burning books or bombing museums in wartime. An important part of humanity, its history and way of understanding the world disappear forever when this happens. Many of the languages predicted to be lost in future still have many speakers. Therefore, investing in supporting these Indigenous communities to revitalise their languages may alter the trend of vanishing languages.\r\n\r\nThe Rosetta Project, a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers is working to build a digital library of human languages. The project draws attention to the accelerated loss of the world\u2019s languages and could help preserve many endangered and \u201csleeping\u201d languages for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe UNESCO International Decade of Indigenous Languages, from 2022 to 2032, aims to engage the global community with the critical issue of language loss. The initiative continues the work of the UN\u2019s 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. As part of its plan, it is creating a network of international stakeholders focused on protecting the rights of Indigenous people to revitalise and preserve their languages. Cornish, a dead language spoken in a part of England, was revived with the help of the internet. People found each other online and communities around Cornish were formed. The language has even found its way back into schools. SGaawaay K\u2019uuna, the first feature-length film made completely in Haida, a Canadian indigenous language, encouraged film production in endangered languages. In 2018, it was honoured as the best Canadian film by the Vancouver International Film Festival and Vancouver Film Critics Circle.\r\n\r\nThe government of India should pay more attention to the dwindling Indigenous languages than according recognition to a handful of mainstream languages that too with political motivation and chalk out a project in line with the UNESCO and Rosetta Project, which may save many local communities\u2019 languages from extinction and our rich diverse human heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(The author is a senior journalist from Assam)",

He paid Rs 30 at the counter, expecting the clerk to return 50 paise since the postal fee for the specified destination was Rs 29.50.When Manasha insisted that the balance be returned, he was informed that the system automatically rounded off the amount to Rs 30. He then offered to pay the exact amount through UPI, which the post office declined by citing a technical issue.Manasha mentioned in his complaint to District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that India Post's alleged practice of rounding off daily transactions could lead to significant amounts of money being siphoned off, even resulting in black money and a loss of GST revenue for the government. The post office stated that amounts involving less than 50 paise were invariably \"ignored\" and that the software had been programmed to round off any such amount to the nearest rupee.On Manasha not being allowed to pay through UPI, the post office explained that the \"Pay U\" QR digital payment mode had been malfunctioning since Nov 2023 and was discontinued in May 2024. After hearing both sides, the commission said the post office had admitted to \"overcharging\" due to a software glitch, which amounted to an unfair trade practice under Section 2(47) of Consumer Protection Act, 2019.",

        "text": "Krishna is the avatar of Lord Vishnu that happened in the Dwapara yuga. The very purpose of this avatar was to eliminate the negative forces that existed during that time. Another linked incident is the three incarnations of Jaya and Vijaya, the door guardians of Vishnu. Third of their incarnation was Shishupala and Dantavakra. Vishnu taking the form of Krishna eliminated Shishupala and Dantavakra pair.\n\n\u2018Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum\u2019 is the prayerful reminder we have for ourselves. Krishna is the chaitanya, consciousness that prevails in all. Universal consciousness when took the human form, it assumed the shape and rupa of Sri Krishna. This is the reason we find that irrespective of number of problems Krishna faced in life, he was unperturbed. He was unshaken. Krishna is the epitome of the vyavahara gyana and also para vidya.\n\nBorn to imprisoned parents and inside the prison is not a good experience for any. Then getting separated from parents, growing up in a different context, and like \u2018one among them\u2019 could be done only by Krishna. Multiple attempts on the life of Sri Krishna have no parallel. Ranging from calf to donkey to cart to storm, the danger could come in any shape and form. One has to be constantly aware of. The final call came from the suspicious Kamsa that the brothers are \u201cinvited\u201d for the yagya that happened at the capital. The only aim was to eliminate brother duo. The attempt failed, and Kamsa lost life.\n\nKrishna\u2019s attached detachment is a wonder to be observed. The large group of Gopis owned up Krishna, and he never made it appear that he doesn\u2019t belong to them. Though he is worshiped as and the shloka-pada says \u2018Rukmini Satyabhamabhyam sahitam Sri Krishnam ashraye\u2019, many had Krishna as a part of them. He appreciated it, and allowed them the ownership of him. He was with everyone, and everyone felt he was only with them.\n\nPartha could win due to the \u2018Sarathi\u2019 he had. When the guiding light of life becomes Krishna, then our journey gets natural illumination. No false steps or mis-directions happen. Every step and every act shall be filled with dharma, balancing life with all the right acts for \u2018iha\u2019 and required acts for \u2018para\u2019 shall happen.

Last year, only eight teams participated in the tournament, and four years ago, only six teams featured in Quaid-e-Azam. \u201cQuaid-e-Azam Trophy is the pinnacle of domestic cricket in Pakistan as it is not just a tournament but also an event that showcases the immense talent across the country and prepares them for the challenges of international cricket. As always, we will continue to provide the best possible platform for players to excel and show their capabilities on the biggest stage in domestic cricket as they will be rubbing their shoulders with the best players of the country,\u201d Abdullah Niazi, the director of domestic operations, said in a statement. \u201cEarlier, we demonstrated a successful Champions One-Day Cup and are fully committed to strengthening our domestic structure. The successful execution of Quaid-e-Azam Trophy remains at the heart of this commitment,\u201d he added. A couple of days ago, the fate of Quaid-e-Azam was unclear. According to ESPNcricinfo, the tentative date for the tournament was October 20. ESPNcricinfo reported that the competition was postponed because the domestic cricket department was awaiting the chairman\u2019s sign-off. The Quaid-e-Azam will perfectly set Pakistan\u2019s upcoming Test series. With the final beginning on December 19, the PCB will have options to evaluate players before the first Test against South Africa on December 26. Pakistan\u2019s Test vice-captain, Saud Shakeel, suggested that the squad for the series should be prepared by using first-class competition. \u201cIf you want to prepare for SENA [series in South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia], you can do it during practice and first-class cricket. If there\u2019s first-class cricket before South Africa, we could prepare those kinds of pitches there. But we should prepare pitches and conditions series-by-series, and according to the opposition,\u201d Shakeel said in a press conference on Tuesday. (ANI)",

Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, anticipates further downside, especially in midcap and smallcap stocks. He suggests that the next significant support for the index is around 24,000, with potential resistance between 24,700 and 25,000 in case of a rebound. Mishra advises adjusting trades accordingly and cautions against adding to losing positions.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities notes that Nifty's short-term trend remains negative, and a decisive move below the 24,500-25,450 range could open the door for a further downside target of 24,000.

        "text": "Hindustan Zinc, owned by Vedanta and India\u2019s largest zinc and silver producer, has initiated a $2-2.5 billion (\u20b930,000 crore) capex plan to double its metal production to over 2 million tonnes, \u201cat least five-year period\u201d. \n\nThe company, in the coming weeks, will be engaging global contractors who would look at mine expansion and development. \n\n Mined metal will include doubling zinc capacity to 2 mt, lead and silver from 800 tonnes to 2000 tonnes.\n\n The company recently roped in a couple of international consultants - two Australian mine-planning and mine-contracting entities. It has also engaged a consultant to work on expanding zinc smelting capacity, a mix of greenfield and brownfield diversification. \n\n According to Arun Misra, CEO, Hindustan Zinc, the report they have said the mines have to be developed in a particular manner to make adequate ore for 2 million tonnes. \n\n \u201cSo for that, we are now inviting discussions with mining contractors who are global players. The mines have to be expanded. And around November-end or so, we should be able to fix the global contractor, whom we will appoint for starting the mine development,\u201d he told businessline during an interaction. Mine development apparently is the first part, following which production can take place.\n\n \u201cInvestments will be around $2 \u2013 2.5 billion or so, and it will be a through a mix of internal accruals and debt. We are working out the details and will be presenting it before the Board soon. However, these investments will be spread over a few years,\u201d Misra added. \n\n For FY25, the company has guided for a mined metal production of 1.2 mt and in H1 its production was around 0.52 mt. \n\n\u201cSo we are on course with our guidance. And sequentially mined metal capacities will be upped, say from 1.2 mt to 1.3 mt in the following year and so on,\u201d he said. \n\n The FY25 guidance also include 1.075 - 1.1 mt refined metal, and 750-775 tonnes saleable silver, with mined metal target of 1.2 mt to be achieved in FY26. \n\n During the recent analyst call, the Hindustan Zinc top brass said, expansion of capacity (mined metal) includes working-out on the logistics of how to transport the material out of the mine and then the concentrator expansion. Both these are \u201cfeasible and very easy to do\u201d. \n\n \u201cAs far as this 2 million tonne is concerned, project is feasible. There is no doubt on that. It is only the mining contractor\u2019s appointment and to see how the adequate metal in concentrate can be produced from the mine,\u201d the CEO had said.\n\n The company has however not shared how the production will be split across its existing mines. It operates six mines, all of which are located in Rajasthan. It has three smelter. Zinc smelting alone accounts of over 913,000 tonnes per annum. \n\n \u201cLet the project be done. But of course, we would love to have as much production from Agucha because that is the highest grid. And the biggest expansion that can happen with the current operations from is in Zawar mine, where (virgin) resources are available. So we will have to make a combination,\u201d Misra further said during the call. \n\n Consultant firm Systematix in a recent report said the company\u2019s growth trajectory \u201cappears to be fully priced in,\u201d and \u201cthe growth here-on is hinged on smelter capacity expansion and commissioning of the fertilizer plant in FY26\u201d.",

One plant will provide direct employment to around 400 people and subsequently around 500 more people will also get employment indirectly who will be engaged in transportation and other arrangements. The waste material from the plant will be natural manure and it will also promote organic farming,\u201d he added. CMD of Rama Group, Naresh Goyal said that they already had a plywood industry in Vindhya region and they were planning for its expansion which will result in creation of a lot of job opportunities. Additionally it will also help in increasing the income of the farmers as raw material required will be argo wood based things. \u201cWe already have a plywood industry in the Vindhya region and we are planning for its expansion. We have a meeting with CM Mohan Yadav and if our legal formalities are resolved then we will expand the plywood industry with an investment of Rs 100 crore. It will create a lot of job opportunities and the raw material used in it is argo wood based things which are grown by the farmers and its plant gets ready in 2-3 years. As a result of which the income of the farmers will also increase,\u201d Goyal said. Additionally, MD and CEO of Dalmia Bharat Limited, Puneet Dalmia told ANI, \u201cI am very excited and inspired to see such an event which is a regional event. Usually, all the conclaves happen in big cities. Still, I think we need to have conclaves in smaller cities like Rewa for a balanced development in India as it inspires many people. I am seeing a real impact of the double-engine government and Development is happening at a very fast pace.\u201d\u201cMadhya Pradesh is a land of opportunity, it has minerals, forest, tourism opportunities, and it has manpower who are very simple people. This state is strategically located at the centre of India and it has great opportunity for growth and a huge market. We want to be a part of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s growth story and we want to contribute to India\u2019s growth,\u201d Dalmia said. He further added that they wanted to make an investment of Rs 3,000 crores to set up a cement plant which would run on 100 per cent green energy and it would be the first such plant in the world. Besides, MP Minister Prahlad Patel praised Chief Minister Mohan Yadav saying it was the result of the CM\u2019s resolve and he had never seen a better situation than this in the state before.\u201cThis is the result of the resolve of the Chief Minister. I have never seen a better situation than this in Madhya Pradesh before. Investors have great confidence in the state administration. It is a very result-oriented step and 2024 will be scripted in history,\u201d Patel said",

        "text": "Hyderabad: The PIL panel of the Telangana High Court on an undertaking by the state\u2019s additional advocate general refused interim orders in a PIL seeking a blanket stay of demolitions on HYDRAA demolitions and Musi River Beautification Project. The panel heard at length Dr K.A. Paul Kilari Anand Paul, party in person who pointed out to the court the anguish and sorrow of those suffering \u201cunprecedented demolitions\u201d. The panel of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J. Sreenivas Rao are hearing a petition based on print, electronic, and social media reports. The petitioner pointed out that over 462 structures were pulled down by HYDRAA and that there was no respect to the rule of law in such large-scale demolitions. Even as the party in person made his plea citing global parallels, additional advocate general Imran Khan assured the court that the government was committed to the rule of law. He said that the government would strictly adhere to the procedure prescribed by the law. For a while, the court witnessed conflicting presentations on whether there were demolitions on the banks of river Musi. Since the petitioner relied highly on a recent judgment of the apex court, the panel observed that the said judgment would not apply in the instant case. Distinguishing the recent apex court judgment on large scale evictions, the panel pointed out that they did not apply to encroachments on river and water bodies. It not only recorded that the government had not filed its response to the allegations but it also held that in view of the undertaking given by the state, there was no need to pass an interim order. The panel in fact recorded its appreciation to the statement of additional advocate general reiterating the state government\u2019s commitment to the rule of law and said that no interim orders were necessary.",

The grants-in-aid from the Centre fared even worse at just Rs.2,447 crore, which accounts for a meagre 11.31 per cent of total Budget estimates of Rs.21,636 crore. Revenue through sales tax was impressive at Rs.16,081 crore, 48.08 per cent of the Rs.33,449 crore of budget estimates while that from Goods and Services Tax (GST) and stamps and registration was Rs.24,731 crore and `7,251 crore respectively by September-end.

With regard to expenditure, the state government incurred Rs.13,187 crore on account of interest payment, 74.38 per cent of Rs.17,729 crore projected for the year and Rs.21,279 crore on salaries and wages amounting to 53.14 per cent of the Rs.40,041 crore projected for the year. Payments in the form of pensions was on the higher side at Rs.8,560 crore, 73.54 per cent of Rs.11,641 crore projected for the entire fiscal.

This reliance not only poses challenges to energy security but also leads to a substantial outflow of foreign currency. However, with ethanol blending, India has a promising opportunity to reduce its dependence on imported oil while addressing environmental concerns. Ethanol, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, can be mixed with petrol, cutting down on fossil fuel consumption and reducing harmful carbon emissions that contribute to climate change and public health issues. The practice of blending ethanol with petrol began in 2001 as a pilot project. Yet, for many years, progress was slow, and ethanol production remained stagnant. Only recently, through a series of comprehensive reforms, has India been able to unlock the full potential of this initiative. These reforms are now driving substantial outcomes, not just by enhancing energy security, but also by revitalizing rural economies. Ethanol production offers a new source of income for farmers, supporting the agricultural sector and fostering economic growth in rural areas. The government\u2019s proactive approach to ethanol blending is evident in its decision to advance the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending from 2030 to 2025, demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable energy practices. During the 7th G-STIC Delhi Conference, Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, emphasized India\u2019s growing success in ethanol blending and its broader commitment to sustainable energy solutions. He highlighted that, in recognition of the progress made, the government has already begun planning for the future by exploring goals beyond the 20% ethanol blending target. This forward-looking approach indicates that India is not only focused on meeting its immediate energy needs but is also preparing for long-term sustainable energy solutions to address future demands. Ethanol is one of the primary biofuels, naturally produced through the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or through petrochemical processes like ethylene hydration. It is widely used not only as an alternative fuel source but also in various industries as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds. Ethanol also has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant, adding to its versatile uses. In the context of India\u2019s rising energy demand, driven by factors such as a growing economy, an expanding population, increasing urbanization, and evolving lifestyles, ethanol plays a critical role. As of March 2024, around 98 per cent of the fuel used in the road transportation sector comes from fossil fuels, while only two per cent is met by biofuels like ethanol. This dependency on fossil fuels presents challenges related to energy security, foreign currency outflow, and environmental impact. Ethanol, as a domestically produced biofuel, offers a strategic opportunity to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuels. When used responsibly, biofuels like ethanol are more environmentally friendly and sustainable, contributing to a cleaner energy landscape. Additionally, ethanol production and usage align with national goals like generating employment, promoting the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, supporting the Swachh Bharat Mission, and contributing to the doubling of farmers' incomes. It also fosters the creation of wealth from waste, further enhancing its importance to India\u2019s economy and energy security. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has embarked on a series of comprehensive reforms aimed at enhancing energy security, combating climate change, and boosting the rural economy. An indicative target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol was initially set for 2030 under the EBP Programme. However, in 2020, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) advanced this target to 2025, reflecting the government's commitment to accelerating ethanol usage. The progress of India\u2019s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme has been noteworthy, with the ethanol production capacity more than doubling in the last four years to reach 1,623 crore litres as of September 18, 2024. This substantial increase highlights the government's commitment to enhancing the role of ethanol in the nation\u2019s energy landscape. In the Ethanol Supply Year (ESY), which runs from November to October, the blending of ethanol with petrol stood at 38 crore litres with a blending percentage of 1.53 per cent in ESY 2013-14. Over the following years, the government implemented various initiatives that led to remarkable growth in ethanol blending. By ESY 2020-21, the blending volume surged to 302.3...",

Company bagged mixed responses from brokerages as they flagged concerns about volume growth, demand recovery and product portfolio across segments. \n\nNuvama Institutional Equities mentioned Hindustan Unilever has posted an overall in-line Q2 FY25 against its estimates. However, the volume growth was at 3 per cent y-o-y, below street\u2019s forecast of 4-5 per cent. \u201cA gradual rural recovery along with pricing growth coming back in H2FY25E/26E bodes well for HUL\u2019s long-term growth trajectory,\u201d it said.

Diverse product basked is expected to support steady growth recovery. However, Motilal Oswal has cut EPS estimates by 2 per cent each for FY25 and FY26.\n\nHUL remains HDFC Securities\u2019 top pick within the large-cap staples pack, as the worst is behind in terms of muted volume growth, pricing corrections, and rural weakness. The brokerage has maintained buy rating at a target price of \u20b93,200.\n\nJM Financial, which has assigned buy rating at a revised target price of \u20b92,870 from \u20b92,915 earlier, emphasised the moderation in urban market has come as a negative surprise. \n\nAmit Agarwal, Senior VP \u2013 Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities, stated that the inflation in crude palm oil and tea weighed on gross margins. Against expectations, HUL\u2019s competitive actions or new formulation in tea and soaps did not translate into volume growth, while home care and beauty segments were the bright spots in an otherwise tepid quarter, he added.\n\nAnalysts of Yes Securities have maintained neutral stance on HUL stock at a target price of \u20b92,845. HUL\u2019s Q2 results were in-line with their estimates. Underlying volume growth (UVG) decline in soaps and tea was offset by high-single-digit UVG in fabric wash & household care, the report read.\n\nAnalysts of Centrum Institutional Research have retained \u2018reduce\u2019 rating on HUL at a target price of \u20b92,697.

Separating ice cream business will have a lesser impact on HUL\u2019s earnings, according to Ajay Thakur, Research Analyst, Anand Rathi Institutional Equities.

        "title": "How to Open an FD Account with Attractive Interest Rates",
        "text": "Fixed Deposits (FDs) remain one of the most preferred investment options, especially for risk-averse individuals seeking a stable return. The guaranteed returns, relatively higher interest rates compared to a regular savings account, and flexibility in tenure make FDs a popular choice for many. However, with a wide variety of banks and financial institutions offering FD accounts, it's essential to know how to open FD account with attractive interest rates to maximise your returns.\nIn this article, we will explore the steps to open an FD account, discuss what to look for when selecting an FD, and highlight ways to secure the best FD interest rate for your investment.\nUnderstanding Fixed Deposits Before diving into how to open FD account, it's crucial to understand what a Fixed Deposit is. FDs are term deposits offered by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). You deposit a lump sum amount for a fixed tenure, and the bank offers a predetermined FD interest rate for that period. At the end of the tenure, you receive your principal along with the accrued interest.\nThe interest rate on FDs varies depending on the bank or financial institution, the tenure, and the type of FD (cumulative or non-cumulative). Some institutions may offer senior citizens and existing customers preferential interest rates.\nSteps to open FD account Opening an FD account is relatively simple and can be done through both online and offline channels. Heres a detailed guide on how to open FD account.\n1. Choose the Right Financial Institution The first and most crucial step is to choose the right bank or NBFC. Different banks offer varying FD interest rates based on the deposit amount and tenure. Its essential to compare interest rates from multiple institutions to find the most attractive offer. While banks are considered safer, NBFCs often offer higher interest rates but come with slightly higher risk. Ensure the institution is reputed and offers secure services.\n2. Determine the Investment Amount Once you've selected a financial institution, the next step is to decide how much you want to invest. The minimum deposit required for an FD account can vary between institutions, ranging from as low as \u00e2\u0082\u00b91,000 to higher amounts for special schemes. Decide your investment based on your financial goals, liquidity requirements, and the FD interest rate offered.\n3. Select the Tenure FDs come with varying tenures, ranging from seven days to ten years. You can select a short-term or long-term FD based on your financial needs. Usually, longer tenures offer better interest rates, but it's crucial to evaluate your liquidity needs before locking in your money for an extended period. If you are looking for attractive returns, opt for a tenure that offers a higher FD interest rate without compromising your financial flexibility.\n4. Choose Between Cumulative and Non-Cumulative FD When opening an FD account, you need to decide between cumulative and non-cumulative options. In a cumulative FD, interest is compounded and paid at the end of the tenure, offering a higher return. A non-cumulative FD pays interest at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually). If youre looking for regular income, a non-cumulative FD might be better, while a cumulative FD is ideal if youre focused on long-term wealth building.\n5. Apply to open FD account Once youve finalised the institution, amount, tenure, and type of FD, the next step is to apply to open FD account. This can be done online or by visiting a bank branch. If you are an existing customer of the bank, opening an FD online is straightforward and quick.\nFor offline account opening, visit the nearest branch of the bank or NBFC with the required documents, including proof of identity, proof of address, and passport-sized photographs. Complete the application form and submit the documents to the bank representative. Once your application is processed, your FD account will be opened.\n6. Monitor the FD Interest Rates Interest rates fluctuate depending on market conditions and the policies of financial institutions. To secure the best FD interest rate, keep an eye on the current rates before opening your FD account. Some institutions also offer promotional interest rates during specific periods, which can help you earn higher returns. Regular monitoring of interest rates ensures that you open your FD at the best possible time.\nSecuring Attractive FD Interest Rates When opening an FD account, your primary goal is to maximise the FD interest rate to grow your wealth effectively. Here are some strategies to secure attractive interest rates:\n1. Compare Rates Across Banks and NBFCs Interest rates on FDs vary significantly between institutions. It's essential to compare rates across different banks and NBFCs to find the best option. Some financial institutions offer higher rates for specific tenures or during promotional periods. Additionally, NBFCs generally offer better rates than banks, although they may carry slightly higher risk.\n2. Opt for Special FD Schemes Many banks offer special FD schemes with higher interest rates for specific tenures or deposit amounts. These schemes are often available for limited periods, and they can provide a substantial boost to your returns. Keep an eye out for these offers when you decide to open FD account.\n3. Look for Senior Citizen Benefits If you're a senior citizen, you can take advantage of preferential interest rates offered by most banks and NBFCs. Typically, senior citizens receive an additional 0.25% to 0.50% interest on top of the standard rates. This can significantly enhance your returns.\n4. Consider Long-Term FDs Longer-term FDs generally offer higher interest rates than short-term ones. If you can afford to lock your funds for an extended period, consider choosing a long-term FD with a higher FD interest rate. However, ensure you dont require liquidity during the tenure, as premature withdrawals may lead to penalties and lower interest earnings.\nThe Impact of FD Interest Rates on Your Returns The FD interest rate plays a crucial role in determining the returns on your investment. A higher interest rate ensures that your deposit grows faster. To understand the impact of interest rates, consider using an FD calculator. This tool helps you calculate your estimated earnings based on the deposit amount, tenure, and interest rate, allowing you to choose the best option for your needs.\nBefore opening an FD account, also take into account the frequency of interest compounding (monthly, quarterly, or annually) as it can affect your total returns. Compounding at shorter intervals leads to higher returns.\nConclusion Opening an FD account with attractive FD interest rates requires careful planning and research. Begin by comparing the interest rates offered by various banks and NBFCs, and choose a tenure and type of FD that aligns with your financial goals. Whether youre looking for long-term wealth accumulation or regular income, FDs can be a reliable investment option. Always keep an eye on promotional rates and special schemes that can help you earn higher returns.\nCheck more details at www.bajajfinserv.in/investments/fixed-deposit \nWith the right strategy and timely decisions, you can open FD account that maximises your savings and secures your financial future. By selecting a bank or NBFC that offers attractive interest rates, opting for tax-saving FDs, and monitoring market trends, you can ensure your fixed deposit yields optimal results.",

        "text": "Tirupati: Tobacco growers in Andhra Pradesh are enjoying a windfall this season, as a surge in demand has led to record-breaking prices, with some farmers earning as much as Rs 360 per kg for premium-quality tobacco. The favourable market conditions have turned the 2023-24 season into one of the most profitable years in recent memory, attracting widespread attention from growers hoping to cash in.This season, tobacco sales across the Nellore district reached 46.8 million kg, with the highest average prices ever recorded at multiple auction centers. Farmers are thrilled, and many are already preparing to expand their acreage next year despite warnings from officials about overproduction and rising land lease costs.In the Southern Light Soils (SLS) region, which comprises the auction centers Kandukur-1, Kandukur-2, DC Palli and Kaligiri, sales commenced on March 6. Auctions at DC Palli and Kaligiri closed on October 14, while the Kandukur-1 centre concluded on Monday. The auction process stretched over 140 days, longer than usual. The highest quality tobacco attracted a record price of Rs 360 per kg, a first in the SLS region. The average price at various centres for the 2023-24 season was Rs 270 per kg, a notable Rs 50 increase from the previous year's Rs 220. \u201cWe have never seen prices like this in my 20 years of farming. I was able to sell my crop for an average of Rs 270 per kg. This season has been life-changing for us,\u201d said K. Rajesh, a farmer from Kandukur-2. Another farmer, Ramana Reddy from Kandukur-1, echoed similar sentiments saying, \u201cLast year was good, but this year was exceptional. With the profits, I am able to clear my debts and invest in better seeds for next season.\u201d However, amid the excitement, the Tobacco Board has issued a word of caution to farmers about the potential risks of increasing the acreage. \"Farmers should be cautious. While this season has seen record profits, the market is unpredictable, and it is important not to assume prices will remain at these levels. Over-expansion can lead to a surplus and drive the prices down,\" a tobacco board official said.The official also warned against the illegal construction of unauthorized barns to store tobacco, emphasising the legal risks and urging farmers to follow the approved guidelines. \"It is important for farmers to focus on improving efficiency, cutting costs and maintaining quality rather than chasing more land and barns that could lead to financial strain in the future,\" he added.",

        "text": "Tuesday saw a significant downturn in the Indian stock market, with major indices including the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 experiencing notable declines. By afternoon, the BSE Sensex had fallen by 787.64 points, marking a 0.97 per cent decrease, positioning it at 80,363.63. Similarly, the Nifty 50 dipped by 262.50 points or by 1.06 per cent, bringing it to 24,518.This downturn affected a broad spectrum of stocks, particularly within the small-cap segment, signalling widespread selling pressure and a shift in investor sentiment.The majority of stocks within the BSE Sensex were observed to be in decline. Tata Steel led the downward trend with a 1.16 per cent drop, closely followed by significant losses in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors, SBI, and IndusInd Bank.Conversely, a few companies managed to buck the trend, with UltraTech Cement seeing an increase of 1.61 per cent, alongside gains in Titan, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and Power Grid Corp.Similarly, the Nifty 50 saw 28 of its 50 stocks decline, with SBI Life, HDFC Life, Shriram Finance, BEL, and Kotak Mahindra Bank experiencing the most significant drops.Market Sector VariancesDifferences were also noted across various market sectors. IT, FMCG, Financial Services, and Private Bank indices were among the few that traded higher, contrasting sharply with the Realty index, which fell by 1.15 per cent. This downturn was echoed by losses in the PSU Bank, Metal, and Auto indices. In the broader market, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 also faced declines, down by 0.29 per cent and 0.83 per cent respectively, further highlighting the days general market downturn.Impact on Individual StocksIn particular, individual stocks faced significant challenges. Amber Enterprises India saw a sharp 13 per cent drop, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Jupiter Wagons among others experienced declines exceeding 5 per cent. This overall trend suggests a cautious or negative outlook from investors, particularly towards small-cap stocks, which have previously enjoyed robust investor sentiment and strong valuations.The decrease in the valuation of small-cap stocks is a point of concern among analysts, indicating a potential overvaluation. Motilal Oswal, a domestic brokerage firm, has pointed out that the market capitalisation-to-GDP ratio for large, mid, and small caps continues to be at historical highs, with small caps surpassing midcaps. This suggests that despite the appeal of small-cap stocks as affordable alternatives to their larger counterparts, their steep valuations have become a point of contention.The sentiment shift and selling pressure, particularly in the small-cap segment, reflect a broader trend of reassessment among investors. This cautious approach is spurred by disappointments in the Q2 earnings season and a scarcity of fresh catalysts for further gains. As investors engage in profit-taking, the allure of small-cap stocks, once seen as key growth opportunities, has diminished.In wrapping up, Tuesdays market activity underscored the volatility and shifting dynamics within the Indian equity markets. While certain sectors and stocks managed to navigate the turbulence, the overall trend signalled caution, particularly towards small-cap stocks. As investors recalibrate their strategies in light of recent developments, the focus may increasingly shift towards sectors and stocks considered more stable or offering better value amidst the current market conditions.",

        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world\u2019s leading generative AI technology.The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment.The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry\u2019s belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement.Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter.Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank\u2019s investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated.In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \u201cAI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \u201cAnd this is just the start.\u201dThe huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \u201cPeople are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\u201d said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year \u2013 adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn\u2019t exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round.Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \u201cthe most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\u201dApple Inc. didn\u2019t participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs.The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company\u2019s board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure \u2014 an unusual organization that has frustrated investors \u2014 to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company\u2019s backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company \u2014 a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI\u2019s board said it hasn\u2019t discussed specific numbers.OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported.A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees \u2014 such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also...",

        "text": "Shares of Marico hit a record high of Rs 719.80, gaining 4 per cent on the BSE in Thursday\u2019s intra-day trade in an otherwise weak market on stable volume growth in July to September quarter (Q2FY25). The stock surpassed its previous high of Rs 713.60 touched on September 27, 2024.At 02:18 pm; Marico had erased its intra-day gain and was trading 0.5 per cent higher at Rs 696.50 on the BSE. In comparison, the BSE Sensex tanked 2.1 per cent or 1,781 points at 82,485. In the last six months, the stock has outperformed the market by surging 41 per cent, as against a near 12 per cent rise in the benchmark index.Marico in its Q2 quarterly update said that consolidated revenue growth remained in high single digits, as higher realisations in the domestic business was offset by incremental currency headwinds in some overseas markets. The company expects consolidated revenue growth to move into double digits in the second half of the year and expects to deliver double-digit revenue growth in this year.The sector witnessed stable demand trends with rural outperforming urban on a year-on-year basis for the third quarter in a row. In the given context, the domestic business posted mid-single digit volume growth, exhibiting improvement on a sequential basis, Marico said.The management said the International business delivered robust low teen constant currency (CC) growth with each of the markets contributing positively. Bangladesh posted high-single digit growth, demonstrating the strong resilience of the company\u2019s business model amidst a challenging operating environment which has now largely stabilized. Vietnam also grew in high single digits, while MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and South Africa maintained their robust double digit growth trajectory.However, Marico expects gross margin to moderate on a year-on-year basis owing to partial absorption of higher input costs, as the Company prioritized expanding its consumer franchise in the current demand environment. Consequently, the company expects a moderate lag in operating profit growth vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.Among key inputs, copra prices rose ahead of internal forecasts and the recent import duty hike led to vegetable oil prices moving higher towards the end of the quarter. Crude oil derivatives, however, remained rangebound.On outlook, Marico said the company remains focused on achieving double-digit revenue growth while managing margin pressures from commodity inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.After a weak update from Dabur, Marico\u2019s update reassured investors. The numbers are largely in line with our estimates, said analysts at Nuvama Wealth Management. Value Added Hair Oils (VAHO) and Saffola Oils remain muted.The brokerage firm said Marico\u2019s consolidated revenue growth is likely to be 8 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Domestic business shall clock 5 per cent volume growth YoY. The International business shall deliver 13 per cent CC growth. Bangladesh shall post high-single digit growth amid a turbulent operating environment. Copra experienced inflation higher than expectations. Parachute shall see mid-single digit volume and double-digit revenue growth.

        "text": "Stock market crash today: In the aftermath of the bloodbath at the Dalal-street on Thursday, investors lost a total of Rs 9.7 trillion in market capitalisation on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At Tuesday's close, the total market capitalisation of companies listed on the BSE stood at around Rs 474 trillion - this was pulled down to Rs 465 trillion on Thursday. However, in intraday deals, investors losses mounted to Rs 10.56 trillion with the total market capitalisation of the BSE slipping to Rs 464 trillion. The market breath also favoured the declines as around 2,875 stocks traded losses versus advances by 985 stocks, with 109 remaining unchanged. In terms of contribution to the 30-blue chip stock index, BSE Sensex\u2019s decline, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank led the way, pulling Sensex down in its sharpest decline since August 05. The BSE Sensex plunged 1,832 points or 2.17 per cent to 82,434 level in intraday deals. Meanwhile, Nifty50 slipped to an intraday low of 566 points, down 2.19 per cent to 25,230.30 level in intraday trade. That apart, the country's volatility indicator, India VIX jumped to 11.72 per cent. Among sectors, Nifty Realty was clear loser ending the day 4.36 per cent lower and was followed by Nifty Auto slipping 2.88 per cent, Nifty Private Bank declining 2.61 per cent and Nifty Financial Services sliding 2.59 per cent. According to analysts, today\u2019s sharp decline was driven by several negative factors, including escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by Sebi and strength in the Chinese market, following the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) stimulus package. \u201cSpeculation is growing that Israel may retaliate by targeting major oil fields in Iran, which could further fuel the rise in oil prices. Additionally, recent regulatory changes in the F&O segment by SEBI are expected to impact trading volumes, as retail participation may decline due to the increased contract size and limits on weekly expiries,\u201d said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP, research & advisory at Master Capital Services.Analysts also concurred that the foreign money is being diverted from India to China as the country became attractive to investors following its government\u2019s stimulus package. \u201cThere has been a notable outflow of Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) money from India to China over the past few days, exerting pressure on large-cap stocks. Lastly, profit booking ahead of state elections and concerns over elevated valuations have added to the downward pressure,\u201d stated Santosh Meena, head of research, Swastika Investmart. .storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "The Airports Authority of India\u2019s Madurai Airport commenced 24-hour operations with effect from October 1, 2024. This milestone marks a significant step towards enhancing connectivity, providing a seamless travel experience and supporting the growth of regional as well as national Air traffic. This will provide flexibility to Airlines, Non-Scheduled operators, Medical flights and General Aviation for efficient planning of Aircraft operations. Airlines can also plan bases at Madurai Airport. This will also enable effective use of Airport Infrastructure and resources, read an official statement.At an event organised at Madurai Airport to formally start the 24-hour operations, M. Suresh, Chairman, AAI underscored the organisation\u2019s strategic approach towards this transformative upgrade. He also emphasised the widespread benefits of the commencement of round-the-clock operations from the Airport. The event also saw the esteemed presence of MP, Manickam Tagore, MP, S. Venkatesan, MLA, V. V. Rajan Chellappa, MLA, A.M.S.G. Ashokan and senior officials from the District Administration.At present Madurai has 248 scheduled movements in a week and is connected to cities like Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Singapore, Dubai and Colombo. Additionally, there is a demand for flight connectivity to other cities of India like Pune, Goa, Kolkata, Cochin, Bhubaneshwar, Varanasi, Guwahati, etc. With round-the-clock operations, the weekly scheduled movements in the winter season of 2024 are expected to be around 344 movements for Madurai Airport.Extending operational hours will allow more flights to land and take off, thereby improving connectivity, especially for flights of long-haul routes. This will attract more airlines and routes, making Madurai Airport a more prominent hub.Travellers will have more flexible flight options, making travel easier and more convenient. This will enhance passenger satisfaction and attract more travellers to Madurai.With more flights and passengers, local businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation services will likely see increased demand. This will lead to job creation and stimulate the local economy. Madurai has a rich cultural and religious heritage. Round-the-clock operations will make this city more accessible to tourists, especially those from different time zones, contributing to the growth of the tourism sector. 24-hour operations will also facilitate better cargo handling, allowing for more efficient logistics operations. This will attract businesses that rely on air freight, further boosting the local economy. It will also enable the locals to have better access to enhanced medical facilities.With the starting of 24-hour operations, a Night parking facility will be available at Madurai Airport as well. This will help the Airport to facilitate connections not only within India but also to international destinations. Since most international operators prefer to operate during night time from India, 24-hour operations will encourage airlines to consider international operations from Madurai Airport. It will also allow airlines to plan night parking at the Airport and plan base flights. Transitioning Madurai Airport to 24-hour operations presents a compelling opportunity to enhance Passenger service, drive economic growth, and improve overall operational efficiency. By embracing this change, the Airport can position itself as the leading airport in the country, catering to the diverse needs of passengers and contributing to the region\u2019s overall development. Implementing these extended hours will not only meet the demands of a growing travel market but also support Madurai\u2019s aspirations as a vital transportation hub in the region",

        "text": "The rupee depreciated 14 paise to settle at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as the volatile geopolitical situation triggered a surge in crude oil prices, weighed down by a steep fall of over two per cent in domestic equity markets. According to forex traders, a strong American currency and unabated outflow of foreign funds fuelled by the bullish Chinese markets also accelerated the rupee's slide. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.91 and touched a low of 83.97 against the greenback during intra-day trading. The unit ended the session at 83.96 (provisional) against the American currency, registering a steep loss of 14 paise from its previous closing level. On Tuesday, the rupee settled 3 paise lower at 83.82 against the American currency. Forex markets were closed on Wednesday on account of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. According to Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the rupee declined on weak domestic markets and a strong dollar, while a surge in crude oil prices also weighed on the domestic unit. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a slight negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"Traders may take cues from ISM services PMI, weekly unemployment claims and factory orders data from the US. Investors may watch out for a non-farm payrolls report from the US on Friday. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.66 per cent to $75.13 in futures trade. Experts attributed the spike in crude prices to the fear of Israel's retaliatory attacks on Iran's oil installations amid escalating tension in West Asia. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex crashed 1,769.19 points, or 2.10 per cent, to settle at 82,497.10, while the Nifty tanked 546.80 points, or 2.12 per cent to close the session at 25,250.10.

FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b915,000 crore since Monday. Analysts said foreign investors rushed to sell Indian equities as Chinese stocks turned bullish after the country announced a slew of stimulus measures to revive the economy. On the domestic macroeconomic front, a monthly survey released on Tuesday showed India's manufacturing sector growth fell to an eight-month low in September amid a softer increase in factory production, sales and new export orders. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from 57.5 in August to 56.5 in September, registering the weakest pace of growth since January.",

        "title": "OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion In Funds at $157 Billion Value",
        "text": "OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world's leading generative AI technology. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment. The deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry's belief in the power of AI and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement. Other investors writing major checks included Tiger Global Management, which put in $350 million, and Altimeter Capital, which invested at least $250 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Global backers participating in the round included SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX. SoftBank's investment was $500 million, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Venture firm Coatue also participated. In a statement, the company said it would use the cash influx to drive forward AI research and increase its computing capacity. \"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating health care breakthroughs and driving productivity,\" OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. \"And this is just the start.\" The huge valuation for OpenAI has transfixed Silicon Valley. \"People are shocked at 150 billion bucks,\" said Altimeter Chief Executive Officer Brad Gerstner, speaking on stage at the Madrona IA Summit in Seattle on Wednesday. But he also cited reports that the startup expects to generate more than $10 billion in revenue next year - adding that a multiple of 10 times projected revenue isn't exorbitant for a company about to go public, giving Google and Facebook as comparable examples. The latest deal values OpenAI at more than $150 billion pre-money, before including the dollars raised in this round. Gerstner also said he hoped OpenAI would soon go public, and that it was the logical next step for the startup, which he called \"the most important AI company in the United States, next to Nvidia.\" Apple Inc. didn't participate in the deal, although the company was previously in talks to invest, Bloomberg has reported. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT on its devices and through its Siri voice assistant. As part of that accord, Apple was previously in discussions to get a board observer role on OpenAI's board, although those plans were dropped, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Some of the funding round was invested through so-called special purpose vehicles, where backers can pool money from a wider array of investors to buy a portion of the shares. For example, in addition to contributing its own capital, Thrive put together an SPV to invest in the company, one person said. OpenAI declined to comment on the SPVs. The financing deal follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company's board fired and then quickly rehired CEO Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees, and lost several key leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. At the same time, OpenAI is discussing moving from its nonprofit structure - an unusual organization that has frustrated investors - to a for-profit model. The move would appease the company's backers, but could pose legal hurdles. As part of a transition, OpenAI has discussed awarding Altman equity in the company - a stake that could be worth more than $10 billion, though OpenAI's board said it hasn't discussed specific numbers. OpenAI kicked off a Silicon Valley obsession with the potential of AI when it debuted its chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022. The tool can generate human-sounding responses to questions, and has amassed 250 million weekly active users, the company said. Its paid service, ChatGPT Plus, has 11 million subscribers, one person said. And its business-focused service has more than 1 million users, as Bloomberg has previously reported. A slate of new companies have sprung up to compete with OpenAI in recent years, including several that have been founded by former OpenAI employees - such as Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. OpenAI is also facing intense competition from larger tech companies with vast resources, including Google and Amazon.com Inc., which are also developing their own AI models. In this funding round, OpenAI discouraged investors from backing rival companies, such as Anthropic or Musk's AI startup xAI, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg earlier reported that leading venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which backed Safe Superintelligence, would not participate in the newest fundraising.

        "title": "Lock into attractive SCSS, FD returns before interest rate cuts begin",
        "text": "Interest rates are expected to decline soon after remaining elevated for an extended period. After the US Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 50-basis-point (bps) cut, other central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will likely follow suit.\u201cThis is a good time to take fixed-income exposure at elevated rates before the softening starts,\u201d says Amol Joshi, founder, PlanRupee Investment Managers.Rate cuts on the horizonThe RBI has projected inflation at 4.5 per cent for financial year 2025 (FY25), close to its 4 per cent target. With the current repo rate at 6.5 per cent, experts anticipate a 50 basis point cut soon. \u201cI see a repo rate cut of 50 bps to 6 per cent,\u201d says Joydeep Sen, author and corporate trainer (debt).\u201cRBI may cut rates by 50 bps over the next six months, starting with a 25 bps cut in December,\u201d says Pankaj Mathpal, managing director, Optima Money Managers. Current rates are attractiveFixed-income instruments such as bank fixed deposits (FDs), corporate FDs, and small savings schemes (SSS) are currently offering attractive returns. For example, bank FDs of two to three years\u2019 duration are yielding 7 per cent, while the government has kept SSS rates unchanged as of September 30, 2024. \u201cIf you want to invest in FDs or the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme (SCSS), now is the right time. Investors can also consider long-term debt funds,\u201d says Mathpal.Sen notes that any reduction in bank FD rates will lag behind the RBI\u2019s actions. \u201cBank deposit rates will ease but may not align directly with RBI rate cuts, as credit demand remains strong, and banks need deposits,\u201d he explains.Which instruments look good?Several fixed-income products currently offer attractive rates. The SCSS, with an 8.2 per cent interest rate that can be locked in for five years, remains one of the most attractive. The scheme\u2019s investment limit has been enhanced to Rs 30 lakh.The Mahila Samman Certificate offers 7.5 per cent interest for two years on deposits up to Rs 2 lakh. Select corporate FDs offering around 9 per cent are worth considering. Banks are offering attractive rates for 12-15 month FDs. Investors with a longer time frame will, however, be better off investing in longer-tenured FDs.\u201cSenior citizens should capitalise on high SCSS rates and lock in investments now. For short-term needs, FDs are a good option. NBFC FDs offer slightly higher rates than bank FDs,\u201d says Mathpal. As a rule, match your investment timeframe with the product\u2019s tenure, as premature withdrawals lead to penalties.Avoid floating rate instruments With interest rates set to fall, floating-rate instruments like RBI Floating Rate Savings Bonds may not be ideal. They currently offer 8.05 per cent (35 bps higher than the 7.7 per cent offered by the National Savings Certificate). \u201cFloating-rate instruments will adjust downwards as rates drop, so they are not suitable in a declining interest-rate environment,\u201d says Joshi.Focus on goals and allocationInvest according to your horizon. \u201cYoung investors should focus more on equity, while retired senior citizens should prioritise fixed income. Mid-career investors should aim for a balanced allocation,\u201d says Sen.Fixed income allocation should also depend on investment horizon and risk appetite. \u201cInvestors with lower risk tolerance and short-term goals should focus on debt instruments,\u201d says Mathpal..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Leading artificial intelligence research company OpenAI announced this week that it has closed an enormous funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion. This massive injection of capital positions OpenAI as one of the highest valued private companies in the world. The round was led by previous investor Thrive Capital, with Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, Khosla Ventures and others also participating. This brings OpenAI's total funding to nearly $18 billion since its founding in 2015. OpenAI says the new funds will allow it to expand its AI research, build new tools, and grow its infrastructure to handle increasing demands on its systems. OpenAI has become the worldwide leader in generative AI models like ChatGPT, which has over 250 million users. The company is also known for developing powerful transformer models for natural language processing, computer vision and other domains. However, continued progress requires vast computing resources and talent \u2013 two things that do not come cheaply. OpenAI reportedly spends billions each year on research costs like training new models as well as hiring top AI scientists and engineers. Sustaining this level of spending is likely why OpenAI sought such a gargantuan funding round. The company faces intensifying competition from DeepMind, Anthropic, xAi and others working in similar areas. Microsoft has also become a close partner, building products using OpenAI technology. To maintain its advantages, OpenAI needs ample funds to recruit top people, invest in the latest hardware and pursue ambitious long-term research goals. With over $17 billion in capital raised to date, OpenAI is now in an elite class of private unicorns. How the company utilizes these massive new resources, and whether it can fulfill its lofty visions, will be exciting to watch unfold in the coming years. For now, OpenAI's dominant position in critical AI domains seems set to continue fueling innovative advances that impact technology worldwide.",

        "text": "Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, plunged in trade on Thursday, mirroring global cues on the back of increased Middle East tensions and rising crude prices. BSE Sensex closed the day, down 2.10% at 82,497.10, and Nifty50 closed the day at 25,250.10, down 2.12%.The bloodbath on Dalal Street left equity investors poorer by Rs 9.78 lakh crore. The market capitalization of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) plummeted by Rs 9,78,778.57 crore, bringing the total value down to Rs 4,65,07,685.08 crore ($ 5.54 trillion) in just one trading session. In the last few days, BSE Sensex has corrected around 4% from the near 86,000 high it hit last week. The risk of a broader regional conflict has increased following Iran's missile strike on Israel. While Iran insisted it has \"no interest in a broader war\" after the attacks, Israel has vowed to strike back. Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory firm, noted in a client note that \"Iran's decision to respond to devastating attacks from Israel against its proxy Hezbollah, including a new ground offensive, with a ballistic missile strike against Israel, raises the risk of a wider regional conflict that could draw in the US and disrupt oil markets. However, according to an ET report, market analysts suggest that the potential downsides in stock markets could be contained.Stock market outlook: Where are Sensex & Nifty headed?According to Sandeep Raina, Executive Vice President-Research, Nuvama Professional, the market correction is temporary in nature. \u201cThe changes in derivative regulations and the expiry scheduled for today has led to the corrections in the market,\u201d Raina told TOI. \u201cHowever, this is a temporary reaction and we don't expect any major corrections. The markets should stabilize and return to normal levels in the coming days,\u201d he said.Escalating tensions in the Middle East have led to a surge in oil prices, with concerns that supplies from major producers could be disrupted. For countries that heavily rely on oil imports, such as India, the increase in crude prices is a significant concern, as it can have a substantial impact on their import bill and overall economy.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, warned, \"The situation will change if Israel attacks any oil installations in Iran which will trigger a huge spike in crude. If it happens, it can turn out to be more damaging for oil importers like India. Therefore, investors should watch the emerging situation very closely.\" Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers predicts heightened volatility in Indian stock markets in the coming weeks.\u201cThe current geopolitical induced risks and ongoing US election cycle may continue to impact global markets including India in the short term. Also, we are entering the results season starting next week and that is also going to add to the moves depending on the quality of results,\u201d Solanki told TOI.\u201cHence, I see near term 2-3 weeks of heightened news based volatility in the markets. Investors may book some profits in stocks which have run up way ahead of fundamentals and could look for new ideas and add in a staggered manner,\u201d he said.Chinese dragon roars: India\u2019s biggest worryFor investors in India, the resurgence of Chinese stocks, which have underperformed in recent years, could be a more significant concern, feel analysts. The Chinese government recently announced a series of economic stimulus measures, which has led to predictions by analysts that the rebound in Chinese stocks could be sustained. As a result, there is a possibility that some funds may be redirected from India to China, as global investors have been favoring India over China in recent times.The recent stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government is being hailed as a game-changer for the nation's economy and stock markets. Victoria Mio, head of Greater China equities and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, believes that this shift in focus from debt control to growth support could be the key to restoring investor confidence and unlocking value in China's markets.\"As global investors seek stability amidst uncertainty, the Chinese government's decisive pivot from debt control to growth support could be the catalyst needed to restore confidence and unlock value in China's markets.\"The impact of this stimulus package is already being felt in the Chinese stock market, with the SSE Composite index gaining over 15% in the past week, including an impressive 8% rise on Tuesday. Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, attributes this surge to a combination of short covering and a growing belief in the effectiveness of the government's policies. He also suggests that some of the capital outflows from India may have been redirected to China to capitalize on the sharp rally.Looking ahead, Holland believes that global interest rate cuts will benefit all emerging markets. For India specifically, investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming results season to gauge the health of the economy and individual companies.",

        "text": "Amid long-standing calls by private port players to bring parity between recent winners of public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports and players with older contracts, the Centre has released draft guidelines for tariff migration, allowing concessionaires to switch to a market-based tariff regime.\u201cIn the past, tariffs were regulated due to a limited competitive landscape, but the evolving market and competitive landscape necessitates deregulation. The original objective of introducing the tariff regulations in 2005 included safeguarding the interest of users, while ensuring fair returns to the port and encouraging competition and efficiency. The long-term objective outlined in the Tariff Guidelines 2005 was competitive pricing. The market and competitive landscape in the Indian port sector have since witnessed a significant shift,\u201d the shipping ministry said in the draft guidelines.Currently, tariffs for private operators at central government ports are regulated under three separate regimes \u2014 Tariff Guidelines 2005 (superseded by Tariff Guidelines 2019), Tariff Guidelines 2008, and those of 2013.The draft guidelines will allow PPP players to fix their own scale of rates (SOR) and will require them to sign a supplementary agreement.Previously, the major port authorities were both service providers to end users and the concessioning authority. Thus, the tariff regulations played an important role in safeguarding the interests of both port users and PPP operators.According to the Centre, with the transition to the landlord port model and increased private sector participation, the utility of tariff regulations (and fixation) in this context has diminished.Several PPP operators had also raised concerns with the ministry in the past, stating they were at a disadvantage compared to fully private ports, as there was no parity in tariff fixation, making PPP projects less desirable.While the new regulations allow pricing freedom, they will not hinder government revenues earned from these PPP projects, as there will be no change in royalty.\u201cAs an additional measure, the royalty as revenue share of the major port should/would not go below what it would have got under the regime when the tariff was fixed/determined as per the Tariff Guidelines. This would be done by converting the revenue share to royalty based on the annual revenue requirement of the project as determined earlier,\u201d the draft guidelines said.The government has invited stakeholders to send their inputs by 25 October..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Shopping malls can avail GST Input Tax Credit on construction expenses, says SC",
        "text": "In a boost to commercial real estate and infrastructure projects, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that if the building is constructed for supplying services such as renting or leasing out, it can be regarded as a plant and input tax credit (ITC) under GST will be eligible. However, it rejected constitutional validity challenge to blocked credit provisions in the GST law. \u201cIf the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, the building could be held to be a plant,\u201d a division bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol said. ITC norms With this the apex court upheld Odisha High Court\u2019s ruling in the matter of Safari Retreats. The issue here revolved around section 17(5) of the CGST Act. This particular section prohibits ITC for works contract services when supplied for construction of an immovable property. However, this will exclude plant and machinery. The big question concerned what will be included in the definition of \u2018plant and machinery\u2019? The High Court had held that if the assessee is required to pay GST on the rental income from the mall, it is entitled to ITC on the GST paid on the construction of the mall. Aggrieved by this, the Tax Department moved the Apex Court. After going through all the submissions, the top Court while saying the shopping mall is a \u2018plant\u2019, held that functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant. Expert terms this ruling as a boon for the industry. \u201cThe outcome of the ruling that \u2018functionality test\u2019 should be applied on buildings to determine whether the same qualify as plant is very positive for the industry. With this ruling, by applying the functionality test, if one is able to prove the nexus/ role a particular product with the business of a taxpayer, credit should ideally be admissible\u201d said Harpreet Singh, Partner at Deloitte. \u201cThe eligibility of input tax credit (ITC) will be determined based on the functionality and essentiality tests,\u201d explained Abhishek A. Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who represented multiple petitioners in the case before the Supreme Court. \u201cIn essence, the Court has effectively read down the provisions of Section 17(5)(c) and (d) of the GST Act. ITC can only be denied in situations where the nature of the taxpayer\u2019s business and the claimed credits fail to satisfy these two critical tests. Post this ruling, there will be no requirement to amend the law. According to Rohit Jain, Deputy Managing Partner at Economic Laws Practice, the top Court has upheld the existing provisions and interpreted that building for leasing qualifies as a \u201cplant\u201d and no restriction of ITC is applicable. \u201cThere is no need to make any changes in the law,\u201d he said. Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co felt by reiterating this broader principle in the context of GST, the Supreme Court has given a lot of hope to taxpayers across the country, especially those whose input costs include substantial construction expenses. \u201cCompanies in the commercial real estate as well as infrastructure sectors will do well to review their input credit positions in the light of this judgment,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "SC permits input tax credits on construction expenses for leased buildings",
        "text": "In a development that may encourage increased investment in commercial real estate, the Supreme Court granted the industry relief on Thursday by permitting the application of input tax credits (ITC) on construction expenses for commercial buildings meant for leasing.\"If the construction of a building was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease or other transactions in respect of the building or a part thereof, which are covered by clauses (2) and (5) of Schedule II of the CGST Act, the building could be held to be a plant,\" said Justices Abhay S Oka and Sanjay Karol.This ruling is anticipated to ease the financial strain of rent on tenants occupying commercial spaces. Real estate companies stand to gain, as buildings can now be categorised as plant and machinery. Additionally, this advantage is not limited to commercial real estate; various industries will also be able to claim ITC on rentals for commercial properties. The ruling suggests that the ITC benefit will be available retroactively.\u201cThis is an important decision that could have wide ramifications for industries, particularly hotels, infrastructure, and logistics, including warehousing. While the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of restrictions relating to input credit on construction-related procurements, it has been held that whether a building constitutes 'plant or machinery' needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis,\u201d said Pratik Jain, Partner, PwC India.\u201cIt means that where it falls under this category, credit would be allowed. It will be interesting to see if the government considers amending the GST laws after this decision,\u201d added Jain.Experts believe that although the constitutional challenge was dismissed, the acceptance of the taxpayer\u2019s submission under Section 17(5)(d) is a positive outcome, potentially lowering the financial burden on developers and fostering greater investment in commercial real estate.\u201cThe real estate industry should carefully evaluate the implications of this ruling on ITC eligibility for outward supplies related to rental income. Given the Supreme Court's decision, it would be prudent for the GST Council to issue clarifications allowing real estate players to claim ITC on rental income,\u201d said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY India.Tax experts also pointed out that the question now arises whether this ruling would also apply to factory buildings, jetties, storage tanks, etc.\u201cThe applicability will depend on the specifics of each case. In the Safari Retreats case, the petitioner retained the property and leased it out rather than using it for personal purposes. In contrast, factory buildings, storage tanks, etc. are typically used by the registered person for their own operations. Therefore, once the detailed ruling is available, it will be crucial to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether ITC related to factory buildings, storage tanks, etc., will be allowed. If ITC is permitted, it will be important to understand the circumstances under which it can be claimed,\u201d said Agarwal.Tax experts also believe that GST laws generally do not allow the benefit of input credit/set-off of GST costs incurred on the input side for the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, with very few exceptions. This often results in additional GST costs for service providers whose primary input-side investment is in immoveable property, such as malls/commercial real estate players, port or airport service providers, and LNG terminal operators.Background of the caseIn the case of Safari Retreats, a mall owner approached the Orissa High Court, arguing that when a mall is being built for providing commercial rental services for the shop spaces therein, there should be no restriction on availing input credit/set-off for the GST cost incurred on the said construction. The Orissa High Court upheld this argument, and the GST authorities subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court. Several similar matters eventually reached the Supreme Court, leading to the formation of a large batch of matters on this legal point. Some of these newer matters also challenged the constitutional validity of such a restriction on input GST credit. Today, the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment\u2014while it has rejected the constitutional validity of the restriction, it upheld the conclusions of the Orissa High Court and, among other things, held that input credit will be allowed if the construction activity is for \u2018plant\u2019 or \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201cThis is a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court. While determining whether a mall, hotel, jetty, breakwater, or warehouse qualifies as \u2018plant or machinery\u2019 will remain a factual question (potentially leading to a second round of litigation), the greatest positive is that the Court has categorically held that there is no blanket restriction against input credit/set-off of the GST cost incurred on the construction of civil structures/immoveable property, especially when the said structure itself is integral to providing the output services in question,\u201d said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "title": "Signs of financial sector froth",
        "text": "The Indian equity market is on a high: again. On August 1, Nifty 50, the benchmark index for the Indian equity market, hit the \u201825000\u2019 mark. The jump from 24000 to 25000 took just 24 trading sessions. By September 24, it soared past \u201826000\u2019. This unbridled bull run has, in fact, characterised the Indian equity markets since the March 2020. However, now the bullish frenzy has regulators concerned. On March 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch, underlined the \u2018stretched valuations\u2019 of small and mid-cap stocks, iterating there are \u201cpockets of froth\u201d in the market. On July 22, she shared her concerns about speculative trading in F&O segment and losses made by retail traders in this segment. Latest reports suggest, SEBI is all set to tighten regulation to curb retail frenzy in equity options. Are the concerns of the regulator regarding a \u2018froth\u2019 in the market valid? Chart 1 shows the six global markets: Nifty 50, India (NSEI), Dow Jones, United States (DJI), German Index (GDAXI), Bovespa Index, Brazil (BVSP), and SSE Composite Index, China (000001.SS) from 2015 to 2024. For every market, we can see a sharp rally post the pandemic, an uncertain correction in 2022 and a sharper rally from late 2022 onwards. However, for both DJI and Nifty 50 (top two panels), the bullish spree in the last two years is extraordinarily strong. The market capitalisation (mcap) as percentage of GDP (Buffet indicator) suggests the Indian markets are overvalued. The Buffet indicator for India increased substantially from 2019 to 2022, a pattern which matches the US\u2019 (Table 1). India\u2019s mcap-to-GDP ratio reached a 15-year high of 140.2 per cent in May 2024. Values of the Buffet indicator above 100 is, by itself, an indicator of overvaluation but with values skirting 150 per cent, the financial sector has, it seems, decided to grow on its own. The concerns of the regulator about \u2018froth\u2019 in the market are evidently not unfounded. What is leading to the continued bullish frenzy? For one, the retail market participants have entered the stock markets in a big way post Covid, especially in India. Moreover, there are concerns that credit growth in the real sector could be finding a route to the equity market. Table 2 presents the growth in the US and Indian equity markets during different monetary policy phases of the US Federal Reserve, broadly matched by central banks of major markets. Expansionary phase The sharp rally in both the markets post Covid coincides with the expansionary phase. From May 2022, Federal Reserve increased interest rates responding to inflationary pressures, leading to some correction: for both DJI and Nifty 50, we see markets returns fall during contractionary phase. However, with the rate hike paused from September 2023, the markets rallied sharply again. With the Fed\u2019s decision to slash interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, we are looking at another expansionary phase, which may stretch valuations on the upside. How will the financialisation impact the real economy? The symptoms of overvaluation bring forth concerns about financialisation: proliferation of financial assets and financial market growth unrelated to the real sector growth. First, financialisation makes companies more concerned about \u2018share-holder value creation\u2019 than real capital accumulation. Financialisation can lead to \u2018distribute and disinvest\u2019 rather than \u2018retain and reinvest\u2019 for firms, which will jeopardize the real capital accumulation and employment generation. Speculative surge Second, the retail participation in the F&O segment and growth in intra-day trading shows the inclination to use the equity market for speculative gains rather than for long-term investment. This can be detrimental to retail participants\u2019 long-term saving behaviour, and adversely impact saving rates in the economy. Furthermore, if the participation in the stock market is leveraged, a market crash can lead to substantial erosion of wealth for retail investors. The Union Budget in 2024, increased short-term capital gains tax (STCG) and introduced a flat long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) across asset classes, discouraging short-term churning of portfolios. But have the market participants, especially the younger retail traders, taken the cue? Going ahead, regulatory measures should not only discourage leveraged trading, but also create awareness on appropriate risk management strategies for intra-day trading and the pitfalls of shorter-term churning for long term financial goals. \u2018Nudges\u2019 may be more effective than overt paternalism in guiding younger retail participants.

        "text": "Swift, the global financial messaging provider, announced on Thursday that it will begin trialing transactions involving digital currencies and assets on its secure network starting in 2025. This marks a notable step toward the gradual integration of digital assets into the broader financial system.Headquartered in Belgium, Swift is a member-owned cooperative that connects over 11,500 banks, securities organisations, and corporations across more than 200 countries, enabling the secure exchange of standardised financial messages. Although Swift does not hold or manage funds, its network allows financial institutions to communicate, facilitating global and local financial transactions. This initiative aims to demonstrate how Swift can support the movement of diverse types of value \u2014 whether digital or traditional \u2014 across over four billion accounts in 200 countries and territories.Bridging digital and traditional currenciesThe pilot programme will involve central and commercial banks, exploring how Swift\u2019s existing infrastructure can facilitate transactions of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other digital assets alongside traditional money. Initial use cases will include payments, foreign exchange (FX), securities, and trade-related transactions. A particular focus will be on enabling Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) and Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) transactions across different digital ledgers.In the release, Tom Zschach, Swift\u2019s chief innovation officer, emphasised the need for digital assets and currencies to coexist with traditional money. \u201cWith Swift\u2019s vast global reach, we are uniquely positioned to bridge both emerging and established forms of value,\u201d Zschach stated. \u201cAs new forms of value emerge, our intention is to continue offering our community the ability to seamlessly make and track transactions of all kinds of assets.\u201dRole of CBDCs in tokenised assetsTokenisation, the process of converting traditional assets such as bonds into digital units or blockchain-based tokens, has been explored by banks and asset managers for several years. The hope is that tokenised assets will make trading more efficient, reducing costs and removing intermediaries. Despite these ambitions, tokenisation has yet to gain significant traction in mainstream markets. The tokenised asset market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, the company said.CBDCs, digital versions of a country\u2019s official fiat currency, are also being trialled worldwide. According to recent data, around 90 per cent of the world\u2019s central banks are currently experimenting with CBDCs. These digital currencies aim to support the trading of tokenised assets and are a response to technological advances that have led to the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.SWIFT, a key player in the global financial system, has been actively involved in trials of both CBDCs and tokenised assets. In March, it announced plans to launch a platform that would connect developing CBDCs to the traditional financial system, ensuring a seamless transition between digital and traditional forms of money..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Indian stock markets staged a strong recovery on Friday afternoon, reversing early losses to trade significantly higher. The benchmark Sensex surged 729.46 points or 0.88 per cent to 83,226.56 at 12.31 PM, while the Nifty climbed 191.80 points or 0.76 per cent to 25,441.90. This upward momentum comes after a weak start, with markets opening lower for the fifth consecutive session due to geopolitical tensions and foreign institutional investor (FII) selling. The Sensex had opened at 82,244.25, down from its previous close of 82,497.10. The market breadth remained positive, with 2,284 stocks advancing against 1,529 declines on the BSE. 174 stocks hit 52-week highs, while 50 touched 52-week lows. 292 stocks reached the upper circuit limit, and 222 hit the lower circuit.

On the flip side, Cipla (-1.42 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (-1.33 per cent), Shriram Finance (-1.13 per cent), BPCL (-1.10 per cent), and Apollo Hospitals (-0.86 per cent) were the top losers. Sectoral indices also showed strength, with the Nifty Bank up 453.30 points or 0.87 per cent at 52,298.50, and Nifty Financial Services gaining 135.35 points or 0.57 per cent to 24,016.90. The Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap Select indices rose 0.31 per cent and 0.26 per cent respectively. The market\u2019s reversal comes despite ongoing concerns about the Iran-Israel conflict and its potential impact on crude oil prices, which could affect inflation and India\u2019s fiscal deficit. Earlier in the day, experts had pointed to global factors, including FII withdrawals to cheaper markets like Hong Kong, as reasons for the initial weakness. Investors are now closely watching US job data and further geopolitical developments for cues on market direction. The sharp intraday turnaround suggests a possible change in sentiment, although it remains to be seen if this momentum will sustain until market close at 3.30 PM. As trading continues, market participants will be keenly observing whether key support levels can be maintained and if the recovery can offset the losses from previous sessions.",

        "text": "Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, the latest entrant in the Gemini family of artificial intelligence (AI) models, is now generally available for production use. On Thursday, Google announced the general availability of the model, highlighting that it was a smaller and faster version of the Gemini 1.5 Flash which was introduced at Google I/O. Due to being fast, it has a low latency inference and more efficient output generation. More importantly, the tech giant stated that the Flash-8B AI model is the \u201clowest cost per intelligence of any Gemini model\u201d. Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B Now Generally Available In a developer blog post, the Mountain View-based tech giant detailed the new AI model. The Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B was distilled from the Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model, which was focused on faster processing and more efficient output generation. The company now claims that Google DeepMind developed this even smaller and faster version of the AI model in the last few months. Despite being a smaller model, the tech giant claims that it \u201cnearly matches\u201d the performance of the 1.5 Flash model across multiple benchmarks. Some of these include chat, transcription, and long context language translation.You Might Soon Be Able to Share Images Directly With Google's Gemini App One major benefit of the AI model is its price effectiveness. Google said that the Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B will offer the lowest token pricing in the Gemini family. Developers will have to pay $0.15 (roughly Rs. 12.5) per one million output tokens, $0.0375 (roughly Rs. 3) per one million input tokens, and $0.01 (roughly Rs. 0.8) per one million tokens on cached prompts. Additionally, Google is doubling the rate limits of the 1.5 Flash-8B AI model. Now, developers can send up to 4,000 requests per minute (RPM) while using this model. Explaining the decision, the tech giant stated that the model is suited for simple, high-volume tasks. Developers who wish to try out the model can do so via Google AI Studio and the Gemini API free of charge. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "The rupee traded on a flat note and settled at 83.96 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday as surging crude oil prices amid volatile geopolitics weighed on the local unit, while the Reserve Bank intervened to prevent the domestic currency from touching its lowest level. Forex traders said a weak American currency against major Asian rivals as well as the RBI's move to sell dollars supported the local unit. However, it was weighed down by weak domestic equity markets and unabated outflow of foreign funds. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 83.96 and moved between a narrow range of 83.93 and 83.97 against the greenback. The unit failed to recover from its deep plunge witnessed in previous sessions, and ended flat at 83.96 (provisional) against the dollar. On Thursday, the rupee slid 14 paise to settle at 83.96 against the American currency. The unit had touched its all-time low of 84.09 on August 5. Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said the rupee traded nearly flat amid reports of the Reserve Bank of India selling dollars in the short-term offshore markets, which prevented the Indian currency from hitting a new record low. However, weak domestic markets, a strong dollar and a surge in crude oil prices weighed on the rupee. Choudhary said the rupee is expected to trade with a negative bias on risk aversion in the global markets and a strong dollar amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. \"FII outflows and elevated crude oil prices may further pressurise the rupee. Traders may take cues from non-farm payrolls report from the US. The USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of \u20b983.75 to \u20b984.20,\" he added. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.11 per cent to 101.87. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 1.12 per cent to $78.49 in futures trade. On the domestic equity market front, the Sensex extended its sharp loss from the previous session and crashed another 808.65 points, or 0.98 per cent, to settle at 81,688.45. The Nifty also tanked 200.25 points, or 0.79 per cent to close the session at 25,049.85. Both the indices had tumbled over 2 per cent on Thursday. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Thursday, offloading shares worth \u20b915,243.27 crore on a net basis in the cash segment, according to exchange data. FIIs have sold shares worth over \u20b930,000 crore since Monday as they turned bullish towards the Chinese market, betting on various economic stimulus measures announced by the country. Meanwhile, a monthly survey released on Friday showed India's services sector activity fell to a 10-month low in September as new business, international sales and output growth moderated. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Services Business Activity Index fell from 60.9 in August to 57.7 in September, indicating that the output registered an increase, but at the slowest rate since November 2023.",

Vishwanath Mysuru: MLC A.H. Vishwanath has strongly criticised the political speeches made during the inauguration of Dasara-2024 atop Chamundi Hill yesterday, asserting that the event lost its sanctity due to the political undertones. Speaking to reporters at Jaladarshini Guest House here this morning, he stated that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah exploited the traditional Dasara inauguration to advance his political agenda. \u201cCM Siddaramaiah, who once spoke lightly of the Gods, has now sought the blessings of Goddess Chamundeshwari, the presiding deity of Mysuru,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dasara inauguration yesterday devolved into a political platform, with CM Siddaramaiah, MLA G.T. Devegowda (GTD), and even the inaugurator, Dr. Hampana, delivering speeches laden with political tones. It was more of a political event than a devotional one,\u201d Vishwanath lamented. He noted that the speakers, focused on their political agendas, overlooked the rich history of Nada Habba Dasara. \u201cDasara has shifted from being a public celebration to a political affair,\u201d he stated, adding that politicians have brought Dasara to a new low. Is GTD a MUDA beneficiary? Regarding MLA G.T. Devegowda\u2019s (GTD) praise for Siddaramaiah, he described it as mere flattery and theatrics. \u201cOne must wonder whether GTD is a beneficiary of the MUDA scam,\u201d he remarked, implying that the MLA\u2019s unnecessary adulation of the CM raises suspicions about his own connections to several MUDA sites. \u201cGTD turned the entire inauguration into a farce, and there is no excuse for this. The function became hypocritical, with everyone patting themselves on the back. It is truly unfortunate that nobody took the time to speak about Goddess Chamundeshwari, the erstwhile Mysuru Maharajas, or the glory of Dasara,\u201d he regretted. He further noted that Union Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has appointed a Non-Vokkaliga leader (C.B. Sureshbabu of the Kuruba community) as the Legislative Party leader of the JD(S), fearing that appointing a Vokkaliga leader might be detrimental to the party in the future. Vishwanath pointed out that no one from the Opposition has explicitly declared intentions to topple the State government, asserting that the Government is propagating this false narrative to protect itself amid the MUDA scam and divert public attention from it. Netas sullied Mysuru\u2019s reputation The MLC questioned whether Siddaramaiah had overlooked the verdict delivered by Justice M. Nagaprasanna, emphasising that the CM\u2019s wife wrote an emotional letter expressing her intention to return the 14 sites just hours after the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s intervention. He maintained that returning the sites does not erase the wrongdoing, arguing that the offence remains even if it is acknowledged. Vishwanath expressed scepticism about GTD\u2019s sudden vocal support for the CM, noting that the MLA has remained silent on the issue until now and allegedly possesses multiple MUDA sites himself. \u201cPoliticians are responsible for tarnishing Mysuru\u2019s reputation. There must be an investigation into all MUDA site allocations, and previous MUDA Commissioners should face imprisonment for their misconduct,\u201d he declared. MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority He further questioned the current MUDA Commissioner\u2019s authority to cancel the Khata of the returned sites while the case is still under judicial review. \u201cSiddaramaiah should first read the 197-page verdict from the High Court. A thorough investigation into the entire MUDA scam is necessary. The current MUDA Commissioner must also be held accountable for hastily cancelling the Khata of the returned sites without properly examining the process,\u201d he stated, challenging the Commissioner\u2019s powers to unilaterally annul the Khata. Vishwanath argued that Siddaramaiah\u2019s remarks seem to suggest he operates above the law, accusing him of undermining the rule of law. He added that the Lokayukta case against Siddaramaiah cannot be withdrawn unilaterally, even after the CM\u2019s wife returned the 14 sites.",

While airlines have been relying on AI for preventive maintenance or improving passenger experience, integrating a risk management platform will help IndiGo adjust its flight schedules proactively and minimise disruptions during emergencies. New tools for the new world This is especially crucial as aviation continues to be affected by global conflicts such as those in West Asia and Ukraine. Airlines have been forced to reroute or cancel flights due to these ongoing conflicts.

        "text": "Private sector banks offloaded loans worth Rs 21,000 crore through securitisation deals in the second quarter ended September 2024 (Q2 FY25) to generate funds amid intense competition for deposits. This will also help to improve the credit-deposit (C/D) ratio, according to the ratings agency ICRA. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had earlier expressed concern over the high C/D ratio for some lenders and sought a review of business models.Abhishek Dafria, group head, structured finance, ICRA, said the securitisation market\u2014pass-through certificates (PTCs) plus assignment\u2014witnessed an extraordinary quarter in Q2 FY25, with volumes touching Rs 60,000 crore. About 35 per cent of the volumes originated from private sector banks, which have dived into the securitisation market to improve their credit-deposit ratio given the relatively slower pace of deposit accretion, he added.The country\u2019s largest private lender, HDFC Bank, securitised new car loans worth Rs 9,063 crore through a PTC transaction where mutual funds were key investors. India Ratings has assigned an \"AAA\" rating to this asset-backed securities transaction.\"Regular issuances by large institutions will provide a fillip to the securitisation market, boost investor confidence\u2014including that of foreign portfolio investors\u2014while proactive regulatory guardrails will ensure financial market stability,\u201d said Jatin Nanaware, senior director, India Ratings.Besides banks, ICRA said non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) would also continue to raise funding through securitisation as they diversify their borrowing liabilities and improve their asset-liability management (ALM). The sustenance of volume growth in the coming quarters, however, remains to be seen, given the appetite for large-size transactions, as seen in Q2, may be limited. The securitisation volumes may reach Rs 2.1 trillion in the current financial year (FY25), Dafria of ICRA said.HDFC Bank securitised Rs 19,200 crore of loans as a strategic initiative to lower its high credit to deposit ratio (CD ratio)..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

        "text": "Increase in thermal stress and humidity due to climate change have turned out to be major factors contributing to infertility in dairy cows, posing a serious challenge to livestock farmers. Reportedly, more than 40% of cows slaughtered in Kerala are infertile and in order to address the issue the Animal Husbandry department will establish Regional Livestock Fertility Management Centres (RLFMC) across the State. A first of its kind initiative in Kerala, the project implemented through the Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) will provide multiple treatment options including IVF (in vitro fertilisation) to the farmers. \u201cA large percentage of infertility cases can be corrected. The RLMFC will take cases referred by department veterinarians and normally cows that fail to get pregnant after three sessions of Artificial Insemination (AI) will be considered,\u201d says R. Rajeev, managing director, KLDB. State-of-the-art facilities Each centre will have a mobile unit with state-of-the-art facilities for embryo transfer process, providing doorstep service to the farmers. It will be led by a team of experts, who will assess the cow\u2019s living conditions, feed, health and case history. While treatment for nutritional and hormonal problems will start immediately, some issues will require an extended period to be addressed. In the meantime, the RLFMC team will use software to collect and examine the data of each case and give instructions to the farmers. While infertility causes considerable losses for farmers, it also impacts Kerala\u2019s goal of attaining self-sufficiency in milk production. \u201cThe expense for producing an embryo and transferring it will come to around \u20b96,000. We mainly target heifers as chances of hormonal imbalance are higher in cows. Heifers are ideal carriers for embryo transfer,\u201d says Mr. Rajeev. The centres also offer the provision to opt for quality embryos if the cows are not superior breed. \u201cThe ovum can be taken from any other cow or the farmer can also opt for quality embryos produced by us. The mobile lab will assess fertility issues in cows and also carry out embryo transfers,\u201d he adds. A joint initiative of the State and the Centre, the RLFMCs will come up at Chithara in Kollam and Thalayolaparambu in Kottayam in the initial phase. Minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development J. Chinchurani will inaugurate State\u2019s first RLFMC in Kollam on Saturday.",

        "title": "254,000 jobs added in September as US economic growth holds steady: Report",
        "text": "The US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far surpassing expectations and alleviating concerns about a faltering job market, as per the US Department of Labor. The report has also beaten Wall Street's expectations of a substantial interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the New York Post.Unemployment rate dropsThe unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%, down from 4.2% the previous month, while hourly earnings rose by 4% year-on-year. Consensus estimates had predicted a gain of 150,000 jobs, a modest increase from the 142,000 reported for August. The unemployment rate had previously shown slight fluctuations, falling from an unexpected rise to 4.3% in July.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that further interest rate cuts are likely, but he emphasised a gradual approach designed to support a healthy economy. At the Fed's last meeting on September 18, officials reduced the rate to 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, and projected two additional quarter-point cuts in November and December.\u201cIf the economy performs as expected, that would mean two more cuts this year,\u201d Powell said.Private sector growthData from ADP showed that private sector companies added 143,000 jobs in September, surpassing analysts' estimates of 125,000 and marking a rebound from August's figure of 99,000. This increase ended a streak of five consecutive months of job declines.Despite these positive signs, there are indications of a weakening job market. The Labour Department reported that the quits rate, a crucial measure of worker confidence, fell to 1.9% in August, the lowest since June 2020. The hiring rate also declined to 3.3%, down from 3.4% in July, the weakest rate since August 2013, excluding the pandemic.Low layoffsPayroll growth across most sectors suggests fewer layoffs, although hiring has slowed due to reduced demand following the Federal Reserve's rate hikes of 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% last month, following a 0.5% rise in August, while year-on-year wages rose by 4.0%, up from 3.9% in August. This strong wage growth makes it unlikely that the US central bank will implement another half-percentage-point rate cut at its meeting on November 6-7.ChallengesThe labour market continues to add jobs at a steady pace, allowing Americans to maintain confidence and spending, which supports the economy. However, the hiring rate has slowed significantly, with an average of 116,000 jobs added monthly from June through August, marking the weakest three-month stretch since mid-2020.However, the economy has remained resilient, growing at a 3% annual pace from April to June, boosted by consumer spending and business investments. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta indicates a growth rate of 2.5% for the July-September quarter.Economic concerns weigh heavily on voters as the presidential election on November 5 approaches. While many Americans appreciate the job market's resilience, high prices continue to frustrate them, remaining approximately 19% above levels recorded in February 2021 when inflation began surging.",
        "summary": "The US economy experienced significant job growth last month, adding 254,000 jobs and reducing the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Despite a slowdown in the hiring rate and worker confidence, wage growth remains strong, making further substantial rate cuts from the Federal Reserve unlikely.",

        "title": "Secure Attractive Interest Rates on Gold Loan with Bajaj Finance",
        "text": "Gold has always been a haven both for investors and borrowers. Even in recent times, gold loans are becoming increasingly popular for those seeking quick financial assistance. They allow borrowers to leverage their gold jewellery to secure funds without the need for extensive complicated documentation or a perfect credit score. Moreover, gold loan interest rates are generally lower than unsecured loans, making them a cost-effective borrowing option. Understanding the various benefits of a gold loan is essential, if an individual is planning on availing one. This can significantly improve one's overall borrowing experience. Bajaj Finance Gold Loan All about the gold loan A gold loan is a secured loan where individuals can pledge their 18-22 karat gold jewellery as collateral to obtain funds. This type of loan offers numerous benefits, including: Quick processing Gold loans are typically processed much faster than traditional loans, with many lenders offering instant approvals. This rapid turnaround can be a lifesaver for those facing unexpected expenses. Higher loan amounts Borrowers can receive loans based on the value of the gold pledged, often up to 75% of its market value. This flexibility allows individuals to secure the exact amount they need without overcommitting. No need for perfect credit score Since gold acts as collateral, lenders are more lenient regarding the borrowers credit history. This makes gold loans an attractive option for those who may struggle to secure other types of financing due to a lower CIBIL score. Reasons to choose Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan There are multiple lenders in the market that one can choose from. However, here are some reasons that make Bajaj Finance a preferable choice for many borrowers: Quick loan processing Bajaj Finance processes gold loans quickly, allowing borrowers to get the funds they need without delays. This is particularly helpful when funding immediate expenses, such as medical bills or urgent repairs. Minimal documentation Borrowers can secure a substantial loan amount by submitting their basic KYC documents like Aadhaar card, Voter ID, driving licence, passport, letter from NPR or NREGA job card. High loan amount One can get a loan starting from \u00e2\u0082\u00b95,000 to \u00e2\u0082\u00b92 crore, depending on the value of the gold pledged, gold loan interest rate, and the borrowers liquidity requirements. This makes it possible for individuals to meet their financial needs, whether big or small. Convenient repayment options With multiple repayment plans, borrowers can choose a schedule that suits their financial situation, making it easier to manage repayments. This flexibility ensures that borrowers can stay on top of their finances without feeling overwhelmed.

        "title": "Insurance Query: Evaluating business-owners\u2019 financial stability",
        "text": "I am 42 years old. I run my own business. I wish to buy life insurance, but I don\u2019t get salary slips, which is an important document to buy a policy. How can I get covered? Congratulations on taking the important step of considering life insurance. It is an essential tool to secure the future of your dependents and safeguard your business interests. Insurance providers understand that entrepreneurs and business-owners like yourself have different financial structures and offer various alternative ways to evaluate your financial stability. There are several options available to you: Bank statements: Your bank statements can offer a clear picture of your financial health and stability. As a business-owner, your transactional history and cash flow from your primary bank account (reasonably reflecting your business and savings) will serve as proof of income. By examining your regular deposits and business-related transactions, we can get a comprehensive understanding of your financial standing. A 12-month record of your bank statements is typically sufficient to demonstrate your financial viability. Using account aggregators, your bank statements can be verified digitally with your consent, with your mobile number and an OTP. Income tax returns (ITR): Another excellent option is your ITR. They reflect your declared income over time and are particularly useful for self-employed individuals or business owners whose income may fluctuate. Your ITR provides consistency, helping us determine an accurate picture of your earning capacity. This is a reliable document for underwriting purposes, giving us the confidence to offer you a suitable insurance policy. Vahan portal: If you own a vehicle, we can retrieve information from the Vahan Dashboard, a government database of registered vehicles. These data help us assess your assets and overall financial position. While vehicle ownership may not directly indicate your full financial strength, it adds another dimension to your profile, further enriching the financial underwriting process. Credit history: Your credit history \u2014 whether through credit card transactions, personal loans, or business loans \u2014 can be accessed via credit bureaus based on your PAN. This allows us to assess your financial behaviour, creditworthiness, and ability to manage financial obligations. A strong credit score is a key indicator of financial health and can significantly strengthen your life insurance application. GST details: As a business-owner, your goods and services tax (GST) filings can be another surrogate for salary slips. GST returns provide insight into your business\u2019 turnover and profitability, helping us assess your financial standing and stability. If your business is registered under GST, sharing your filings can help us tailor your insurance coverage based on your business performance. Other ways In rare cases, when the above financial surrogates may not fully establish your eligibility, there are still ways to secure a policy. Insurers are often open to considering other financial assets you may own, such as property, investments or business assets, that can demonstrate your financial strength. Flexibility is key, and we believe that every customer deserves a thorough and fair evaluation. Points to note You can present any asset you own \u2014 property, mutual funds, fixed deposits, or business assets. All of these contribute to demonstrating your financial health for the purposes of underwriting. Always provide clear, accurate and up-to-date financial documents. This ensures a smooth, hassle-free process with no delays in securing your life insurance policy. Since every individual\u2019s financial situation is unique, especially for business-owners like yourself, insurance companies now offer policies designed specifically for entrepreneurs and other self-employed individuals.

        "title": "RBI survey indicates slowdown in manufacturing",
        "text": "The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) latest quarterly industrial outlook survey of 1,300 manufacturing companies reveals that manufacturing companies are witnessing a slowing growth in the first and second quarter of 2024-25. This is also mirrored in manufacturing PMI which is tapering downwards.\n\nAccording to RBI survey data, the net response (difference in the percentage of companies reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism) regarding production output has decreased from 27.9 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 22.9 per cent in Q2 2024-25. The number was 34.4 in the fourth quarter of FY24. This implies that more manufacturers witnessed slowdown in production this fiscal. One concern is that the companies polled indicated a steep fall in growth expectation of production output in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal.\n\nThe RBI survey report states that the pressure from raw material costs, financing expenses, and salary payments has eased. As a result, expectations of growth in selling prices and profit margins have also softened. \u201cManufacturers polled for better expectations on production, order books, employment, capacity utilisation and overall business situation during Q4:2024-25 and Q1:2025-26. Input cost pressures are likely to continue for manufacturers, who expect to retain pricing power and increase in selling prices on the back of robust demand conditions,\u201d the survey report reads.\n\nGeopolitical strife\n\nRamendra Verma, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat says, \u201cThiscan be attributed to a chain reaction of geo-political situation, which has resulted in supply chain disruptions leading to high inputs costs (for e.g. \u2013 energy and semiconductors). This is also leading to weakening of demand.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, net responses for order book growth dropped 25.6 per cent in Q1 2024-25 to 19.5 per cent in Q2 2024-25, while net responses for pending orders increased from 5.9 per cent to 8 per cent in the same period. Similarly, net responses for capacity utilisation fell from 18.7 per cent to 15.1 per cent.\n\nVerma outlined several factors contributing to the low net responses for order books, such as declining consumer confidence and reduced spending, which have led to fewer new orders. Additionally, global economic uncertainties have made businesses reluctant to place large orders. \u201cMany manufacturers are operating below capacity due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions,\u201d Verma explained, adding that this under-utilisation is also linked to more cautious inventory management practices.\n\nSujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, pointed out that the slower growth in related indicators aligns with the decline in industrial production. In Q1 FY25, capacity utilisation dropped after surpassing 75 per cent in the final quarter of the previous fiscal. \u201cOne of the reasons for lower utilisation was elections which usually disrupts activity along with heatwaves especially in the north. This was also highlighted in the PMI survey which indicated some of the factories remained shut due to excessive heat,\u201d Hajra added. \n\nThe monthly Purchasing Managers Index for India\u2019s manufacturing sector has also shown a downward trend. It was reported at 58.8 in April 2024, remained relatively stable at 58.3 in June, but declined slightly to 57.5 in August 2024, and further dropped to 56.5 in September 2024.\n\nThe global market research firm Nomura\u2019s report indicates a similar weakening outlook. \u201cEven as the pace of government spending picks up in coming months and base effects become more favourable, we expect growth momentum to remain soft, due to fading urban pent-up demand, tight monetary policy, a moderation in credit growth, negative real rural wage growth, sluggish private capex and soft external demand,\u201d the Nomura report says.",

They will stay put for two days and public entry to MUDA Office has been restricted.\n\nThe investigation focuses on the controversial allotment of 14 sites to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah\u2019s wife, B.M. Parvathi, along with other irregularities related to 50:50 site allocations, alternative sites and compensatory sites. Social activist Snehamayi Krishna has complained to the ED that irregularities worth Rs. 4,000 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore has happened in MUDA.\n\nThe team, accompanied by armed personnel, travelled from Bengaluru\u2019s Shantinagar Office and arrived at MUDA gate around 10.45 am. More than 20 armed personnel from Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have provided security to the ED sleuths. The Mysuru City Police are providing additional security.\n\nAfter their arrival, an ED representative informed the Police officers on duty at MUDA gate that they were from ED in Bengaluru. Upon hearing the update, MUDA Commissioner A.N. Raghunandan promptly arrived at the gate to welcome the ED officers. Subsequently, the sleuths proceeded directly to the MUDA Commissioner\u2019s chamber on second floor, where they began discussions in the antechamber around 11.30 am.\n\nAn Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Siddaramaiah, Parvathi and others, revolving around allegations of illegal money transfers linked to the land allotments.\n\nRaid at Kengeri home\n\nSources informed Star of Mysore that the ED team also conducted a raid at the residence of J. Devaraju in Kengeri, Bengaluru. Devaraju was the individual who sold the 3.16-acre land at Kesare to B.M. Mallikarjunaswamy, Parvathi\u2019s brother. Mallikarjunaswamy later gifted the land to Parvathi, in exchange for which she received 14 sites in the Vijayanagar Third and Fourth Stages under a 50:50 ratio.\n\nAfter a brief discussion in the antechamber of the Commissioner\u2019s Office, the ED sleuths proceeded to MUDA Chairman\u2019s Office. Chairman K. Marigowda has already resigned from his post. The officers then moved to the meeting room adjacent to Chairman\u2019s Office, where they held discussions with senior officials.\n\nWill cooperate: MUDA Secretary\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the MUDA Office around 12.15 pm, MUDA Secretary Prasanna Kumar stated that the ED has officially commenced its investigation. \u201cWe will cooperate with the sleuths and provide whatever information they request. All documents will be made available, and there will be no public work for two days,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked how much longer the ED sleuths intend to remain in Mysuru, the MUDA Secretary replied that, for now, they would stay for two days. \u201cDepending on their progress, their stay might be extended. Ultimately, it is for them to decide, and I have no role to play in that matter,\u201d he added.\n\nSeeking documents\n\nBefore arriving in Mysuru, the ED had instructed MUDA to submit all the crucial documents related to the case, which forms the basis of the FIR (11/2024) registered by the Lokayukta against Siddaramaiah, his wife Parvathi, his brother-in-law B.M.

        "title": "Why this small-cap real estate and EPC company is a worthy buy",
        "text": "Both the construction and infrastructure industries have taken off strongly in the post-Covid period. Residential real estate and commercial construction have been on overdrive over the past three-four years. Infrastructure projects such as ports have been in the limelight for a while now and continue to see considerable traction.\n\nAs a play on these segments, Man Infraconstruction (Man Infra) has been a key beneficiary of the offtake in the real estate and construction businesses.\n\nThe company focuses on residential construction and infrastructure projects (ports). It takes an EPC (engineering, procurement and contracting/construction) approach in its infrastructure business as well as select real estate projects. \n\nIn the residential construction segment, Man Infra takes the joint development agreement (JDA), joint venture (JV), development manager (DM) and society redevelopment approaches, which ensure that the upfront investments are minimal and margins are healthy. It is focused on the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in its residential towers projects.\n\nAt \u20b9190, the stock trades at 23 times its per share earnings for FY24 and 19 times its likely per share earnings for FY25. This is among the lowest valuation multiples commanded by any real estate or construction company with mid-sized operations. The BSE Realty trades at a PE of nearly 65 times, while most frontline and mid-sized real estate players trade at price-earnings multiples of 30-70 times. \n\nA track record of strong execution of projects, expertise in residential, commercial properties, as well as ports, multiple revenue streams via a low-risk, asset-light business model and a net-debt-free balance sheet are positives for Man Infra. The company has both private and public sector clients.\n\nThe stock has corrected about 20 per cent from its recent high and presents a reasonably attractive opportunity. Investors with a two-three-year perspective can buy the shares of the company at the current price. \n\nBetween FY22 and FY24, the company\u2019s revenues grew at a compounded annual rate of 43.5 per cent to \u20b91,263.5 crore in FY24, while net profits rose at nearly 111 per cent annually to \u20b9300.4 crore. It enjoys an EBITDA margin of 25.8 per cent in FY24, which is among the best in the industry.\n\nDiversified operating model\n\nMan Infra has been in the construction business for nearly 60 years now. It has specialised capabilities in the ports business. It has helped in the development of eight major ports in India including those of Navi Mumbai, Chennai, Gujarat Pipavav, Mundra and Kochi. It has also been an EPC contractor for leading infrastructure companies and real estate developers. \n\nIn the last several years, Man Infra has been able to up its game in the residential space. Projects such as Atmosphere O2, Mulund West (47 storeys \u2013 two towers), Aaradhya Highpark, Nr. Dahisar (30 storeys \u2013 six towers) and Aaradhya EastWind, Vikhroli (34 storeys) were executed in three-and-a-half to four years.\n\nIn the last 10 years, the company has become a reasonably-established player in the MMR, with a presence in the central, eastern, western suburbs and recently in South Mumbai as well.\n\nIn all, 17 projects totalling 2.4 million sq ft have been delivered, mostly six months to one year ahead of schedule. Around 90 per cent of its inventory reportedly is sold before even the occupancy certificate is received.\n\nMan Infra receives DM fee for handling and marketing a real estate project. It receives EPC margin for in-house construction and engineering capabilities. The company receives interest margin on funds infused into projects. \n\nIn the EPC business, it receives regular EPC margin from the government and private clients. When it professionally manages a site, material and labour of a real estate project, it receives a PMC (project management consultancy) margin. \n\nRevenues from projects executed under the DM model are not reflected in consolidated sales figures, but only the DM fee (12-14 per cent of total project revenues) gets added to the sales and PBT.\n\nFor projects executed under the JV model, sales are not reflected in the consolidated revenue figure, but the company\u2019s share of profits gets added to the bottom line.\n\nThus, in the DM model, all costs and revenues are booked in the landlord\u2019s financials, while in the JV model, all costs and revenues are booked in the SPV, even as Man Infra receives a share of profit based on the extent of its stake in the venture.\n\nThis asset-light approach is set to continue for the company. Given the focus on DM and JV-based revenue generation, the top-line growth may not be as robust as in the past few years, though profitability is set to receive a considerable boost given that minimal to no upfront capital commitment is required.\n\nFuture potential and healthy financials\n\nMan Infra has cash and cash equivalents of \u20b9487 crore as of June 2024. Its debt was only \u20b933 crore as of June 2024, down from \u20b9332 crore in September 2022. Very few real estate and construction players enjoy a net-debt-free balance sheet as well as healthy operating margins.\n\nThe company has 6.1 million sq ft of carpet area waiting for execution over the next several years. Man Infra\u2019s real estate business itself has a visibility of \u20b915,000 crore over the next five-six years, with margins expected to be north of 20 per cent consistently.",

        "text": "As the agriculture minister chairs the annual conference on Rabi crops on Saturday, where strategies will be chalked out with States for a bumper harvest, one important issue to grab attention may be the shortage of Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), the key fertiliser used in wheat, mustard and gram, all three major winter crops. \n\nLatest data show that sales of DAP fell to 7.76 lakh tonnes (lt) last month, which is 51 per cent lower from 15.7 lt year-ago. Monthly sales of DAP in September were reported at 11.15 lt in 2022, 5.96 lt in 2021, 7.65 lt in 2020 and 6.33 lt in 2019.\n\n\u201cFarmers normally buy DAP in September-October to prepare the field for the sowing. With a favourable monsoon and its delayed withdrawal as well as good moisture has created the demand for fertilisers as farmers expect a good harvest of winter crops,\u201d said agriculture scientist A K Singh. \n\nAlso read: India decides to ease rice export curbs further\n\nWith the reports of farmers\u2019 protest over alleged shortages of DAP coming particularly from Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, there is something amiss as far as availability is concerned, Singh added.\n\n\u201cWheat crop this year is very crucial and the government should not take any chance and ensure ample and timely availability,\u201d Singh suggested and added that there should be study on shrivelled crop of wheat, which has been continuing for last few years and the government has been relaxing procurement norms in one state or the other.\n\nAccording to the crop weather watch report, the total fertiliser sale during Kharif season 2024 (April-September) was 319.97 lt which included 189.12 lt of urea, 46.12 lt of DAP, 9.27 lt of MOP and 75.46 lt of complex (a mixture of N, P , K nutrients). The total demand for the season was estimated at 321.44 lt \u2013 177.12 lt of urea, 59.87 lt of DAP, 10.26 lt of MOP and 74.19 lt of complex.\n\nSingh said that it is unusual to see the fall in sales of DAP as against its projected demand whereas there is no such difference noticed in other fertilisers when sales data are compared with demand.\n\nOfficial data show that sales of urea were up 3.1 per cent at 30.89 lt in September 2024 from 29.97 lt year-ago, but those of MOP were down 4.7 per cent at 2.25 lt from 2.36 lt and complex dropped by 11.6 per cent at 16.6 lt from 18.77 lt.\n\nThe Centre will discuss (on October 19) with state officials about the plan and strategies about the on-going Rabi sowing season that started from October 1, to ensure that the winter-grown foodgrains production target of 164 million tonnes (mt) including 115 mt of wheat, 13.65 mt of gram and 13.8 mt of mustard, officials said.\n\nAlso read: Rice exports a tad lower in H1, but trade sees shipments gaining pace in year ahead as govt eases curbs",

The bracelet, passed on to him by his father Salim Khan, has been integral to Salman\u2019s life for several decades. You will never spot Salman without the bracelet. So how does the Firoza bracelet secure Salman Khan? In a recently resurfaced Reddit video, Salman elucidates the protective mechanism of the \u201cFiroza\u201d stone in his bracelet. He says, \u201cThis stone is called Firoza. Apparently, there are only two living stones, they say. One is a Greek, and one is a Firoza. This is the turquoise. What happens with this is if there\u2019s any negativity coming onto you, first this takes it. It gets veins in it and then it cracks. This is my seventh stone.\u201d Healing properties Turquoise, a mesmerising gemstone, is recognised not only for its vibrant blue-green hue but also for its rich history and believed metaphysical properties. The benefits of wearing turquoise are manifold, spanning from health and emotional well-being to spiritual growth,\u201d says Dr Priya Kaul, a spiritual life coach and healer. \u201cIt is supposed to calm and reduce anxiety and tension. Its calming effect can help people handle anger and stress, promoting stability, she says adding, \u201cThis gemstone promotes self-expression and communication, which may help emotional upheaval sufferers.\u201d Firoza, the living stone Turquoise, also popularly known as \u201cFiroza\u201d, is a powerful gem that brings in good luck, blessings of higher powers, and spiritual protection to people who tend to get into conflicts very often. \u201cIt\u2019s a stone that activates your good luck and ability to get through situations. Turquoise is associated with the planet Jupiter, which activates the luck side of divine protection,\u201d says Neelam Naseeb, CEO of MBM Crystals and the Ursoulcompass community.

        "title": "Your Guide to Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates in India",
        "text": "Purchasing a car is not just a significant milestone; it\u2019s often a major financial commitment that can impact your budget for years to come. One of the most crucial aspects of financing your vehicle is securing the best car loan interest rates. Whether you\u2019re considering a sleek new model or a reliable used car, understanding how to get favorable loan terms can save you substantial money over time. This guide provides essential tips and insights to help you secure the best deal on your car loan and streamline your new car loan approval process.\n\nWhy Car Loan Interest Rates Matter\n\nCar loan interest rates play a vital role in determining how much you will ultimately pay for your vehicle. A lower interest rate means reduced monthly payments and lower total interest paid over the loan term. On the other hand, a higher interest rate can inflate the overall cost of your vehicle, leading to financial strain.\n\nFor example, consider a \u20b910,00,000 car loan with a five-year term. If you secure a loan with an 8% interest rate, your monthly payment will be approximately \u20b920,000. However, if your interest rate is 12%, your monthly payment jumps to around \u20b922,000. Over five years, that\u2019s a difference of nearly \u20b91,20,000! Clearly, understanding how to obtain the best car loan interest rates is essential for making a sound financial decision.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nSeveral factors influence the car loan interest rates you may qualify for, including:\n\n1. Credit Score\n\nYour credit score is one of the most significant determinants of your car loan interest rates. Lenders assess your creditworthiness based on this score; a higher credit score generally results in a lower interest rate. For example, individuals with a score above 700 typically enjoy more favorable loan terms than those with lower scores.\n\nBefore applying for a car loan, it\u2019s wise to check your credit score. If you find areas for improvement, such as outstanding debts or errors on your credit report, take steps to rectify these issues. Paying off debts and ensuring timely payments can help boost your score, making you more attractive to lenders.\n\n2. Loan Term\n\nThe length of your loan, or the term, can also impact your interest rate. Generally, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates, while longer-term loans may carry higher rates but result in lower monthly payments. It\u2019s crucial to strike a balance that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nWhile a longer loan term might seem appealing due to lower monthly payments, keep in mind that you could end up paying significantly more in interest over the life of the loan. Consider your budget and long-term financial objectives when choosing a loan term.\n\n3. Loan Amount and Down Payment\n\nThe amount you borrow, and your down payment can influence the interest rate offered. A larger down payment reduces the loan amount, which can lead to a lower interest rate. Additionally, a significant down payment shows lenders that you are financially responsible, potentially improving your loan terms.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the car\u2019s purchase price. For example, if you\u2019re purchasing a car for \u20b915,00,000, a down payment of \u20b93,00,000 can significantly improve your chances of securing a better rate.\n\n4. Market Conditions\n\nCurrent market conditions can also affect car loan interest rates. Economic factors, such as inflation and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policies, can influence lending rates across the board. Keeping an eye on market trends can help you time your loan application for better rates.\n\nTips for Securing the Best Car Loan Interest Rates\n\nTo maximize your chances of obtaining the best car loan interest rates, follow these actionable tips:\n\n1. Improve Your Credit Score\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a higher credit score can lead to lower interest rates. Take proactive steps to improve your credit before applying for a loan:\n\n\u2022 Pay bills on time: Late payments can negatively impact your score.\n\n\u2022 Reduce outstanding debts: Aim to lower credit card balances and pay off loans.\n\n\u2022 Check your credit report: Correct any errors that may be affecting your score.\n\n2. Shop Around\n\nNot all lenders offer the same car loan interest rates. To find the best deal, compare rates from various sources, including banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Make sure to take into account the loan terms, fees, and other charges that may apply.\n\nUse online comparison tools to simplify this process. A little research can go a long way in helping you secure a better interest rate.\n\n3. Consider Pre-Approval\n\nGetting pre-approved for a car loan can significantly enhance your bargaining power when shopping for a vehicle. Pre-approval provides you with a clear idea of how much you can borrow and what interest rates you might qualify for. This not only streamlines the buying process but also strengthens your position when negotiating with dealerships.\n\nAdditionally, a pre-approved loan can help you avoid high dealer financing rates, ensuring that you stick to your budget.\n\n4. Negotiate Your Rate\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to negotiate with lenders. If you receive a better rate from another lender, use it as leverage in your discussions. Many lenders are willing to match or even beat competing offers to secure your business.\n\nBe prepared to discuss your credit history and financial situation during negotiations. Demonstrating that you\u2019ve done your research can bolster your position.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Additional Fees\n\nWhen considering a car loan, pay attention to any additional fees that may affect your overall costs. These can include:\n\nProcessing fees\n\nPrepayment penalties\n\nLate payment fees\n\nUnderstanding these charges can help you make a more informed decision about your loan.\n\n6. Stay Informed About Market Trends\n\nKeeping an eye on market conditions can help you identify the best time to apply for a loan. Interest rates can fluctuate based on economic factors, so being informed can guide your decision-making process.\n\nNavigating the world of car loan interest rates doesn\u2019t have to be daunting. By understanding the factors that influence your rate and taking proactive measures, you can significantly reduce your vehicle's overall cost. Start by checking your credit score, comparing lenders, considering your loan term, and confidently negotiating your rate. With these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to drive off in your new car with a loan that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nReady to kick off your journey? Begin by reviewing your credit score and exploring various lenders to uncover the best car loan interest rates available. Your dream car is within reach\u2014ensure you\u2019re financing it wisely!",

Exports of petroleum products dropped by 12.48 per cent to USD 36.54 billion, while gems and jewellery exports fell 10.89 per cent to USD 13.92 billion. \n\nA slowdown in developed economies, along with higher crude prices and disruptions in global supply chains, compounded these challenges.\n\nIndia\u2019s trade dynamics have been shaped by several international factors, including the Russia-Ukraine war, which has kept energy prices elevated, and tensions between the US and China, which have disrupted supply chains. \n\nAdditional pressures arose from Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, causing higher freight rates, and the EU\u2019s new carbon tax and forest regulations.\n\nWhile the WTO projects a gradual recovery in global trade, predicting 2.6 per cent volume growth in 2024 and 3.3 per cent in 2025, geopolitical risks remain.\n\nIndia\u2019s top export markets during H1 included the US, the UAE, the Netherlands, the UK, and China. Despite modest export growth, the country\u2019s trade deficit widened by over 24 per cent to USD 54.83 billion during April-September, compared to USD 44.18 billion in the same period last year. However, September saw the deficit narrow to a five-month low.\n\n\u201cThe external sector needs close monitoring, with real-time interventions when necessary,\u201d said Manoranjan Sharma, chief economist at Infomerics Ratings.\n\nIndia\u2019s evolving trade scenario underscores the importance of diversification and resilience to navigate global uncertainties. The focus on engineering, electronics, and pharmaceuticals could drive export growth as global trade recovers.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

        "text": "The dollar index continued its rise for the third consecutive week. The rise to 104 almost happened last week in line with our expectation. The index touched a high of 103.87, and has come down from there to close the week at 103.49. \n\nDollar outlook\n\nThe overall bullish view is intact. The dollar index (103.49) has some resistance at 104 which can be tested this week. We expect this resistance to hold on its first test.\n\n A corrective fall from around 104 to 103-102.70 is a possibility. A fresh leg of up-move thereafter will have the potential to breach 104. That in turn will open the doors for the dollar index to see a fresh rise to 105-105.50 in the coming weeks. \n\nFinds support\n\nThe US 10Yr Treasury yield (4.08 per cent) is getting support around 4 per cent. The yield fell in the first half of the week and made a low of 3.99 per cent. But from there it rose back well in the second half recovering all the loss.\n\nImmediate resistance is at 4.12 per cent. A break above it can take the US 10Yr Treasury yield up to 4.17 and 4.21 per cent this week. The price action thereafter will need a close watch to see if the rise is extending beyond 4.21 per cent or not.\n\nThe outlook will turn negative only if the yield declines below 4 per cent. Only then the chances of a fall to 3.85-3.8 per cent will come into the picture again.\n\nMore downside\n\nThe euro (EURUSD: 1.0867) continues to fall. It touched a low of 1.0811 and has bounced back from there. The broader trend is down. Resistances are at 1.0885 and then 1.0920-1.0930 which can cap the upside if more rise is seen from current levels.\n\nThe outlook is bearish to break 1.08 in the coming days. Such a break can take the euro down to 1.0750 in the short term.\n\nThe level of 1.0750 is a strong support which can halt the current fall. A bounce from there can trigger a corrective rise to 1.09-1.0950 going forward.\n\nThe Indian rupee (USDINR: 84.07) was broadly stable all through last week. The domestic currency was stuck in a narrow 10-paise range of 83.98-84.08 through the week. The break above 84 seen on Wednesday failed to get a strong follow-through rise. There are chances for the rupee to remain stuck between 84 and 84.10 for some more time.\n\nHowever, the bias is negative. We expect the rupee to break 84.10 eventually and decline towards 84.40 going forward. \n\nRupee has to get a sustained rise above 84 in order to see a recovery towards 83.85-83.80.\n\nOn the charts, the medium-term picture is negative for the rupee. It is likely to remain below 83.50 going forward. Once the break below 84.10 happens, it will open the doors for the rupee to weaken towards 84.80-85 over the medium-term.",

        "text": "The Nobel prize in economics for 2024, or more correctly Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded earlier this week has triggered off debates not as much about economics but about colonialism and its institutions. Economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were awarded for their significant work on how a nation\u2019s institutions shape its economic development. Among the most cited in economics, their work not only draws a connection between the two but parses societal institutions into \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cextractive\u201d, and theorises that inclusive institutions have a positive long-term impact on economic prosperity while extractive institutions stifle a country\u2019s economic development. They claim inclusive institutions are the ones that promote democracy, limit corruption, enforce justice and property rights; the extractive show a high concentration of power, corruption, and limited political freedom.\n\nThe claim that certain institutions are a pre-condition for economic development has drawn criticism from within the discipline because inclusive institutions in many high-income western economies came about after their development. Equally important is how countries like China, to take an example, enjoy staggering economic prosperity despite \u201cextractive\u201d institutions. The economists have ignored the impact of colonialism \u2014 and its extractive institutions in colonies \u2014 on economic development. This should interest India where the flavour of the season is to throw off the colonial yoke and symbols. Its institutions, a colonial legacy, still function on the discredited trickle-down theory; there has been a staggering rise in its billionaires count even as household savings have fallen sharply with people spending more on basic necessities. If anything, this year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics draws attention to why it is critical for India to de-colonise its economic structure that was, and continues to be, based on the extractive principle.",

        "text": "State-run lender UCO Bank on Saturday reported around 50 per cent year-on-year growth in its net profit to \u20b9602.74 crore for the second quarter this fiscal, backed by over 45 per cent y-o-y rise in its operating profit and around 44 per cent y-o-y fall in provisions during the period.\n\nThe Kolkata-based bank had registered \u20b9401.67 crore net profit for the second quarter last fiscal. The lender posted \u20b9550.96 crore net profit in the first quarter of the current financial year. \n\nIts operating profit for the second quarter of FY25 grew \u20b945.80 crore to \u20b91431.60 crore from \u20b9 981.88 crore for the corresponding period of FY24, the bank said in a stock exchange filing. \n\nNet Interest Income (NII) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 stood at \u20b92300.34 crore, registering a growth of around 20 per cent on a y-o-y basis as against \u20b91916.55 crore for the same period a year ago. Domestic Net Interest Margin (NIM) rose 25 basis points y-o-y to 3.30 per cent. During the period non-interest income grew 53.48 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9993.07 crore. \n\nTalking to the media, UCO Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Office Ashwani Kumar said the increase in net interest income and non-interest income were the two main factors for the growth in net profit. \u201cOur provision coverage ratio slightly came down and NIM improved,\u201d Kumar said. Provision Coverage Ratio stood at 95.92 per cent as on September 30, 2024.\n\nTotal provision during the quarter fell 44.07 per cent y-o-y at \u20b9492.84 crore compared with \u20b9342.09 crore for the same period last fiscal. Fresh slippages stood at \u20b9864 crore during Q2FY25 compared with \u20b9578 crore in Q2FY24. \u201cSlippage was slightly elevated in this quarter due to one corporate account which turned into an NPA, having an exposure of around \u20b9245 crore,\u201d the MD said. \n\nTotal Recovery and upgradation\n\nTotal recovery and upgradation during the period stood at \u20b91017 crore as against \u20b9656 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal. \n\nUCO Bank has so far recovered around 90 per cent of the \u201cerroneous credits\u201d which certain account holders of the bank had received via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) last year. \u201cActions are on to recover the rest of the money. Our endeavour is to recover maximum during this fiscal,\u201d Kumar said. Notably, certain accounts holders of the Kolkata-based bank in November last year had received a total of around Rs 820 crore \u201cerroneous credits\u201d via IMPS.\n\nThe lender\u2019s asset quality improved during Q2FY25. Gross NPA ratio fell 96 bps year-on-year to 3.18 per cent, whereas net NPA ratio fell 38 bps y-o-y to 0.73 per cent during the period. \n\nThe bank is planning to tap capital markets for raising of equity capital upto \u20b9 1500-2000 crore by way of QIP in one or more tranches. \u201cWe may go for it in the third quarter, subject to market conditions,\u201d Kumar said. \n\nThe bank\u2019s overall loan growth target for this fiscal is 12-14 per cent y-o-y. It expects that home and car loans to grow 18 per cent and 30 per cent y-o-y, respectively, during this festive season.\n\nIn the second quarter the lender witnessed an 18 per cent y-o-y growth in gross advances, while deposits growth stood at 10.57 per cent y-o-y.",

        "text": "India sustained a robust economic growth rate of 8.2 per cent in FY 2023-24, up from 7.0 per cent the previous year, expanding its economy to an estimated $3.5 trillion. \n\nWith the ongoing structural reforms, the country aims to achieve a $5 trillion economy by 2027. Among the key industries fueling this growth, the Indian government has prioritised the agrochemical sector, recognising it as one of the \u201c12 industries with the greatest potential for India to achieve global leadership.\u201d\n\nThe agrochemical sector has experienced significant progress, with projections estimating its value will reach $8.22 billion by 2024 and grow to $13.08 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 4 per cent. \n\nHowever, FY2023-24 brought its share of challenges, including fluctuating markets, rising raw material costs, and unpredictable monsoons. \n\nAlso read: What is it in the Digital Farm Mission?\n\nResilient industry\n\nThe industry has remained resilient, supported by government initiatives like \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cAtmanirbhar Abhiyan,\u201d strategic investments, and a focus on innovation. Increased collaboration in research and development, alongside the growing focus on manufacturing is expected to further drive the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nInternational magazine Agropages released the rankings of the top 20 Indian agrochemical companies based on their FY 2023-24 performance. The revenue threshold for inclusion in the top 20 list increased to \u20b91,226 crore, up from \u20b91,151 crore in the previous year, reflecting robust growth among the Indian agrochemical companies. \n\nAmong the top 20 companies, 11 surpassed the \u20b92,000 crore sales mark, while nine companies reported revenues between \u20b91,000 crore and \u20b92,000 crore. \n\nNotably, 10 companies posted year-on-year growth, with PI Industries and Safex Chemicals achieving double-digit increases, nearing or exceeding 20 per cent. \n\nOn the other hand, 10 companies faced declines in sales, with Sharda Cropchem and Meghmani Group experiencing the steepest drops.\n\nFocus on R&D pays off\n\nOne of the standout performers in the Agropages rankings was Best Agrolife Ltd (BAL), which climbed from 16th place last year to 13th in FY 23-24. \n\nThe company reported a consolidated revenue of \u20b91,873.3 crores for the fiscal year, showcasing its growth and increasing market presence. Interestingly, the company\u2019s growth relied on building its brand business. Its branded business grew by 85 per cent in FY \u201824, while having shifted its focus from B2B to B2C. \n\nThe company\u2019s focus on R&D and patented products seems to have yielded a strong product presence in the expanding customer base.

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 20 (IANS) The outlook for the market for next week will be guided by the major domestic and global economic data such as India Nikkei S&P Global manufacturing and services PMI data, India RBI MPC meeting minutes, US initial jobless claims, FII activities and quarterly results, according to the experts.\n\nBetween October 21 and 25, the results for the September quarter of the financial year 2024-25 will be released by companies like Bajaj Housing Finance, UltraTech Cement, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Green Energy, Bajaj Finance, Godrej Property, TVS Motors and JSW Steel.\n\nThe Indian stock market extended its losing streak for the third consecutive week with nifty 50 toppling to its weakest level since August before settling the week at 24,854, down nearly 0.50 per cent or 110 points from the previous week, while Sensex declined around 0.20 per cent or 156 points to end the week at 81,224.\n\nThe weakness in Indian indices was triggered by disappointing quarterly earnings by major companies and underwhelming India\u2019s inflation figures which again fuelled the expectation of delay in early rate cut by RBI (Reserve Bank of India). The consumer price inflation in India rose to 5.49 per cent in September from 3.65 per cent in the previous month, well above market estimates of 5 per cent. It was the highest inflation rate since the start of the year, overshooting the RBI\u2019s target of 4 per cent after dropping below the threshold in the first two months of the September quarter.\n\nHowever, a significant fall in crude oil prices helped the market to recover from lower levels.\n\nOn the domestic front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to offload shares, selling Rs 21,823 crore in the cash segment, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) kept their buying momentum with purchases totalling Rs16,384 crore in the same segment.\n\nPalka Arora Chopra, Director of Master Capital Services said, \u201cNifty 50 ended its three-week losing streak by closing in the green. The key resistance now stands at 25,000, and a breakout above this could lead to a move toward 25,300. On the downside, support is at 24,500, and a breach below this may see the index drop to 24,200.\u201d\n\nPravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart said, \u201cBank Nifty, on the other hand, is showing relative strength, with resistance at 52,400 and 53,000. The immediate demand zone lies between 51,700 and 51,500. It needs to cross the 20-DMA Of 52,300 to confirm a bullish reversal. Above 20-DMA, the next target will be the 53,300 level.\u201d",

        "text": "The USD 200 billion Chinese food delivery industry, once a thriving sector that expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic, is now facing a downturn, according to a report by CNN.Having more than doubled in size over three years, this industry \u2013 the world\u2019s largest by revenue and volume of orders \u2013 had provided a steady income for casual workers. However, the workers are now struggling to make ends meet.China\u2019s economic slowdown, prompted by a property crisis and weak consumer spending, has hit delivery workers hard, decreasing their incomes and job stability.On Friday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed a moderation in third-quarter growth and said that weakened consumer spending and the ongoing property market crisis continue to weigh heavily on the economy.Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.6 per cent in the three-month period from July to September, compared with a year ago. That was just slightly higher than the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, who had predicted an expansion of 4.5 per cent, CNN reported.According to a professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, delivery workers will persistently face pressure as long as delivery platforms prioritise cost-cutting measures. \u201cThey are working long hours, really being squeezed,\u201d said Jenny Chan, associate sociology professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong. \u201c[And] they will continue to face pressure as [delivery platforms] have to keep the cost low,\u201d she said.Chan further noted that the economic downturn has led to a shift towards budget-friendly meals, resulting in decreased earnings for delivery workers, who must then work extended hours to maintain their earnings.Apart from the given problems, the workers are constantly under immense pressure to meet tight deadlines, even if it means cutting corners on the road \u2013 by speeding or running red lights \u2013 causing hazards that endanger both themselves and other road users, CNN reported.Delivery workers have been witnessing their paychecks shrink dramatically, increasing their financial struggles.Last year, they made 6,803 yuan (USD 956) a month, according to a report from the China New Employment Research Center. That\u2019s almost 1,000 yuan (USD 140) a month less than they were making five years ago, despite many reporting working longer hours, according to CNN.A 1,000 yuan difference may seem negligible in US dollars, but it\u2019s substantial in China, where the national average monthly wage stood at just 1,838 yuan (USD 258) last year, according to the NBS figures.",

        "text": "Kasauli, Oct 20 (IANS) India\u2019s G20 Sherpa and former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant contends that in order for India to grow at high rates of nine to ten per cent and become a developed economy by 2047, the country\u2019s GDP has to grow by nine times and per capita income by eight times, with manufacturing and urbanisation playing a key role in the process.\n\nHe also hailed India\u2019s chairmanship of the G20 and batted for lateral entry into the government service.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturing has to grow by 16 times. It has to fire on all cylinders. We have to become a manufacturing nation,\u201d Kant told IANS at the Kasauli Literary Festival.\n\nHe also stressed that the country must urbanise in a scientific, sustainable manner, enhance agriculture productivity, and remain a services nation.\n\n\u201cFor all this to happen, you have to provide well-paid jobs to the people and every transition that takes place to manufacturing means that people must move from agriculture to manufacturing and towards urbanisation. The dependence of population in India on agriculture is 46.5 per cent,\u201d Kant added.\n\nHe pointed out that agriculture gives us 16.5 per cent of the GDP, adding that nowhere in the world does this happen.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you need to take the population away from agriculture and put them into manufacturing on better-paid quality jobs. There also needs to be stress on disinvestment, cutting red tape, and ease of doing business which has been this government\u2019s agenda,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nAbout the time when India held the presidency of G20 from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, Kant recollects that the country was able to bring consensus on all key issues confronting the world.\n\nSome of the key issues were a specific action plan for sustainable development goals which had been impacted due to Covid, the issue of strong, sustainable, balanced growth in the global economy, the issue of Green Development Pact, technological transformation and the use of digital public infrastructure and more importantly, the issue of women-led development.\n\n\u201cThese were all critical issues. But to my mind, our biggest achievement during G20 was the fact that it spoke the voice of the Global South, and under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, was able to make the African Union an integral member of G20. So, in a way, we succeeded in making it from G20 to G21 which has made G20 a far more inclusive body in the world. Now, it covers almost 90 per cent of the global population and covers a very vast, almost 80 per cent of the global GDP. So, this has been India\u2019s biggest achievement,\u201d Kant said.\n\nStressing that it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wish to hold G20 meetings in most states and UTs, and not just at one or two places, the former bureaucrat said: \u201cWe took it to every nook and corner of the country. And every state was an active participant. This required clockwork precision. It was a very federal G20. Every state brought their one district and a product forward.\u201d\n\nAdding that the country has succeeded hugely when it comes to ease of doing business, Kant claims what India has achieved in last eight years what it could not achieve in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe have scrapped over 1,600 laws. And moved up 79 positions in the World Bank ease of doing business. India has now become an easy and simple nation,\u201d he said.\n\nKant feels that the next lot of reforms have to happen by the states which have to make procedures simple.\n\n\u201cThis is very critical. India has done a lot of work in terms of insolvency, bankruptcy code, real estate regulation act, and goods and services tax. We have opened up, reduced the corporate tax, and opened up the economy for the private sector in a much bigger way while the FDI has also grown,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked why small traders are not very happy with the introduction of GST, Kant said that there will be some unhappy people when you bring in major reforms of paperless digital tax, as you are cutting out human intervention completely.\n\n\u201cGST rates in some areas are high but that is an issue where states and Central government have to sit down and sort out,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout India\u2019s focus right now, the former NITI Aayog CEO said first and foremost, the country needs to drive manufacturing in a big way and increase exports in order to become an exporting nation.\n\n\u201cWe must urbanise and must improve learning and health outcomes and nutritional standards which is very important. The social indicators to improve are very critical. Health, education, nutrition, all these are very critical over a long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nConsidering that NITI Ayog during his reign had several lateral entries, India\u2019s G20 Sherpa said that he has always been in favour of lateral entrants considering they bring in a lot of fresh thinking.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to find ways of, introducing new talents into government to constantly push for innovation and transformation within government,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that there was no disconnect between major schemes and their implementation on the ground, Kant cited a few examples.\n\n\u201cWe have made 40 million houses and provided pipe water connection to 253 million Indians. Around 130 million toilets and 88,000 kilometres of road have been made. Now this is the kind of infrastructure which no other country has been able to make in seven years. What disconnection are you talking about?\u201d",

This is mainly on account of higher yields on account of favourable weather conditions. The yields are estimated to be higher this year at 1063 kg per hectare as against 1002 kg per ha in the previous year, as per the survey carried out by SOPA recently in the key producing states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.",

The incident sparked nationwide outrage, with several voices stressing the need to raise boys better instead of restricting girls.\n\n\"It starts at home, it starts for boys at a very tender age of 4-5 years when they start understanding the difference between a boy and a girl... how a girl should be respected... it is for mothers to understand and tell their little boys.

She is married to actor Saif Ali Khan.\n\nThe actor said children understand actions more than words. \"If they also see their mother doing (work) things... Taimur understands now, I have told him that I am speaking at a very important event, so he is excited, he's like 'What are you gonna talk about?' When I go home, he might ask me. So we will talk about different things that I said... These conversations are important,\" she said.\n\nEarlier, while responding to a question about her son Jeh, Ms Kapoor Khan said she would want him to grow up into someone who would always stand by the truth. \"He (Jeh) has a brother, but that does not mean he does not have a (duty) to protect other girls, he will be somebody's father, husband someday so I hope he values what his mother has done for him because he sees his mother and father go to work.

        "text": "A new genus and snake species discovered in the Himalayas has been named after the Academy Award-winning Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio - the \"Titanic\" star who is also a passionate environmentalist, officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe newly described snake species, \u2018Anguiculus dicaprioi' is distributed from central Nepal to Chamba district in Himachal Pradesh, whereas \u2018Anguiculus rappii' is distributed in Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThese snakes are mostly active from late May to August and are not found at other times of the year, nothing is known about the biology of the two species, and \u2018Anguiculus rappii' is rare and has not been recorded in the last couple of decades.\n\nThe snake was first found by Virender Bhardwaj in the backyard of his home in the western Himalayas during the Covid-19 Pandemic lockdown.\n\nHe posted its pictures on social media, leading to a sensation - and a three-year-long investigation coupled with laborious research - to identify the snake which resembled \u2018Liopeltis rappi', a species known to be distributed in the eastern Himalayas.\n\nHowever, the population from Himachal Pradesh differed from the true \u2018Liopeltis rappi' found in Sikkim in many aspects like the scales on the head and general colour patterns -- which was confirmed by examining specimens from natural history museums across Europe, the US and even India.\n\nBesides, the DNA sequences generated for this snake did not match any genus and the team included DNA and morphological data for other related species from all over Asia.\n\nThe complication of the molecular and morphological data suggested that the snake from HP is related to \u2018Liopeltis rappi' but differed in many aspects, to be called a new species, and both these belong to a new genus that is endemic to the Himalayas region.\n\nA research paper was authored by Zeeshan A. Mirza of Max Planck Institute for Biology at Tubingen (Germany); Virender K. Bhardwaj and H. T. Lalremsanga of Mizoram University (India); Saunak Pal of the Newcastle University (UK); Gernot Vogel of the Society for Southeast Asian Herpetology(Germany); Patrick D. Cambell of the Natural History Museum (UK) and Harshil Patel of the Thackeray Wildlife Foundation (Mumbai, India).\n\nThe research paper was submitted early this year and published recently by Scientific Reports, an international peer-reviewed journal.\n\nDiCaprio has been actively involved in creating awareness about global climate change, increased biodiversity losses and the impact of pollution on human health plus related issues.\n\n\"The specific epithet 'dicaprioi' is a patronym honouring Leonardo DiCaprio, an American actor, film producer, and environmentalist who has been actively involved in creating awareness about global climate change, increased biodiversity loss, and human health issues through pollution,\" the report explained.\n\n\"The work not only resolved the status of the Himalayan species but also resolved a taxonomic confusion regarding the genera Liopeltis and Gongylosoma that lasted 180 years. The work provides a newly revised classification of these two genera that are distributed across Asia,\" said a statement here.\n\nThe members of the genus Anguiculus are small and are currently known by two species and these snakes are found at elevations above 1500 meters across the Himalayas.\n\nThe authors said that the description of a new snake genus and species from Himachal Pradesh highlights the poor herpetofauna documentation of the western Himalayas.\n\nPreliminary field surveys across Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand suggest that the region's biodiversity has been grossly underestimated, and along with Jammu & Kashmir, remain the least explored for the herpetofauna biota they host.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The work was edited by Vidwan Satavadhani R. Ganesh at his own cost spending over \u20b93 lakh in the process, as a mark of respect and tribute to Sayanacharya, said Mr. Lokanath.

The discussions are at a preliminary stage and there is no proposal before the Board of the company or its insurance subsidiaries in this regard, said Bajaj Finserv.\u201cAllianz has indicated to Bajaj that given its strategic priorities, it is actively considering an exit from the life and general insurance joint ventures. It has indicated that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market but will not speculate on alternatives,\u201d said Bajaj Finserv.Bajaj Finserv holds a 74 per cent stake each in two JVs Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. while Allianz owns the remaining.Allianz plans to exit because Bajaj Group isn\u2019t allowing the German insurer to raise its stakes at a discounted price. It also isn\u2019t given a say in strategic decisions, according to a Bloomberg report.As per a 2001 joint venture agreement, the German company had a call option to increase its stake in the life insurance joint venture to 74 per cent from 26 per cent at a predetermined price if allowed under laws and subject to regulatory approvals. If the option is exercised by July 30, 2016, the pre-determined price will be Rs 5.42 per share, plus interest at 16 per cent per annum from July 31, 2001, to the date of payment. After 2016, Allianz would have to pay the market price.Allianz is instead now looking to buy stakes in newly established insurance firms to retain a presence in the fast-growing South Asian country, said the news report.Allianz, in case it exits the joint venture, has committed full support to Bajaj in ensuring a smooth transition to the Bajaj brand keeping in mind the interest of policyholders, business partners, employees and other stakeholders of the insurance companies, the statement further said.The Bajaj Allianz general insurer is the third-largest in the country by gross written premiums, while the Bajaj Allianz life insurer is one of the fastest-growing with assets under management of Rs one lakh crore as of March 31, 2024.",

Honouring the washing stones on the Muthalakkulam ground in Kozhikode city, which are forced to suffer the beating of dhobis in the daytime and the long and tedious speeches of politicians in the evenings was one such act. When the Miss World competition was held in Bengaluru to choose the most beautiful woman in the world, Vaidyar conducted a \u2018Viroopa Rani\u2019 and \u2018Viroopa Raja\u2019 competition in Kozhikode to select the most ugly-looking people,\u201d Mr. Leelakrishnan said. He was also the first to give a \u201clife-long pension\u201d to his wife.\n\nVaidyar, an Ayurvedic medical practitioner by profession, was more famous for his social criticism and friendship with eminent writers of his time. Nilgiris, the private lodge he ran near the railway station, was a haven for many writers, Mr. Leelakrishnan recalled.\n\nHe pointed out that Malayalis were often found to preach something and practise something else. Mere criticism would not help address this attitude, and Vaidyar knew it very well. That was why he resorted to his quirky acts, Mr. Leelakrishnan said. Thus, Vaidyar became part of the great tradition of satirists in Malayalam such as Kunchan Nambiar, E.V. Krishna Pillai, Sanjayan, and VKN, he added. \n\nCalicut Press Club president E.P. Mohammed and senior journalists A. Sajeevan and Kamal Varadoor, among others, were present.",

In the latest episode of the show's 16th season, the actor engaged in foodie conversations with contestant Harsha Upadhyay and revealed his favourite dish, which is a popular street snack in Mumbai. After a food-related question, contestant Harsha Upadhyay, an arts, crafts, and music teacher from Gujarat, asks Amitabh Bachchan if he enjoys churma, reported IANS. Big B chuckles and reveals that while he may not know all the dishes, he does have a favourite snack - Vada Pav.\n\nAlso Read:Not Just Deepika Padukone, Prabhas Has Also Treated These Stars To Yummy Food\n\nTalking about his love for Vada Pav, the KBC host says, \"Usse badhkar koi cheez nahi hai, chhota sa hai par lekin itna badiya hai... har jagah milta hai - sirf desh mein hi nahi, par videsh mein bhi.

        "text": "Mitchell Starc has started to peak just before the Border Gavaskar Trophy against India as shown by his scorching spell at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) during Sheffield Shield. While featuring for the New South Wales, Starc was a force to be reckoned with across both innings. Ahead of the highly-anticipated BGT series, where skills and patience will be tested, Starc is getting primed at the right time. He took 1/35 and 6/81 in 36.5 overs across the match. On both occasions, Starc removed Marcus Harris, one of the players in contention to open for Australia in the BGT.He took seven wickets in the match by putting his experience and skillset to optimum use. But even after his valiant display, New South Wales tasted a 141-run defeat against Victoria. NSW coach Greg Shipperd believes India could find themselves in a tough spot if the conditions are similar to the one they played in. \u201cHis pace, his rhythm, all of those things that go to engineering the sort of pace he was dealing with. He changed the game once he decided to go short and really change the dynamic of the match. And the second innings again, we thought perhaps he\u2019d done enough, but he kept coming. And so that\u2019s a good sign for Australia and troubles ahead, perhaps, on the right wicket for India,\u201d Greg said as quoted from ESPNcricinfo. On the fourth day of the match, Victoria stood victorious before lunch. Right-arm pacer Sam Elliot picked the final four scalps to end NSW\u2019s agony. He broke the stubborn partnership 63-run between Josh Philippe and Starc. Philippe scored 88. Starc was next to follow after top-edging the ball while attempting a pull. Nathan Lyon departed similarly after miscuing his pull shot, which was taken at the square leg. Elliot cleaned up Jackson Bird moments later to seal the game in Victoria\u2019s favour. (ANI)",

        "text": "Mumbai: Actress Akansha Ranjan Kapoor has recently shared her excitement about teaming up with filmmaker Vasan Bala for the film \u2018Jigra.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe film featured Akansha in a cameo alongside Alia Bhatt. The actress expressed deep appreciation for Bala, calling him as a significant guiding force in her career. Reflecting on her decision to join the film, Akansha recounted how, upon receiving Vasan\u2019s call, she didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment before agreeing to take part. The \u2018Guilty\u2019 star shared, \u201cI had an absolute blast working with Vasan Sir again. Whenever he calls me, it's a no-brainer for me to say yes, and it was the same with Jigra. I remember he called me one fine day and told me that I had a one-day shoot, and I immediately signed up for it. He\u2019s always been a guiding force in my career. The fact that this short scene is getting so much love from the audience, and that people are tagging me everywhere, feels amazing.\u201d In \u2018Jigra\u2019, Akansha portrayed a quirky air hostess who brings a much-needed dose of levity to the story. Clad in a sharp uniform, she makes a striking impression. Her standout moment comes in a scene with Alia Bhatt, where she serves food to Bhatt\u2019s character.\r\n\r\nThe film, produced by Karan Johar, also starred Vedang Raina in a pivotal role. The film was released on October 11. In terms of work, Akansha is known for her impressive performances in the films like \u2018Guilty\u2019, \u2018Ray\u2019, and \u2018Monica, O My Darling.\u2019 Jigra marked the actress\u2019 fourth collaboration with Vasan Bala. Kapoor is all set to make her South debut with the upcoming film \u2018Maaya One\u2019 alongside Sundeep Kishan.\r\n\r\nIn the film, which is also said to be Akanksha\u2019s first appearance on the silver screen, Kishan reprises his role as crime inspector, Kumaran. She also has many exciting OTT projects in her kitty.",

        "text": "Former Australian speedster Brett Lee has described the Indian team as a \"powerhouse that don't want to bow down\" to anyone, cautioning his compatriots who will take on the Asian giants in an upcoming five-match Test series. Lee's remarks came after India's eight-wicket defeat to New Zealand in the Bengaluru Test earlier this week. India, aiming to qualify for their third successive final in the World Test Championship, will be travelling to Australia next month to defend the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"This day and age, India is a powerhouse that don't want to bow down. They know how to win, and they know they can beat Australia; they know they can beat the Kiwis. They know they can beat anyone on any given day,\" Lee told 'Fox Cricket'.Commenting on India's outing in the Bengaluru Test against the Kiwis, Lee felt that they might have got influenced by 'Bazball', leading to playing some loose shots.\"India just didn't go into their shell. Maybe it's Bazball brushing off on other cricketers around the world,\" he noted.\"I know that India won't be proud of the way they played. They played some pretty loose shots.\" India's decision to bat first in overcast conditions raised eyebrows, as the team was bowled out for 46 in the first innings of the opening Test, its lowest Test score at home.Lee said the side needs to \"weigh up the risk factor\" and added the Indians should have judged the conditions better.\"But, you've got to weigh up the risk factor as well. There are times when you've got to go, 'Okay, well, maybe the big shots aren't working today'.\"Maybe, just rein it in a little bit. I don't think they sort of summed up the conditions as quickly as what they should have done,\" Lee said.India play two more Tests against New Zealand -- Pune (October 24-28) and Mumbai (November 1-5) -- before leaving for Australia.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Americans have a strong fascination with live sports, leading to the term \"WAGs\" for the wives and girlfriends of professional athletes. Taylor Swift began a relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce during her Eras Tour. The relationship was confirmed when Swift attended Chiefs games with Kelce's mom and Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany Mahomes. The National Football League quickly recognized the value of Swift's presence at games, making the Kansas City Chiefs and Swift almost synonymous, despite longtime football fans' disdain. However there also have been some controversies.

The video, which was not based on a viral social media post or paparazzi snap, has made a significant mistake, leaving fans and Swifties scratching their heads. This saga has been filled with whispers, theories, and speculation this season. \u2014 cynthiamt123 (@cynthiamt123) The NFL has made a name drop during a Kansas City Chiefs game preview, causing fans to question if they know more than they let on.

Last season, a similar incident occurred during a Wild Card Game preview when Travis was referred to as \"Travis Swift-Kelce.\" This time, the NFL dropped a bombshell during their Week 3 video recap, referring to Taylor Kelce as just five yards, sending fans into a tailspin.Taylor Swift's extensive feature in an NFL promo video had drawn mixed reactionsTaylor Swift's promotional video for the Kansas City Chiefs has sparked controversy among fans. The video features Swift attending games with Travis Kelce's mother, kissing him on the field, and celebrating at the Super Bowl.

The Daily Mail reported that several fans found the video 'ridiculous', questioning whether it was a blunder or joke.The romance was part of a predetermined planA leaked document claiming a \"Comprehensive Media Plan\" for the 'Love Story' couple has gone viral, causing concern among Swift's followers. The leaked document claimed the couple's romance was part of a predetermined plan, with a planned breakup date of September 28th. However, Full Scope, the company for Kelce, denied the rumor, stating the document was entirely made up and had nothing to do with the company. \"These documents are entirely false and fabricated and were not created, issued or authorized by this agency,\" the rep for Kelce team claimed. \"We have engaged our legal team to initiate proceedings against the individuals or entities responsible for the unlawful and injurious forgery of documents,\" the rep added, hinting at a full-blown legal battle against those spreading false news.Also Read: \u201cHe can fall asleep at a f***ing rock concert\u201d: Travis Kelce hilariously blames his dad for his and Jason Kelce's sleeping habit",

        "text": "Boman Irani recently took to Instagram to share a special post for his wife Zenobia Irani, who celebrates her birthday on October 23. To accompany a carousel of photos, he penned a long, heartfelt caption filled with candid musings and wishes for his spouse. He mentioned how his wife has \"ghar ka khanna\" taste buds, which makes it difficult for them to find spots for eating out that she would like. In the post, Boman Irani hinted at their shared love for chai too. He explained that, while travelling out of the country, his wife's pet peeve is being rather disappointed with specific tea offerings. She often tends to feel that drinks that are labelled chai abroad don't actually deserve to be called that. He finds himself in agreement with her on this point.\n\nAlso Read:\"I Truly Believe In This\" - Boman Irani's Latest Reel Is All About Bonding Over Food\n\nBoman Irani's note also includes several other glimpses into their life together. He has lovingly described her habits and complimented her personality. Here's the complete caption: \"It is impossible to find a restaurant to please your \"Ghar Ka Khana\" tastebuds. Impossible. You always repeat instructions a minimum of 84 times. Like, \"Check the passport, or let's leave 4 hours early for the airport, or let's go to the gate, 2 hours before the gate opens. When you see a dog... you snap your finger and instruct me to take a photograph like I'm on your payroll. When I'm abroad, you wake me up in the middle of the night to ask if I've taken my medication. Then wonder why I'm sounding sleepy. When in town you give me my medication yourself, and 5 minutes later you ask if you've given me my medication. You hate to speak in public but somehow love to speak (a lot) in private. When abroad, your pet peeve phrase is, \"How dare they call this CHAI??\" (This, I agree, actually.). I wouldn't mind being on your staff; that's where one gets treated the best.I love to grumble about you like this. Because saying nice things is somehow boring. But today I am going to say just one nice thing. Why not... I have yet to find a person who has a single bad thing to say about you. Said it. Only because it's your birthday. Happy birthday, Zen!\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nBefore this, Boman Irani had posted about his experience dining at Chef Vikas Khanna's New York restaurant. He posted a reel that captured Chef Khanna's hospitality and the lip-smacking dishes served during the meal. Boman said that it was an \"unforgettable celebration\".

        "text": "Former MLC quits BJP to join Congress, likely to contest Channapatna by-polls\n\nBengaluru: In a big shocker for the opposition BJP and JD(S) alliance, former Minister C.P. Yogeshwar tendered his resignation to the primary membership of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to join the Congress party, here this morning. Yogeshwar sent his resignation to BJP State President B.Y. Vijayendra through a WhatsApp message. It may be remembered that Yogeshwar, who was nominated to the Legislative Council by BJP, had resigned as MLC on Monday.\n\nThe former BJP MLC joined the Congress party in presence of KPCC President and Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, Ministers N. Cheluvarayaswamy, B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan and R. Ramalinga Reddy, former MP D.K. Suresh among others including party MLAs from Mandya and Ramanagara districts at KPCC Office on Queen\u2019s Road.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Yogeshwar said he had joined the Congress party unconditionally. However, sources said that Congress is likely to field Yogeshwar in Channapatna bypoll.\n\nMeanwhile, D.K. Shivakumar said that All India Congress Committee (AICC) would announce the candidate for Channapatna by-election this evening following which the nomination papers will be filed tomorrow.\n\nYogeshwar, who aspired to contest the upcoming Channapatna by-poll on a BJP ticket, was denied the ticket by party high command which forced the former Minister to join the Congress party. Yogeshwar\u2019s move comes amid JD(S) State President and Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy informing the party workers about BJP National President J.P. Nadda and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi calling to him to enquire the possibility of Yogeshwar contesting the Channapatna by-polls on a JD(S) ticket.\n\nIt may be recalled, H.D. Kumaraswamy had defeated C.P. Yogeshwar by a margin of 15,195 votes in the Assembly polls held last year.\n\nAccording to sources, Yogeshwar had given BJP High Command a deadline till Oct. 22 evening to decide on the ticket. With party unable to take a decision, the former Minister decided on rejoining the Congress party. Yogeshwar\u2019s return will not only be a boost to the Congress Party in Channapatna but will also strengthen the party in Bengaluru Rural and old Mysuru region.\n\nThe prominent Vokkaliga leader, also a five-time MLA from Channapatna, had played a crucial role for the victory of BJP candidate Dr. C.N. Manjunath, brother-in-law of H.D. Kumaraswamy, from Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha Constituency in 2024 elections against the then sitting Congress MP D.K. Suresh, younger brother of D.K. Shivakumar, by a margin of 2,69, 647 votes.\n\nSources also said that Yogeshwar was also in touch with Samajwadi Party leaders to secure a \u2018B\u2019 Form to contest the upcoming by-poll from Channapatna. However, in the last minute he decided to rejoin the Congress Party as he saw better chances of winning and bright political prospects in the future. \n\nThe by-poll to Channapatna Assembly Constituency has been necessitated following the resignation of H.D. Kumaraswamy as MLA after him getting elected to Lok Sabha from Mandya during the general elections held early this year.\n\nThe last date for filing of nomination papers is Oct. 25 while the polling will take place on Nov.13 and the results will be announced on Nov. 23.\n\nC.P. Yogeshwar\u2019s electoral career in Channapatna Assembly Constituency\n\n1999: He won as an independent candidate by a margin of 18,828 against Congress party\u2019s Sadath Ali Khan.\n\n2004: Contested on a Congress ticket and defeated M.C. Ashwath of JD(S) by a margin of 16,169 votes.\n\n2008: Contested again from Congress and defeated M.C. Ashwath of JD(S) by a margin of 4,930 votes.\n\n2009 (By-election): Joined BJP and lost to H.D. Kumaraswamy (JD-S) by a margin of 20,254 votes.\n\n2011 (By-election): Contested on BJP ticket and won against S.I. Nagaraju of JD(S) by a margin of 17,803 votes.\n\n2013: Contested on a Samajwadi Party ticket and won against Anitha Kumaraswamy (JD-S) by a margin of 6,464 votes.\n\n2018: Contested from BJP and lost to H.D. Kumaraswamy by a margin of 21,530 votes.\n\n2022: Nominated as MLC by the BJP State Government under artiste quota as he was also a Kannada actor.\n\n2023: Contested from BJP and lost to H.D.

        "text": "Like every year, fashion designer Manish Malhotra hosted a Diwali party on Tuesday night. The star-studded event was attended by who's who of Bollywood, including Shraddha Kapoor. The actress looked stunning in a silver tissue saree, which she paired with a heart-shaped purse. Later in the night, the actress tried to make a quiet exit from the party but was enveloped by a crowd of paparazzi. In a shrewd attempt to divert the shutterbugs' attention, the actress pointed in the other direction and mentioned Shah Rukh Khan's name, believing that the paps would hurry to get a picture of the star, allowing her to make a quick exit. In between all this, Shraddha approached the wrong car and attempted to change the subject by bringing up Salman Khan's name. Unfazed, the paparazzi maintained their focus on her by pointing out that Salman wasn't there. Shraddha was accompanied by Raveena Tandon's daughter Rasha Thadani.

The film also featured Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Banerjee and Aparshakti Khurana in key roles. Directed by Amar Kaushik, Stree 2 is the sequel to the 2018 horror comedy Stree. After the immense success of the first two parts, the makers are now all set to work on the third instalment of the franchise. At a recent media event, Shraddha confirmed that Stree 3 is in the works. The actress revealed that director Amar Kaushik already has a story ready for the next movie. She said, \"When Amar sir told me he had a story for Stree 3, I got very excited because I know it's going to be something amazing. I can't wait to hear what it's about.\u201d Talking about the success of the first two movies, Shraddha Kapoor said, \"The kind of love and accolades the first part received were immense. It all started there. Hats off to the director, writer and producer for cracking a sequel. It's important not to make a sequel just for the sake of it - you need substance to bring people to theatres and earn genuine appreciation. They stayed true to how a sequel should be made and cracked the story of Stree 2. It had all the entertainment factors, brilliant actors and really entertaining dialogues. I believe it was a fabulous team effort. It was pure cinematic joy.\"Apart from the Stree franchise, Shraddha Kapoor is also expected to be featured in a dance number in Pushpa 2: The Rule.

        "title": "PT Usha Breaks Silence On CWG Dropping Badminton, Hockey For 2026",
        "text": "Indian Olympic Association president PT Usha feels the axing of medal-yielding sports such as wrestling, hockey and badminton from the 2026 Glasgow Commonwealth Games programme is \"disappointing\" for the country but the approach to reduce cost would ensure that the event continues to find hosts in future. The 23rd edition of the Games is scheduled to take place from July 23 to August 2, marking the Scottish capital's return as host after 12 years. Most of the National Sports Federations have been critical of Glasgow's decision to exclude hockey, badminton, wrestling, cricket, shooting, TT, and squash from the roster and have even questioned the relevance of the Games after this move.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");But Usha said the reasons can't be completely ignored.\"The reduction in the sports programme for the 2026 Commonwealth Games is disappointing, but I am sure that you will understand that 2026 games serve as a bridge to the future of the CWG,\" Usha read out a written statement to PTI Videos on Wednesday.Glasgow stepped in to save the Games after original host Victoria (Australia) backed out citing ballooning cost. It has less than two years to complete preparations and the organisers said they have tried to ensure that financial and operational risks are reduced by their conservative approach.While India would lose out on a lot of medals, Usha backed the idea of reduced cost and lower environmental impact due to a pruned schedule of 10 events to be conducted at four venues within an eight-mile radius.\"The approach aims to reduce costs, lower environmental impact, and increase social benefits, such progressive and sustainable model is very exciting as it will enable more countries to host the Games in future,\" she explained.\"Given the limited time-frame and financial constraints, focus of CGF has been to deliver a high-quality Games in a financially responsible way, with emphasis on minimising risks and prioritising athletes and sports,\" said one of India's greatest athlete.Usha said CWG grew from being a 10-sport event up until 1998 and can go back to expanding itself in future once a stable model of hosting the event is figured going forward.\"Historically, CWG featured around 10 sports and since 1998, programme has expanded to include 15 to 20 sports, and flexibility in future will be crucial for hosts,\" she added.\"I have had discussion with CGF president and he has assured me that exclusion of certain sports from the 2026 programme doesn't set a precedent for future games, and all CWG sports remain important to CGF, with opportunity to return in future editions,\" she said.The sports programme will include Athletics and Para Athletics (Track & Field), Swimming and Para Swimming, Artistic Gymnastics, Track Cycling and Para Track Cycling, Netball, Weightlifting and Para Powerlifting, Boxing, Judo, Bowls and Para Bowls, and 3x3 Basketball and 3x3 Wheelchair Basketball.",

        "text": "Royal author and former editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair Tina Brown has shredded Meghan Markle to pieces in a no-holds-barred attack in which she analyzed Prince Harry and Meghan's character and their exit from the Royal family and what followed after that. According to Brown, Harry is good at being Prince Harry and is the most talented member of the royal family but he became the sacrificial lamb in Meghan Markle's scheme of things and Meghan is always wrong.Brown said Meghan is a perfectionist but about getting it all wrong. She had the worst judgement in the world and she's flawless at getting it wrong. The attack comes at a time when Meghan and Harry are manoeuvering a lot of things -- their divorce speculations, their new house in Portugal, their individual career path etc. Just before that, a report in the US media called Meghan a dictator in high heels -- citing Meghan's former staff. While all this combined delivered a blow to Meghan's PR, Tina Brown said Meghan has a lot of people, she asks them their opinion and then doesn't follow it. \"She does what she wants to do. And all of her ideas are total crap, unfortunately.\"The royal author, who was Princess Diana's biographer and the author of the Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor -- The Truth and the Turmoil, decribed Prince Harry as the naive persone who does not know the ways of the world -- a person who has probably not ever booked a table in a restaurant. \"The army was great for him, and he was extremely good and competent in there. That really helped turn him into a real person.\"Since his marriage to Meghan, Harry has been the lamb to the slaughter. When Harry met Meghan, he was terribly impressed by her, the savvy Hollywood wheeler-dealer. \"He was terribly impressed by Meghan. He thought that she knew all, she persuaded him that she was the savvy Hollywood wheeler-dealer who could come in and make them stars and all the rest of it. And he just sort of blindly followed her like a child, really.\"But Harry has a road to come back as he would always be Prince Harry, Brown said. Being Harsh to Meghan, she said she's kind of run out of road. Both of them are, however, addicted to drama, Brown said .",

        "title": "Return Of Luxe Craftsmanship",
        "text": "In recent years, the fashion industry has seen a notable resurgence of craftsmanship in the luxury sector. This return to artisanal traditions highlights a growing appreciation for the artistry, dedication, and heritage embedded in fashion\u2019s finest creations. Fast fashion, while accessible and affordable, often comes with significant ethical and environmental costs. Consumers are becoming conscious of these downsides. They are seeking clothes with aesthetic appeal, ethical integrity and longevity. Enter the renewed focus on craftsmanship in the fashion industry. Meaningful Fashion\u201cTimeless artistry is precious. It is indeed a fragile and intricate process \u2014 the weaving of Banarasi fabric, which demands patience and dedication. With our artisans, we focus on authenticity and the skill that goes into creating the craft. There's a push for a significant level of speed, yet the collections show how we devote time and thought to each piece,\u201d says Khushi Shah, owner of Shanti Banaras.For luxury fashion houses, the return to craftsmanship is more than a reactionary move. It is a reclamation of the heritage. Craftsman-ship, after all, is what has long set luxury fashion apart from the fast fashion world. These brands have always been synonymous with meticulous attention to detail, quality fabrics, and timeless designs. Consumers are seeking more from their wardrobes \u2014 durability, and authenticity. Luxury houses are refocusing on ancient craftsmanship and their roots.Archana Jaju, owner, Archana Jaju says that they use old techniques like hand embroidery, Kalam-kari, and Zardozi in creating their designs. \u201cAll these methods not only become a means of storytelling in each product but also symbolize the rich cultural heritage of India. Details and patterns and how they come together are not merely aesthetic choices but reflections of olden traditions, and so each garment is a bridge between the past and the present,\" says Archana.Handcrafted vs Mass ProductionOne of the driving forces behind this shift is the desire for uniqueness. In a market saturated with identical, machine-made garments, handcrafted pieces represent something special. Every stitch, fold, and detail tells a story of human hands and techniques passed down through generations, and of the cultural traditions that inspire fashion's finest creations. \u201cBanarasi handloom weaving is the core of our designs. Through generations of weavers from Varanasi, each piece that we make is a testament to this rich legacy. Storytelling within our collections comes through in the intricacies of motifs and patterns, each of which holds cultural significance and makes our contemporary pieces part of a tradition spanning centuries,\u201d says Khushi.This return to artisanal craftsmanship can be seen in the revival of techniques such as hand embroidery, tailoring, and textile creation. Intricate beading, once reserved for haute couture, is making its way back into collections, offering consumers the chance to wear something genuinely unique. Brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci, among others, are increasingly leaning on their ateliers and skilled artisans to create one-of-a-kind pieces that stand in stark contrast to the ubiquity of fast fashion.Sustainability & CraftsmanshipAnother key factor driving this renewed focus on craftsmanship is the growing emphasis on sustainability in fashion. Fast fashion industry\u2019s negative environmental impact has been under scrutiny. In contrast, the artisanal approach encourages slower, more mindful production, often using higher quality, sustainably sourced materials that result in garments with longer life spans.\u201cThis craft allows the wearer to wear creations that might be passed down for generations. Handwoven fabrics and natural fibres breathe life into clothes meant to last decades. These pieces aren\u2019t just a fashion item; they\u2019re a part of family heirlooms sewn together with the quality-of-care mass-produced goods cannot. All of this leads to slow fashion, waste reduction, and intimacy with what one wears,\u201d adds Khushi. By embracing craftsmanship, fashion houses are creating garments meant to be treasured and worn for years, not just for a single season. This shift represents a broader trend towards slow fashion \u2014 a movement that prioritizes quality, sustainability, and the ethical treatment of workers.Behind the ScenesAt the heart of this shift are the artisans whose skills are now being championed and celebrated. Historically, these craftsmen and craftswomen have often remained in the shadows, with little recognition for their contributions to the industry. As the demand for handcrafted pieces grows, so too does the visibility of the artisans behind them.\u201cCraftsmanship will always be at the heart of luxury fashion. Though technology may bring efficiency, the soul in luxury is human touch and attention to detail. The customers will be targeting handcrafted pieces that they will see as authentic and connected; thus, there will be a stay...",

        "title": "Bollywood actresses expand brand with big-ticket Telugu films",
        "text": "After a break, it looks like Bollywood actresses are having a good time in Tollywood by being part of some big-ticket movies to expand their brand equity. Top league actress Deepika Padukone showcased her acting prowess in \u2018Kalki 2898 AD,\u2019 and held on her own, despite the presence of legends like Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan. She is going to hog more limelight in 'Kalki sequel' as well since the sci-fi thriller revolves around her and a divine child. Her colleague Kiara Advani is romancing Ram Charan in \u2018Game Changer,\u2019 while Mrunal Thakur proved her acting mettle in films like \u2018Sita Ramam\u2019 and \u2018Hi Nanna\u2019. However,Janhvi Kapoor turned out to be find of the season and created a lot of buzz with her maiden Telugu film \u2018Devara\u2019 opposite Jr NTR and also signed up another film with Ram Charan in a big film being directed by Buchi Babu Sana. \u201cWe felt that Janhvi Kapoor would be apt for this female lead role in our film with a big star Ram Charan. Even director Buchi Babu felt the same since he has etched a significant role. In fact, Ram Charan and Janvhi pairing would be a refreshing jodi on big screen,\u2019 says ace producer Ravi Shankar Yellamanchilli.Similarly, Raveena Tandon is in talks to do a pivotal role in Telugu film 'Jatadhara', while Norah Fatehi has done a key role in her Telugu film \u2018Matka\u2019 with Varun Tej and would be showcasing a new avatar. \u201cIt is true that some Bollywood actresses are headlining Telugu films these days, and they come as a breath of fresh air,\u201d says producer Vishnu Vardhan Induri, who brought in Kangana Ranaut for \u2018Thalaavi\u2019 and Vidya Balan for \u2018NTR Kathanayakudu\u201d.\u201cIt all depends on the massive scale and reach of their pet projects. If they are looking for a pan-India appeal, a top-rung Hindi actress would be a big value addition. For instance, if I am watching a Malayalam film, I would watch it with more interest, if I find a familiar Telugu actor in it. Hence, to make North viewers own our movies, Telugu filmmakers are signing up Hindi actresses. Their popularity is bound to give a fillip to our big-ticket movies,\u201d he adds. However, young director Hanu Raghuvapudi introduced B-town diva Mrunal Thakur in his Telugu blockbuster \u2018Sita Ramam\u2019 since he was looking for a girl who fits into the role of a princess. \u201cI was looking for a gorgeous looking girl who is also a good performer, so I found Mrunal Thakur ideal for the role. She matched strides with ace performer Dulquer Salmaan and proved my choice right with a sterling performance. I am quite happy that she is doing more Telugu films now,\u201d says director Hanu Raghavapudi who introduced non-Telugu girls like Lavanya Tripathi and Mehreen Pirzada in his movies like \u2018Andala Rakshasi\u2019 and \u2018Krishnagadi Veera Prema Gaadha\u2019 respectively. On strict demands put up by few Bollywood divas like traveling with their 7 to 8 member team like chef, trainer along with stylist and designer, producer A M Ratham, explains, \u201c'We have to be transparent while making agreements with them. If both actor-producers follow the terms, there will be no issues. More Bollywood actresses will come to town in the days to come, since Telugu films have turned multilingual.\"",

        "text": "Actor Jennifer Garner had a warning for a crowd of \"Moms for Harris\" gathered at a tearoom in Tucson, Arizona: Be prepared to see more Hollywood stars visiting your state to talk about the November 5 election.\"Jessica Alba, Kerry Washington - my colleagues and friends - will be here tomorrow. We're all just going to barnstorm you and drive you nuts,\" Garner said with a smile.\"I'm sure everything is a nightmare. You don't even want to turn on the TV,\" Garner said to laughter. \"That being said, it really is that important.\"The \"Alias\" star was acknowledging the text messages, TV ads, canvassing and other efforts in one of the seven battleground states that will decide whether Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump becomes the next US president.Celebrity endorsers such as Garner are part of the down-to-the-wire blitz to mobilize voters ahead of Election Day on November 5. A week after her Arizona stop, Garner stumped for Vice President Harris in Pennsylvania and had plans to visit Nevada.When stars want to campaign, political strategists urge them to visit places where they have a personal connection and to talk about issues they have worked on. They also are pairing them with political heavyweights.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In Garner's case, she joined former policy adviser and Ambassador Susan Rice, and the actor talked about how her parents met in Arizona. A board member for Save the Children, Garner touted Harris' support for child tax credits and higher pay for child-care workers.Julia Roberts, meanwhile, visited her home state of Georgia and was introduced by former state Representative Stacey Abrams.Actor Jane Fonda, an advocate for action on climate change, knocked on doors in Michigan to tout Harris and other \"climate champions.\" The Oscar winner and longtime political activist said she had never campaigned door-to-door for a president before.\"I'm doing everything I can,\" Fonda told one potential voter. \"We have to get them elected.\"While Hollywood has a reputation for being liberal, some stars are working to turn out the vote for former President Trump. Dennis Quaid, who starred in a recent movie as Republican icon Ronald Reagan, spoke at a Trump rally in California.\"I'm here to tell you that it's time to pick a side,\" Quaid said to applause.Other Trump supporters from the entertainment world include musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, and wrestler Hulk Hogan, who spoke at this summer's Republican National Convention.HELPING OR HURTING?Will Garner, Quaid or any other movie star make a difference?Celebrity appearances do amplify messages about voting, said Christian Grose, a political science professor and academic director at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute.If a non-famous person knocks on a door, it affects only that voter. When a celebrity does, it generates media coverage and social media posts that reach beyond that home, Grose said.Whether that translates into higher turnout depends on the celebrity and the circumstances.Megastars such as Oprah Winfrey can make a meaningful impact. Winfrey's 2007 endorsement of Barack Obama was credited with driving 1 million votes during the Democratic primary.And pop megastar Taylor Swift stimulated thousands of new voter registrations with a nonpartisan call for people to register in 2023, according to the nonprofit group Vote.org.This September, Swift went a step further and endorsed Harris via an Instagram post, which has now received more than 11 million likes.While the Harris campaign welcomed Swift's support, it may not turn out to be a blessing, according to Mark Harvey, author of \"Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy,\" published in 2018.Harvey and other researchers surveyed 1,000 people in August, before Swift's endorsement. Half were shown a photo of Swift with a generic message urging people to vote and half were shown the same image urging votes for Democrats.In the study, the singer was most influential with undecided voters who were Swift fans. Swifties who saw the general message reported a high likelihood of heading to the polls. The intent to vote declined, however, among the Swift fans who saw the singer calling for ballots for Democrats.\"I think there are a lot people who don't want to mix their entertainment with their politics,\" said Harvey, an associate professor at the University of Saint Mary in Kansas.And outside of the elite sphere of the biggest celebrities, studies suggest celebrity endorsements have \"no effect to marginal effect\" on turnout, Grose said.Still, it is possible that the presidential race, and some races for the U.S. Congress could be decided by hundreds or thousands of votes.\"I wouldn't put it up there as the most critical part of the campaign,\" Grose said, \"but you certainly can mobilize people with enthusiasm and excitement and a little bit of Hollywood pizzazz showing up in places you wouldn't expect.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Australia batter Steve Smith said that Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne \"hated\" him at the top order and wanted him to return back to his original batting position - No. 4 - but he is happy to bat wherever the team wants him to. Australia head coach Andrew McDonald confirmed last week that he and captain Pat Cummins have decided to shift Smith back to No. 4 batting spot in Test cricket following a brief stint at the opening role.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Smith stated that he was asked by McDonald to tell his preferred batting position to which he replied 'four' but he never requested the management to put him back in the middle order.\"I got asked where I'd prefer to bat, and I said four. I didn't ask (to move) though. I also said I'm happy batting wherever. I'm not really too fussed. I got asked where my preference would be, and I said four. I saw a few things last week saying that I've requested to bat at four. That wasn't the case. I said I'm happy to bat wherever you'd like me to bat but, yeah, four would be my ideal position,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted Smith as saying.He added that his teammates Labuschagne and Khawaja in particular were not happy to see him bat in the top order and with all-rounder Cameron Green being ruled out of the India Test series, it became evident to shift him back to No. 4.\"Obviously there's a spot there now with Greeny (Cameron Green) out. And I think just conversations we had after New Zealand with particularly Marnus and Uzi, they hated me up top, to be honest. They wanted me behind them. They just like the...they call it security behind them, in a way. They were pretty strong on me not batting there. So that was a big part of it. And then obviously, I've got a decent record at four,\" he added.On his brief opening stint, Smith feels that he would have excelled if given more opportunities. \"It was good fun having a crack at something new, batting up top. I still feel like I could do a job there for sure. It was a pretty small sample size. But I've done pretty well at four for a number of years now. I feel like it's probably where I can have my best input for this team at the moment.\"After replacing retired David Warner as Khawaja's opening partner, Smith scored 171 runs at an average of 28.50 in four Tests. His numbers were not that bad as no opener averaged more than 32 after four Tests.\"Honestly, I'm not that fussed. I said it when I took that job, I'm not really fussed where I bat. The conversations I had with the other guys, they didn't like it at all. They wanted some security, I suppose, behind them, where I've done really well for a number of years, and I can understand that as well. So it is what it is and I'm not going to be opening this summer. That's it,\" Smith said.The 35-year-old feels Nic Maddison is one of the potential candidates, along with Cameron Bancroft and others, to fill the void created after Warner's departure. \"There's a few really good candidates, guys, that have done really well the last few years. (Cameron) Bancroft and the usual suspects that have been talked about. Maddo I think is also another really good candidate. He's had a good couple of years. If you're looking for someone similar to a Davey replacement, he gets after the ball and can score really quickly,\" Smith said.\"So he's someone who probably hasn't been spoken about a great deal from all you guys in the last little bit, but I think he's someone that could definitely play test cricket and have a similar impact to what Davey sort of had at the top, the way he plays. So plenty of options. We'll wait and see,\" he added.--IANSab/bc(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The idea that a society\u2019s well-being is influenced by its economic institutions dates back to Adam Smith. This year, the Economics Nobel was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (AJR) for their research demonstrating the link between economic and societal institutions and the level of prosperity. By institutions, the laureates refer to the broad set of rules and norms that govern the economic behaviour of businesses and society or a nation.\n\nAn example of the impact of institutional differences can be seen in the high income disparity between Nogales, Arizona, US, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, despite sharing the same geography, climate, and culture across the US-Mexico border. A similar contrast exists between South Korea and North Korea. These obvious intra-community inequality is explained by AJR in terms of differences in their political and economic institutional framework.\n\nAn example of a successful social institution is the Marwari community. Despite operating within the same geographical area with common economic and political institutions as other Indian communities, the Marwaris have achieved remarkable economic prosperity.\n\nTrust-based credit\n\nA key factor for this lies in their informal institutional framework, which enabled them to leverage trade credit effectively. Trust is the cornerstone of trade credit. Intra-community extension of trade credit relied on extended family ties and relationship, acquaintances, and referrals by respected and distinguished business and community figures.\n\nThis trust-based credit network helped them in establishing and expanding their businesses when banking was absent or inaccessible. Such familial business relationships not only provide credit but extend advice and strategic partnerships. It minimises credit risks and maximise opportunities.\n\nHistorically, trust in B2B credit relationships was reinforced by a strong social and business stigma against default and bankruptcy. Within tightly-knit communities, the fear of reputational damages and social boycotts \u2014 such as avoiding marriage alliances with bankrupt families \u2014 created strong pressure to honour financial commitments. These factors acted as powerful deterrents to defaults.\n\nWith changing social values and weakened societal bonds, and events like demonetisation and the Covid-19 pandemic, the trade credit ecosystem has been disrupted, eroding the willingness to honour financial commitments. Intense competition and the loosening of close-knit social ties have diminished the effectiveness of fear of reputational damages leading to widespread delays and defaults. These undermine payment culture - once key to business prosperity.\n\nBusinesses thrive on reputation, which is deeply tied to credit discipline. To operationalise this, real-time tracking of payment defaults and delays, along with the digital dissemination of this information to stakeholders, can foster a trade credit ecosystem.\n\nThe writer is former DGM, SIDBI",

        "text": "Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE. The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year. Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain. By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.\"I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today,\" Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.\"There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level,\" the Portuguese boss added.On Monday, Hilal took the lead on 26 minutes, when former Newcastle United and Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic played in Lodi down the left, and the ex-Atletico Madrid full-back drilled a low shot past Khalid Essa in the Al Ain goal.However, Hernan Crespo's side drew level six minutes before half-time, Morocco international Soufiane Rahimi sliding home a cross. Rahimi was the star of Al Ain's Asian Champions League success last season, finishing top scorer and named player of the tournament.In first-half stoppage-time, Hilal seemed to take the contest away from their UAE rivals. First, Joao Cancelo, a summer signing from Manchester City, crossed for Milinkovic-Savic to head home unmarked from six years. Moments later, reigning Asian Player of the Year Al Dawsari raced cleared of the Al Ain defence, skipped around the onrushing Essa and curled home superbly on the angle.Al Ain reduced the deficit just after the hour, through substitute Mateo Sanabria, only for Al Dawsari to flick home his second of the night from a Milinkovic-Savic centre. Minutes later, Rahimi notched his double as a see-saw clash took another swing. Al Dawsari then restored Hilal's two-goal advantage with a sublime strike from range.Not long into 12 minutes of the allotted injury-time, and with Hilal reduced to 10 men after defender Ali Al Bulaihi was sent off for an intentional handball, Rahimi won and converted a penalty to secure his hat-trick and give Al Ain hope, but the Saudi champions hung on to claim the win.Neymar had little time to truly impact the game, although he did flash wide an effort in the dying moments of normal time. Hilal sit top of the Western region group, with three victories from three while Al Ain have picked up a solitary point.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Lidia Thorpe, an Independent Australian senator, has accused King Charles of committing genocide of Indigenous people and shouted, \"You're not my king.\" The 51-year-old interrupted King Charles's parliamentary reception on Monday, saying, \"You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people.\" A video of Ms Thorpe's remarks before she was whisked away by security personnel went viral on social media.Who is Lidia Thorpe?Born in 1973 in Carlton, in the state of Victoria, Lidia Thorpe belongs to the Gunnai, Gunditjmara, and Djab Wurrung peoples and has been a prominent figure in politics and advocacy for Aboriginal causes.She has a Diploma in Community Development from Swinburne University of Technology and a graduate certificate in public sector management. Ms Thorpe is known for her strong opposition to monarchy and advocacy for Indigenous rights.Lidia Thorpe's political careerLidia Thorpe was first elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly from the Northcote seat in a 2017 by-election. She received over 45 percent primary votes. In December 2018, she lost her seat to Labour candidate Kat Theophanous.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");In 2020, Victorian Greens members preselected Lidia Thorpe for the federal Senate seat, which fell vacant after the resignation of Richard Di Natale. Her election to the Senate also made her the first Aboriginal woman to represent Victoria in the Senate. She is also the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian from the Greens.After her re-election in May 2022, the Greens party room elected Lidia Thorpe as the party's deputy leader in the Senate. She quit the Greens in February 2023 after the party threw its weight behind the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum, a reform Ms Thorpe and some of her supporters did not approve of, The Guardian reported.Why did Lidia Thorpe confront King Charles?After her outburst at King Charles, Lidia Thorpe was escorted out of the venue. While the parliamentary reception continued, she later told the BBC that her goal was to send \"a clear message\" to Charles, stressing that \"to be sovereign you have to be of the land. He is not of this land.\"What are Lidia Thorpe's views on the British monarchy?Lidia Thorpe has long been critical of the British monarchy, calling King Charles \"not the legitimate sovereign of these lands\" and accusing the institution of committing genocide against Indigenous Australians.\"How can he stand up there and say he's the King of our country - he's stolen so much wealth from our people and from our land and he needs to give that back. And he needs to entertain a conversation for a peace treaty in this country,\" she told the BBC.She advocates for a treaty between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to address historical wrongs. Ms Thorpe believes that moving towards a republic through a treaty process can help resolve \"unfinished business.\"She has been involved in Indigenous activism for many years, even before entering politics. She has campaigned for justice system reform, environmental issues, and Indigenous land rights. Lidia Thorpe's activism is deeply rooted in her upbringing. \"I had no choice in being influenced by black activists and the black struggle of my people...I was born into it and I don't know anything else,\" she said in 2022.Lidia Thorpe has a history of high-profile protests. In 2020, during her swearing-in ceremony as a senator, she raised a black power salute while wearing a traditional possum-skin cloak and holding an Aboriginal message stick. The stick bore 441 marks to symbolise Aboriginal deaths in custody following a royal commission in 1991. In 2022, after being re-elected, she referred to the late Queen Elizabeth II as \"the colonising Her Majesty\" during her oath, for which she was required to repeat the correct wording.",

Aisa laga ke yeh kya hua? (The wound was deep, but I couldn\u2019t believe it had happened.

The incident resulted in a gush of blood, leaving him shocked by the unexpected turn of events.113842639He further explained that after the incident, he chose not to involve anyone else to avoid causing trouble.

        "text": "Ananya Panday's film CTRL debuted on Netflix today (October 4). Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, the movie also stars Vihaan Samat in a key role. In a recent interview, Ananya revealed that she gets her \u201cnazar\u201d taken out every week to ward off negativity. \u201cI take out my nazar every week. The help at my house does the mirchi thing. You know the Mirchi thing? So, if it smells a lot, it means you have nazar. If the mirchi burns a lot, you have nazar. I don't know the science behind it,\u201d Ananya said in a video shared on Netflix India's YouTube channel. The actress also mentioned that her mother, Bhavana Panday, often puts \u201ckaala teeka\u201d behind her ear to shield her from the evil eye. She said, \u201cMy mom put two black dots behind my ear before I came here. Everyone thinks I don't shower or have something dirty behind my ear, but my mom keeps putting it again and again.\u201d(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Last month, Netflix dropped the trailer for CTRL. The story follows Ananya Panday's character Nella and her seemingly perfect life. She stumbles onto Control Your Life, an AI-based program. Her life changes after logging into the app. Nella's relationship with her boyfriend Joe (Vihaan Samat) comes to an end after he cheats on her but everyone blames her. In resentment, Nella says to CTRL, \u201cI just want to erase my ex.\u201d While Nella wants to take away her suffering, the app has different ideas. Soon after, Joe's presence in the real world starts fading along with his social media blueprint. After a phone conversation, Nella learns that Joe has gone missing. \"But isn't that what you wanted?\" an AI-generated character asks Nella in the last few seconds of the trailer.Sharing her thoughts on playing Nella, Ananya Panday said in a statement, \u201cMy character Nella is like any of us. She's caught up in a world dominated by technology and social media. CTRL explores how we navigate the fine line between our online presence and who we are in real life. Working with Vikram sir and Nikhil sir has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait for you to watch it on Netflix and uncover the connection between Nella and Allen,\u201d reported News18. CTRL is produced by Nikhil Dwivedi and Arya Menon under Saffron and Andolan Films.",

        "text": "Ananya Panday has left movie buffs mesmerised with her performance in her latest release, \u2018CTRL\u2019, a gripping cyberthriller directed by Vikramaditya Motwane.In the film, Ananya plays Nella Awasthi, an influencer who, after a painful breakup, turns to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to erase her ex-boyfriend Joe from her life. While the story takes a thrilling turn with AI going out of control, Ananya shared how she handles breakups in real life.Speaking to ANI, Ananya revealed that, unlike her character Nella, she leans on her \u201creal friends\u201d when going through tough times, especially breakups.\u201cI lean on my real-life friends only. As Nella proved in the film, it\u2019s not the best thing to rely on AI and all these digital things. I prefer to stick to physical friendships,\u201d she shared.The \u2018CTRL\u2019 actress also spoke about handling social media trolling, saying she\u2019s become more \u201cthick-skinned\u201d over time. \u201cIt affects me as much as it would affect any other person, but I think it also depends on the day. Sometimes I\u2019m able to deal with stuff better, and some days it affects me a lot more. But in general, I\u2019m a lot more thick-skinned than I was, and I don\u2019t let unnecessary, irrelevant voices reach me,\u201d she said.The movie marks her second OTT release this year, following her debut in the series \u2018Call Me Bae\u2019 in September.

        "text": "The media is buzzing with tales of a whopping Rs 50 crore heist from a retired IAS officer\u2019s high residence in the tranquil hills of Uttarakhand. What\u2019s drawing attention is not just the theft, but also the great question\u2014how did such a hefty sum of money get there in the first place? The babu, once a powerful figure in a nearby state government and still considered very close to the Chief Minister there, has now become the focus of suspicion on social media, where rumours are spreading quickly. What makes this case even more intriguing is the fact that no formal FIR has been lodged, despite the scale of the theft. Some media outlets have meanwhile received notices, we\u2019re hearing. Neither the authorities nor anyone associated with the officer appears prepared to speak out, adding to the mystery. A Lucknow-based daily broke the story, alleging ties to a powerful ex-bureaucrat but not naming any names. As expected, the story has since gone viral, with social media users spreading the word and speculating about the officer\u2019s identity. Many people question why the authorities are so tight-lipped. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the officer\u2019s wife was emotionally affected by the occurrence, adding another layer of personal drama to an already sensational case. What\u2019s really going on here? Some argue that this is yet another example of how certain public officials stash illicit wealth in cash to avoid detection by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Cash is harder to trace, making it a convenient way to fly under the radar of anti-corruption bodies. If the stolen money is found, experts warn that any attempt by the officer to reclaim it could trigger a new legal firestorm under the Prevention of Corruption Act. For now, the silence around the case only seems to intensify public curiosity. The lack of an official statement, whispers about who the officer might be, and the staggering amount of money involved have everyone waiting for more details to surface. The case may even impact the prevailing tensions between the Centre and the state chief minister. Watch this space for updates. Delhi DMs get more powers, ruffle feathers The Delhi government\u2019s recent move to form \u2018working groups\u2019 of District Magistrates (DMs) to assess and improve the functioning of various departments has raised eyebrows, especially among senior babus. These groups are tasked with reviewing departmental operations and submitting actionable recommendations by October 5. They\u2019ve also been empowered to hold meetings with concerned officials\u2014which is the tricky part. Many in the administration are questioning the practicality of junior DMs overseeing and advising more experienced senior officials. Some see this as an unusual situation, with younger IAS officers from recent batches being asked to recommend improvements to departments headed by officials with decades of experience. This bold move comes at a time of transition for Delhi, with newly appointed Chief Minister Atishi stepping into the shoes of Arvind Kejriwal. Known for her focus on education reforms, Atishi now faces the challenge of managing the city\u2019s broader governance issues. This initiative is likely part of her broader strategy to improve inter-departmental synergy and bring fresh perspectives to long-standing administrative processes. A senior official explained that this initiative aligns with Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena\u2019s vision of making DMs more active and dynamic. Take that with a pinch of salt! The order coincides with a renewed push for cohesion between Atishi, AAP ministers, and senior babus, aiming for better coordination across key departments like transport, health, and education. Whether this approach will foster the intended inter-departmental synergy or cause further friction remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly a shake-up in Delhi\u2019s administrative corridors. Why merging DIPAM and DPE makes sense The government is once again considering the merger of two important departments: the Department of Investment & Public Asset Management (DIPAM) and the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). Both play crucial roles in managing Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and if all goes according to plan, they could soon be working together under the Ministry of Finance. The idea behind the merger is to create more synergy and liquidity for the NDA government\u2019s ambitious investment projects, particularly as it prepares for major reforms aimed at boosting growth and employment. This proposal isn\u2019t entirely new. It was first floated during the NaMo 2.0 era but didn\u2019t materialize for various reasons. The project was revived again in the list of \u201c100 days programme\u201d conceived by the Modi sarkar before the May 2024 Lok Sabha polls. So why merge these two departments? DIPAM deals with investment and disinvestment in CPSUs, while DPE focuses on the management and performance of these enterprises. When a CPSU is up for closure or divestment, DIPAM initiates the process, and DPE handles the final closure. A merger could streamline this process and make things more efficient. It seems the government is banking on this move to bring much-needed agility to its public sector investment strategy ahead of 2024. By Dilip Cherian",

Hathaway will also produce under her Somewhere Pictures banner. Naia Cucukov, Lim's producing partner at 100 Tigers, will executive produce the film alongside Melissa Stack. Princess Diaries 3 has been in development since 2022 and, last year, Hathaway shared an update about the long-awaited movie's progress in an interview with V Magazine. \"We're in a good place,\" Hathaway teased. \"There's nothing to announce yet. But we're in a good place,\" she had said. Flora Greeson is writing the script.

Alia\u2019s appearance at Alan\u2019s show comes during the times when international artistes are finding a steady footing in India. In January, the British rock band Coldplay is set to perform in Mumbai and has generated significant buzz around the same. Meanwhile, Alia will be next seen in Jigra which is directed by Vasan Bala of Monica, O My Darling fame. The film also stars Vedang Raina, who portrays the role of Alia\u2019s brother in the film. Alia essays the role of Satya, a devoted sister who will go to the edge of the world for her brother. She is determined to rescue her brother, Ankur, played by Vedang.

        "text": "Many people wonder whether street vendors earn more than many white-collar professionals. A vlogger has now highlighted the impressive monthly income of a vada pav seller, leaving the internet stunned. Sarthak Sachdeva shared a video on Instagram where he joined a local vendor and worked on his cart. The clip begins with the content creator saying, \u201cAaj mai dekhunga ek din mein vadapav bechke mai kitne paise kama sakta hu. Subah ki shuruyaat dekhke aur seekhke kiya, phir garam garam vada pav banake. Ek ke baad ek customer aane laage. [Today, I will see how much money I can earn by selling vada pav in a day. I started the morning by observing and learning, then made hot vada pavs. Soon, one customer after another began to arrive.]\u201d The content creator was even heard telling a customer, \"Aaj mera pehla din hai thele pe [Today is my first day on the food cart].\" Then, he said, \u201cEk vada pav 15 rupae ka tha. Ek ke baad ek customer thele pe aa rahe the aur pata chal raha tha ki subhe subhe vada pav ki kitni demand hoti hai. Aur 2.5 ghante mein kareeb 200 vadapav bik chuke the. [One vada pav costs Rs 15.

        "title": "Heritage Circles or Hoardings ?",
        "text": "This year\u2019s Dasara illumination is mediocre but the Circles are worse. Mysuru has turned into \u2018flexuru\u2019, thanks to the Government\u2019s decision to hand over key Circles to private players. What used to be iconic landmarks are now little more than giant hoardings. Interestingly, according to sources, most of these companies were not interested to take over the Circles as they did not have enough time to create aesthetic designs but agreed to sponsor so as to not \u2018upset\u2019 the administration. But here\u2019s the burning question: If the Government is intent on selling off our public spaces to the highest bidder, then why did they bother increasing the Dasara budget? And they did this while creatively sidestepping public tenders by invoking the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act. For those not in the know, the KTPP Act allows the Government to bypass open bidding when it claims it \u2018ran out of time.\u2019 How convenient. So, we\u2019re left wondering \u2014 was the whole Dasara preparation process conveniently delayed just to activate this loophole and handpick the \u2018right\u2019 contractors? Here\u2019s where it gets truly puzzling: The Dasara budget ballooned from Rs. 29 crore last year to Rs. 40 crore this year. That\u2019s a whopping Rs. 11 crore more, and yet, somehow, they still felt the need to hand over our beautiful Circles to private companies. Now, instead of historic monuments, we\u2019re greeted by enormous sponsor logos and political banners. The District Administration appears to have forgotten that Mysuru is not just any city; it is a heritage city, where even a traffic Circle has historical significance, whether in its name, its design, or its location, which is meant to reflect the unique character of the city. But now, under a barrage of gaudy lights, sponsor logos and political banners, these once-distinguished Circles are telling a different story \u2014 a story of administrative neglect, lack of imagination, and unbridled greed. It is truly disheartening that the first impression tourists arriving from Bengaluru by road receive is no longer one of beauty or history, but of consumer products and political personalities. This unregulated give-away of public spaces without the establishment of any proper guidelines has led to what can only be described as a visual assault. Seeking sponsorship to improve public spaces isn\u2019t inherently a bad idea. Done right, it can be a win-win situation \u2014 enhancing the city\u2019s beauty while also attracting investment. But the way it\u2019s been executed here is anything but right. To begin with, the administration did not give sponsors enough time to plan and design their campaign. Next, if public spaces like Circles or medians are to be leased to sponsors, there must be clear and enforceable ground rules, which we don\u2019t have. Other countries have stringent design approval committees for such purposes, often comprising experts from renowned advertising agencies or design institutions. Why can\u2019t Mysuru do the same? We could have a \u2018Dasara Public Space Design\u2019 Approval Committee which MUST comprise people from reputed design firms and schools such as the National Institute of Design or Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. Such a Committee would ensure that sponsors adhere to basic aesthetic principles, like limiting the sponsor\u2019s logo to no more than 20 percent of the space and ensuring that the advertisement blends harmoniously with the theme of Dasara and surrounding architecture. Additionally, it could enforce rules that protect the physical structure of these heritage sites, ensuring that nothing is permanently damaged. What we have now, however, is a chaotic free-for-all, where anyone with a banner can turn our historical Circles into personal billboards. For years now, the city\u2019s once-pristine Circles have been turned into medieval town squares, plastered with garish posters announcing everything from elections to festivals to, morbidly, even deaths. But MCC does nothing to stop this vandalism. Way back in 2006, the MCC proposed to declare K.R. Circle, Five-Lights Circle, Ramaswamy Circle etc., as \u2018hoarding-free\u2019 zones and ban commercial hoardings within 100 metres of heritage sites. What happened? Nothing. In 2009, MCC started an \u2018illegal hoarding drive\u2019, what happened? Nothing. In 2011, MCC Commissioner K.S. Raikar made a grand announcement: \u201cWe held discussions with the City Police Commissioner and cases will be filed against those violating the MCC directive on flex boards.\u201d What happened? Nothing. Earlier this year, in 2024 the MCC Commissioner said that they have issued notices and asked the Zonal Commissioners to clear out the flex\u2026 what happened? Nothing. Today, flex posters not only remain all around heritage Circles and buildings, but they have also now become part of the structure and with that part of Dasara too! What a sad reflection of incompetence, of a District Administration, of a Royal Heritage City, one that hosts a world-famous festival! Unless the MCC really flexes its muscles against flex, our city will become \u2018Flex City\u2019 and unless they make rules for sponsors of Circles during Dasara, then Historic Circles will end up as \u2018Billboards.\u2019 At this rate of callousness, myopic vision and greed, Mysore Palace may be the next big Dasara hoarding with sponsors\u2019 logo adorning the Palace domes. We are doomed. e-mail: [email protected]",

Without further adieu, here are all the amazing cars decking up his garage.Toyota Land Cruiser\u2014 jessicaray0 (@jessicaray0) An impressive inclusion in the collection, the mighty Toyota Land Cruiser is a popular choice in both national and international markets.

It delivers a top speed of 190 kmph. The Land Cruiser is the most expensive car in this list. Toyota Fortuner\u2014 cars_pixels (@cars_pixels) Another beauty from Toyota that can be found in The Great Khali\u2019s garage, is the Fortuner.

PEOPLE reported that things are rocky between Cheryl Hines and Kennedy Jr and they have barely spoken. 'She's embarrassed because he got caught,\" a source told PEOPLE. Hines has been in Europe since shortly after the news broke.Olivia Nuzzi was placed on leave after she acknowledged that her relationship with Kennedy Jr (she didn't name him) turned personal. Kennedy camp vehemently rejected it and asserted that he only met Nuzzi once during the interview last year. But the two camps did not let things be. Kennedy camp claimed Olivia Nuzzi bombarded him with her nudes while Nuzzi camp claimed Kennedy Jr grabbed her arm during the interview in a very creepy way. Nuzzi accused her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza of playing a role in leaking the allegations and Lizza denied those. In a court filing, Nuzzi said Lizza explicitly threatened to make public personal information about her to destroy her life, career and reputation. Amid this controversy, three more women claimed that they have been romantically involved with Kennedy Jr over the past year. According to reports, these three women came in contact with Kennedy Jr through Children's Health Defense -- the advocacy group founded by Kennedy. \u201cThere are a number of women in the \u2018health freedom\u2019 movement who thought of themselves as Bobby\u2019s only one, and I\u2019m quite sure they are angry and shocked to find out they weren\u2019t,\u201d a source told Mediaite. \u201cAfter talking to some of these women, I think what he does is just love bombs them.

Since he was struggling to make ends meet, and inspired by tales of people from his district going abroad, he began dreaming of a better life in a foreign country. He was directed to an agent at Palavakkam in Chennai. In the very first meeting, the agent claimed that he had successfully sent many abroad for jobs, and Sunil was quickly convinced. He paid \u20b940,000 to him in processing fees for a job in Israel. However, thereafter, there was no progress at all for months. Sunil met the agent frequently to push his case. Every time, the agent collected more money, and altogether Sunil ended up paying \u20b97 lakh, which he mopped up by mortgaging his house, pledging his wife\u2019s jewellery, and borrowing from relatives. The agent claimed he had tied up with a tour operator in Israel for sending 46 men and women en masse as tourists. Tickets for onward and return journeys and hotel rooms were booked in their names. The plan was that they would travel like tourists and on reaching a famous church in Jerusalem, would disappear amid the crowd. Later, they would stay in the houses of relatives or friends who had already settled down as migrant workers and seek jobs. A plan fraught with danger and rejection, but Sunil went ahead because he was desperate to \u201cgo abroad\u201d. However, the visa was rejected. Neither could he leave Chennai nor was his money repaid. The agent advised him to stay back and wait for another opportunity, promising this time a job in Canada. He demanded a further \u20b98 lakh, and Sunil coughed it up too, borrowing from every one he knew. Forged ID cards On May 1, the agent sent Sunil forged ID cards and documents identifying him as a senior scientist in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) attending a conference of scientists in Canada. This time the visa came through, but as Sunil tried to board a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the authorities came to know that there was no such conference happening and stopped him. \u201cMy dreams are gone. I had to come back and begged the agent to return the money. Instead of returning the money, he threatened me. I am staying at a cheap lodge for five months now, and I\u2019ve been starving. If I go back home, all the people who lent me money will be at my door. So I am hiding in Chennai. My aged father is down with a terminal illness and my wife is unable to bear this life any more.\u201d Later, investigation revealed that his agent was running an office as a registered bus travel operator. His modus operandi was the same: sending people abroad with forged documents and ID cards as scientists from prestigious research institutions. But Sunil is far from alone in his predicament. The police say there has been a huge increase in the number of overseas job-seekers being cheated by unscrupulous recruitment agents. Once Gulf countries were the most sought-after, but the pattern of migration by unskilled and semi-skilled aspirants indicates that eastern European nations, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, Lithuania and Armenia, are popular. South Korea, Israel, and Canada have also come into the picture. Recently, it came to light that job-seekers from several districts, especially from South India, were recruited through illegal manpower agencies and sent to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar on tourist visas. Victims are then held captive in Cambodia or Laos for work in harsh and restrictive conditions. They are forced to commit online cyber frauds, which is known as \u201ccyber slavery\u201d. These agents do not have a licence from the Ministry of External Affairs, which is mandatory to be involved in any recruitment for work abroad. Typically, they target job-seekers through advertisements posted on social media platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. In 2023, G. Mohan, an engineer from Erode, saw an advertisement on Facebook. Out of curiosity, he clicked the link and entered all details sought. Immediately, he received a call from an agent offering a job in Canada and even permanent residentship. They first collected \u20b950,000 for processing papers, and subsequently, he had to pay \u20b94.5 lakh. Later, they called him, informing there was some delay in getting a visa owing to the India-Canada diplomatic row. \u201cThey asked me to go to any European country and work for some time there. It would be easier to migrate to Canada then. They told me that they would arrange a visa from the Slovakian embassy. Days went by, but there was no progress towards travelling to any country or obtaining a visa. They said they would get a visa for another country and demanded more money. The money I paid has still not been returned,\u201d he recounted. The police later discovered that Akil, 25, of Ernakulam, and S. Veeraragavan, 29, of Tindivanam, also had similar experiences. Irrespective of whom they approached, the police found that some traits were similar. Tutoring the applicants These unregistered agents run their illegal operation from outlets such as browsing centres, tea shops, or petty shops, while some of them have swanky offices, creating the impression of a travel agency. They also tutored applicants on how to approach visa officers in embassies, besides supplying forged documents to them. They even tutored them on how to seek asylum in a foreign country, if they managed to get there. Many of those who were cheated did not file complaints because they were hoping to get their money back. Then how could the police zero in on this racket? Only if the forgery was detected at the processing stage. In September, last year, Mohammed Irfan Khan of Andhra Pradesh appeared with documents before the visa processing staff in the U.S. Consulate in Chennai and claimed that he was a medical professional and wanted a visa to attend a medical expo. All his documents were found to be fake. In November, Rusheekesh Reddy and Dhivakar Reddy of Andhra Pradesh were caught when they produced fake documents for visa processing for Kallem Sai Ram Reddy. Following this trail, the police found out that all fake certificates were generated at a centre at Villivakkam in Chennai, run by Mohammed Riyas and Mageshwaran since 2019. Thirumurthy, 30, of Thanjavur, was one of the victims rescued by Indian authorities recently. He recounted, \u201cWe paid \u20b94.5 lakh to the middleman who arranged this job for a salary of $2,000 a month. Eight of us were taken to Sihanoukville, Cambodia, by road from Bangkok. Our passports were collected by them. Only after landing at the workplace did we realise that it was a scam. We were detained in wire-fenced buildings. When we refused to do their bidding, they would beat us up and even give electric shocks.\u201d He adds, \u201cOur phone and WhatsApp conversations were scrutinised by them constantly. At last, we managed to send a mail to family members. With the help of a native lawyer, we sought the assistance of the Indian High Commission, and were rescued.\u201d R. Viswanathan, vice-president of the Tamil Association in Cambodia, said that based on a series of complaints from the affected persons, the Indian authorities, with the help of local officials, rescued the workers, and were trying to put an end to the illegal recruitment and confinement camps. Recently, the CB-CID registered nine cases and arrested 10 illegal recruitment agents. Similarly, the Greater Chennai Police, along with the Emigration Department, raided 10 locations, registered nine cases, and arrested five persons who operated without licence. The Emigration Department has also identified certain districts as hotspots where people try to go abroad through illegal means. These include Tiruchi, Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Sivaganga, Madurai, Tiruvannamalai, Perambalur, and Thiruvarur. \u2018File complaints\u2019 Greater Chennai Police Commissioner A. Arun has advised people to be wary of fake advertisements of foreign employment. Anyone who has been cheated by unauthorised companies should file a complaint, he has said. Surender, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Job Racket Wing, says no individual or agency can recruit Indian citizens for overseas employment without a valid licence. \u201cHowever, job aspirants get connected to the agents under the radar. We are working on 60 cases of job rackets.\u201d The Emigration Department advises those seeking jobs overseas to engage only with licensed agents. Licensed agents are required to maintain a bank guarantee with the government, and their operations are monitored and regulated by the offices of Protector of Emigrants (PoE). These agents undergo stringent inspections and document verification before they are licensed. A valid job offer comes along with an employment contract duly signed by the foreign employer, recruitment agent, and the worker. The contract must mention the terms and conditions of the job and the salary and other emoluments. Valid offers must allow the worker to emigrate on the strength of employment or work visa or other similar visas, not on a tourist visa. As per the Emigration Act, 1983, no recruiting agent shall collect from the prospective emigrant service charges of more than \u20b930,000 plus GST (18%) for services, excluding airfare and other charges. A receipt has to be issued. M. Rajkumar, Protector of Emigrants, Chennai, says, \u201cWe have 200-odd licensed agents registered with us. People can see the list of licensed agents on www.emigrate.gov.in and check whether their agents are licensed or not. We have also opened a column called job opportunities as of now for ECR (Emigration Clearance Required) countries. Wherever the licensed agents conduct the interviews, it will be posted here.\u201d He adds that aspirants would be safe when they go through licensed agents. \u201cWhen ECR passport-holders go to ECR countries, we verify everything for them and give them emigration clearance.\u201d Job-seekers can dial the PoE helpline 9042149222 for more information.",

        "text": "As Prince Harry is on a solo trip and rumors of Harry-Meghan divorce are rife, it has now come to be reported that Harry did not spend the night of his 40th birthday with Meghan though he was in the US at that time. While many reports call it the \"latest blow to their marriage\", their friends claim that it was actually a gift from Meghan and the couple are not separating -- they are professionally choosing different paths. Meghan was last seen before Harry's birthday. The Duchess of Sussex reportedly booked the trip for Harry so that he could spend the night of his 40th birthday doing a hike on the Montecito peak -- which is part of the Cold Spring Trail in California. It is near Harry-Meghan's mansion.Soon after Harry's birthday, he started his solo tour which has now been extended by a few days and Harry has scheduled some secret meetings. Reports claimed Harry and Meghan have been staying apart and Harry was found moping around by himself at a local cafe. It was when reports of his longing to be back to the Royal Family emerged. It was reported that Harry was feeling homesick as Meghan was busy with her Hollywood and entrepreneurial projects. Sources close to the couple who emphasize that they are not splitting claimed that the phase of Harry moping is over and now he has immersed himself in work according to his liking. Meghan was supposed to accompany him on his tour to New York but she was unwell. From New York, Harry flew to the UK and it was obvious that Meghan would not accompany him there. From UK, Harry went to Africa for a charity event but now Harry has extended his solo trip. Harry was initially scheduled to be back in California this weekend, UK Express reported. But he has chosen to prolong his solo trip. The Duke will likely head to Johannesburg and Cape Town for \"private time\" with family and friends. Another secret visit is also planned but it has been kept out of his official diary, the report said.",

        "title": "Hamas confirms Yahya Sinwar\u2019s death",
        "text": "Jerusalem: Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar , was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza, and the militant group reiterated its stance that hostages taken from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. \u201cThose prisoners will not return to you before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza,\u201d said Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar's Qatar-based deputy and headed up the grou's delegation during several rounds of cease-fire negotiations mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. In a statement, Hamas heralded Sinwar as a hero who \u201cascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.\u201d The statement appeared to refer to a video the Israeli military circulated of Sinwar\u2019s apparent last moments in which a man sits on a chair in severely damaged building, badly wounded and covered in dust. In the video, the man raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli drone. Sinwar\u2019s killing, in what appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, could shift the dynamics of the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas war began. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran , which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be him, half-buried in rubble and with a gaping wound in his head. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that \u201cour war is not yet ended.\u201d But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar\u2019s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar\u2019s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. \u201cWe are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,\u201d Ronen Neutra, father of the Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra, said in a video statement. \u201cSinwar, who was described as a major obstacle to a deal, is no longer alive.\" Netanyahu was planning to convene a special meeting Friday to discuss hostage negotiations, an Israeli official with knowledge of the negotiations said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the their former enemy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. \u201cWhen U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield \u2014 in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy \u2014 the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.\u201d More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza erupted in October last year, issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. Hezbollah's statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel\u2019s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it would activate an additional reserve brigade to the north of its country to support troops battling in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to \u201cplans prepared in advance\u201d to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced...",

        "title": "Sakshi Malik\u2019s memoir \u2018Witness\u2019: The wrestler sees an unsparing image of herself in her own mirror",
        "text": "\u201cIt is indisputable,\u201d reads a line in the autobiography of an Indian cricket icon co-written by a journalist, \u201cthat my parents were very supportive.\u201d\n\nThere is a reason (auto)biographies of Indian sportspersons are almost uniformly inane \u2013 a reason explained by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and memoirist JR Moehringer in a May 2023 piece in The New Yorker.\n\nMoehringer, whose own coming-of-age story The Tender Bar ranks as a classic of the memoirist\u2019s art, and who has co-written the bestselling autobiographies of tennis legend Andre Agassi, Nike founder Phil Knight, and England\u2019s estranged Prince Harry, recounts a conversation he had with the latter during a pre-writing session that did not end well.\n\nA story, carved from a life\n\nAfter a long discussion with Harry, Moehringer refused the offer to co-write the book. Why? \u201cBecause, I told him, everything you just said is about you. You want the world to know that you did a good job, that you were smart. But, strange as it may seem, a memoir isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s not even the story of your life. It\u2019s a story carved from your life, a particular series of events chosen because they have the greatest resonance for the widest range of people\u2026\u201d\n\nThe art of memoir, encapsulated in six words: A story, carved from a life.\n\nThat is the problem with autobiographies of Indian sportspersons \u2013 they tend, more often than not, to be a highlights reel of their careers as they lived it \u2013 or, often, as they want you to think they lived it. What you get is a one-dimensional portrait \u2013 scorecards and career graphs rendered in prose and wallpapered with a litany of clich\u00e9s; what you don\u2019t get is insight into the living, breathing human being behind those accomplishments; the stories carved from their lives.\n\nThere are exceptions. A Shot At History by Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, co-authored by Rohit Brijnath, is one; the more recent I Have The Streets by India\u2019s ace off-spinner R Ashwin, written with Sidharth Monga, is another. To that sparse canon add Witness, the autobiography of champion wrestler Sakshi Malik co-written with veteran sports journalist Jonathan Selvaraj.\n\nWhen the book hits the shelves, the large-type headlines and the buzz in the social media echo chamber will be about Malik\u2019s first up-close experience of sexual harassment and her ongoing battle to bring BJP politician and former Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to book for the serial sexual abuses he is accused of. And that will be a pity, because there is so much more to Malik\u2019s story as both a champion wrestler and an insurgent fighting injustice.\n\nThe battle against Brij Bhushan and his backers in politics \u2013 and, by extension, against the strong arm of the police force \u2013 bookends the story of Malik as an insecure girl from a small village in Haryana; her early, occasionally risible forays into various sports; her discovery of wrestling as the career she always wanted and never knew it till her wandering footsteps led her to the mat.\n\nThe book is hung on the tick-tock timeline of her life and times, both in the ring and out of it, and it is a story of stark contrasts. There is the self-assured sportsperson juxtaposed with the awkward, unsure woman in the throes of a first, and lasting, love. She is the ace wrestler, proud of the painfully acquired strength of thighs and biceps, but also the woman who hates how those same biceps look when she is forced to wear high fashion. She is the gawky village girl who leans heavily on parental support and encouragement in a rigidly patriarchal environment that frowns on women \u201cdisplaying\u201d themselves in skimpy sports costumes but equally, the mature woman battling the realisation that the love of even the most supportive of parents can be subsumed by the lure of the money their accomplished daughter brings in\u2026\n\nSakshi Malik, the person\n\nMalik\u2019s story is layered; it lends what we know of her life a larger frame and a deeper context. Through the pages of Witness, a Sakshi Malik emerges who is no longer just a champion wrestler, or a leader in an ongoing battle against a political strongman and accused sexual abuser \u2013 she is a human being in the true sense of the word, with all the fears and uncertainties, the faults and the foibles that being human entails.\n\nAnd it is all down to a clear-eyed awareness of her own self, abetted by honesty as unsparing of herself as it is of everyone in her orbit. Thus, if she is open about her parents\u2019 unconditional love turning into unbridled greed as the money begins to pour in, or about the politicking of farmer leader Naresh Tikait who insinuated himself into the wrestlers\u2019 protests for his own ends, or about her disenchantment with what she sees as the self-interest of her comrades-in-arms Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, she is equally forthright about her own early forays into petty theft and, more startlingly, about her deepest insecurities.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Moehringer said in an interview where he discussed the art of the memoir, \u201cin order to tell the truth, you simply cannot avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings. It goes down easier if you are equally unsparing of yourself.\u201d\n\nParts of Witness will hurt. Parents, siblings, former opponents, and present comrades will all find reflections of themselves that they would far rather have hidden from the world \u2013 but there is no part of the book that cuts as deep, and is as unsparing, as the image Malik sees in her own mirror.\n\nIn an early chapter, she talks of the paralysing dread that envelops her before every bout, and about how she has \u201cnever enjoyed the actual act of confrontation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany wrestlers have a little bit of nervousness before their bout starts, which helps them get focused for the contest,\u201d Malik writes. \u201cI have come across contestants who tell me they are excited before a bout. They enjoy that feeling of getting into a fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that. I\u2019ve always been afraid, sometimes almost sick with worry.\u201d\n\nWho knew? As one accustomed to reading, and listening to, sportspersons natter on about \u201cembracing the challenge\u201d, \u201csoaking up the pressure\u201d and suchlike inanities, it came as a refreshing change to read an elite sportsperson \u2013 a practitioner of one of the most physically confrontational of all sports \u2013 talk with such openness about the crippling grip of fear that she had to confront, even before she confronted her opponent on the mat, right through her career.\n\nIf being honest \u2013 with oneself first, and then with the reader \u2013 is hard for sportspersons, it is equally difficult for them to talk in an accessible fashion about the nuances of their sport. And there is a reason for this: in her formative years, the sportsperson practices the mechanics of her sport for countless hours until it becomes part of muscle memory. In the heat of competition, she instinctively does what all that practice has prepared her for. Asking her to relieve a bout, to explain the mechanics of a takedown, is akin to asking a pilot how she flies a plane, or a writer how she organises her material and engages her reader.\n\nHere, again, Malik scores \u2013 a favourite section, one that I went back to after a first read-through of the entire book, is chapter ten where Malik delves into the arcana of \u201cweight cutting\u201d, a phrase that entered the public consciousness thanks to the fiasco of Vinesh Phogat failing, by 100 grams \u2013 one third the weight of an adult human heart \u2013 to qualify for the final of the 50kg wrestling competition in the Paris Olympics.\n\nElsewhere, there are illuminating details about the mechanics of various forms of takedowns, insights into how a wrestler reads and counters an opponent\u2019s strategy \u2013 a wealth of detail, told in accessible form, that made me go back to YouTube videos of her various bouts, including the Rio Olympics bronze medal match in the 58-kg category that made her India\u2019s first woman Olympic medallist in wrestling, with a new awareness and appreciation of the sport.\n\nWe consume sport in boxes \u2013 the playing field, the wrestling ring, the boundaries of our television screens. And yet the real story, unseen by us, lies outside these boundaries, in what ace sportswriter Gary Smith calls \u201cthe psyche of the sporting spirit.\u201d\n\nWriting an energising memoir\n\nThe likes of Andre Agassi, Phil Knight and Prince Harry needed a Moehringer to go outside those boxes, to delve into and unearth the stories hidden behind those medals, the fame, the public persona. Malik finds the ideal amanuensis in Jonathan Selvaraj, a veteran sportswriter who has spent decades covering those sports, including wrestling, that play out in the nearly impenetrable shadow cast by cricket.\n\nOn the evidence of this book, Selvaraj has mastered sprezzatura, the ability to conceal art. Selvaraj brings to the book the art and the craft of a skilled storyteller \u2013 a mastery of narrative arc and of pacing, the ability to focus on what is important, the minute attention to the telling detail. Rather than chisel and sand and buff and polish the story to death, Selvaraj helps Malik embrace the volatility, the insecurities, integral to the human condition.\n\nWhere Selvaraj really excels though is in his ability to step back and let Malik\u2019s natural voice, with which we have become familiar through the many press conferences and interviews she has given in the course of her battle against Brij Bhushan, shine through. It is Selvaraj who writes, but it is Malik we hear.\n\nMalik\u2019s lived experiences and refreshing honesty combine seamlessly with Selvaraj\u2019s self-effacing pen to produce a sports biography that is energising, and compellingly readable.\n\nWitness, Sakshi Malik with Jonathan Selvaraj, Juggernaut.",

The two cases, though separate, have brought attention to growing criminal activities in the region, prompting swift action from local law enforcement.\n\nThe first case involves a 52-year-old mushroom trader from Tanda Rajpur, Palampur. He lodged a complaint against four individuals\u2014two women and two men\u2014accusing them of extortion and blackmail. According to the victim, the incident began when he received a call from a woman in Ram Chowk, Palampur, asking to purchase mushrooms. Upon arriving at her house, he found two women inside. They gave him water, locked the door, and then engaged in obscene acts. Shortly after, two men entered the room, assaulted him, and forcibly filmed an obscene video.\n\nThe victim claimed the group demanded \u20b91.5 lakh, threatening to release the video if he didn\u2019t pay. Terrified, he approached the Palampur police station, where a formal case was registered. Station in-charge Bhupendra Singh Thakur confirmed that an investigation is underway, with the accused currently being tracked by the police.\n\nMeanwhile, in Manali, local police exposed a gang involved in prostitution-related fraud after receiving a complaint from Pradeep Bagati, a resident of Jharkhand. Bagati reported that he was tricked by a woman at the Manali bus stand, who promised him a room at a cheap rate. When he followed her to Aleu, she demanded \u20b92000 for engaging in sexual activity. As soon as he undressed, she took photographs and summoned her accomplices. A second woman and two men then entered, robbing him of \u20b95000 in cash, taking his ATM card, and withdrawing \u20b910,000.\n\nThe gang threatened Bagati, demanding an additional \u20b950,000 to ensure his release. Bagati managed to escape and alerted the Manali police. Acting swiftly, the police arrested the suspects and recovered 12 mobile phones, ATM cards, and cash. The arrested individuals were identified as Vishal from Shimla, Deepak from Chandigarh, and two women from Kullu and Manimajra.\n\nManali police station in-charge Manish Sharma stated that this gang had been operating for over two years, targeting unsuspecting individuals. The gang\u2019s network is now under further investigation, with more arrests likely.\n\nThese two cases underline the growing concern over extortion and organized fraud in Himachal Pradesh, as police intensify efforts to combat such criminal activities.",

        "text": "Air pollution is back to haunt the national capital with the onset of winter and early morning and late-night fog. \nOn Saturday, Delhi\u2019s Anand Vihar reported PM 2.5 of 326 and PM 10 levels of 654, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to activate Stage 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan from October 15. GRAP includes measures to control dust, waste management, and ensure vehicular restrictions, with mist-spraying drones to monitor and tackle pollution hotspots.\nThe Delhi government on Monday also imposed a blanket ban on the sale and use of firecrackers till January 1, 2025, in view of the likely deterioration of air quality in the city during the winter.\nTo further understand the effects of the deteriorating air quality, LocalCircles conducted a survey which revealed that 36 per cent Delhi-NCR families have one or more members with sore throat, cough and breathing difficulty/asthma due to rising levels of pollution, while 27 per cent have someone with a runny nose/congestion.\nThe survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. A total of 61 per cent respondents were men while 39 per cent were women.\nThe survey also sought to know the steps Delhiites were taking or planning to take to combat the issue of air pollution. While only 18 per cent citizens of Delhi-NCR said they will use air purifiers to reduce the impact of pollution, a large majority said they would just live with it by increasing the intake of immunity foods and drinks. A total of 22 per cent respondents are planning to travel for some part of the next one month. It is also likely that many have planned travels for Diwali which also allows them to get away from peak pollution days in Delhi-NCR when AQI has touched 1000 in the past.\nYear after year for the last decade, AQI levels in the region have been touching 500-1000 between October 15 and December 1, causing devastating long-term impact on the health of residents and no concrete solutions have been implemented to address this at a structural, policy and enforcement level.\nEmissions from transportation account for approximately 19.2 per cent of Delhi\u2019s air pollution, according to the Centre\u2019s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management in Delhi.\nAnother major contributor to the worsening air quality is stubble burning in neighbouring states. Satellite data on Wednesday reported 99 fire incidents in Punjab, 14 in Haryana, 59 in Uttar Pradesh, and one in Delhi.\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered \u201cgood\u201d, 51 and 100 \u201csatisfactory\u201d, 101 and 200 \u201cmoderate\u201d, 201 and 300 \u201cpoor\u201d, 301 and 400 \u201cvery poor\u201d, and 401 and 500 \u201csevere\u201d.",

Eight were found alive on Wednesday after being reported missing after an avalanche on Sunday, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nAn avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, such as a hill or mountain. Avalanches can be triggered spontaneously, by factors such as increased precipitation or snowpack weakening, or by external means such as humans, other animals, and earthquakes.\n\nPrimarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches have the capability to capture and move ice, rocks, and trees.\n\nAvalanches occur in two general forms, or combinations of slab avalanches made of tightly packed snow, triggered by a collapse of an underlying weak snow layer, and loose snow avalanches made of looser snow.\n\nAfter being set off, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they capture more snow. If an avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air, forming a powder snow avalanche.\n\nThough they appear to share similarities, avalanches are distinct from slush flows, mudslides, rock slides, and serac collapses. They are also different from large-scale movements of ice.\n\nAvalanches can happen in any mountain range that has an enduring snowpack. They are most frequent in winter or spring but may occur at any time of the year. In mountainous areas, avalanches are among the most serious natural hazards to life and property, so great efforts are made in avalanche control.",

Four years down the line, their Montecito neighbors are not very happy about the royals settling at their place.

The residents are expressing frustration that the coastline is now becoming exclusive to wealthy property owners. UK Express reported that restricting access to public beaches was illegal in Portugal until recently but new regulations now allow local councils and government agencies to designate certain beaches as \"private\". \"Worst thing to happen to the Portuguese coast, typical greed situation. Taking land and property from locals who have been enjoying it for years,\" one wrote. \"I am very upset by this massive piece of Portuguese land destroyed for the rich, removed from the average local that had been creating memories in this place for generations and generations,\" another said. \"I have been going to this place for years, camped there several times and, because of this company, this is no longer possible,\" another said. Reports said Harry and Meghan chose Portugal to be close to Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank who own a home at the Costa Terra Gold and Ocean Club in Melides. Harry and Meghan will not be shifting out of the US and their Portuguese resort will be more like a holiday home for them. Reports said the resort is on a picturesque and unexplored beach in the Algarve and has become a popular holiday destination. Once completed, the resort is set to have 300 homes, with prices starting at a whopping \u00a33.6million.The news has put speculations over Harry-Meghan divorce to sleep following their individual engagements.

Earlier, comedy kings like Brahmanandam, M S Narayana, and Vennela Kishore managed to draw more applause than heroes in some of their movies. Now, it is the turn of young comedian Satya to make his presence felt in his latest release 'Mathu Vadalara 2'. \"No doubt, Satya stole the show with his comic one-liners and unique mannerisms and has become the flavor of the season,\" adds the source. He claims that Satya would be roped in by other producers since few distributors are insisting for his comedy and few ongoing films could have his comedy track to cash in on his popularity. \"He will be doing comedy in another big star movie and discussions are underway, \" he adds. He also claims that probably by now, few producers would have reached him to cast him as a \u2018hero\u2019 in the films since the laugh-riot has set cash registers ringing in two Telugu states. \u201cHe may soon turn a protagonist and is surely grabbing plum comic roles too,\u201d he concludes.",

The streets buzzed with excitement as women prepared for this special day dedicated to the well-being and long life of their husbands. Various organisations and local communities came together to organise programmes and gatherings for the cultural celebrations. Women dressed in vibrant, traditional attire were the centre of attraction of the festival. Their hands were adorned with intricate mehndi designs, symbolising love and devotion.\n\nFrom dawn, the women observed a day-long fast, refraining from food and water. This fast is a key ritual of Karva Chauth and is kept until the moon appears in the night sky. The day began with Sargi, a pre-dawn meal given by mothers-in-law to their daughters-in-law, symbolising the bond between them. As the day progressed, groups of women gathered in homes or community centres, sharing stories and songs related to the significance of the festival. They passed the Karva (a clay pot) around in a circle, singing traditional songs of marital bliss.\n\nKarwa Chauth Moon Rise Timings In MP: Moon Will Be First Seen In Bhopal Followed By Indore; Check...\n\nIn the evening, as twilight fell, the anticipation grew. Women sat in beautifully decorated spaces, their thalis prepared with diya, rice and sweets, waiting for the moon to rise. Once the moon appeared, they gathered on rooftops or terraces, gazing at it through a sieve, symbolising the filtering of negativity. They then offered water to the moon, seeking its blessings before breaking their fast by sipping water and eating a sweet from their husband's hands. Throughout the city, the sounds of laughter, music and blessings filled the air, as families gathered to celebrate the bond of love and the strength of relationships, making the night of Karva Chauth a truly magical and heart-warming experience.\n\nOne unique programme took place in the Pashupatinath Porwal Social Group. They celebrated the Karva Chauth festival at The Meera Garden, Rajiv Gandhi Square, Indore. Over 250 people participated in the event and passed a message to observe No Car Day once a week. The males of the group were seen holding placards and they also took a pledge to keep the environment safe.\n\nMaharashtra: NCP-Ajit Pawar Faction Appoints Ashish Damle As Chairman Of New Brahmin Economic Development Body\n\nMumbai: Doctor Dupes Colleague Of \u20b934.97 Lakh In Medical Camp Scam\n\nMumbai: Peon Arrested For Sexually Assaulting Minor At School Premises\n\nMaharashtra: ACB Files 26 Disproportionate Assets Cases Involving \u20b929 Crore\n\nFollow us on",

A recent video showing a snake effortlessly swallowing an egg significantly larger than its head has left viewers speechless. The video, captured in a single motion, opens to show an egg resting in a human hand. The serpent then proceeds to devour the oversized egg, as its jaws expand to accommodate its food. The staggering size difference between the egg and the snake's head has ignited widespread fascination, leaving many wondering how this remarkable act is physiologically possible.\n\n''Snake gulping an entire egg bigger than its head,'' the video was captioned on X page 'Nature is Amazing.'\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nSnake gulping an entire egg bigger than its head pic.twitter.com/YN2TwWLaVd\u2014 Nature is Amazing \u2618\ufe0f (@AMAZlNGNATURE) October 18, 2024\n\nThe jaw-dropping footage has sparked both fascination and concern. Since being shared the video has amassed more than 6 lakh views and close to 300 comments. \n\nOne user explained, ''A snake swallowing an entire egg larger than its head is a remarkable example of its unique anatomy and feeding capability. Snakes have flexible jaws, which are not rigidly attached like in many other animals. This flexibility allows them to stretch their jaws wide open to accommodate prey much larger than their head. In the case of an egg, the snake carefully manoeuvres it into its mouth and gradually swallows it whole. Once inside, special muscles in the snake's bodywork to break the egg's shell, after which the contents are digested, and the shell is later regurgitated. This incredible ability showcases the snake's evolutionary adaptations for survival.''\n\nAnother said, ''That's a remarkable sight! Snakes have the ability to stretch their jaws to consume prey much larger than their heads, thanks to their unique jaw structure. It's a fascinating example of nature's adaptability.''\n\nA third said, ''Incredible sight! Nature is fascinating.'' A fourth added, ''Omg this is really shocking.'' A fourth added, ''Creatures are so different that every single creature has its own uniqueness.''\n\n''That sounds wild! Snakes are fascinating when they eat something that seems too big for them. It's always surprising how they can stretch their jaws to swallow larger prey,'' yet another stated.",

Recalling the event, she said, \"We go to Sunita Kapoor's house, Anil Kapoor's wife. So all of us go there and break the fast together. We have to go to the terrace to see the moon. So all of us go together. So we got the channi (strainer) and placed the diyas there. I told Chunky to hold his position because we were waiting to eat.\" Bhavana then complained how Chunky Pandey's old habits landed her in an awkward situation. \"Chunky has this old habit. I prepared everything and the moment I turned around he was gone. I don't know whether he got a call or something else happened, and the channi landed straight on the face of Boney Kapoor! I instantly turned around and yelled, 'Chunky, where are you?' He came back and took his position. Then I did the ritual properly,\" she concluded. This made everyone burst into laughter, leading Kapil to a witty comeback. He joked that Boney Kapoor must have been wondering why Sridevi (his late wife) looked so different that day.

When asked about his favourite Bollywood movie, he said, \u201cI had the great pleasure of meeting Aishwarya Rai when I was a Prime Minister and I liked the film called Devdas. I am a big admirer of hers and that extraordinary Bollywood family. (sic)\u201d In Devdas, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan played the role of Paro. Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the movie, released in 2002, also featured Shah Rukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit in important roles.

He stated that the movie presented a \u201charrowing portrayal of the terrible events that happened there and a reminder of how the country has suffered from terrorism.\u201d He said, \"And, I think that one of the things that should bring us together is recognizing that despite ongoing wars in Ukraine, Middle East etc, we have got this challenge of defeating extremist Islamic terror, which affects your country as well as my country. And we should never forget about how many lives have been lost in that. The problems still exist.\"Coming back to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, the actress attended the IIFA Awards at Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, last month.

        "title": "Aquaphobia Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Aquaphobia is a type of specific phobia that is an irrational fear of something that does not pose much danger. A person with aquaphobia has extreme fear or anxiety when thinking about or seeing water. They may avoid places near water, such as swimming pools or lakes. In severe cases, sufferers may stop bathing or using water from the sink to clean themselves.\n\nAquaphobia is often mistaken for another phobia called hydrophobia. Although both are afraid of water, aquaphobia and hydrophobia are not the same. Because, hydrophobia is not actually caused by trauma to water, but is a symptom of rabies infection.\n\nSymptoms of Aquaphobia\n\nThe symptoms of aquaphobia vary greatly from person to person. For example, some people with this phobia may be afraid of deep water or strong tides. Others may experience intense anxiety just thinking about water. Regardless of the type or amount of water, people with aquaphobia experience anxiety in response to the water.\n\nSome of the symptoms of aquaphobia include:\n\nFeelings of fear, anxiety, or panic when thinking about water\nExcessive or irrational fear and aversion to water\nFear and anxiety in the presence of water that significantly affect a person\u2019s ability to socialize or function.\nContinuous avoidance of water.\n\nA person with aquaphobia tends to experience anxiety, fear, or panic when exposed to water. Physical effects of aquaphobia include:\n\nRapid heartbeat.\n\nShallow breathing.\nTightness or pain in the chest or throat.\nTrembling when exposed to water.\n\nDizziness and nausea. \nConfusion or disorientation.\n\nMeanwhile, children with specific phobias such as aquaphobia may express anxiety or fear by:\n\nCrying and having tantrums.\nRefusing to speak or move.\nPhysically attached to a parent or a particular object.\n\nPeople who have specific phobias often have at least one additional mental health condition, including:\n\nDifferent types of anxiety disorders.\nDepression.\nBipolar disorder.\nImpulse control disorder.\n\nCauses and Risk Factors of Aquaphobia\n\nThe causes of specific phobias such as aquaphobia are not well understood. However, there is some evidence that phobias can be genetic. If you have a family member with a mental health condition, such as anxiety or another phobia, you may be at risk of developing a phobia.\n\nHowever, aquaphobia is often caused by a traumatic event during childhood, such as a near drowning. It can also be the result of a series of negative experiences. This usually occurs in childhood and is not as severe as a traumatic experience.\n\nOn the other hand, experts also claim that changes in brain function also play a role in developing specific phobias.\n\nMeanwhile, another theory proposes that phobias are learned associations. For example, a person may develop a particular phobia after observing a phobic reaction in another person. Such as a parent, sibling, or friend. The person may internalize the other person\u2019s fearful reaction and adopt the same aversion to the object or situation.\n\nDiagnosis of Aquaphobia\n\nTo diagnose aquaphobia, doctors or psychologists use the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). However, currently, the DSM-5 does not have a specific diagnosis or category for aquaphobia. Instead, the use of this manual aims to identify the fear of water under the diagnosis of specific phobias or specific mental conditions.\n\nIf you suspect you have aquaphobia, see your doctor right away. Your doctor can refer you to a mental health specialist who can diagnose and treat the phobia.\n\nBased on the criteria from the DSM-5, a mental health specialist will most likely diagnose aquaphobia (or a specific phobia). This diagnosis can be given if you have experienced symptoms of aquaphobia for at least six months. Part of the diagnosis also includes ruling out other mental health conditions, such as:\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nPTSD or Post-traumatic stress disorder.\nPanic disorder.\n\nAquaphobia Treatment\n\nConsidering that aquaphobia is a specific phobia, there are two forms of psychotherapy that can be used as the main treatment, namely:\n\n1. Exposure therapy\n\nExposure therapy can help change a person\u2019s fear response. The procedure involves exposing the phobic to the object or situation that triggers the phobic response repeatedly and gradually.\n\nIn the procedure, a mental health professional will conduct exposure therapy in a safe and controlled environment. During each session, they will also record and analyze the individual\u2019s reactions, thoughts, feelings, and sensations.\n\n2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\n\nCBT is another important element in treating specific phobias. In the procedure, the health professional will address the thought and behavior patterns that occur during the phobic response. During CBT, the psychologist will help the person with specific phobia understand which thoughts and behavior patterns contribute to the phobia. They work with their patients to change these patterns in order to overcome the phobia.\n\nCBT can also involve learning relaxation techniques and coping mechanisms to manage anxiety, fear, and panic. This can help teach people how to respond appropriately during exposure therapy.\n\nIn addition, anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications may also be prescribed to help reduce the symptoms of aquaphobia. Doctors usually prescribe these medications in combination with CBT.\n\nComplications of Aquaphobia\n\nAll phobias can hinder the sufferer\u2019s productivity and daily activities. In severe Aquaphobia, this condition can affect the sufferer\u2019s quality of life. This is because the sufferer of this phobia may not want to take a shower or bathe. This can ultimately affect the sufferer\u2019s cleanliness and self-confidence. In addition, the risk of a number of diseases can also increase if the sufferer of this phobia does not maintain personal hygiene.\n\nSome people with aquaphobia may experience panic attacks. These attacks can cause:\n\nFeeling dizzy or lightheaded.\nFeeling the impending doom.\n\nNoncardiac chest pain.\nRacing heartbeat.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea).\n\nAquaphobia Prevention\n\nMost specific phobias cannot be prevented. However, it is important for people with phobias to seek intervention and treatment early after a traumatic experience. This can prevent people with specific phobias from developing more severe anxiety disorders due to their phobias.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nIf you experience several symptoms of aquaphobia for almost six months, immediately check your condition with a psychologist or psychiatrist.",

The group's recommendation was endorsed by CDC Director Mandy Cohen. The CDC's prior guidance for pneumococcal vaccines was for adults aged 65 and over and children under 5. The shots are also suggested for certain adults and children who are immunocompromised. Both companies had asked the CDC to lower age recommendations to include adults 50 and up. The wider recommendations could bode well for Pfizer, which has been struggling to find new sources of revenue amid a decline in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and treatment. The company's pneumococcal shot, called Prevnar, is one of its best-selling products with about $6 billion in annual sales.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Merck's recently approved vaccine, however, gives Pfizer some major competition.

        "title": "Anosmia Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Anosmia?\n\nAnosmia is the inability or decreased ability to smell. It can be permanent or temporary depending on the cause.\n\nIn fact, some people have this condition from birth, while others lose the ability to smell due to some condition.\n\nExperts estimate that anosmia and hyposmia affect between 3 and 20 percent of the human population. Hyposmia is a decreased ability to smell.\n\nSometimes people refer to this condition as smell blindness. This condition can be permanent or temporary. Smelling a particular odor is a complex process involving both the brain and the nose.\n\nWhen a person smells a scent, air enters the nose and odor molecules attach to receptors on nerves that sense smell, called olfactory nerves. These nerves line the olfactory epithelium, which is the tissue that lines the nasal cavity.\n\nWhen odor molecules from the environment stimulate these nerves, they send signals to the brain. The brain receives the olfactory information and processes it into a scent that a person can identify.\n\nA disturbed sense of smell can affect a person\u2019s quality of life, especially when tasting food because the sensation of food taste is a combination of the senses of smell and taste.\n\nTherefore, sufferers will experience appetite disorders which can result in malnutrition.\n\nIn addition, this condition can also cause sufferers to be unaware of danger signs around them, for example not being able to detect the smell of stale food, the smell of a gas leak, or the smell of smoke from a fire.\n\nSymptoms of Anosmia\n\nWhen people experience anosmia, they may notice that they can no longer smell identifiable odors.\n\nOn the other hand, people who are born with anosmia due to genetic differences may not realize they have anosmia, having never had the ability to smell.\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can cause loss of the sense of smell.\n\nIf a person living with a neurodegenerative disease notices a loss of smell, they should seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. Sometimes anosmia is an early sign of a neurodegenerative disease.\n\nWhen a person can no longer smell, they cannot perceive odor warnings in food and the environment.\n\nPeople living with anosmia may experience a lower quality of life-related to social interactions, eating, and mental well-being.\n\nRisk Factors for Anosmia\n\nSome things that are risk factors for this condition are:\n\nHaving a nasal infection or head trauma.\nAged over 60 years.\nSuffering from neurodegenerative disease.\nTaking medications that can cause anosmia.\nUndergoing radiation therapy to the head or neck.\n\nCauses of Anosmia\n\nIn the past, this disorder occurred in many people who had COVID-19. But overall, there are various other things that can cause disorders in the olfactory pathway that lead to anosmia, including:\n\nObstructive Disorders\n\nObstruction or blockage of the sense of smell is the most common cause of anosmia.\n\nOne cause of obstruction is inflammation, such as flu, rhinitis (colds), and rhinosinusitis. In addition, the presence of lumps in the nostrils, such as nasal polyps, can also cause obstruction of smell.\n\nHead Trauma\n\nHead injuries due to trauma are also one of the common causes of anosmia.\n\nThis is caused by a head injury which results in damage to the nose and sinuses which becomes a mechanical obstacle to being able to smell.\n\nIn addition, head trauma can also cause damage to the olfactory nerve. Anosmia due to head trauma can be temporary or permanent depending on the type of damage that occurs.\n\nAging and Neurodegenerative Processes\n\nThe aging process is a normal condition and is associated with a decrease in the ability to smell. This is due to the loss of a number of cells in the olfactory nerve.\n\nIn addition, several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Lewy Body dementia also result in decreased ability to smell.\n\nCongenital Disease\n\nTurner syndrome and Kallman syndrome are some congenital conditions that can cause permanent anosmia.\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nAnosmia is one of the side effects of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nDiagnosis of Anosmia\n\nLoss of smell can be difficult to detect. Your doctor may ask you questions about your current symptoms, examine your nose, perform a complete physical exam, and ask about your medical history.\n\nYour doctor may also ask about when the problem started, whether all or only some types of smell are affected, and whether or not you can taste food.\n\nDepending on the answers, the doctor may also perform one or more of the following tests:\n\nCT scan, which uses X-rays to create detailed images of the brain;\nMRI scans, which use radio waves and magnets to look at the brain;\nX-ray of the skull;\nNasal endoscopy to look inside the nose.\n\nAnosmia Complications\n\nPeople with anosmia may lose interest in food leading to malnutrition and weight loss.\n\nPeople with anosmia should also ensure that they have a working smoke and fire alarm in their home at all times.\n\nThey should also be careful with food storage and natural gas use, as it may be difficult to detect spoiled food and gas leaks.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n\nProperly label food with expiration dates;\nRead labels on chemicals, such as kitchen cleaners and insecticides;\nBe careful when using electrical equipment.\n\nAnosmia Treatment\n\nTreatment depends on the cause. If the loss of smell is due to COVID-19, a cold, allergies, or a sinus infection, it will usually go away on its own within a few days.\n\nYou should consult a doctor if anosmia does not go away after cold or allergy symptoms subside.\n\nTreatments that may help with anosmia caused by nasal irritation include:\n\nDecongestant;\nAntihistamines;\nSteroid nasal spray;\nAntibiotics, for bacterial infections;\nReduce exposure to nasal irritants and allergens;\nQuit smoking.\n\nLoss of smell caused by nasal obstruction can be treated by removing whatever is blocking the nasal passages.\n\nThis removal may involve procedures to remove nasal polyps, straighten the nasal septum, or clear the sinuses. Unfortunately, older adults are more likely to lose their sense of smell permanently.\n\nThere is currently no treatment available for people with congenital anosmia.\n\nPeople with partial loss of their sense of smell can add concentrated flavorings to foods to enhance their enjoyment.\n\nAnosmia Prevention\n\nBecause anosmia is a symptom of many health-related conditions, it cannot always be prevented.\n\nHowever, there are several things that can be done to reduce the risk:\n\nAvoid toxic chemicals and the environment.\nDo not smoke.\nWear protective gear when playing contact sports, as anosmia can be caused by brain injury.",

        "text": "Anorexia nervosa is a mental illness that makes sufferers obsessed with having a thin body because they are very afraid of having a fat body or looking fat.\n\nEven though they are thin, sufferers always think that their body is not thin enough or fat enough.\n\nAside from anorexia nervosa, there is also another eating disorder that is quite dangerous, namely bulimia. Although both are included in eating disorders, these two mental problems have differences.\n\nThe difference between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa is seen from the weight and behavior that appears. Bulimia mental disorder generally has a normal weight because sufferers have an obsession with overeating, then vomiting the food.\n\nMeanwhile, anorexia sufferers generally have less than normal body weight and have an obsession to be thin. Anorexia can be very dangerous because it causes malnutrition in the body of the sufferer.\n\nSymptoms of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nThe signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa are related to signs of starvation.\n\nAnorexia also includes emotional and behavioral problems involving unrealistic perceptions of body weight and an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat.\n\nSigns and symptoms can be difficult to spot because what is considered underweight varies from person to person. Also, some people may not appear very thin.\n\nPeople with anorexia nervosa also often disguise their thinness, eating habits, or physical problems.\n\n Physical symptoms\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms of anorexia may include:\n\nExtreme weight loss or no weight gain according to development.\nThin appearance.\nAbnormal number of blood elements.\nDizziness or fainting.\nBluish discoloration of the fingers.\nHair that is thinning, breaking or falling out.\nFine, downy hair covers the body.\nNot having menstruation.\nConstipation and stomach ache.\nDry or yellowish skin.\nCold intolerance.\nIrregular heart rhythm.\nLow blood pressure.\nSwelling of the arms or legs.\nTeeth are worn down and calluses on the knuckles from vomiting.\n\nBinge and purge type of anorexia, similar to bulimia. However, anorexics generally struggle with an abnormally low body weight, whereas bulimics are usually overweight.\n\n Emotional and behavioral symptoms\n\nBehavioral symptoms of anorexia may include attempts to lose weight by:\n\nSeverely restricting food intake through diet or fasting.\nOver-exercising.\nOvereating and self-induced vomiting to eliminate food, possibly including the use of laxatives, enemas, diet aids, or herbal products.\n\nMeanwhile, emotional and behavioral signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa include:\n\nPreoccupation with food, which sometimes includes cooking elaborate meals for others but not eating them himself.\nOften skip meals or refuse to eat.\nDenying hunger or making excuses for not eating.\nEat only certain foods, usually those that are low in fat and calories.\nDoesn\u2019t want to eat when there are a lot of people.\nLying about how much food is consumed.\nFear of gaining weight which may include repeatedly weighing or measuring the body.\nFrequently check the mirror for flaws.\nComplaining about being fat or having fat body parts.\nCovering layers of clothing.\nThe mood of the day is flat or lacking emotion.\nSocial withdrawal.\n\nLack of interest in intimate relationships.\n\nIn fact, the way the brain works for people with eating disorders is actually not the same as normal people.\n\nCauses of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nUnfortunately, experts do not yet know for sure what causes anorexia nervosa.\n\nAs with many diseases, there may be a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors.\n\n Biological\n\nAlthough it is not clear which genes are involved, there may be genetic changes that put some people at higher risk of developing anorexia.\n\nAdditionally, a person may also have a genetic predisposition to perfectionism, sensitivity, perseverance, and all the traits associated with anorexia.\n\n Psychological\n\nSome people with anorexia nervosa have obsessive-compulsive personality traits that make it easier to stick to a strict diet and forget about food even when hungry.\n\nThey may have extreme perfectionism, leading to thoughts that they are never thin enough.\n\nIn addition, they also have high levels of anxiety and engage in restricted eating to reduce it.\n\n Environment\n\nThere is a lot of modern popular culture that emphasizes that the ideal body is a slim body. Success and fame are often equated with the ideal thin body.\n\nPeer pressure can also help fuel the desire to be thin, especially among young girls.\n\nRisk Factors for Anorexia Nervosa\n\nAnorexia is more common in girls and women. However, today\u2019s boys and men are also developing eating disorders, which may be related to increased social pressure.\n\nAnorexia is also more common in teenagers. However, people of any age can develop this eating disorder.\n\nAdditionally, the disorder is rare in those over the age of 40. Teenagers may be at greater risk because of all the changes that occur in their bodies during puberty.\n\nAdditionally, teens may also face peer pressure and be more sensitive to criticism or even casual comments about their weight or body shape.\n\nMeanwhile, there are several factors that can increase the risk of anorexia, namely:\n\nCertain gene changes may put certain people at higher risk of developing anorexia.\n\nThose who have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling, or child who has the disorder have a much higher risk of anorexia.\n\n Poor diet and starvation\n\nDieting is the single most important risk factor for eating disorders. There is strong evidence that the symptoms of anorexia nervosa are actually symptoms of starvation.\n\nStarvation affects the brain and causes mood swings, rigidity in thinking, anxiety, and decreased appetite.\n\nStarvation and weight loss can change the way the brain works in at-risk individuals. This can then normalize the formation of restrictive eating behaviors and make it difficult for them to return to normal eating habits.\n\n Transition\n\nWhether it\u2019s a new school, home or job, a breakup, or the death or illness of a loved one, any of these changes can bring emotional stress and increase the risk of anorexia.\n\nIn addition, parents also need to be aware of the parenting patterns they apply because Mistakes in Parenting Children Cause Anorexia Nervosa.\n\nDiagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nDoctors can make a diagnosis through interviews, physical examinations, and various supporting examinations.\n\nA doctor will diagnose anorexia if they find the following characteristics:\n\nSufferers restrict food intake to maintain or gain less than normal body weight without paying attention to the calories and energy the body needs.\nHave a great fear of gaining weight or being fat. This fear will eventually make the sufferer do activities that can reduce the body weight that is already less than normal.\nHaving problems seeing yourself, such as constantly looking at your weight and body shape and denying that your weight is far below normal.\n\nThen, the doctor will perform several physical examinations, including:\n\nMeasure weight and height.\nCheck the condition of nails and skin.\nPerform examinations on the stomach, heart and lungs.\nMeasuring vital signs, such as body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.\n\nIn order to get a more accurate diagnosis, the doctor may recommend several supporting examinations.\n\nThe goal is to rule out other potential problems causing weight loss or potential complications. These tests include:\n\nLaboratory tests, including a complete blood count, urinalysis, and measuring protein and electrolyte levels in the blood. Other tests include kidney, thyroid, and liver function.\nConducting a mental health evaluation, in the form of an interview to find out how the sufferer feels, their eating habits, and their thought patterns.\nX-rays to determine bone health and density, as well as the potential for lung infections or heart problems.\n\nAnorexia Nervosa Treatment\n\nHere are some steps for treating anorexia nervosa that you can take:\n\n Consultation with medical and psychological professionals\n\nAn important first step is to seek help from a medical and psychological team experienced in treating eating disorders.\n\nA doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist can help diagnose and plan appropriate treatment.\n\n Nutrition and weight recovery\n\nIn cases of anorexia nervosa, weight restoration is a priority to restore healthy body function. Consult a dietitian to plan a balanced diet.\n\n Cognitive behavioral therapy\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one form of therapy that is effective in treating anorexia nervosa.\n\nThis therapy helps sufferers identify negative thought patterns and behaviors related to eating and weight. The therapist will also help them replace these thought patterns with healthier and more realistic ones.\n\n Family therapy\n\nThis type of therapy is generally intended for teenagers who suffer from anorexia nervosa.\n\nInvolving the family in care can help build support and understanding of the family\u2019s role in recovery.\n\n Group support\n\nJoining a support group for eating disorders can help individuals feel more accepted and gain support from people who are going through similar things.\n\n Overcoming emotional problems\n\nTherapy also helps individuals deal with emotional issues that trigger the condition, such as anxiety, depression, or stress. Doctors usually prescribe medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers.\n\n Avoid comparing yourself\n\nAlso, don\u2019t compare yourself to others, especially regarding weight and appearance.\n\nFocus on your own recovery. Sufferers also need to be open. Don\u2019t hesitate to talk to those closest to you about the struggles you\u2019ve been through.\n\nIf it has reached a critical stage and the symptoms of malnutrition are leading to death, the sufferer needs immediate medical treatment.\n\nSide Effects of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nAnorexia can have many complications. In severe cases, complications can lead to death, even when a person is not very thin.\n\nThis condition can occur due to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) or an imbalance of electrolytes or minerals such as sodium, potassium, and calcium which maintain fluid balance in the body.\n\nOther complications of anorexia include:\n\nHeart problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms, or heart failure.\nOsteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures.\nMuscle loss.\nNot experiencing menstruation in women. While in men, decreased testosterone levels.\nDigestive problems, such as constipation, bloating or nausea.\nElectrolyte abnormalities, such as low blood potassium, sodium, and chloride.\nKidney problems.\n\nIf an anorexic person becomes severely malnourished, every organ in the body can be damaged, including the brain, heart, and kidneys.\n\nThis damage may not be fully reversible, even when anorexia is under control.\n\nIn addition to a number of physical complications, people with anorexia also commonly have other mental health disorders . These include:\n\nDepression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.\nPersonality disorders.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nAlcohol and substance abuse.\nSelf-harm, suicidal thoughts, or suicide attempts.\n\nPrevention of Anorexia Nervosa\n\nUnfortunately, there is no surefire way to prevent anorexia nervosa. However, there are a few things you can try to reduce your risk of developing the condition, including:\n\nNot demanding or putting pressure on family regarding appearance or appearance.\nHelps increase self-confidence among family members.\nFocus on other things that have nothing to do with appearance.\nDiscuss with your doctor if you want to go on a diet or make changes to your eating patterns to lose weight.",

        "text": "What is Angular Cheilitis?\n\nAngular cheilitis is an inflammatory skin condition that affects one or both corners of the mouth. This skin condition causes sores and cracks in the corners of the mouth.\n\nAlthough painful, angular cheilitis is usually mild and not contagious. It can last for a few days or persist indefinitely.\n\nSymptoms of Angular Cheilitis \n\nAngular cheilitis symptoms only appear at the corners of the mouth. The condition can be painful and vary in shape and color. It usually ranges from mild redness to open, bleeding blisters.\n\nIf you experience this disorder, the corners of your mouth will appear:\n\nItchy rash.\n\nOther symptoms of angular cheilitis may include:\n\nOral fungal infection (thrush). Get to know the triggers in this article: \u201c These are 5 Causes of Thrush and How to Treat It \u201d.\nEczema-type rash on the lower face.\nRedness of the roof of the mouth in denture wearers.\nThere is saliva in the corners of the mouth.\nDeep cracks at the corners of the lips.\n\nCauses of Angular Cheilitis\n\nAngular cheilitis occurs due to the accumulation of saliva and the type of skin on the lips that tends to be dry. Over time, dry skin can become cracked, increasing the risk of bacteria or fungi entering.\n\nThere are also several diseases that can cause angular cheilitis, such as:\n\nAtopic dermatitis or eczema.\nThe habit of drooling while sleeping.\nFungal or yeast infections in the mouth, such as thrush.\nMisaligned teeth position.\nSuffering from skin allergies.\nWearing a face mask.\n\nRisk Factors for Angular Cheilitis \n\nAngular cheilitis is more likely to occur in people who have moist corners of the mouth. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\nUsing braces.\nWearing ill-fitting dentures.\nThe habit of licking your lips frequently.\nHave a lot of saliva.\nHaving crooked teeth.\nLoose skin around the mouth due to weight loss or age.\nHaving a habit of sucking a thumb or pacifier.\nActive smoker. Find out here, \u201c 9 Effective Tips to Quit Smoking \u201d.\nNot getting enough nutrients, such as B vitamins or iron.\n\nThere are certain medical conditions that can increase the risk of developing angular cheilitis, such as:\n\nBlood cancer.\nDown syndrome.\nImmune disorders, such as having human immunodeficiency virus(HIV).\nKidney, liver, lung, or pancreatic cancer.\n\nDiagnosis of Angular Cheilitis \n\nSome procedures that can help the medical team in diagnosing disorders include:\n\n Medical interview\n\nMedical interview to collect relevant medical information about the patient\u2019s medical history. Including current complaints, medical history, and previous treatment procedures.\n\n Physical examination\n\nNext, the doctor will examine your mouth to check for cracks, redness, swelling, or abrasions. They will also ask about habits that may be contributing to your lip problems.\n\n Supporting examinations\n\nThe doctor will swab the corners of the mouth and nose to collect saliva. The doctor will then send it to a lab to see what type of bacteria or fungus is causing angular cheilitis.\n\nAngular Cheilitis Treatment \n\nThe treatment plan will depend on the cause. Some treatment procedures include:\n\n Antibiotics\n\nThe use of this antibiotic drug consists of two ways, namely oral and topical. Whatever the type of drug, the use of antibiotics aims to help treat bacterial infections.\n\n Dental care\n\nMake sure you wear dentures or braces in the correct position. Because misaligned teeth when biting can cause or even worsen existing symptoms.\n\n Changes in eating patterns\n\nConsume foods rich in protein, iron, and vitamin B. This is done to help overcome problems that occur due to poor diet or nutritional deficiencies.\n\n Ointment or cream\n\nTopical antifungal or steroid creams can help relieve swelling and pain from cracks in the corners of your mouth. You can also use lip balm or petroleum jelly to keep your mouth moist.\n\nComplications of Angular Cheilitis \n\nComplications of the disease can occur if the cause is a bacterial or fungal infection. If you experience this, the infection can spread to the surrounding skin and cause canker sores.\n\nOther complications include:\n\nDifficulty speaking.\nDifficulty eating and drinking.\nSwelling and inflammation.\nInfection that doesn\u2019t get better.\nDecreased self-confidence due to wounds that interfere with appearance.\n\nHow to Prevent Angular Cheilitis \n\nSome steps you can take to prevent angular cheilitis include:\n\nKeeps lips dry.\nDon\u2019t lick your lips.\nTreat the underlying condition.\nUse lip balmor petroleum jelly.\nPractice good oral hygiene.\nDo not smoke or use tobacco products.\nDo not use expired cosmetics.\nRinse mouth after using inhalation.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nDiscuss with a dermatologist if you experience:\n\nWounds that last more than 2 weeks.\nExperiencing severe symptoms.\nThere is a wound near the eye.\nPain that spreads to other areas of the body.",

        "title": "Color Blind Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Color Blind Color blindness is the inability to see the difference between certain colors. Although many people commonly use the term \u201ccolor blindness\u201d for this condition, color blindness in the sense that everything is seen in shades of black and white is very rare. So most people who are color blind see a different color than they should see. Color blindness is usually an inherited condition, and men are more likely to be born with the condition. Most people with color blindness cannot distinguish between certain shades of red and green. Less commonly, a person with this vision disorder cannot distinguish between blue and yellow. In addition, certain eye diseases and some medications can also cause color blindness. Symptoms of Color Blindness A person may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. Some people find out that they or their child has color blindness symptoms when it causes confusion. Such as when there is a problem distinguishing colors in traffic lights or interpreting color-coded learning materials. The most common color blindness is the inability to see some shades of red and green. Often, a person who is less able to see red-green or blue-yellow is not fully sensitive to either color. This condition can be mild, moderate, or severe. Can Color Blind People See Any Colors? The following is an explanation of what colors color blind people can see, based on the type of color blindness: 1. Red-Green Color Blindness This is a condition where the photopigments in the red cones or green cones of your eyes do not function properly. There are several types: Deuteranomaly: This is the most common form of color blindness and affects 5 percent of men, but is rare in women. It occurs when the green cone photopigment does not function properly. Yellow and green appear redder, and it is difficult to distinguish blue from violet. Protanomaly: Occurs when the red cone photopigments do not function properly. Orange, red, and yellow appear greener, and the colors are less vibrant. It is usually mild and does not cause problems in daily life. It is rare in women and affects about 1 percent of men. Protanopia: A person does not have functioning red cone cells. Reds appear only dark gray. Some shades of orange, yellow, and green appear yellow. This is rare in women and affects only about 1 percent of men. Deuteranopia: A person does not have functioning green cone cells. Red looks yellow-brown, and green looks beige. This affects 1 percent of men and is rare in women. 2. Blue-Yellow Color Blindness This is when the blue cone photopigment is missing or not functioning properly. This is the second most common type affecting men and women equally. Tritanomaly: Blue cone cells work only in a limited way. Blue looks greener, and pink is difficult to distinguish from yellow and red. This condition is very rare. Tritanopia: also known as blue-yellow color blindness, is a condition where someone does not have blue cone cells. Blue looks green, and yellow looks light gray or purple. This condition is also very rare. 3. Complete Color Blindness Also has another name monochromacy, which is when someone does not see color at all and vision is not very clear. There are two types, namely: Cone monochromacy: This condition occurs when 2 of the 3 cone photopigments, such as red, green, or blue, are not functioning. When only one type of cone is functioning, it is difficult to distinguish one color from another. Rod monochromacy: also known as achromatopsia, is the most severe form of color blindness. None of the cone cells have functioning photopigments. As a result, the world appears in black, white, and gray. Meanwhile, color blindness in children is often detected late. Because children tend not to know and are not aware that what they see may not be perfect. Risk Factors There are many things that increase the risk of experiencing this vision disorder, including: Inherited from parents. Having certain diseases. Taking certain medications. Exposure to chemicals. Done. Causes of Color Blindness Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that occurs with the eye\u2019s ability to respond to different wavelengths of light. Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters the eye through the cornea and passes through the transparent lens. The jelly-like tissue in the eye (vitreous humor) to the wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of the eye in the macular area of \u200b\u200bthe retina. Cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), or long (red) wavelengths of light. Chemicals in the cone cells trigger reactions and send wavelength information through the optic nerve to the brain. If your eyes are not abnormal, you will perceive color. But if your cone cells lack one or more wavelength-sensitive chemicals, you won\u2019t be able to distinguish between red, green, or blue. Causes of color blindness include: 1. Genetic disorders Inherited color deficiencies are much more common in males than females. The most common color deficiency is red-green, with blue-yellow deficiency being much less common. It is rare to have no color vision at all. You can inherit a mild, moderate or severe degree of the disorder. Inherited color deficiencies usually affect both eyes, and the severity does not change throughout life. 2. Certain diseases Several conditions can cause color deficits in the eyes. Starting from sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic alcoholism, and leukemia. One eye will be more affected than the other, and the color deficit will improve if the underlying disease can be treated. 3. Certain eye diseases This condition can also occur due to eye disease that causes damage to the part of the eye that helps see color. Examples of eye diseases include glaucoma or macular degeneration. 4. Consumption of certain medications Some medications can alter color vision, such as some drugs that treat certain autoimmune diseases, heart problems, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, infections, nervous disorders, and psychological problems. 5. Aging factors Your ability to see colors slowly declines as you age. 6. Chemicals Exposure to certain workplace chemicals, such as carbon disulfide and fertilizers, can cause color vision loss. Color Blindness Diagnosis If you have trouble seeing certain colors, your eye doctor can perform a test to see if you have a color deficiency. You will have a complete eye exam. Then, the doctor will perform supporting tests to support the examination. Here are some types of color blindness tests that doctors can perform: 1. Ishihara test This examination is the option that doctors most often recommend. In the procedure, the doctor will ask the patient to recognize numbers or letters that are shown faintly on the image in the form of colored dots. 2. Color Arrangement Test This examination aims to provide a detailed analysis of this condition and/or a person\u2019s ability to recognize colors accurately. This color blindness test consists of a number of colored discs or plates that a person must arrange in the correct color order. 3. Cambridge Color Test This test involves using a computer screen. When a person undergoes it, the doctor will ask them to identify the letter \u201cC\u201d on the screen that is a different color than the surrounding colors. Color Blindness Treatment There is no cure for color blindness. Except for color vision problems related to the use of certain medications or eye conditions. Stopping the medication that is causing the vision problem or treating the underlying eye disease may result in improved color vision. Wearing colored filters over glasses or colored contact lenses can enhance the perception of contrast between confusing colors. However, such lenses will not improve the ability to see all colors. Several rare retinal disorders associated with color deficiencies can be modified with gene replacement techniques. This treatment is being studied and may be available in the future. In addition, you can also try the following tips to help overcome this condition: Memorize the order of colored objects. If it is important to know individual colors, such as traffic lights, memorize the order of the colors. Label colored items that you want to match with other items. Ask someone with good color vision to help you sort and label clothes. Use technology. Such as apps for mobile phones and digital devices that can help identify colors. Color Blindness Prevention The causes of color blindness are divided into factors that sufferers cannot control (genetic) and factors that sufferers can control. Here are steps you can take to reduce the risk of color blindness: 1. Prevention for genetic factors If the cause of color blindness is a genetic factor, then there is no preventative measure that a person can take. Therefore, it is important for couples who want to get married to discuss genetic testing with their doctor before planning a pregnancy. 2. Prevention for controllable causes For causes of color blindness that you can control, there are several efforts to reduce the risk: Routinely undergo a comprehensive health check. Have an eye exam every year. Implement a healthy lifestyle. If working in a sector that is prone to exposure to hazardous chemicals, be sure to wear proper eye protection. Exercise regularly. Consume healthy, balanced nutritious food. Especially food that is healthy for the eyes. Complications of Color Blindness In general, this condition can cause the child\u2019s learning process to be less than optimal. In addition, there will be many adjustments that sufferers will have to make. However, the most severe level of this condition is total color blindness. In this condition, sufferers can only see colors such as gray, white, and black. In addition, people with total color blindness are also at risk of experiencing other vision disorders, such as: Nystagmus or a condition where the eyeballs make rapid and repeated movements without intention. Photophobia or sensitivity to bright light. Decreased visual acuity. Amblyopia or lazy eye syndrome. Farsightedness or hypermetropia. When to See a Doctor? If you suspect you or someone you love has trouble distinguishing certain colors or changes in color vision, see an eye doctor for testing. Remember, it is important for children to get a comprehensive eye exam. Including color vision testing, before starting school. Also, there is no cure for genetic color deficiencies. But if eye disease or illness is the cause, then treatment can improve color vision.",

        "title": "Lazy Eye(Amblyopia) Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Lazy Eye(Amblyopia) The medical term for lazy eye is amblyopia. This condition occurs when the brain only connects to one eye, causing poor vision in the other eye. This causes the brain to ignore signals from the weak or lazy eye. This disease can lead to impaired vision and loss of depth perception. The eye affected by lazy eye does not always look different, although it may \u201cwander\u201d in different directions. The condition usually affects only one eye. However, in some cases, vision in both eyes can be affected. This condition usually occurs in children and is the main cause of decreased vision in children. However, it is important to understand that this condition is not the same as crossed or turned eyes or what is called strabismus. It\u2019s just that strabismus can cause amblyopia if crossed eyes are not used enough. If left untreated, temporary or permanent vision loss can occur. This includes loss of depth perception and three-dimensional vision. Lazy Eye Symptoms (Amblyopia) Lazy eye symptoms are seen from sufferers who cannot focus well with one of their eyes. Because the disturbed eye will not see objects clearly. The brain cannot receive clear data either, so it will start to ignore the image of the object. In many cases, a stronger brain and eyes can make up for these deficiencies very well. Therefore, sufferers do not realize that they have an eye problem. That is why lazy eye is often only diagnosed when a child undergoes a routine eye test. Symptoms of lazy eye can include: Blurred vision. Double vision. Weak depth perception. Rolling the eyes, either up, down, out, or in. People with this condition need to have their vision checked, especially if they have a family history of strabismus, childhood cataracts, or other eye conditions. Risk Factors for Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Risk factors associated with an increased risk of lazy eye include: Born premature Having a family history of lazy eye Developmental disorders. Causes of Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Lazy eye develops as a result of abnormal visual experiences early in life. This changes the nerve pathways between the retina at the back of the eye and the brain. The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals. Eventually, the eyes\u2019 ability to work together decreases, and the brain suppresses or ignores input from the weaker eye. Anything that causes a child\u2019s vision to become blurry or causes the eyes to squint and change direction can cause this condition. Common causes of this condition include: Muscle imbalance (strabismus amblyopia). The most common cause is an imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes. This imbalance can cause the eyes to protrude inward or outward, preventing them from working together. Difference in visual acuity between the eyes (refractive amblyopia). A significant difference between the two eyes can cause lazy eye. Often it is due to nearsightedness, but sometimes it is due to farsightedness or an uneven curvature of the eye\u2019s surface (astigmatism). Glasses or contact lenses are usually used to correct this refractive problem. In some children, this eye condition is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems. Problems with one eye, such as a cloudy area in the lens (cataract), can block clear vision in that eye. Infantile deprivation amblyopia requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. It is often the most severe type of amblyopia. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Diagnosis Amblyopia diagnosis can be determined from a medical interview, physical examination, and several supporting examinations such as: Crowding phenomena test, testing using the Snellen chart. Density filter neutral test, a vision test using reduced light intensity. Worth\u2019s four dot test, a test to see fusion and stereopsis vision. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Treatment Effective lazy eye treatment involves treating the underlying eye condition first. Simple early treatment measures that can be taken may include the use of glasses, contact lenses, eye patches, eye drops, or vision therapy. The earlier the condition is treated, the better the outcome. However, recovery is still possible if amblyopia is diagnosed and treated when you are older. 1. Glasses/contact lenses If you have amblyopia due to nearsightedness or farsightedness, or have astigmatism in one eye, then corrective glasses or contact lenses may help. 2. Eye patch Wearing an eye patch over your dominant eye can help strengthen your weaker eye. Your doctor may recommend wearing the patch for 1 to 2 hours a day, depending on how severe your amblyopia is. Blindfolds will help develop the areas of the brain that control vision. 3. Eye drops Eye drops can be used once or twice a day to blur the vision in the good eye. Like an eye patch, this treatment encourages you to use your weaker eye more often. This can be an additional alternative to lazy eye treatment. 4. Surgery If you have crossed eyes or eyes that point in opposite directions, you may need surgery on the eye muscles. Lazy Eye Complications Certain complications can occur with lazy eye, including: Blindness. If left untreated, sufferers can eventually lose vision in the eye affected by lazy eye. This vision loss is usually permanent. Eye Alignment. Strabismus, where the eyes are misaligned, can be permanent. Central Vision. If children do not receive treatment, central vision may not develop properly. This can affect their ability to perform certain tasks. Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) Prevention Lazy eye cannot be prevented. However, you can stop it from getting worse or causing permanent problems. The best way to prevent vision loss due to amblyopia is to have regular eye exams. Make sure your child has a comprehensive eye exam at 6 months of age and then again at 3 years of age. When to See a Doctor? When you experience symptoms of this eye problem and it starts to interfere with your vision, see an eye doctor immediately for further treatment. Proper treatment can minimize the effects so that treatment can be done faster.",

        "title": "Pterygium Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Pterygium Pterygium is an eye disease that occurs due to the growth of a pink, triangular tissue membrane that appears on the white part of the eyeball. This condition is also known as surfer\u2018s eye. Typically, this condition begins on the cornea near the nose and can grow to the pupil (the black part of the eye). This condition is usually only found in one eye. However, if you experience it in both eyes, this eye disorder is called pterygia. This disease can cause discomfort and trigger itching. If not treated immediately, this condition can increase the risk of closed pupils and impaired vision. Symptoms of Pterygium This disease develops slowly. At the beginning of the appearance of pterygium, you will not experience any symptoms. However, symptoms will be felt more as the condition worsens. There are several symptoms that sufferers often experience in the early stages of its development, such as: A pink line appears on the white of the eye. Red and irritated eyes. Dry eyes accompanied by itching and a burning sensation. Feeling like there is sand or dust in the eyes. Eyes that water more often. The vision became a little blurry. Worsening symptoms are characterized by the growth of a membrane that increasingly covers the cornea and impaired vision. Pterygium Risk Factors Avoid various risk factors that can trigger this disease, such as: Spending too much time outdoors during the day. Eyes exposed to dust, sand, and air pollution can cause eye irritation. Dry eyes. Causes of Pterygium It is not yet known exactly what causes pterygium. However, too much direct exposure to ultraviolet light is thought to be the cause of this condition. There are several theories that try to explain the pathogenesis of pterygium. For example, geographical variations affect the incidence of pterygium, which is shown by most studies that have been done. This is based on the higher incidence of pterygium in countries closer to the equator. The increased prevalence of pterygium is thought to be due to the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation, particularly UV-B radiation, which affects people in equatorial regions. The hypothesis is that this radiation causes mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, thereby facilitating abnormal proliferation of the limbal epithelium. Apart from direct exposure to sunlight, eye irritation that is not treated properly can also trigger pterygium. Diagnosis of Pterygium A doctor can diagnose this condition based on a physical exam using a slit lamp. This lamp allows the doctor to see a person\u2019s eye with the help of magnification and bright lighting. Additional tests include: Visual Acuity Test. This test involves reading letters on an eye chart. Corneal Topography. This medical mapping technique is used to measure changes in the curvature of the cornea. Photo Documentation. This procedure is done by taking pictures that aim to track the growth rate of the pterygium. Pterygium Treatment If the symptoms of pterygium are still mild or still in the early stages, doctors will generally prescribe medication to reduce irritation or redness in the eyes. Medication can be given with steroid eye drops, artificial tears, and so on. However, if the pterygium has reached an advanced stage and disturbing symptoms are found, such as impaired vision, the doctor will recommend surgery to remove this abnormal tissue growth and remove it. After that, conjunctival tissue or placenta can be used to fill the empty space where the pterygium lesion was. Pterygium Complications If left untreated, this condition can trigger severe scarring of the cornea. Scarring can increase the risk of vision loss. Pterygium Prevention Prevention of pterygium disease can be done by using sunglasses with lenses that can block 99-100 percent of UV A and UV B every day when going outdoors and the weather is hot. Don\u2019t forget to use head coverings, such as hats, which can protect your eyes from direct exposure to sunlight.",

        "title": "Conjunctivitis Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis, also called pink eye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva. Well, the conjunctiva itself is a clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye (sclera) and the inside of the eyelids. This inflammatory disorder of the conjunctiva can cause the white part of the eye to appear reddish or pink. This eye disease is usually caused by bacterial or viral infections, to allergic reactions. Even so, this disorder rarely affects vision. In addition, conjunctivitis most often attacks children, because this eye disease can spread quickly in schools and daycare centers. However, conjunctivitis is rarely serious, especially if it is found and treated quickly. The role of parents is very important to address this problem in children quickly so that the discomfort caused can be overcome immediately. Symptoms of Conjunctivitis Symptoms of conjunctivitis vary depending on the type and cause. In general, the symptoms of conjunctivitis are: Red eyes in one or both eyes. The eyes also often feel itchy and like there is sand in them. The eyes can produce a thick, crusty discharge at night, making it difficult to open your eyes in the morning. Enlarged lymph nodes may also be found. Eyes feel burning and/or sore. Swollen eyelids. Blurred vision. Eyes are sensitive to light. Green or white discharge from the eyes. Risk Factors for Conjunctivitis There are several factors that increase a person\u2019s risk of experiencing this eye problem, including: Using contact lenses, especially long-term wear. Exposure to someone infected with the virus or bacteria causes this eye disorder. Being exposed to something that causes a person to be allergic. Causes of Conjunctivitis As mentioned earlier, there are three main types that cause this eye disorder, namely infections from viruses or bacteria, and allergies. However, there are several other causes that can cause conjunctivitis, such as: Reaction to eye drops. Irritants to shampoo, dirt, smoke, and chlorine. Fungi, amoeba, and parasites. Conjunctivitis is also sometimes caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Gonorrhea and Chlamydia are examples of STDs that can cause conjunctivitis. Types of Conjunctivitis There are several types of conjunctivitis that are distinguished by their causes. Here is a more complete explanation: Viral Conjunctivitis This viral eye condition is the most common type of conjunctivitis. This type of pink eye is highly contagious and often spreads in certain settings, such as schools and other crowded places. This condition can cause burning red eyes with discharge. Bacterial Conjunctivitis This eye problem is also considered very contagious. A bacterial infection causes the eyes to turn pink. This disorder can also cause pain in the eyes with lots of sticky pus in the eyes. Some bacterial infections can also cause little or no discharge. Allergic Conjunctivitis This eye problem is caused by an allergic reaction to pollen, animals, cigarette smoke, pool chlorine, car exhaust, and many more. This conjunctivitis is not contagious. When it occurs, you can feel very itchy, red, and watery, and the eyelids can become swollen. Diagnosis of Conjunctivitis To make a diagnosis, the doctor will initially ask questions about symptoms and recent medical history related to conjunctivitis. After that, supporting examinations are carried out by taking samples of fluid flowing from the eye to be analyzed in the laboratory (culture). This laboratory examination can help the doctor to determine the cause of the disorder. For example, caused by bacteria, viruses, allergies, or other problems. After that, the determination for the right treatment can be done. Conjunctivitis Treatment Treatment for this eye disorder depends on the underlying cause. Here are some treatments: For viral conjunctivitis, doctors will not prescribe antibiotics, as it usually resolves on its own within one to three weeks. To create more comfort, apply a cool, wet cloth to the eyes. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment. However, if the conjunctivitis is caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia, oral antibiotics are needed. Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with vasoconstrictors, antihistamines, and steroid eye drops. This can help relieve itching and swelling. General treatment is symptomatic for all types of conjunctivitis, namely compressing the eyes with warm water for 5-10 minutes 4 times a day to relieve discomfort. In addition, artificial tears can also be given. For conjunctivitis sufferers who use contact lenses, it is recommended not to wear contact lenses until the eyes are completely healed. Complications of Conjunctivitis If left untreated, conjunctivitis can cause complications in the form of inflammation of the cornea that affects vision. This can happen to both children and adults. Therefore, proper evaluation and treatment are needed to avoid problems such as blurred vision or light sensitivity so that the risk of complications is smaller. Conjunctivitis Prevention Here are some ways you can do to prevent conjunctivitis: Keep your hands clean and do not touch your eyes with your hands. Wash your hands more often. Use clean towels and cloths every day. Do not share towels or washcloths. Change pillowcases as often as possible. Limit the use of eye cosmetics, such as mascara. Do not share eye cosmetics or personal eye care items. Avoid allergy triggers. Clean contact lenses regularly, especially before use. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms of conjunctivitis, such as eye pain, a feeling of something stuck in your eye, blurred vision, and light sensitivity, see an eye doctor immediately for treatment. Those who wear contact lenses should stop wearing them as soon as symptoms of conjunctivitis begin. If symptoms do not improve within 12 to 24 hours, make an appointment with your eye doctor to make sure you do not have a more serious eye infection related to your contact lens use.",

        "title": "Presbyopia Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Presbyopia Presbyopia or old eyes is a condition in which the eyes slowly lose their ability to focus quickly on close objects. This condition is something that commonly occurs as we age. Presbyopia generally appears at age 40 and continues to develop until age 65. This is related to the eye lens which is surrounded by elastic muscles. These muscles can change the shape of the lens to focus light to fall right on the retina. Unfortunately, as we age, the muscles around the eye lens will lose their elasticity and harden. As a result, the eye lens cannot bend light properly to focus it on the retina. Symptoms of Presbyopia Symptoms of presbyopia begin to be experienced since someone enters the age of 40 years, usually, someone is not aware that he has presbyopia because he can still try to adjust. You need to recognize the symptoms of presbyopia especially if you are over 40 years old. The symptoms that appear are usually marked by: Difficulty reading newspapers or writing on a cell phone or letters from a close distance, and when you move the object away, the writing is more legible. Vision becomes blurry when looking at objects at close range. Eyes feel sore and head feels tense and sore after reading at close range or writing. The above complaints will get worse when you do it in low light conditions. Risk Factors for Presbyopia The most significant risk factor for presbyopia is age. Most people lose some of their ability to focus on near objects by age 40. However, certain diseases or medications can cause presbyopia in people younger than 40. When symptoms of presbyopia occur earlier than usual, it is called premature presbyopia. In addition, a person is at higher risk for premature presbyopia if they have: Anemia, which is a lack of enough normal blood cells. Suffering from cardiovascular disease. Diabetes, or difficulty metabolizing blood sugar. Having hyperopia, or farsightedness, which means the sufferer has greater difficulty seeing objects that are close up than objects that are far away. Multiple sclerosis, which is a chronic disease that affects the spine and brain. Myasthenia gravis, which is a neuromuscular disorder that affects the body\u2019s nerves and muscles. The presence of trauma or certain eye diseases. Have vascular insufficiency, or poor blood flow. In addition, some prescription and over-the-counter medications can also increase a person\u2019s risk of developing early presbyopia. Examples of these medications are: Anti-anxiety medication. Antidepressant. Antihistamines. Antipsychotics. Antispasmodic. Diuretic. Causes of Presbyopia First of all you need to know that in order to see an object, the human eye must capture light, and focus the light from the object being viewed to the retina in the eye. When the object is at a closer distance, the lens of the eye that is responsible for focusing the light captured by the cornea of \u200b\u200bthe eye becomes more flexible. The lens of the eye is different from the cornea, because the lens of the eye has a flexible nature, and can change shape with the help of the circular muscles that surround it. When you look at an object that is far away, the circular muscles relax. Likewise, when you look at an object at close range, the circular muscles of the eye will tense and make the lens of the eye change shape in order to focus the light received. In presbyopia, the eye lens will experience changes to become harder and begin to lose its flexibility, this happens with age. As a result of this loss of flexibility, the eye lens becomes difficult to focus the existing light. As a result, the resulting image becomes unfocused/blurry. Presbyopia Diagnosis Presbyopia can be diagnosed through a routine eye examination consisting of a vision examination through an eye refraction test, and a complete eye examination. Presbyopia Treatment Until now, several steps that can be taken to overcome presbyopia include: Wearing glasses. Using contact lenses. Refractive eye surgery, such as LASIK surgery. Eye lens implantation. Korean inlay, which is the act of inserting a small plastic ring into each cornea to change the curvature of the cornea. Complications of Presbyopia If presbyopia is not diagnosed or not properly corrected, the sufferer\u2019s vision will gradually deteriorate. This condition can make presbyopia sufferers have problems maintaining their daily activity and productivity levels. Especially when sufferers have to read small writings, they can experience headaches and eye fatigue. Everyone develops presbyopia as they age, so presbyopia may also be accompanied by other types of eye problems. Presbyopia can occur in combination with: Astigmatism. An imperfection in the curvature of the cornea that causes blurred vision. Hyperopia, or farsightedness. Myopia, or nearsightedness. In addition, people with presbyopia may also have different types of eye problems in each eye. Presbyopia Prevention To date, there is no proven technique to prevent presbyopia. However, there are steps you can take to improve your eye health and slow the progression of presbyopia, namely: Have regular eye exams. Manage chronic health conditions that can cause vision loss, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Wearing sunglasses. Wear protective eyewear when participating in activities that may result in eye injury. Eat a healthy diet with foods containing antioxidants, vitamin A, and beta carotene. Make sure you wear glasses with the right lens size. Use good lighting when reading. When to See a Doctor? If you experience one or more symptoms of presbyopia, see a doctor immediately. The goal is that appropriate treatment can be carried out early so that the risk of complications can be minimized.",

        "title": "Cataract Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Cataract Cataracts are a disease when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy and opaque. In general, cataracts develop slowly and are not initially felt to be disturbing. However, over time, cataracts will interfere with vision and make sufferers feel like looking at a foggy window, making it difficult to drive, read, and do daily activities. This eye disease is the leading cause of blindness in the world that can be treated. Cataract Symptoms Sufferers can experience several symptoms, for example: Blurred vision like fog. See circles around the light. Double vision. Decreased vision at night. Glare when looking at car headlights, the sun, or lamps. Frequently change the size of glasses. The colors around it look faded. Cataract Risk Factors There are several factors that can increase the risk of cataracts, including: Aging. Aging is the most common cause of lens opacities or cataracts. History of trauma. Eye lenses that have experienced trauma, such as sharp material fragments entering the eye, being hit by a ball, fireworks, can cause cataracts to develop more quickly. Infection during pregnancy. If the mother has an infection during pregnancy, especially rubella, it can be the main cause of congenital cataracts in the child that is born. Congenital cataracts can occur in one or both of the child\u2019s eyes. Taking certain medications over a long period of time, such as corticosteroids and amiodarone, can trigger cataracts. People with certain diseases. People with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypokalemia, and atopic dermatitis may be associated with the development of cataracts later in life. Smoking and alcohol consumption habits. Prolonged exposure to sunlight on the eyes. Exposure to toxins or poisons. Family history of cataracts. History of eye surgery. Causes of Cataracts The most common cause of cataracts is due to aging or trauma that causes changes in the eye tissue. The lens of the eye is mostly made up of water and protein. As we age, the lens becomes thicker and less flexible. This causes protein clumps and reduces the amount of light reaching the retina, a light-sensitive layer located at the back of the eye. This condition eventually causes blurry and dull vision. The lens changes start out as a mild yellow-brown color, but worsen over time. Some inherited genetic disorders can also cause other health problems that can increase the risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, previous eye surgery, or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications can also cause the eye disease to develop. Cataract Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose cataracts by reviewing your medical history and symptoms and performing a thorough eye exam, including: Visual field examination. Visual acuity test. Examination using a tool directed from the side of the eye, to show cloudiness in the eye lens ( shadow test ). Other additional examinations that can also be performed to diagnose cataracts include: A slit lamp examination, which allows the eye doctor to see the structures in the front of your eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the retina, if abnormalities in other organs in the eye are suspected. Applanation tonometry. This test measures the fluid pressure in the eye. Cataract Treatment If cataracts aren\u2019t too bothersome, you may just need new glasses to help you see better. If cataracts cause vision to worsen and make it difficult to carry out daily activities, surgery is a treatment that can be performed to overcome this eye problem. Cataract surgery is generally safe and does not require hospitalization. There are two types of cataract surgery, namely: Small incision cataract surgery ( phacoemulsification ). This surgery is done by making a small incision on the edge of the cornea. Next, the doctor will shine ultrasound waves to destroy the lens and then remove it using a suction device. Extracapsular surgery. This surgery requires a larger incision to remove the cloudy lens nucleus. The remaining lens is then removed using a suction device. In both types of surgery, an artificial lens, also called an intraocular lens, is inserted to replace the original lens. The surgery takes about an hour and is painless. Doctors usually use eye drops to numb the eye and keep the patient conscious during the surgery. Cataract Complications In most cases, cataracts will continue to worsen over time, causing vision to decrease. This can make it difficult for sufferers to drive, even endangering safety, as well as the sufferer\u2019s overall quality of life. If left untreated for a long time, cataracts can often cause total blindness. Untreated cataracts can also become \u201chyper-mature,\u201d a condition that makes them more difficult to remove and more likely to cause complications of cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is usually safe and rarely causes complications. However, it is not impossible for complications from cataract surgery to occur, including: Eye inflammation. This complication usually occurs when the sufferer has a large or thick cataract. Light sensitivity. When this condition persists, it may be due to dryness or inflammation. Photopsia, or seeing flashes of light or floaters. This condition occurs when the gel inside the eye separates from the retina. Photopsia is common and usually resolves within a few months. Macular edema. This is caused by a buildup of fluid in the macula, the central part of the retina at the back of the eye. Ptosis, or drooping eyelid. This complication can occur due to surgical trauma. Intraocular lens dislocation. This occurs when a new (intraocular) lens implant is not properly seated in the eye\u2019s capsular bag, which holds it in place or is dislocated. Torn or detached retina. This is more likely to occur in younger sufferers and is the result of the retina pulling away from the back of the eye. Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) or a second cataract, can occur because cataract surgery removes the front part of the lens but leaves the back in place. Cataract Prevention Some efforts that can be made to prevent cataracts include: Have your eyes checked regularly by an eye specialist. Protect your eyes from impact and prolonged exposure to sunlight by using glasses that protect against ultraviolet rays, both UVA and UVB. Manage other health problems, such as diabetes, that can increase the risk of cataracts. Limit the habit of driving at night. Improve lighting in the house. Using a magnifying glass when reading. Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption Implement a diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables. When to See a Doctor? If some of the cataract symptoms above appear and become increasingly disturbing or worsen, so that the sufferer feels pain in the eyes or has difficulty carrying out daily activities, it is a good idea to immediately see an eye specialist for further examination and treatment.",

        "title": "3 Diets That Can Do More Harm Than Good For Women With PCOS, Nutritionist Shares",
        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is one of the most common hormonal problems among women of reproductive age. In this condition, women may experience symptoms such as irregular or missed periods, fertility problems, excessive hair growth - especially on the face - and acne. If you are suffering from PCOS or have recently been diagnosed with it, you'll know how challenging it can be. While there is no permanent cure for this condition, the good news is that you can manage it. How? By taking charge and being more mindful of your dietary practices. However, many start following diets without knowing if they're really good for their condition. Are you also feeling confused about what to eat and what not to? Recently, nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary took to her Instagram handle to clear this confusion and share the three worst diets for women with PCOS.Also Read: What To Drink For PCOS: 5 Quick And Easy Herbal Drinks Shared By Ayurvedic Expert Here Are 3 Worst Diets For Women With PCOS, According To The Nutritionist: 1. Intermittent Fasting Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a popular diet in recent times. In this, you are required to alternate between eating and fasting periods. While it may work well for some, Rashi recommends avoiding it if you have PCOS. She explains, \"If you're going to do intermittent fasting every single day, and not cyclically, it's going to raise your cortisol levels and bring down your progesterone.\" When this happens, it can mess up your hormones and worsen your condition. 2. Low Calorie Diet Low-calorie diets are great for losing weight, but not for people with PCOS. According to Rashi, eating low-calorie foods like salads all the time can do more harm than good. In fact, it can make your condition worse. This is because your body may go into survival mode, instead of focusing on thriving processes like ovulation. You may be getting your period, but this does not necessarily mean you are ovulating. Therefore, it's essential to fulfil your recommended daily calorie intake, which is about 1600 to 2400 calories a day. 3. All Fruit Diet Do you resort to having fruits all the time, thinking they are healthy? Well, this is exactly why you're unable to manage your symptoms, especially if you have insulin-resistant PCOS. For the unversed, this specific type of PCOS is caused by blood sugar dysregulation. The nutritionist explains that eating too many fruits at once can cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar levels. So, while you think you're eating healthy, it can worsen your hormones. If you want balanced hormones, start with balanced blood sugar levels.Also Read:Should You Avoid Dairy If You Have PCOS? Expert Weighs In Watch the full video below: View this post on Instagram So, What Type Of Foods Should You Eat For PCOS Management? Now that you know what to avoid for PCOS, you must be wondering what to eat. To begin with, make sure to enrich your diet with high-fibre and high-protein foods. This includes all types of fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens. Protein-rich foods, on the other hand, will help promote satiety and improve insulin sensitivity. Along with this, you must also include omega-3 fatty acids in your diet since they can help improve fertility, regulate hormones, and even reduce facial hair growth. When trying to manage PCOS, your focus should be on following a well-balanced diet, not a strict one. PCOS can be managed by making the right dietary choices.

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Peppermint Tea",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Peppermint Tea: Peppermint, a cross between watermint and spearmint, is native to Europe and Asia. For thousands of years, people have used it for its pleasant, minty taste and numerous health benefits. The essential oil found in peppermint is menthol, which gives the plant its cooling properties and recognizable minty scent.Peppermint tea is generally sweet and free of caffeine. Many studies have shown that peppermint tea may have health benefits such as improving digestion, boosting focus, and relieving migraine. Peppermint tea is typically consumed as a beverage. Let us read some of the possible benefits of drinking peppermint tea below.5 Health Benefits of Ginger TeaFollowing are some of the top health benefits of peppermint tea.1. Alleviates Digestive Problems: Peppermint may help alleviate digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and indigestion. This is because peppermint relaxes the digestive system and eases pain. Additionally, some animal studies indicate that peppermint can prevent smooth muscle contractions, which can help relieve spasms in the gut. While there are no studies on peppermint tea and digestion, experts believe that the tea may have similar health benefits.2. Relieves Headaches and Migraines: Peppermint, known for its muscle-relaxing and pain-relieving properties, has the potential to alleviate certain types of headaches. The menthol found in peppermint oil stimulates blood flow and offers a cooling sensation, which may contribute to pain relief. While there is limited scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of peppermint tea in relaxing muscles and reducing headache pain through its aroma, applying peppermint oil directly to the temples may provide some relief.7 Health Benefits of Rosemary Tea3. Prevents Menstrual Cramps: According to a study published in 2016, peppermint oil capsules were found to be equally effective in reducing menstrual pain as mefenamic acid, a common over-the-counter pain medication. The research team tested the effectiveness of peppermint oil on 127 young women with dysmenorrhea and found some promising results. Some people also consume peppermint tea as a home remedy for menstrual cramping.4. Alleviates Nasal Congestion: Although consuming peppermint tea won't cure a cold on its own, the menthol scent of the mint combined with the steam from the tea could help clear your nasal passages if you have a blocked nose.7 Health Benefits of Black Tea5. Prevents Bad Breath: Peppermint not only has a refreshing flavor, but its antibacterial qualities may also aid in eliminating the microorganisms that are causing the mouth odor. It's also said to prevent a film of bacteria from accumulating on your teeth, maintaining the health of your whites.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "10 Health Benefits Of Adding Lemons To Your Daily Diet",
        "text": "Lemons are small, bright yellow citrus fruits known for their sour taste and high vitamin C content. They are incredibly healthy due to their rich supply of antioxidants, particularly vitamin C, which strengthens the immune system, aids in collagen production, and promotes skin health. Lemons also contain fibre and beneficial plant compounds that support digestion, weight management, and heart health by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Consuming lemons daily can boost hydration, enhance nutrient absorption, detoxify the body, and even prevent kidney stones. Their versatile nutrients make them a simple but powerful addition to a healthy diet. In this article, we discuss in detail how consuming lemons daily can boost your health. Here's how lemons can boost your overall well-being 1. Rich source of vitamin C Lemons are packed with vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and protects against colds and flu. Vitamin C also helps repair tissues, promotes collagen production, and strengthens the skin. 2. Improves digestive health Lemon juice stimulates the production of digestive juices like bile, helping to improve digestion. Its acidic nature also helps break down food more effectively and relieves symptoms of indigestion, such as bloating and heartburn. 3. Aids in weight loss Lemons are low in calories and high in fibre, particularly pectin, which can help you feel fuller for longer and reduce cravings. Drinking lemon water before meals can support portion control and weight management. 4. Promotes hydration Adding lemon to water encourages you to drink more, helping to maintain hydration throughout the day. Staying hydrated improves metabolism, energy levels, and overall cellular function. 5. Boosts heart health The vitamin C and plant compounds in lemons help lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Consuming lemons regularly can reduce the risk of heart disease by improving vascular health and preventing artery blockage. 6. Supports skin health Lemon's antioxidant properties protect the skin from free radical damage, which can cause premature aging. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, helping to keep the skin firm, reduce wrinkles, and heal wounds. 7. Helps detoxify the body Lemons act as a natural diuretic, promoting urination and helping flush out toxins from the body. This detoxifying effect supports kidney health and helps maintain overall detoxification through the liver. 8. Prevents kidney stones The citric acid in lemons increases urinary citrate levels, which helps prevent the formation of kidney stones. Drinking lemon water regularly can dilute urine, reducing the risk of stone formation. 9. Boosts iron absorption Lemons enhance the absorption of non-heme iron, the type of iron found in plant-based foods. Adding lemon juice to meals can improve iron uptake, reducing the risk of iron deficiency anaemia. 10. Supports oral health The antibacterial properties of lemons can help fight bacteria in the mouth, reducing the risk of gum disease and bad breath. However, due to their acidity, lemons should be consumed in moderation to avoid tooth enamel erosion. Adding lemons to your daily diet provides a wide range of health benefits.

        "title": "Facts about sea turtles you need to know",
        "text": "Sea turtles are ancient and vital creatures, having lived in the world\u2019s oceans for over 100 million years. Found in warm and temperate seas, they play a crucial role in maintaining marine ecosystems. However, sea turtles face increasing threats from climate change, habitat destruction, and human activities. Their unique life cycle and migratory patterns make them particularly vulnerable, yet they remain symbols of resilience. Every year on June 16, \u2018World Sea Turtle Day\u2019 is celebrated to raise awareness about the conservation efforts needed to protect these magnificent animals and highlight their importance to ocean health. Fascinating facts about sea turtlesLife expectancy of 80 yearsSea turtles have an impressive lifespan, with many species living between 50 and 80 years. They take two to three decades to mature, and once they do, they remain actively reproductive for about 10 years. Sand temperature determines their genderThe temperature of the sand where sea turtles lay their eggs plays a crucial role in determining the sex of the hatchlings. Cooler sand temperatures produce male sea turtles, while warmer sand tends to result in females. This temperature-based sex determination is sensitive to climate change, impacting future turtle populations.Florida faces a shortage of male sea turtlesDue to record-high temperatures in Florida, the sands where sea turtles nest have become significantly hotter. This has led to an alarming trend where most eggs are hatching as females, resulting in a growing shortage of males. Sea turtles migrate thousands of milesSea turtles are known for their remarkable migrations. The leatherback turtle, for example, travels more than 10,000 miles annually across the Pacific Ocean. Loggerhead turtles have been tracked migrating from Japan to Baja, covering around 8,000 miles. These long-distance migrations are essential for feeding, breeding, and survival.They play a vital role in ocean ecosystemsSea turtles are essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. They graze on seagrass beds and coral reefs, preventing overgrowth and promoting biodiversity. By controlling jellyfish and crustacean populations, sea turtles help balance the food web. Their presence ensures the health of the oceans, benefiting many other species.Their shells cannot retractUnlike land turtles, sea turtles cannot retract their heads or flippers into their shells. This makes them more vulnerable to predators like sharks and killer whales. Hatchlings and eggs face even greater threats from animals such as raccoons and seabirds, making protection crucial for their survival in the wild.Human activities pose major threatsHuman activity is a significant threat to sea turtles. Coastal development reduces nesting sites, while artificial light disorients hatchlings, leading them away from the ocean. Plastic pollution also presents a major danger, with many sea turtles mistaking debris for food, which often results in fatal blockages or entanglement.There are only 6.5 million sea turtles leftThe current global sea turtle population is estimated at 6.5 million, with most species classified as endangered or critically endangered. This decline is primarily due to habitat loss, illegal hunting, and accidental capture in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are critical to prevent further decline and to protect these iconic marine species.Hawksbill and Kemp\u2019s Ridley turtles are critically endangeredHawksbill turtles, known for their striking shells, have a population of only about 57,000 individuals, making them critically endangered. Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles, another critically endangered species, are even rarer, with just around 10,000 individuals left. Both species are under severe threat from climate change and human activities.Sea turtles thrived during the COVID-19 pandemicDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced human activity on beaches gave sea turtles a break from disturbances. In Florida, where around 400,000 sea turtle nests were recorded in 2019, researchers found improved nesting success during lockdowns in 2020. Fewer beachgoers and less waste allowed turtles to thrive without human interference.Sea turtles have existed for over 100 million yearsSea turtles are among the oldest creatures on Earth, having existed for more than 100 million years. They have survived drastic changes in the planet\u2019s climate and ecosystem over millennia. However, their ability to adapt is being tested by the accelerated pace of modern climate change and human impacts on the oceans.They can hold their breath for hoursSea turtles are highly adapted to life in the ocean and can hold their breath for up to five hours when resting. When active, they surface every few minutes for air. This ability is essential for their long dives, especially when they are feeding or avoiding predators in the deep sea.Excellent navigation skillsThey use the Earth's magnetic fields to navigate thousands of miles, returning to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs.Sea turtles help combat climate changeBy grazing on seagrass beds, sea turtles play a role in regulating the ocean\u2019s carbon cycle. Seagrasses absorb carbon dioxide and store it, helping mitigate the effects of climate change. The health of these underwater meadows depends on sea turtles, as they prevent overgrowth and maintain biodiversity in marine ecosystems.Conservation efforts Many organisations and governments are working to protect sea turtles through measures like reducing bycatch in fisheries, protecting nesting sites, and banning plastic waste. The Sea Turtle Conservation Project, in particular, aims to protect species such as the Olive Ridley turtle. Launched in 1999 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in collaboration with the UNDP, it focuses on Indian coastal states, particularly Orissa. It uses satellite technology to monitor nesting areas, safeguard breeding habitats, and promote collaboration at national and international levels for turtle conservation efforts.Also read: Why does Octopus have blue blood?",

        "title": "Celiac Disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Celiac Disease Celiac disease is a serious autoimmune disease. It occurs in people with a genetic condition where gluten consumption causes damage to the small intestine. Celiac is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide, but only about 30 percent are diagnosed. Celiac Disease Symptoms The symptoms are not the same as food allergies. When accidentally ingesting food containing gluten, the person will experience intestinal problems such as diarrhea, excessive gas, and constipation. Other symptoms seen in sufferers include: Stomach ache. Nauseous. Anemia. Rash or dermatitis herpetiformis). Loss of bone density. Headache or general fatigue. Bone or joint pain. Mouth ulcers. Weight loss. Heartburn. In children, they are at risk of experiencing intestinal problems than adults. Symptoms are characterized by: Nausea or vomiting. Bloating or swelling in the stomach. Diarrhea. Constipation. Too much fat in the stool (steatorrhea). Weight loss. Risk Factors for Celiac Disease Celiac is at high risk for the following groups: Having a family history of Celiac or dermatitis herpetiformis. Having type 1 diabetes. Having Down syndrome or Turner syndrome. Having autoimmune thyroid disease. Having Addison\u2019s disease. Causes of Celiac Disease It is not yet known exactly what causes Celiac. This disease triggers a reaction from the immune system to gluten by damaging the small hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine. Damaged villi prevent the body from getting essential nutrients from food. Celiac Disease Diagnosis Celiac diagnosis is done with the following steps: Serology tests. These tests look for antibodies in the blood. Elevated levels of certain antibody proteins indicate an immune reaction to gluten. Genetic testing. Testing is done with human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) to rule out celiac disease. If the test results indicate celiac disease, your doctor will likely do further testing by: Endoscopy. This procedure uses a long tube with a tiny camera on the end. The camera allows the doctor to see the small intestine and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to analyze damage to the villi. Capsule endoscopy. This procedure uses a small wireless camera to take pictures of the entire small intestine. The camera is inside a vitamin capsule that is swallowed. As the capsule travels through the digestive tract, the camera takes pictures of the condition of the intestine. Celiac Disease Treatment Celiac treatment can be done with the following steps: Gluten-Free Diet These are the foods that sufferers need to avoid Wheat. Barley. Wheat. Potato flour. Malt. Semolina. Triticale. Bread. Pasta. Cereals. Spell. Gluten can be hidden in foods, medicines, and non-food products, including: Modified food starch, preservatives, and food stabilizers. Prescription and over-the-counter medications. Vitamin and mineral supplements. Herbal and nutritional supplements. Lipstick products. Toothpaste and mouthwash. Envelopes and stamp glue. Play-doh. Vitamin and Mineral Supplements The use of supplements is done in patients with anemia or severe nutritional deficiencies. Supplements consumed include: Copper. Folate. Iron. Vitamin B-12. Vitamin D Vitamin K. Zinc. Complications of Celiac Disease Untreated Celiac Disease can cause: Malnutrition. This occurs when the small intestine cannot absorb enough nutrients from food. Malnutrition causes anemia and weight loss. In children, malnutrition causes growth retardation and short stature. Weakening of bones. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D causes softening of bones (osteomalacia or rickets) in children and loss of bone density (osteopenia or osteoporosis) in adults. Infertility and miscarriage. Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D causes reproductive problems. Lactose intolerance. Damage to the small intestine causes abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating or drinking dairy products containing lactose. Cancer. People who do not maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer. Nervous system problems. Some people experience seizures or nerve disease in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Celiac Disease Prevention Prevention is done by reducing the risk. These are the steps that can be taken: During pregnancy, stick to a gluten-free diet. Gluten consumption during pregnancy activates the disease and causes malabsorption of nutrients in both mother and fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage. Genetic testing for babies. If the baby tests positive for Celiac, antibody blood tests should be done after the child is 3 years old and every two to three years thereafter. Breastfeeding for at least six months. Based on research, delayed symptoms among infants at risk of Celiac disease who are breastfed for at least 6 months, can occur. Introduce gluten slowly after the child is between 4 and 6 months old. Adding gluten to children while breastfeeding lowers the risk of Celiac disease after they are 2 years old. Mothers who breastfeed their children after adding gluten to their diet reduce the risk of their children developing Celiac disease later in life.",

        "title": "Chagas disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Chagas disease is a zoonotic disease transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans and vice versa. This disorder causes inflammation and infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a type of parasite in the form of insects, such as fleas and cockroaches. Therefore, Chagas disease is often referred to as the kissing bug. The insects that spread the parasite that causes Chagas disease are from the genus Triatoma, including Triatoma infestans, Rhodnius prolixus, and Panstrongyius megistus. The disease is more common in South America, Central America, and Mexico, where the triatomine insects originate. This disease can infect everyone without exception. If not treated immediately, Chagas disease can cause serious heart and digestive problems. In someone who has acute disease, the parasite needs to be destroyed. But if the disorder is chronic, the treatment that needs to be done is to manage the symptoms and prevent the infection from spreading. Chagas Disease Symptoms A person who has Chagas disease will experience a number of symptoms, namely: Fever Fatigue Pain in the body Headache Rash Loss of appetite Diarrhea Vomiting Swelling of the eyelids In general, these symptoms will last for several weeks or even longer but can disappear on their own. However, it is advisable to see a doctor if Chagas disease symptoms recur or if you have just returned from a country with high exposure to the T. cruzi parasite. By immediately checking yourself with a doctor, Chagas disease can be treated quickly. Chagas Disease Risk Factors Some factors that can increase a person\u2019s risk of developing Chagas disease include: Receiving a blood transfusion or organ transplant from a person with the disease. Consuming raw food that has been contaminated with the parasite or eating undercooked meat from infected animals. Pregnant women who are infected can transmit the disease to the fetus in the womb. Living in rural areas with poor sanitation or living in countries with high exposure to the T. cruzi parasite, such as Central America, South America and Mexico. Living in a housing complex that has triatomine insects. Travelers visiting countries with high exposure to the disease. Spending time in a forest filled with wild animals that may be infected. Causes of Chagas Disease The most common cause of Chagas disease is the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of an insect called a triatomine. The insect can become infected with T. cruzi when it ingests the blood of an animal infected with the parasite. These insects usually bite humans while they are sleeping. Infected insects defecate after feeding and leave parasites on the skin. The most commonly bitten parts of the body are areas with thin skin, such as the eyes or mouth. After that, the parasite enters the body through the eyes, mouth, cuts or scratches, or insect bites. Scratching or rubbing the bite area can cause the parasite to enter the body. Once inside the body, the parasite multiplies and eventually spreads. Chagas Disease Diagnosis The doctor will first perform a physical examination, such as asking about the symptoms experienced and other factors that can increase the risk of contracting Chagas disease. If you experience symptoms of Chagas disease, a blood test may be needed to confirm the presence of the T. cruzi parasite or the levels of proteins produced by the immune system (antibodies) to fight the parasite in your blood. If diagnosed with Chagas disease, it is recommended to undergo several additional tests to determine whether the disease is already in the chronic phase and has the potential to cause heart or digestive complications. These supporting tests include: Electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor heart activity. Chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged. Echocardiogram to see if there are changes in the heart or its function. Abdominal X-ray to look for changes in the colon. Endoscopy. Chagas Disease Treatment In the early stages, Chagas disease is quite easy to cure. Treatment focuses on killing the T.cruzi parasite by taking benznidazole and nifurtimox. These drugs must be taken for 2 months. Treatment will be effective if the drugs are taken as soon as possible after infection. This disease needs to be treated immediately so that it does not enter the chronic phase because the medicine cannot cure the disease. However, this medicine can slow its development and minimize serious complications. In addition, some additional treatments may be needed depending on the signs and symptoms that arise, such as: Heart-related complications require taking medications, a pacemaker, or the use of other devices to ensure the heart remains healthy. Complications related to treatment require changes in diet, consumption of drugs, corticosteroids, and others. Chagas Disease Complications If Chagas disease has progressed to the chronic phase, serious heart or digestive complications can occur. These may include: Heart failure. Enlargement of the esophagus (megaesophagus). Enlargement of the large intestine (megacolon). Chagas Disease Prevention Chagas disease is a dangerous disease. However, you can avoid this disease by doing some preventive measures such as the following: Spray the inside and around the house with insecticide. Do not stay in muddy areas, filled with straw, or in shacks for long periods of time. Put up a mosquito net on the bed. Using mosquito repellent lotion. Maintain food hygiene and storage. Checking donor blood, organs, cells, and tissues before receiving a transfusion. Perform routine uterine check-ups to avoid transmitting this disease to your child. Do not consume raw foods. When to See a Doctor? If you have just visited a country that has a high risk of Chagas disease and are experiencing symptoms, it is a good idea to get checked immediately.",

        "title": "Kidney Disease Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What is Kidney Disease? Kidney disease is one of the medical conditions that are prone to occur so you should be aware of it. The kidneys are two organs shaped like red beans that are located on either side of the upper back of the body, right under the human ribs. The function of the kidneys includes producing renin, an enzyme that regulates blood pressure. In addition, the kidneys also produce erythropoietin compounds that function to stimulate red blood cell production. This organ also functions to filter the body\u2019s metabolic waste. Even healthy kidneys can keep the salt and mineral levels balanced in the body. No less important, the kidneys are able to produce active compounds from vitamin D so that bone health is maintained. When the kidneys are damaged, the body\u2019s metabolic waste will cause swelling in the ankles, vomiting, shortness of breath and lack of sleep. Symptoms of Kidney Disease In fact, the symptoms of kidney disease that appear in each sufferer will be different. This is because of the different types of kidney disease that individuals experience. In fact, some of them do not show any symptoms at the beginning of this condition. Therefore, it is better to know more about the health symptoms associated with kidney disease. Here are the early signs and symptoms that everyone should be aware of: You will experience fatigue, lack of energy, and even difficulty concentrating. Having trouble sleeping. Changes in skin health that become drier and itchier. Experiencing increased frequency of urination. There is blood in the urine. Urine that is foamy and has a pungent odor. Not only that, urine also has a very dark color. Experiencing persistent swelling in the eye area. Swollen ankles and feet. Experiencing decreased appetite. More frequent muscle pain or cramps. In addition to the above symptoms, there are also some Often Ignored Symptoms of Kidney Disease. It is important to immediately recognize and ask a doctor if there are any suspicious complaints or signs. Kidney Disease Risk Factors People with diabetes are at higher risk of developing kidney disease. In fact, diabetes is the main cause of this condition. However, the risk of kidney disease also increases in individuals with the following conditions: Have high blood pressure. Have high cholesterol levels. Smoking habit. Have other family members with a history of kidney disease. Elderly, over 65 years old. Research shows that this condition is more common in people of African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian descent. In addition, this condition is also often associated with other medical conditions, such as: Blockage of blood vessels in the arms or legs. Suffering from diabetes or sugar disease. High blood pressure or hypertension. Suffering from heart failure. Currently undergoing intensive care in hospital due to a serious illness. Suffering from liver disease. Types of Kidney Disease This condition consists of several different types. Here are the types of kidney disease that often occur: 1. Chronic kidney disease or chronic kidney failure Experts also often refer to this disease as chronic kidney failure. This disease occurs when kidney function is gradually lost. When this condition occurs, the body will slowly accumulate waste or substances that the body does not need. Over time it can cause health problems in other organs. 2. Acute kidney disease This type of kidney disease is a sudden decline in kidney function. There are a number of causes that can trigger acute kidney disease. Starting from lack of fluid and blood, injury to the kidneys, or blockages that cause fluid to return to the kidneys. 3. Kidney stones This condition is indicated by the formation of solid objects or gravel in one or both kidneys. Usually, this condition occurs due to high levels of certain minerals in the urine. 4. Kidney infection Doctors also call this condition pyelonephritis. This condition can occur due to an untreated urinary tract infection. As a result, bacteria move towards the kidneys and cause infection. 5. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes cysts to appear in the kidneys. 6. Glomerulonephritis Disorders of the glomerulus or glomerulonephritis are conditions when the kidneys become inflamed. The glomerulus is a part of the kidney organ that plays a role in filtering waste materials, as well as removing excess fluids and electrolytes from the body. Glomerulonephritis can occur in a short time (acute) or long-term (chronic). For the cause, glomerulonephritis can occur due to many factors. For example, such as infection, autoimmune disease, or as an impact of inflammation that attacks blood vessels. Causes of Kidney Disease The causes of this condition will vary depending on the type. For example, the causes are: The kidneys do not have enough blood flow. There is direct damage to the kidneys. Kidney tissue damage due to drugs or severe infection (sepsis). Have a history of chronic kidney disease. Obstruction of urine from the kidneys. Meanwhile, chronic or long-term kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition damages kidney function. This condition eventually causes kidney damage to worsen over months or years. Meanwhile, diseases or conditions that cause chronic kidney disease can include type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as high blood pressure. Kidney Disease Diagnosis Immediately visit the nearest hospital when you experience some health problems related to kidney disease. There are several examinations that you can do to find out the condition of your kidneys, such as: Blood tests , usually these tests are to filter waste from the blood by estimating the glomerular filtration rate or eGFR. A doctor can also perform a urine test to determine the health condition of your kidneys. Kidney biopsy is a procedure where a specialist doctor takes a tissue sample from the kidney to then examine in detail in the laboratory. USG, to get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe current condition of the kidneys and detect other disorders, such as tumors or cysts. Kidney Disease Treatment Treatment for this condition will also depend on the type and cause of the disease. However, treatment generally aims to relieve symptoms and reduce the condition from getting worse. There are several treatments that doctors can recommend for sufferers, such as: Use of medications. For example, the use of ACE inhibitors to help control blood pressure and protein in the urine. In addition, the use of antibiotics can also be prescribed by doctors to inhibit bacterial growth. Kidney stone crushing to treat large kidney stones. Dialysis that lasts for 3-5 hours with a frequency of about 3 times per week. Surgical procedures to remove kidney stones or polycystic kidneys and kidney transplantation. In addition to these treatment options, doctors will also recommend that sufferers of this condition live a healthy lifestyle to ease kidney function. Efforts to implement a healthy lifestyle are: Limit your intake of foods high in salt, sugar, and cholesterol. Routinely check for diseases you have. For example, diabetes, hypertension, and autoimmune diseases. Increase your consumption of water. Limit consumption of alcoholic beverages. If you smoke, people with kidney disease need to stop this habit immediately. Increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Exercise regularly. Kidney Disease Cure Rate The cure of this condition will actually depend on the type. For example, in chronic kidney failure, this disease cannot be completely cured. However, treatment, medical care, and the implementation of the right lifestyle can help people with this disease to carry out normal activities and extend their life expectancy. Meanwhile, for cases of acute kidney failure which usually occurs temporarily, appropriate medical treatment and care can restore or improve kidney function. Kidney Disease Prevention Immediately check the condition of the kidney stones by visiting a doctor to do some tests. Do a urine test first to check for infections and stones in the urine. And do a blood test to make sure the kidneys are functioning properly. There are also preventive measures to reduce the risk of getting this disease, such as: Follow the directions for use. When using over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, follow the directions on the package. Taking too much or too often can cause kidney damage. Maintain ideal body weight. Make sure to exercise regularly and adopt a healthy diet. Read more about recommended exercise times at: Note, This is a Good Exercise Time for Health . Don\u2019t smoke. Smoking can damage your kidneys and worsen existing kidney damage. Manage your medical conditions well. If you have a disease or condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to manage it. Complications of Kidney Disease Long-term kidney disease can negatively impact almost every part of the body. Possible complications include: Fluid retention, which can cause swelling in the arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). A sudden increase in the level of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia), which can interfere with heart function. Anemia. Heart disease such as coronary heart disease. Weak bones and increased risk of fractures. Decreased sex drive, impotence or decreased fertility. Damage to the central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes, or seizures. Decreased immune response, which makes sufferers more susceptible to infection. Pericarditis, is inflammation of the sac-like membrane that surrounds your heart (pericardium). A pregnancy complication that carries risks to both the mother and the developing fetus. Permanent damage to the kidneys (end-stage renal disease), which ultimately requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms of kidney disease that do not improve, immediately check your health condition with an internal medicine specialist . Remember that proper treatment from the start can reduce the risk of dangerous complications.",

        "title": "Diabetes Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What Is Diabetes (High Blood Sugar)? Diabetes or sugar disease (high blood sugar) is a chronic (long-term) disease that you need to be aware of. The main sign of this disease is an increase in blood sugar (glucose) levels above normal values. This condition occurs when the sufferer\u2019s body is no longer able to take sugar (glucose) into the cells and use it as energy. This condition ultimately results in the accumulation of extra sugar in the body\u2019s bloodstream. Uncontrolled diabetes can have serious consequences, causing damage to various organs and tissues of the body. For example, organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. There are two main types of diabetes, namely type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If explained, here is an explanation of both, namely: Type 1 diabetes. This type is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body\u2019s immune system will attack itself. In this condition, the body will not produce insulin at all. Type 2 diabetes. In this type of diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin or the body cells of people with type 2 diabetes will not respond normally to insulin. Symptoms of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) The symptoms of this health problem will appear differently in each sufferer. Because this condition will depend on the severity and type of diabetes that the sufferer has. However, in general there are several symptoms that will be experienced by sufferers, both type 1 and type 2, namely: Increased thirst. Increased frequency of urination. Easily tired or feeling constantly tired. There are visual disturbances, such as blurred vision. The occurrence of continuous infections in the body, which commonly occur in the gums, skin, and vaginal area (in women). Unexplained weight loss. The presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are byproducts of the breakdown of muscle and fat that occur when there is not enough insulin available). Therefore, immediately check yourself with a doctor if you experience one or more of these symptoms. This aims to ensure that sufferers receive appropriate treatment early on so that the risk of complications from diabetes can be avoided. Risk Factors for High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) There are several risk factors for type 1 diabetes, including: Family history or hereditary factors, namely when someone will have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes if there are family members who suffer from the same disease because it is related to certain genes. Geographical factors, people who live in areas far from the equator, such as Finland and Sardinia, are at risk of developing type 1 diabetes. This is due to the lack of vitamin D that can be obtained from sunlight, which ultimately triggers autoimmune diseases. Age factor. This disease is most often detected in children aged 4\u20137 years, then in children aged 10\u201314 years. Other triggering factors include consuming cow\u2019s milk at too early an age, water containing sodium nitrate, cereals, and gluten before the age of 4 months or after 7 months, having a mother with a history of preeclampsia, and suffering from jaundice at birth. Meanwhile, here are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes, including: Overweight or obesity. High distribution of abdominal fat. Inactive lifestyle and rarely doing activities or exercising. History of type 2 diabetes in the family. Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans have higher rates of disease compared to whites. Age over 45 years, although it is possible that it can occur before the age of 45 years. Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. History of diabetes during pregnancy. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is characterized by irregular menstruation, excessive hair growth, and obesity. Causes of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) Normal blood sugar levels are less than 100 mg/dL. If blood sugar levels have reached 100-125 mg/dL, it means you have entered prediabetes status. Meanwhile, blood sugar levels that reach 126 mg/dL and above are classified as diabetes. High blood sugar levels are known as hyperglycemia. Basically, hyperglycemia is a condition when blood sugar levels increase or are excessive. Meanwhile, diabetes is a disease that is mostly influenced by hyperglycemia. The cause of high blood sugar from diabetes occurs due to disorders in the body. Because this condition makes the body unable to use blood glucose into cells. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood. In type 1 diabetes, this disorder occurs because the immune system, which usually attacks viruses or other harmful bacteria, attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells. As a result, the body lacks or cannot even produce insulin so that the sugar that should be converted into energy by insulin causes a buildup of sugar in the blood. While in type 2 diabetes, the body can produce insulin normally. However, insulin cannot be used normally by the body. This condition is also known as insulin resistance. Diagnosis of High Blood Sugar (Diabetes) The doctor will diagnose this condition in a person by conducting a medical interview. Then, the doctor will also check the glucose levels in a blood test. There are three types of tests that doctors can use to measure blood glucose levels, namely: 1. Fasting blood glucose test For this test, people with diabetes need not eat or drink anything except water (fasting). This fasting is for at least eight hours before the test. Because food can greatly affect blood sugar, this test allows the doctor to see baseline blood sugar. 2. Random blood glucose test This examination can be done randomly by diabetics. Even when you are fasting. 3. A1c This test, also known as HbA1C or glycated hemoglobin test, aims to show a person\u2019s average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. 4. Oral glucose tolerance test In this test, the doctor will measure blood glucose levels after fasting overnight. Then the diabetic will drink a sweet drink. Later, the patient\u2019s blood glucose levels are checked at one, two and three o\u2019clock. In addition, the doctor will also perform blood and urine tests to distinguish whether someone has type 1 or 2 diabetes. Later, the blood will be checked for autoantibodies (autoimmune signs that the body\u2019s immune system is attacking itself). Meanwhile, urine will be checked for ketones (a sign that a person\u2019s body is burning fat as an energy supply). Diabetes Treatment Treatment will be adjusted to the type of diabetes you have. Insulin therapy is one of the treatments that can be done by sufferers of this condition, both type 1 and type 2. In fact, in fairly severe cases of type 1 diabetes, pancreas transplantation may be an option to treat damage to the pancreas. Meanwhile, people with type 2 diabetes will be given several types of medication. However, generally, there are several treatments that must be done to reduce the risk of diabetes, such as: 1. Implement a healthy diet If you have diabetes, you should adjust your diet to a healthy one. Focus on your intake of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Not only that, you also need to consume fiber and reduce certain types of food, such as foods containing saturated fat, processed carbohydrates, and artificial sweeteners. 2. Do physical activity regularly Everyone certainly needs physical activity to maintain optimal health, including people with diabetes. Exercise is one activity that can be done to lower blood sugar levels by converting it into energy. You can choose to do light exercise, such as walking, swimming, or cycling. Make these activities a daily routine to help you avoid your diabetes condition getting worse. Diabetes Medication Recommendations Here are some recommendations for diabetes medications that you can use: Gliabetes 30 mg 10 Tablets. Is a drug containing Pioglitazone HCl to treat type 2 diabetes. Diabemed 24 Capsules. Useful for overcoming and preventing diabetes, as well as lowering the sugar level in the blood and keeping it stable. Inlacin 100 mg 5 Strips (6 Capsules/Strip) \u2013 Save on Bulk Prices. Contains a combination of Lagestroemiaspeciosa and Cinnamomum burmannii to help lower blood glucose levels. Pioglitazone HCl 30 mg 3 Strips (10 Tablets/Strip) \u2013 Routine Medication. It is a tablet medication that is useful in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Amaryl M 1 mg/250 mg 3 Strips (10 Tablets/Strip) \u2013 Routine Medication. Contains a combination of Metformin and Glimepiride which is useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes Prevention Although risk factors such as family history and race cannot be changed, there are other risk factors that can be prevented early through implementing a healthy lifestyle. Here are some healthy lifestyle steps that you can take to prevent this disease, including: Maintain ideal body weight by consuming low-fat foods. Eat high-fiber foods such as fruits and vegetables. Reduce consumption of sweet foods and drinks. Exercise regularly and do lots of physical activity. Reduce the amount of time spent sitting still for too long, such as when watching television. Avoid or quit smoking. Diabetes Complications Complications from this disease will develop gradually. The longer a person has it and the more uncontrolled the disease is, the higher the risk of complications. Ultimately, complications can be disabling or even life-threatening. The following are some possible general complications of diabetes, namely: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes can increase the risk of various problems with the cardiovascular system. These include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Eye damage (retinopathy). Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can cause complications in the form of damage to the retina of the eye, Nerve damage (neuropathy). Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that feed nerves, especially in the feet. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. In addition, diabetes also has the potential to cause kidney damage, sexual dysfunction, and even miscarriage as complications.",

        "title": "5 Health Benefits of Hibiscus Tea",
        "text": "Health Benefits of Hibiscus Tea: Hibiscus, a flowering plant that thrives in warmer climates, produces deep red flowers with a sweet and tart cranberry-like flavor. The part of the hibiscus plant used for making tea is known as the calyx. It protects and supports the flower.Hibiscus has cultural significance in many parts of the world and is generally used in food and traditional medicine. It has been used to treat a wide range of conditions for centuries, including high blood pressure, indigestion, and obesity. Modern science also suggests that there may be other health benefits to using the hibiscus plant, including lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight management. However, more research is required to confirm these findings.5 Health Benefits of Peppermint TeaFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of hibiscus tea.1. Prevents Disease: The Hibiscus plant is rich in many antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, Vitamin C, and anthocyanin. These antioxidants help the body fight off harmful molecules called free radicals. Free radicals are linked to several different diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Although the body's antioxidants fight against the free radical damage, antioxidant-rich foods can also help prevent disease.2. Reduces Inflammation: The anti-inflammatory properties of hibiscus have been demonstrated in several animal and human investigations. Numerous disorders, including cancer, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, are caused by inflammation. It appears that hibiscus may have anti-inflammatory properties, however, more research is required to reach a definitive conclusion.5 Health Benefits of Ginger Tea3. Lowers Blood Pressure: High blood pressure, affecting nearly half of all adults in the United States can lead to severe health issues such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated that drinking hibiscus tea can lower blood pressure in humans. However, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health cautions that hibiscus and other herbal remedies only modestly reduce blood pressure and cannot substitute medications for individuals diagnosed with high blood pressure.4. Lowers Cholesterol: High cholesterol affects millions of adults and can lead to serious health issues such as heart attack and stroke. Although some clinical studies have shown that hibiscus may lower cholesterol levels, others have shown little to no effect. While hibiscus tea may help maintain healthy cholesterol levels, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness.5 Health Benefits of Chamomile Tea5. Promotes Weight Loss: Numerous studies indicate that hibiscus extract, which is more concentrated than hibiscus tea, has a good effect on weight loss, which may help avoid obesity. There isn't any proof, though, that hibiscus tea has the same effect.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Keto Diet Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What Is The Keto Diet? The keto or ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet. This type of diet is useful as a medical treatment and is an effective option for short-term weight loss. This diet has been linked to the treatment of epilepsy. In fact, ketogenic diets can help reduce seizures in people with epilepsy, especially in children who do not respond to medication. The mechanism is not fully understood, but this low-carb, high-fat diet is said to change activity in the brain. Effects that are felt include reducing sensitivity to stimuli that cause seizures. When undergoing a diet, the body produces ketone compounds as the main source. This compound has a protective effect on the body against seizures due to epilepsy. In addition, the keto diet also helps control blood sugar levels and improves mood stability. These conditions also contribute to seizure control. However, further research is needed to confirm these benefits. Benefits of the Keto Diet for Body Health You need to know that the keto diet should not be done long-term by healthy people. However, in general, this type of diet offers a number of benefits, including: 1. Lose weight A study entitled Ketogenic diet for weight loss and its implications on health: A literature study in ResearchGate states that ketogenic is a popular diet pattern for losing weight. The method is by limiting carbohydrate intake to 50 grams per day. This diet is quite effective in helping to lose weight in the short term. The duration itself is less than 6 months. 2. The keto diet is good for people with diabetes and prediabetes Diabetes presents with symptoms such as metabolic changes, high blood sugar, and impaired insulin function. Following a keto diet can help manage these symptoms. This is because the diet helps eliminate excess fat associated with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome. A study in the ACP Journals found that the keto diet can improve insulin sensitivity by up to 75 percent. Additionally, another study in the Journal of Diabetes Research conducted research on women with type 2 diabetes. The study found that following a keto diet for about 90 days significantly reduced hemoglobin A1C levels, a measure of long-term blood sugar management. 3. Reduces the risk of heart disease The keto diet is a diet that increases the intake of healthy fats. This method can reduce the risk of heart disease by improving risk factors. For example, reducing blood pressure, body fat, and blood sugar. A study entitled Effects of ketogenic diets on Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Evidence from Animal and Human Studies in Nutrients states that ketogenic is a useful diet pattern for improving several components of metabolic syndrome. The syndrome causes sufferers to experience a group of health problems simultaneously, one of which is heart disease. By reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome, the potential for heart disease can also be reduced. 4. The keto diet can reduce the intensity of Parkinson\u2019s symptoms. Parkinson\u2019s is a nervous system imbalance disorder that interferes with the body\u2019s ability to control balance and movement. One of the symptoms is slowed body movement. A study in PubMed Central found that the keto diet may help improve symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, more research is needed on these benefits. 5. Other health benefits In addition, following a healthy ketogenic diet can also provide health protection benefits for the body against the following conditions: Cancer. Experts are currently exploring diet as an additional treatment for cancer, as they suspect that diet may help slow tumor growth. Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The keto diet is also said to help reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and slow its progression. Epilepsy. Studies have shown that this diet also plays a role in reducing seizures in children with epilepsy. Polycystic ovary syndrome. Following a ketogenic diet may help reduce insulin levels, which may play a role in polycystic ovary syndrome. However, further research is needed to determine the benefits of the keto diet for these medical conditions. It is always best to discuss the best treatment with a nutritionist. Foods to Eat During the Keto Diet When on a keto diet, you should include fat in every meal. However, the ratio of fat, carbs, and protein can vary from person to person based on age, weight, and medical conditions.

Refined sugar. Included in beverages, such as cola, soda, artificial sweeteners, sugar, honey, and alcohol. Snacks, especially those high in preservatives and containing artificial sweeteners. In addition, you must also avoid high-protein foods, acidic foods, and foods that contain alkaline. How to Start a Keto Diet? Unfortunately, many people still mistake the keto diet with carbs. Both are similar, but not the same. Find out the difference through the article Similar but Not the Same, Here\u2019s the Difference Between the Carb and Keto Diets. If you\u2019re just starting a ketogenic diet, here are some things to keep in mind: 1. Pay attention to your intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. First, you have to limit your carbohydrate intake, consume moderate amounts of protein, and consume high amounts of fat per day. This makes the body burn fat as its main fuel source and break it down into \u2018ketones\u2019 in a process called ketosis. A person on a keto diet should consume 20 grams to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day, or less. For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates is equivalent to 2 slices of bread and a banana. The reason is that carbohydrates make up about a tenth of the daily kilojoule intake on the keto diet. This way, the body remains in a constant state of ketosis. A kilojoule itself is a measure of how much energy the body gets from food. 2. Maintain body intake Ketosis is a condition where the body lacks carbohydrate intake to be converted into energy. When experiencing ketosis, the kidneys will work harder to remove more fluids and electrolytes. Therefore, make sure to consume sodium and potassium intake, and drink plenty of water while on the keto diet. 3. Pay attention to the duration of the keto diet How long is the keto diet actually? This type of diet is good for you to do in the short term, namely for 2 to 3 months. The maximum limit is 6 to 12 months. The practice not only reduces body weight but also improves health. If you are just starting to try this diet, induction is the first phase that you must go through. The method is, stop eating at 8 pm and eat again the next day at 12 noon. This induction phase lasts for 7 days. 4. Discipline in implementing the keto diet Don\u2019t forget, make sure you are disciplined and consistent in following this diet. Pay attention to all the rules, including reducing carbohydrate and sugar intake. If you continue to consume carbohydrate and sugar intake, then the diet will not work. This is because fat in the body cannot be transmitted into energy. 5. The emergence of keto flu symptoms When in the induction phase, keto dieters may experience keto flu. This condition appears with symptoms of weakness and dizziness. The disorder occurs because the body is adjusting to the loss of carbohydrates. Later, the body will start to get used to burning fat as an energy source. 6. Pay attention to health history If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, gallbladder problems, or other chronic illnesses, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting a keto diet. 7. Write a food menu During the induction phase, you should only include 20 grams of carbohydrates in your body. As for fat intake, you can get it from beef, chicken, turkey, and steak, not processed foods such as sausages, nuggets, and meatballs. 8. Pay attention to protein intake The standard protein requirement is normally around 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. Meanwhile, keto dieters need a higher protein intake. The amount is around 1.5 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. 9. Pay attention to calorie intake In addition to high protein, you also have to pay attention to your calorie intake. Usually, the number of calories your body needs is around 2,000 kilocalories with a composition of 55 to 60 percent fat from the total food you consume. Note that calorie intake should not exceed the recommended limit, because it can increase fat stores in the body. Similar to protein, the body will store excess fat in the form of lipoproteins. 10. Avoid eating starchy vegetables Next, avoid consuming starchy vegetables. This includes potatoes, corn, peas, pumpkin, and beans. This step aims to keep participants in a state of ketosis. 11. Increase your egg intake Eggs are one of the best foods for keto dieters. This type of food is high in protein and contains healthy fats that can support the weight loss process. However, pay attention to how to process it. You can fry it with olive oil that contains healthy fats. In addition, you can also boil it and make it as a salad or sandwich topping. 12. Cook your own food By cooking your own food, you will not consume excessive carbohydrates. You are free to reduce or increase the right intake so that the diet gives optimal results. 13. Know the side effects The side effects of undergoing a keto diet that may occur are not limited to keto flu. You are also at risk of experiencing digestive disorders, such as bloating, constipation, and frequent farting. These problems arise because the body\u2019s fiber intake is not met. 14. Be patient to get the results During the first week, your body will experience effects that may make you uncomfortable. For example, dizziness and weakness. However, the process will be visible for several weeks afterward. So, be patient to get maximum results. Who Can\u2019t Do The Keto Diet? Although effective in helping to lose weight, there are groups of people who should not do this diet, including: 1. People with cardiovascular risk Ketogenic is done by consuming high-fat foods. This is dangerous for groups of people with a history of cardiovascular problems. Because this diet can increase the risk of heart failure. 2. Pregnant women Pregnant women who only consume certain foods are at risk of experiencing nutritional deficiencies that are useful for fetal growth and development. Not only that, this diet can also cause babies to be born with low birth weight. 3. People with digestive disorders Ketogenic is a low-fiber diet. This diet is certainly not suitable for people with digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The impact can range from nutritional deficiencies to decreased quality of life. 4. People at risk of osteoporosis The ketogenic process in the body also causes a decrease in bone mineral levels. This can certainly increase the risk of osteoporosis which triggers bone fractures, thus reducing the quality of life of sufferers. 5. People with diabetes Ketogenic can indeed help control blood sugar and insulin levels. However, this diet pattern is not suitable for sufferers who are undergoing insulin treatment. This is because this process can cause a drastic decrease in blood sugar which can be fatal. Is Keto Diet Safe for Health? This diet is generally safe for most healthy people. However, some people may experience some side effects at first, especially as their bodies adjust. Some side effects of the keto diet are: Lack of energy. Poor mental function. Sleep disorders. Nauseous. Digestion feels uncomfortable. Decreased physical performance. These effects are temporary and may subside over time. However, if you follow the keto diet long-term, side effects can include: Low protein in the blood. Excess fat in the liver. Kidney stones. Micronutrient deficiencies. To avoid this, you can try a low-carb diet regularly for the first few weeks. This will make your body burn more fat before you completely eliminate carbohydrates. In addition, the keto diet can also change the body\u2019s water and mineral balance. So, try adding extra salt to your food or taking a mineral supplement. When you first start the keto diet, you may want to eat until you are full and avoid restricting your calories too strictly. Usually, the keto diet can help you lose weight without having to intentionally restrict calories.",

        "text": "What is Bell\u2019s Palsy? Bell\u2019s palsy is a temporary weakness that occurs on one side of the facial muscles. The side of the face affected by Bell\u2019s palsy will usually appear to droop. Generally, this condition occurs in pregnant women, people with diabetes, and HIV. This nerve condition is often misunderstood as cerebral palsy, or the meaning is often confused. In fact, Bell\u2019s palsy and cerebral palsy are two different conditions. Bell\u2019s palsy is a condition where damaged nerves in the face affect the sense of taste and the way the body produces tears and saliva. Bell\u2019s palsy usually comes on suddenly and gets better within a few weeks. Meanwhile, cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect muscle movement and coordination. The condition occurs due to damage to the immature and developing brain, and most often occurs before birth. In many cases, cerebral palsy also affects vision, hearing, and sensation. Bell\u2019s palsy will cause one-half of the face to appear to droop. Smiles can only be done on one side, and the eye on the affected side refuses to close. This condition is also known as acute peripheral facial paralysis, the cause of which is unknown, and can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown, but many experts believe the condition is the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Or it may be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. Bells Palsy Symptoms Bell palsy causes different symptoms in each sufferer. Symptoms of paralysis that occur on one side of the face can be divided into two types, namely: Partial paralysis (mild muscle weakness). Total paralysis (no movement at all, but this is very rare). Bell\u2019s palsy also affects the sufferer\u2019s mouth and eyelids, making it difficult for these two parts to open and close. The following are the symptoms of Bell\u2019s palsy that you need to know: Ear pain on the paralyzed side of the face. The affected ear will be more sensitive to sound. Ringing in one or both ears. Decreased or changed sense of taste. The affected part of the mouth will drool easily. Mouth feels dry. Pain around the jaw. Headache and dizziness. Difficulty eating, drinking, and speaking. Bell\u2019s palsy is a disorder that occurs in the muscles and nerves of the face, so this condition does not impact the performance of the brain and other parts of the body. If paralysis on one side of the face is also accompanied by paralysis in other parts of the body, the sufferer really needs serious treatment from a doctor. Risk Factors A link was found between migraines and weakness in the face and limbs. A 2015 study revealed that people who suffer from migraines may be at higher risk of developing Bell\u2019s Palsy. In addition, Bell\u2019s Palsy is more common in: People aged 15-60 years. Those who have diabetes or upper respiratory disease. Pregnant women, especially in the third trimester. Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold Recurrent attacks of Bell\u2019s palsy are rare. However, in some cases, there is a family history of recurrent attacks, suggesting the possibility of a genetic predisposition to Bell\u2019s palsy. Causes of Bells Palsy Until now, experts do not know for sure the cause of Bell\u2019s Palsy. However, they suspect that this condition occurs because the nerves that control the facial muscles are compressed or disturbed. In addition, the cause of paralysis occurs due to inflammation of a viral infection, one of which is the herpes virus. You need to know that Bell\u2019s palsy has nothing to do with stroke. Here are some causes of Bell\u2019s palsy on the face: Injuries due to accidents occur due to lacerations to the chin or cracks in the skull. Hereditary facial paralysis, this condition occurs in children who are born with weakness or paralysis of the face. Surgical injury, this condition usually occurs during parotid gland surgery. Meanwhile, several viral infectious diseases that are suspected of being related to Bell\u2019s palsy are: Herpes simplex. Chickenpox and shingles. Infectious mononucleosis (epstein-barr). Cytomegalovirus infection. Respiratory disease (adenovirus). German measles (rubella). Mumps (mumps virus). Flu (flu B). Coxsackievirus. According to the US National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, many experts believe that something can trigger a dormant viral infection, essentially awakening and triggering Bell\u2019s palsy. If you are stressed or have recently been sick, those can be potential triggers. So can recent physical trauma or even lack of sleep. Autoimmune conditions can also be other triggers. The facial nerve reacts to the infection by swelling, which can cause pressure on the bony (fallopian) canal through which the facial nerve passes to the side of the face. Inflammation of the facial nerve can reduce blood flow and oxygen to the nerve cells. Damage to these cranial nerves and nerve cells can lead to paralysis of the facial muscles. In most cases of Bell\u2019s palsy, paralysis on one side of the face can usually recover completely. Therefore, it is best to contact a doctor to understand the condition experienced. Diagnosis The American Medical Association (AMA) states that treatment is more effective when given early. Therefore, sufferers are advised to visit a doctor immediately after experiencing symptoms. Diagnosing Bell\u2019s Palsy is a process of elimination. Doctors will look for other conditions that cause facial paralysis, such as a tumor, Lyme disease, or stroke. The medical staff will also examine the sufferer\u2019s head, neck, and ears. The doctor will also assess the facial muscles to determine if any nerves other than the facial nerve are affected. If the diagnosis is still uncertain, the doctor will refer the sufferer to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist or otolaryngologist. Here are the tests you can do to diagnose Bell\u2019s palsy: Electromyography (EMG): This procedure can be done by placing electrodes on the sufferer\u2019s face. The machine will then measure the electrical activity of nerves and the electrical activity of muscles in response to stimulation. This test is useful for determining the level of nerve damage, as well as its location. MRI, CT Scan, or X-ray. These tests are good for determining whether there is another underlying condition, such as a bacterial infection, skull fracture, or tumor. Blood tests to check for bacterial or viral infections. Bells Palsy Treatment To reduce swelling in the facial nerve, sufferers can use prednisolone or prednisone (a group of corticosteroid drugs). Meanwhile, to prevent problems arising in the eyes that cannot close, sufferers usually need eye drops. About 70 percent of people with Bell\u2019s palsy recover. Most will start to improve within two to three weeks. However, it can take up to 10 months to fully recover depending on the extent of nerve damage. If a specific cause of Bell\u2019s palsy can be identified by your doctor, such as an infection, that cause will be treated. If not, symptoms will be treated as needed. One of the treatments that doctors recommend for Bell\u2019s palsy is to protect the eyes from drying out at night or when working in front of a computer screen. Eye care includes eye drops during the day, ointments at bedtime, or keeping the room humid at night. These treatments help protect the cornea from being scratched, which is essential for the management of Bell\u2019s palsy. The doctor may also prescribe other treatments for the sufferer\u2019s condition based on the severity of symptoms and medical history. Other treatment options include: Steroids to reduce inflammation. Antiviral drugs. Analgesics to relieve pain. Physical therapy to stimulate the facial nerve. In addition to the above treatments, learn about therapies to treat Bell\u2019s Palsy. Bells Palsy Prevention Start a healthy lifestyle by eating high-fiber foods and exercising regularly. In addition, do regular health checks. Bells Palsy Complications Bell\u2019s Palsy usually resolves within a short period of time and does not cause long-term complications. However, during the illness, most people with Bell\u2019s Palsy are unable to close their eye on the affected side of their face. That is why it is very important to prevent dry eyes at night or when working on a computer. The eye care you need is eye drops during the day, ointment at bedtime, or making the room humid at night. These methods can help protect the cornea from being scratched. Other complications of Bell\u2019s palsy can include: Permanent damage to the facial nerve. A person may have synkinesis, a condition in which moving one part of the face causes another part to move without the person realizing it. For example, your eyes close when you smile. Partial or complete blindness in the eye that will not close due to excessive dryness, and scratches on the protective membrane of the eye (cornea).",

        "text": "What is Cerebral Palsy? Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect movement and muscle coordination. In many cases, cerebral palsy also affects vision, hearing, and sensation. This condition occurs due to damage to the immature and developing brain, and most often occurs before birth (during pregnancy). However, cerebral palsy can also occur during the birth process, or in the first year after birth. In general, cerebral palsy causes movement disorders associated with excessive reflexes, spasticity or flexibility of the limbs and body. In addition, other signs include unusual postures, unintentional movements, unsteady walking, or a combination of all of these. Cerebral Palsy Symptoms The signs and symptoms of this disease can vary greatly from person to person. Cerebral palsy can affect the entire body, or be limited primarily to one or two limbs, or one side of the body. Common signs and symptoms include problems with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues. The following is an explanation of the symptoms of cerebral palsy from a number of aspects: `1. Symptoms in movement and coordination Stiff muscles and excessive reflexes (spasticity), the most common movement disorder. Variations in muscle tone, such as being too stiff or too floppy. Stiff muscles with normal reflexes (rigidity). Lack of balance and muscle coordination (ataxia). Tremors or involuntary, jerky movements. Slow, wriggling movements. Favoring one side of the body, such as reaching with only one hand or dragging a foot while crawling. Difficulty walking, such as walking on toes, a crouched gait, a scissor-like gait with crossed knees, a wide-legged gait, or an asymmetrical gait. Difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes or picking up utensils. 2. Symptoms when talking and eating Delay in speech development. Difficulty speaking. Difficulty with sucking, chewing, or eating. Excessive salivation or difficulty swallowing. Developmental Disorders. Delays in reaching motor skill milestones, such as sitting or crawling. Learning difficulties. Intellectual disability. Delayed growth, resulting in smaller than expected size. 3. Other issues Brain damage can cause other neurological problems, such as: Seizures ( epilepsy ). Difficulty hearing. Problems with vision and abnormal eye movements. Abnormal touch or painful sensations. Bladder and bowel problems, especially in children with cerebral palsy are more susceptible to bladder stones. Mental health conditions, such as emotional disorders and behavioral problems. The brain disorder that causes this condition does not change over time, so symptoms usually do not get worse with age. However, as the child gets older, some symptoms become more or less obvious. Muscle shortening and muscle stiffness can worsen if not treated promptly. Cerebral Palsy Risk Factors There are a number of factors that can put a baby at increased risk of cerebral palsy, including: Premature birth (birth before reaching 37 weeks of gestation). Low birth weight (less than 2.5 kilograms). Breech birth occurs when the baby\u2019s bottom or legs come out first Rh incompatibility, which occurs when the Rh type of the pregnant parents\u2019 blood does not match the Rh type of their baby\u2019s blood. Negative habits in mothers during pregnancy. For example, smoking, drinking alcohol or using drugs. The birth of twins or more (triplets), especially when one baby survives and the other dies at birth. Causes of Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy occurs due to abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain. This usually occurs before the child is born, but can also occur at birth or in early infancy. In many cases, the cause of cerebral palsy is unknown. Many factors can cause problems with brain development, including: Gene mutations that result in genetic abnormalities or differences in brain development. Maternal infection that affects the developing fetus. Fetal stroke, a disruption of blood supply to the developing brain. Bleeding into the brain in the womb or during birth. An infection in a baby that causes inflammation in or around the brain. Traumatic head injuries in infants, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or physical abuse. Lack of oxygen to the brain is associated with difficult labor or delivery, although birth-related asphyxia is a much less common cause than historically thought. Diagnosis Cerebral Palsy A doctor will diagnose cerebral palsy by taking a complete medical history, performing a physical examination that includes a detailed neurological exam, and evaluating the symptoms. In addition, to support the diagnosis, the doctor can also perform additional tests such as: Electroencephalogram (EEG). Aims to evaluate electrical activity in the brain. MRI. The purpose of this examination is to identify brain irregularities or injuries. CT scan. A CT scan creates clear cross-sectional images of the brain. It can also reveal brain damage. Ultrasonography (USG). Cranial ultrasound is a method of using high-frequency sound waves to obtain basic images of a young baby\u2019s brain. Blood tests. Aim to rule out other conditions, such as bleeding disorders. If a doctor confirms a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, they may refer the person to a specialist who can test for neurological problems. Neurological examination can detect: Vision loss and disturbances, such as blurred vision in one or both eyes. Deaf condition. Speech delay. Intellectual disability. Movement disorders. Cerebral Palsy Treatment Children and adults with cerebral palsy require lifelong care with a medical care team. In addition to a pediatrician or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist (physiotherapist), and a pediatric neurologist to oversee the child\u2019s medical care, the team includes a variety of therapists and mental health specialists. Remember, there is no cure for cerebral palsy. However, there are many cerebral palsy treatment options that can help improve a person\u2019s daily functioning, including: 1. Medicines Medications that can reduce muscle tension can be used to improve functional ability, treat pain, and manage complications related to spasticity or other cerebral palsy symptoms. Muscle or nerve injections. To treat certain muscle tightening, your doctor may recommend injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), or other agents. You may need to repeat the injections every three months. Oral muscle relaxants. Medications such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, or dantrolene are often recommended by doctors to relax the muscles. Medications to reduce saliva. One option is Botox injections into the salivary glands. 2. Therapy Various therapies play an important role in treating cerebral palsy: Physical Therapy Exercise and muscle training can help a child\u2019s strength, flexibility, balance, motor development, and mobility. Parents will also learn how to safely care for their child\u2019s daily needs at home, such as bathing and feeding the child. For the first 1 to 2 years after birth, both physical and occupational therapists work on issues such as head and trunk control, rolling over, and grasping. Then, both types of therapists are involved in the wheelchair assessment. Braces, splints or other supportive devices may be recommended for your child to help with function, such as improving walking and stretching stiff muscles. Speech and Language Therapy A speech-language pathologist can help improve a child\u2019s ability to speak clearly or communicate using sign language. They can also teach you how to use communication devices, such as computers and voice synthesizers if communication is difficult for you. Speech therapists can also address feeding and swallowing difficulties. Recreational Therapy Some children benefit from regular recreational or competitive or adaptive sports, such as therapeutic horseback riding or skiing. This type of therapy can help improve a child\u2019s motor skills, speech, and emotional well-being. Both adults and children benefit from regular physical activity and exercise for general health and fitness. 3. Operating Procedure Surgery may be necessary to reduce muscle tension or correct bone deformities caused by spasticity. This treatment includes: Orthopedic Surgery. Children with severe contractures or deformities may require surgery on the bones or joints to place their arms, spine, hips, or legs in the correct position. Cutting Nerve Fibers. If other treatments don\u2019t help, the surgeon will cut the nerves that serve certain spastic muscles. One procedure that the doctor may perform is a selective dorsal rhizotomy. This relaxes the leg muscles and reduces pain, but can cause numbness. 4. Other Treatments If necessary, your doctor may recommend medications and other treatments to treat some of the symptoms. Medication may be recommended to treat seizures, pain, osteoporosis, mental health conditions, and problems with sleep, oral health, eating and nutrition, bladder incontinence, vision, or hearing. Cerebral Palsy Prevention You can\u2019t prevent most cases of cerebral palsy, but you can reduce your risk. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you can take the following steps to maintain your health and minimize pregnancy complications: Get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated against diseases, such as rubella, preferably before becoming pregnant, can prevent infections that can cause fetal brain damage. Get regular pregnancy checkups. Visiting your doctor regularly can help prevent premature birth, low birth weight, and infections. Avoid certain intakes. For example, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. Because some of these substances have been associated with the risk of cerebral palsy. Practice good public safety. Prevent head injuries in children by providing appropriate protection and supervision. For example, ensuring that children wear helmets when riding bicycles. Cerebral Palsy Complications Without proper treatment, people with cerebral palsy are at risk of experiencing complications, such as: Communication difficulties, such as speech and language disorders. Spinal problems, such as scoliosis, lordosis (swayback) and kyphosis (hunchback). Osteoarthritis. It is pressure on the joints or abnormal joint alignment due to muscle spasticity. If you want to know more about this disease. Contractures occur when muscles become locked in a painful position. Osteopenia, or poor bone density that can make bones break easily. Dental problems. Incontinence. When to See a Doctor? It is important to get a proper diagnosis for any movement disorder or developmental delay in your child. See a neurologist if you have concerns about symptoms of loss of awareness of surroundings or unusual body or muscle movements, impaired coordination, difficulty swallowing, eye muscle imbalance, or other developmental problems.",

        "text": "What is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a condition that can cause someone to have repeated seizures. Epilepsy can attack someone when there is damage or changes in the brain. In the human brain, there are neurons or nerve cells that are part of the nervous system. Each nerve cell communicates with each other using electrical impulses. In cases of epilepsy, seizures occur when these electrical impulses are produced excessively, causing uncontrolled behavior or body movements. In fact, epilepsy can happen to anyone. This disease can affect people of all ages and all genders. According to WHO, around 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological diseases in the world. Symptoms of Epilepsy Recurrent seizures are the main symptom of epilepsy. The characteristics of the seizures will vary and depend on which part of the brain is first affected and how far the damage has progressed. Types of epileptic seizures are divided into two based on the disturbance in the brain, namely: 1. Partial seizures In partial or focal seizures, only part of the brain is affected. These partial seizures are divided into two categories, namely: Simple partial seizures This is a seizure in which the sufferer does not experience loss of consciousness. Symptoms can include jerking limbs, or tingling sensations, dizziness, and flashes of light. The part of the body that experiences seizures depends on which part of the brain is affected. For example, if epilepsy disrupts the brain function that controls hand or foot movement, then only those two limbs will experience seizures. Partial seizures can also cause sufferers to experience emotional changes, such as feeling suddenly happy or afraid. Complex partial seizures Sometimes, focal seizures affect the sufferer\u2019s awareness, making them appear confused or semi-conscious for a few moments. This is called a complex partial seizure. Other characteristics of a complex partial seizure are blank stares, swallowing, chewing, or rubbing hands. 2. Generalized seizures In generalized or generalized seizures, symptoms occur throughout the body and are caused by a disorder that affects all parts of the brain. The following are symptoms that can occur when someone has a generalized seizure: Eyes open during seizure. Tonic seizures. The body becomes stiff for a few seconds. This may be accompanied by rhythmic movements of the arms and legs or nothing at all. The muscles in the body, especially the arms, legs, and back, twitch. Atonic seizures, where the body\u2019s muscles suddenly relax, causing the sufferer to fall uncontrollably. Clonic seizures, which are rhythmic jerking movements that usually affect the muscles of the neck, face, and arms. Sometimes, people with epilepsy make noises or scream during a seizure. Bedwetting. Difficulty breathing for a while, so the body looks pale or even blue. In some cases, a generalized seizure leaves the sufferer completely unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the sufferer appears confused for several minutes or hours. There is a type of epilepsy that is commonly experienced by children, known as absence epilepsy or petit mal. Although this condition is not dangerous, the child\u2019s academic performance and concentration can be disrupted. The characteristics of this epilepsy are loss of consciousness for a few seconds, blinking or moving the lips, and a blank stare. Children who experience these seizures will not be aware or remember what happened during the seizure. Epilepsy Risk Factors Several factors that can potentially increase the risk of developing epilepsy include: Age. Epilepsy is generally experienced by children and the elderly. However, this condition can also be experienced by all groups who are at risk of developing epilepsy. Genetics. A family history of health problems can be a trigger for epilepsy. Head injury. Head injury can be one of the causes of epilepsy. Stroke and vascular disease. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can cause brain damage that can trigger this condition. Dementia. Brain infection. Inflammation of the brain or spinal cord can increase the risk of developing epilepsy. History of seizures in childhood. Seizures can be caused by high fever. In this condition, children are more susceptible to epilepsy. Causes of Epilepsy Epilepsy can start at any age, generally this condition occurs since childhood. Based on the cause, epilepsy is divided into two, namely: Idiopathic epilepsy, also known as primary epilepsy. This is a type of epilepsy that has no known cause. Some experts suspect that this condition is caused by genetic factors (hereditary). Symptomatic epilepsy, also called secondary epilepsy. This is a type of epilepsy that has a known cause. A number of factors, such as severe head injury, brain tumors, and strokes are thought to cause secondary epilepsy. Apart from the causes above, there are several other causes including: Immune disorders. Conditions that cause the immune system to attack brain cells, called autoimmune diseases, can cause epilepsy. Developmental disorders. Birth defects that affect the brain are often the cause of epilepsy, especially in people whose seizures are not controlled with anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis of Epilepsy The steps taken before the doctor makes a diagnosis include a physical examination, recording your medical history, asking about your activities, and possibly asking you to have a blood test. Your doctor may also ask about your symptoms during your seizure and ask you or your family if you experience any of the following during your seizure: Brain jerk. Muscle stiffness. Urinating or defecating during a seizure. Changes in breathing. Skin color becomes pale. Blank stare. Loss of consciousness. Difficulty speaking or understanding what people are saying to you. In addition, doctors also perform several tests to find out how the brain is performing by checking: How to walk. Muscle. Sensitivity. Thinking ability. Next, the doctor will recommend the following tests, if you are suspected of having epilepsy, such as: EEG or electroencephalogram. This is a test to find out the problem of electrical activity in the brain. Blood tests. These tests are useful for detecting signs of infection and other health problems. Epilepsy Treatment Although epilepsy cannot be cured, there are many treatment options available. As many as 70 percent of epilepsy sufferers can manage their disease with medication. There are several treatments to control epilepsy ranging from taking anti-seizure drugs, special diets, to surgery. Consumption of anti-seizure drugs This medication can control seizures in about 60 to 70 percent of people with epilepsy. Your doctor may prescribe one or more anti-seizure medications, a dose of medication, or a combination of medications to find the best medication to control your seizures. The choice of anti-seizure medication also depends on several things, such as: Types of seizures. Previous response to anti-seizure medications. Other medical conditions you have. Potential interactions with other drugs currently being taken. Side effects of anti-seizure drugs. Age. Overall health condition. This is because some anti-seizure medications have been linked to birth defects. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Special diet The ketogenic diet and the Atkins diet (a diet high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates) are two of the most common diets sometimes recommended for people with epilepsy. Most diets are recommended for children whose medical treatment is ineffective and whose condition does not allow for surgery. A low glycemic index diet may also reduce seizures in some people with epilepsy. Operation Your doctor may consider surgery if anti-seizure medication does not control your seizures and your seizures get worse. Epilepsy surgery can be a safe and effective treatment option when more than two trials of anti-seizure medications have failed to control seizures. Epilepsy surgery options include: Surgical resection. Removal of abnormal tissue. Severance. Cutting of the bundle of fibers that connects areas of the brain. Stereotactic radiosurgery. Targeted destruction of abnormal brain tissue. Implantation of a neuromodulation device. This device sends electrical impulses to the brain to reduce seizures over time. Epilepsy Prevention Apart from medication, there are several ways that can be done to prevent epilepsy, such as: Drive safely This is done to prevent traumatic brain injury. Be careful when doing activities. For example, use a bicycle helmet when cycling and a motorcycle helmet when riding a motorbike, use a seat belt, and provide a child passenger seat. This is done to reduce motor vehicle and traffic injuries. Pay attention to the steps Falls are a major cause of brain injury. Older adults and children are more likely to suffer a brain injury from a fall. Treat injuries early Get help immediately if a traumatic brain injury occurs. The risk of epilepsy is high in severe brain injuries. Taking good care of injuries can help prevent epilepsy. Healthy lifestyle Eating healthy foods, exercising such as walking every day, and not smoking can prevent epilepsy. Apart from epilepsy, this healthy lifestyle can also reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease. Vaccine Immunization, also known as a vaccine, can reduce the chances of getting an infection which can sometimes cause epilepsy. Maintain cleanliness An infection called cysticercosis is the most common cause of epilepsy. This disease is caused by a parasite and can be prevented through good hygiene and food preparation practices. Health checks and early treatment of cysticercosis can prevent epilepsy. Maintaining health during pregnancy Several problems during pregnancy and childbirth can cause epilepsy. Follow a prenatal care plan with your obstetrician or nurse to keep yourself and your baby healthy. When to See a Doctor? You need to contact a doctor if you experience the following symptoms of epilepsy: The seizure lasted more than 5 minutes. Breathing or consciousness does not return after the seizure stops. The second seizure occurred soon after. High fever. Heat exhaustion. Is pregnant. Have diabetes. Injuring oneself during a seizure. Still having seizures despite taking anti-seizure medication. Having a seizure for the first time. While it may be uncertain whether or not you have had a seizure, it is always a good idea to see a doctor right away if you suspect something or someone tells you about behavior you are not aware of.",

        "title": "Bladder Stones Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Bladder Stones Bladder stones or bladder calculi are stones that form from mineral deposits in the bladder. Everyone is actually at risk of having them. However, men over the age of 50 are at higher risk of experiencing it. Especially for men who have an enlarged prostate. As for bladder calculi, they can block the urinary tract and cause pain when urinating, difficulty urinating or not being able to urinate at all. If not treated immediately, these stones have the potential to cause infection and complications. Treatment of this condition usually requires medical assistance. However, if the stone is small, bladder calculi can come out with urine. Symptoms of Bladder Stones Some bladder calculi pass out of the body in the urine and do not cause any symptoms. However, large bladder stones can irritate the bladder and cause severe pain, bleeding, and problems urinating. Signs and symptoms include: Changes in urine color. The sufferer may have cloudy or dark urine or may see blood in the urine. Frequent urination. You may feel like you always need to urinate, even if you just went. Pain. With stones, there is usually pain or burning when urinating. You may also feel pain that comes and goes in the lower abdomen. In men, sometimes the pain will be felt in the penis or testicles. Stopping and starting. You may have trouble starting a urine stream, even when you really need to go. Sometimes the urine stream stops and starts (intermittent urination). Urinary tract infection. These stones can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). Symptoms of a UTI include frequent, painful urination and cloudy, smelly urine. However, you need to understand that bladder stones and urinary tract infections are two different conditions. Risk Factors for Bladder Stones Men, especially those over 50, are more likely to have bladder stones. Other conditions that can also increase the risk include: Obstruction of urine flow. Any condition that blocks the flow of urine from the bladder to the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, can lead to the formation of bladder calculi. There are several causes, but the most common is an enlarged prostate. Nerve damage. Stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, herniated disks, and a number of other problems can damage the nerves that control bladder function. A person is also at risk for nerve damage and conditions that cause bladder outlet obstruction. These conditions will further increase the risk of stones. Causes of Bladder Stones This condition can develop when the bladder does not empty completely. This condition causes the urine to become concentrated. Concentrated urine can crystallize and form stones. Some infections can cause bladder stones to form. Sometimes underlying conditions that affect the bladder\u2019s ability to hold, store, or excrete urine can also lead to the formation of bladder calculi. Any foreign material present in the bladder is likely to cause bladder stones. The most common conditions that cause this condition include: 1. Prostate Gland Enlargement An enlarged prostate ( benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) can cause bladder calculi in men. An enlarged prostate can block the flow of urine, preventing the bladder from emptying completely. 2. Damaged Nerves Normally, nerves carry messages from the brain to the bladder muscles, directing them to tighten or relax. If these nerves are damaged, either by stroke, spinal cord injury, or other health problems, the bladder may not empty completely. Another term for this condition is neurogenic bladder. 3. Inflammation of the bladder This condition sometimes occurs due to urinary tract infections or radiation therapy to the pelvis, can cause bladder calculi . 4. Use of medical devices The use of a bladder catheter through the urethra to help urine drain from the bladder can cause stones to form. So can objects that accidentally migrate into the bladder. Examples include contraceptive devices or urinary stents. Mineral crystals, which later become stones, tend to form on the surface of these devices. 5. Suffering from kidney stones Stones that form in the kidneys are not the same as bladder stones. But small kidney stones can travel down the ureter to the bladder and grow into stones. Bladder Stone Diagnosis To diagnose this disease, your doctor may need one or a combination of the following tests: Physical exam. The doctor may place his or her hand on the person\u2019s lower abdomen to feel for an enlarged bladder. Urine Test. Your doctor may need a urine sample to check for signs of blood, bacteria, and crystallized minerals. CT Scan. This scan combines several X-ray images to show internal organs in detail. In addition to detecting stones, CT scans can also be useful for detecting a number of other health problems. Ultrasonography. Produces images by bouncing sound off internal organs. Intravenous pyelogram. This procedure involves injecting a special fluid into a vein that will drain to the kidneys and bladder. The doctor will then use X-rays to look for signs of kidney stones. Bladder Stone Treatment If the size of the bladder stone is quite small, then treatment is sufficient by drinking 1200 milliliters of water per day. The goal is to help the stone pass naturally with urine. However, if the size is large enough, the doctor can perform the following medical procedures: Cystolitholapaxy. In this procedure, the doctor will crush the stones in the bladder into small pieces using a laser, ultrasound, or mechanical means. Once the stones are small, they will be easier to pass along with the urine. Surgery. This procedure may be an option if the stone is too large and too hard to pass by cystolitholapaxy. Bladder Stone Complications Although some cases of bladder are asymptomatic, it does not mean that you should take this health condition lightly. Because, without proper treatment, this condition can cause the following two main complications: Chronic bladder dysfunction. This condition is characterized by increased frequency of urination along with pain during urination. Sometimes, bladder calculi can completely block urine from leaving the body. Urinary tract infection. This infection can recur and therefore requires proper treatment. Because, if ignored, this condition is dangerous to health. Well, more complete information about the dangers, Bladder Stone Prevention Bladder stones are usually the result of an underlying condition that is difficult to prevent. However, anyone can reduce their chances of developing bladder stones by following these tips: Check for unusual urinary symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of prostate enlargement or other urological conditions can reduce the risk of developing these conditions. Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking more fluids, especially water, can help prevent stones from forming. This is because fluids dilute the concentration of minerals in the bladder. How much water you should drink will depend on your age, size, health, and activity level.",

        "title": "Urinary Tract Infection Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Urinary Tract Infection Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a condition when the urinary system experiences an infection. It can be in the ureter, kidney, bladder, and urethra. Generally, the infection attacks two parts, namely the urethra and the bladder. Although it can happen to anyone, this infection is more likely to occur in women. In addition, this infection can attack deeper parts and the most common one that occurs is a bladder infection (cystitis). Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections in Women and Men UTIs can cause the lining of the urinary tract to become red and inflamed (irritated). Some of the characteristics of UTI that can occur in men and women include: 1. Characteristics of Urinary Tract Infections in Women Symptoms of urinary tract infections in women can include: Pain or burning sensation when urinating. More frequent urination. Urine smells and has a different color than usual. Pelvic or lower abdominal pain. Feeling weak and unwell. Fever. Shivering. Bloody urine (hematuria). In girls, they tend to be restless or cry when urinating. 2. Characteristics of Urinary Tract Infections in Men Although more common in women, men can also experience urinary tract infections (UTIs) with the following symptoms: Pain or burning sensation when urinating. Difficulty urinating. Frequent urination. Pain in the lower abdomen or lower back. Urine smells and is colored differently than normal. Fever. A feeling of discomfort in the pelvic or genital area. Exhaustion. Intense pain. Risk Factors for Urinary Tract Infections General risk factors for urinary tract infections include: Have urinary tract abnormalities. Having a blockage in the urinary tract. Have a low immune system. Using a catheter. Having surgery or a urinary tract examination. This disease is more common in women, and many women experience it more than once during their lifetime. Several factors that increase the risk of this disease in women, namely: Sexually active. The anatomy of the female body has a shorter urethra than men. Using certain types of contraception. Already menopausal. Women who have the habit of wiping the genital area after urinating from back to front are also at risk of contracting this disease. This is because the urethra is located close to the anus which tends to have a lot of bacteria. Sexual intercourse can also cause bacteria to enter the urinary tract, apart from dirty habits after urinating. Therefore, cleaning the genital area after having sex is very important. Types of Urinary Tract Infections UTIs are divided into several types, depending on which part of the urinary tract is infected. Some common types are: Urethritis. Infection of the urethra, the hollow tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. Cystitis. A bacterial infection of the bladder that often spreads from the urethra. Pyelonephritis. This occurs in the kidneys, usually due to an infection that has spread to the urinary tract, or from a blockage in the urinary tract. Obstruction in the urinary tract causes urine to flow back into the ureters and kidneys. Causes of Urinary Tract Infections The cause of urinary tract infections is bacteria that infect one part of the urinary system. The type of bacteria that most often causes this infection is E. coli. However, there are several other types of bacteria that can also cause UTIs. Such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. This disease can occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and grow in the bladder. Although the urinary system works to prevent bacteria from entering through the urethra, sometimes it can still happen. Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection Some tests and procedures to diagnose urinary tract infections, namely: Urinalysis. Examination of a urine sample, looking for white blood cells, red blood cells, or bacteria. Urine Culture Examination. This is useful to determine the type of bacteria present, in order to determine the right treatment. Imaging tests. Such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, to see images of the urinary tract. Cystoscopy. An examination using a special instrument inserted through the urethra to look inside the bladder. Urinary Tract Infection Treatment The most common treatment for this disease is by administering antibiotics. This drug is able to kill bacteria, thereby eliminating the infection that occurs. However, make sure to finish the antibiotics according to the doctor\u2019s prescription so that the bacterial infection is resolved and the body does not become resistant to the drug later. In addition, it is also necessary to consume more water so that bacteria can be removed from the urinary tract system. So, Can Urinary Tract Infections Be Cured with Pipemidic Acid? If this condition recurs three times in a year or more, ask your doctor to recommend a specific treatment plan. Some treatment options that you can undergo include: Using low doses of antibiotics over a longer period to help prevent recurrent infections. Taking a single dose of antibiotics after intercourse, to prevent common triggers of infection. Take antibiotics for 1 or 2 days whenever you feel symptoms. So, if you experience bladder problems, contact this doctor immediately. Recommended Medications for Treating Urinary Tract Infections The following are recommended medications for treating urinary tract infections: Floxifar 500 mg 10 Caplets. Tablets containing the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin which are useful for treating infections in the urinary tract, bones and joints, and digestive tract. Scopma 10 mg 10 Caplets. Used to treat stomach pain or serious digestive disorders. Spasmolit 10 mg 10 Tablets. A hard drug that can be consumed based on doctor\u2019s instructions. This drug contains Hyoscine Butylbromide to treat digestive disorders such as paroxysmal pain in the stomach or small intestine. Tequinol 500 mg 10 Caplets . Can be consumed to treat severe infections caused by bacteria such as urinary tract infections, urethritis, and infections of the digestive tract and respiratory tract. Baquinor Forte 500 mg 10 Caplets . Antibiotics containing Ciprofloxacin are useful for treating infections of the urinary tract, skin and soft tissue, bones and joints, to acute osteomyelitis. Helixim Dry Syrup 30 ml. Is a type of antibiotic that contains Cefixime to treat urinary tract infections without complications. Cefspan Dry Syrup 30 ml. With Cefixime content, this drug is an antibiotic to treat urinary tract infections, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. Buscopan 10 mg 10 Tablets . Tablets containing Hyoscine-N-butyl bromide are useful for treating spastic disorders in the digestive tract, urinary tract, bile duct, and genital tract in women. Prive Uricran 10 Capsules . Supplements that contain multivitamins and Isoflavones that are useful for maintaining urinary tract health. Complications of Urinary Tract Infections Urinary tract infections that are not treated immediately can trigger urosepsis, a condition where bacteria in the infected kidney spread to the blood. This causes many bad effects, such as shock and even death. In addition, in some cases this disease can also cause: Premature birth, if this disease occurs in pregnant women. Permanent kidney damage if the bacteria spread to the kidneys. Narrowing of the urinary tract. Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections Here are some efforts to prevent urinary tract infections: Not holding urine. Always clean the genital area from front to back after urinating. Drink plenty of water. You should avoid feminine hygiene sprays, feminine fragrances, and other products for the feminine area because they will only irritate the mucosa. Clean the genital area before having sex. After intercourse, urinate. This is to remove any bacteria that may have entered the urethra. Don\u2019t wear underwear for days. Do not wear tight bottoms as they will increase humidity.",

        "text": "Health Benefits of Brown Rice: Brown rice has gained immense popularity in recent years. It is largely associated with healthier eating, as it is a whole grain that contains bran and germ. While white rice is stripped of its hull, bran, and germ, brown rice is less processed and has only the hull removed. This leaves in the nutrient-packed bran and germ, which are essential for a healthy diet. Brown rice has a low glycemic index (GI), which prevents it from causing your blood sugar to spike after eating. This is beneficial for those who are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Studies show that eating three servings of whole grains, including brown rice, can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 32 percent. People who eat a lot of white rice are 17 percent more likely to develop diabetes than those who eat less. 5 Health Benefits of Black Cumin (Kalonji)Brown rice is a rich source of dietary fiber, which can reduce your risk of death from heart disease. Overall, eating more brown rice can help in reducing the risk of heart disease by up to 22 percent and stroke by 12 percent.

        "text": "Health Benefits of Jasmine Rice: Jasmine rice is a popular variety of rice that is grown mostly in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It has a strong aroma that is caused by the production of natural compounds that are aromatic and have fragrance. The most important aromatic compound in jasmine rice is 2-acetyl-1-purroline.Jasmine rice is sticky in texture and has a slightly sweet taste. It is mostly eaten steamed or boiled because it is not suitable for frying as it can become sticky. Steamed jasmine rice is a good choice for curries and meat. In addition to being a popular form of rice, jasmine rice is also high in calories but has several health benefits. Let us read them below.5 Health Benefits of Brown RiceFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of jasmine rice.1. Promotes Healthy Pregnancy: Folic acid, a synthetic form of folate (Vitamin B9), is a vital nutrient for pregnant women. Consuming folic acid during pregnancy can help prevent neural tube defects in the baby, which are birth defects that affect the brain or spine. Folic acid also plays an important role in the proper growth of the baby's heart and blood vessels. Since jasmine rice is rich in folic acid, it can be a good choice for pregnant women looking to increase their intake of folic acid.2. Prevents Iron Deficiency: Iron plays an essential role in our body. It not only helps in the production of red blood cells but also strengthens the immune system. In addition, iron transports oxygen in the blood and produces energy. Lack of iron in the body can lead to many health issues, including anemia. Anemia is a condition in which patients suffer from fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and various other symptoms. Consuming jasmine rice in a daily diet may help prevent the deficiency of iron and the associated health problems.5 Health Benefits of Black Cumin (Kalonji)3. Enhances Digestive Health: Brown jasmine rice is high in insoluble fiber, which helps in maintaining a healthy digestive system. It also helps in getting rid of constipation by softening stools and facilitating nutrient absorption through slowed food passage. Jasmine rice is less processed than other rice varieties and has many nutrients intact. 4. Boosts Immune System: Jasmine rice is available in many colorful varieties, including red, purple, and blue. The colored jasmine rice is loaded with useful compounds like phytonutrients. These phytonutrients prevent cell damage, strengthen the immune system, and enhance overall health.5 Health Benefits of Peppermint Tea5. Aids in Weight Loss: Jasmine rice is naturally low in fat. There, it may be a healthy option for people who wish to reduce fat intake or lose weight. Consuming jasmine rice gives a full feeling and therefore prevents overeating.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Acromegaly Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Acromegaly Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder that develops when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones will increase in size. In childhood, this condition causes an increase in height called gigantism. However, in adulthood, body changes do not occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of the hands, feet, and face, and is called acromegaly. Symptoms of Acromegaly Symptoms of acromegaly can vary and usually develop slowly. Initially, symptoms usually include: Swelling of the hands and feet. Usually, marked by changes in ring and shoe size. Fatigue and difficulty sleeping. Snoring. Changes in facial appearance, such as the eyebrows, lower jaw, and nose becoming larger, and the gaps between the teeth becoming wider. Numbness and weakness in the hand caused by pressure on the nerves in the hand. In children and teenagers, it will be very high. In advanced conditions, complaints may increase, such as: Large hands and feet. The size of the nose and lips, as well as the large tongue. Skin changes, such as becoming thicker, rougher, and oilier or sweating more often. The voice becomes deeper. Joint pain. Chest pain. Headache Visual disturbances. Decreased libido. Menstrual disorders in women and erectile dysfunction in men. Risk Factors for Acromegaly Acromegaly is usually related to genetics, so a family history of acromegaly can be a risk factor. It is also important to note that acromegaly can begin at any time after puberty. However, it is more common in middle age. People are usually unaware of the condition. This is because changes in the body occur slowly over many years. Causes of Acromegaly Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of the brain, just behind the bridge of the nose. This area produces growth hormone and a number of other hormones. It is important to note that growth hormone plays an important role in managing physical growth. When the pituitary gland releases GH into the bloodstream, it triggers the liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Insulin is what causes bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH can lead to too much IGF-1, which can cause the signs, symptoms, and complications of acromegaly. In adults, tumors are a common cause of too much GH production: 1. Pituitary tumor In most cases, acromegaly is caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and visual disturbances, are caused by the tumor pressing on surrounding brain tissue. 2. Non-pituitary tumors In some people with acromegaly, a tumor in another part of the body, such as the lung or pancreas, causes the condition. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumor produces a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH. Diagnosis of Acromegaly To diagnose acromegaly, the doctor will ask about the patient\u2019s medical history and perform a physical examination. Then, the doctor may recommend the following tests: IGF-1 measurement. Before performing this test, your doctor will ask you to fast overnight. On the day of the test, your doctor will take a blood sample to measure the level of IGF-1 in your blood. Elevated IGF-1 levels indicate acromegaly. Growth hormone suppression test. This is the best method to confirm a diagnosis of acromegaly. During this test, your blood GH levels are measured before and after you drink sugar (glucose). In people who do not have acromegaly, a glucose drink usually causes GH levels to drop. However, if you have acromegaly, your GH levels will tend to remain high. Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help determine the location and size of a tumor on your pituitary gland. If a pituitary tumor isn\u2019t visible, your doctor may recommend other imaging tests to look for non-pituitary tumors. Treatment and Side Effects of Acromegaly Treatment for acromegaly usually depends on the symptoms experienced. In acromegaly sufferers who have a pituitary gland tumor, it is usually recommended to remove the tumor through surgery, which may need to be followed by drug therapy or radiation therapy. 1. Surgery Tumor removal therapy is one of the effective therapies for acromegaly sufferers due to pituitary tumors. The choice of tumor removal requires prior examination to ensure its benefits. In conditions where the tumor is too large and cannot be removed completely, a partial removal is usually performed. This will then be followed by medication or radiotherapy before further surgery. Pituitary gland tumor removal surgery is an operation that requires general anesthesia and is performed in the operating room. Surgery or surgical procedures to remove pituitary gland tumors have several risks, such as the risk of damaging healthy tissue and infection of the meninges. The surgeon will provide an explanation before performing the procedure and will try to minimize any risks that may occur. 2. Medicine The doctor will give medication after surgery or in conditions where surgery cannot be done for some reason. The purpose of giving medication is to reduce the production of growth hormone. Types of drugs that can be given include dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogs, and growth hormone antagonists. Somatostatin analogs can cause side effects on the stomach or digestive tract, such as diarrhea and nausea or gallstones. 3. Radiation Radiation may be used to destroy large tumors or any remaining tumors after surgery, or when other treatments are ineffective. This method can slowly help lower GH levels when used in conjunction with medications. Reducing GH levels using this method may take several years. At least the sufferer needs to be given radiation therapy in several sessions, four to six weeks. The types of radiation therapy that may be used are: Conventional radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy is usually given daily for four to six weeks. People may not see the full effects of this therapy for 10 years or more after treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery. This method uses 3D imaging to deliver high doses of radiation to tumor cells while limiting the amount of radiation to surrounding normal tissue. Usually, this type of radiation can be given in a single dose. GH levels can return to normal within five to 10 years with this method. Unfortunately, radiation can interfere with fertility. In rare cases, this treatment method can cause someone to lose their vision, have brain injuries, or have secondary tumors. Prevention of Acromegaly Until now, no method has been found that can prevent acromegaly, so early detection and treatment is the most effective step in treating this disease. Complications of Acromegaly If left untreated, acromegaly can cause serious health problems. Complications of this rare disease include: High blood pressure ( hypertension ). High cholesterol. Heart problems, especially an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy). Osteoarthritis. Type 2 diabetes Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Precancerous growths (polyps) in the lining of the colon. Sleep apnea Carpal tunnel syndrome. Changes or loss of vision. When to See a Doctor? If you experience symptoms or complaints that indicate acromegaly, talk to your doctor immediately to get the right treatment.",

        "text": "Albinism Albinism or albino is a congenital disorder that causes sufferers to experience a lack of melanin or even no pigment at all. Therefore, the skin, hair, and eye color of sufferers of this condition are pale and tend to be white. Although this condition cannot be cured, sufferers can still live a normal life and carry out daily activities like normal people in general. Symptoms of Albinism There are several symptoms of albinism that occur with variations in sufferers. Symptoms of this condition generally affect the color of the skin, hair, eyes, and vision. 1. Symptoms on the skin and hair The most obvious symptoms of albinism are white hair and very pale and light skin. However, in some cases, hair color can range from white to brown. In addition, skin coloring can also be in the form of pigmentation, which is when the color is lighter than it should be in certain areas. People of African descent who have this condition may have light brown or reddish-brown skin and have freckles. For some, their skin color can be nearly the same as a parent or sibling without albinism. If people with albinism are exposed to sunlight, they may experience: Spots. Moles, colorless or pink. Large freckles or solar lentigines. Sunburned and unable to sunbathe. For some people with this condition, their skin color will never change. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and adolescence, causing slight changes in color. 2. Symptoms in hair An albino\u2019s hair color can range from very white to brown. However, albinism of African or Asian descent may have yellow, red, or brown hair. Hair color can darken in early adulthood. Hair color changes can also occur due to contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker as you age. 3. Eye color symptoms People with albinism usually have pale eyelashes and eyebrows. Eye color ranges from light blue to brown, and can change with age. In people with albinism, the colored part of the eye (the iris) usually lacks pigment. This allows light to shine through the iris and makes the eyes very sensitive to bright light. As a result, very light-colored eyes may appear red in certain lighting. 4. Symptoms in vision Visual impairment is the main symptom of all types of albinism. Eye problems that may occur may include: Rapid, uncontrolled back-and-forth movements of the eyes (nystagmus). Unusual head position or posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movement and see better. Eyes that cannot look in the same direction at the same time or appear crossed (strabismus). Having trouble seeing objects close up or objects far away, called nearsightedness or farsightedness. Having excessive sensitivity to light (photophobia). There is a difference in the curvature of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye (astigmatism), which causes blurred vision. There is a difference in the development of a thin layer of tissue on the inside of the back wall of the eye (retina). This difference results in reduced vision. Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that do not follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye (optic nerve misrouting). Having poor depth perception, meaning not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. Risk Factors for Albinism Albinism is a condition that someone has since birth. A child is at high risk of being born with this condition if they have parents with the same condition. In addition, it can also occur if the parents carry the gene mutation that causes albinism. To date, research has not found any possible activities or diseases that could increase the risk factors for albinism. Causes of Albinism The cause of this condition is a change in one of the genes. Some genes provide instructions for making one of several proteins involved in melanin production. Then, cells called melanocytes will produce melanin which is present in the skin , hair, and eyes. Genetic changes can cause melanin to be absent altogether or to decrease in quantity. Types of Albinism There are different types of albinism that can occur based on the gene changes that cause the disorder. The types will differ based on how they run in families and the genes that are affected. 1. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) This type is the most common. OCA albinism involves two copies of the altered gene, one from each parent. This condition is also called autosomal recessive inheritance. Oculocutaneous albinism is the result of changes in one of eight genes that range in label from OCA-1 to OCA-8. OCA causes decreased pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, as well as vision. The amount of pigment varies by type. The skin, hair, and eye color that results from OCA also varies by type. 2. Ocular albinism Ocular albinism is limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of this type is type 1. This type is inherited due to a change in the gene on the X chromosome from a mother who carries one X gene. This gene has then changed when it is passed down to the child. This is also called X-linked recessive inheritance. However, ocular albinism usually occurs only in males and is less common than OCA. 3. Albinism related to hereditary syndrome Examples of this type of albinism are Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome which is a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and intestinal diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is also a form of OCA, as well as immune problems and recurrent infections, brain and nerve problems, bleeding disorders, and other serious problems. 4. Griscelli syndrome Griscelli syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder. It occurs due to a defect in one of three genes. Only about 150 cases of the syndrome were recorded worldwide between 1978\u20132018. This condition occurs with albinism, but may not affect the entire body. In addition, Griscelli syndrome also occurs due to immune problems and neurological problems. Griscelli syndrome usually causes death in the first decade of life. Diagnosis of Albinism Albinism occurs at birth. Generally, diagnosing this condition is not difficult and only requires an examination by a doctor. This examination can be done by a doctor by: Physical examination includes examination of skin and hair pigmentation. Comprehensive eye examination. Comparing the pigmentation of a child with albinism with other family members. Review your child\u2019s medical history, including any bleeding that won\u2019t stop, serious bruising, or unexpected infections. Albinism Treatment Although it cannot be cured, treatment for albinism focuses on maximizing the ability to see and protecting the skin by providing proper care. Use sunglasses to protect the eyes from direct exposure to ultraviolet rays. Wear clothing that covers the skin and use sunscreen to protect the skin from sun exposure. Use of special glasses if you experience eye and vision problems. Do skin care and skin cancer prevention. For example, by having a skin exam at least once a year to screen for skin cancer or spots that can lead to cancer. Prevention of Albinism Albinism is not a disease that someone can prevent in some way because it is a hereditary condition. If you want to know about the risk of this condition occurring in children, you can do a genetic counselor to find out what type of albinism might occur. Complications of Albinism The lack of melanin produced by the body causes the skin, hair and eyes to become pale. The following are complications that may occur in people with albinism: Visual impairment However, people with albinism can learn to use their vision over time. Some people with albinism may be able to overcome problems with astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness with glasses or contact lenses. Skin cancer Lack of melanin in the body can cause skin cancer in people with albinism. Check regularly if you experience symptoms of skin cancer. Also, minimize exposure to the sun for a long time. Problems in the social environment People with this condition are at high risk of social isolation, due to the social stigma behind the condition. When to See a Doctor? If you experience signs and symptoms of albinism, you can talk further with a doctor to find out the cause and proper treatment. In addition, you can consult a doctor for treatment if you experience complications or the impact interferes with daily activities.",

        "title": "Cold Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Cold Allergy Not everyone can stay comfortable when facing cold air. Some people experience cold allergy problems, or in medical terms is cold urticaria. This problem can cause itchy welts and redness of the skin within minutes of exposure to cold. The symptoms of cold allergies experienced by each person can vary, ranging from mild to severe reactions. For some people, swimming in cold water can cause loss of consciousness, drop in blood pressure, and even be fatal. This disorder occurs most often in adolescents and may disappear completely after a few years. In addition, preventive measures are very important so that this problem does not recur. Cold Allergy Symptoms Signs or symptoms that can arise when someone experiences a cold allergy can range from mild to severe. For mild symptoms may include: Temporary reddish spots accompanied by itchy welts on the skin areas exposed to the cold. Bad skin reaction when the cold wears off. Experience swelling in the hands when holding cold objects. There is swelling of the lips due to consuming cold food or drinks. Then, for severe reactions, among others: Experiencing anaphylaxis which can cause fainting, heart palpitations, body swelling, and shock. Swelling of the tongue and throat that makes it difficult to breathe. Heart palpitations. Decreased blood pressure. Faint. Symptoms of urticaria begin immediately when the skin experiences a sudden drop in air temperature or cold water. Each episode can last up to about two hours. The most severe problem occurs when the whole body is exposed to cold, such as swimming in cold water. If not treated immediately, the sufferer can lose consciousness and drown. Cold Allergy Risk Factors This disorder, called cold urticaria, is most common in teenagers. About half of those who suffer from it may or may not get better after 6 years. Risk factors can be conditions or situations that increase a person\u2019s likelihood of experiencing an allergic reaction when exposed to cold temperatures or extreme temperature changes. Here are some risk factors you need to be aware of: History of allergies. A person who has a history of allergies to certain substances, such as pollen, animal dander, or certain foods, is more susceptible to this condition. Asthma. People who have asthma or other allergies, such as allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis (eczema), are at higher risk of developing this condition. Age. Children and adolescents tend to be more susceptible to it than adults. Family history. If you have a family history of this condition or other allergies, you may also be at higher risk for developing this condition. Environmental exposure. People who live or work in environments that tend to be cold or are exposed to cold temperatures for extended periods of time may be at higher risk for developing this condition. Outdoor activities. Being active in cold temperatures or extreme temperature changes can increase the risk of cold allergies. Low humidity. Environments with low humidity, especially in winter, can also trigger cold allergies. Physical activity. Some people experience cold allergies especially when doing physical activities, such as running or exercising in cold temperatures. Cholinergic urticaria reaction. Some people develop an allergic reaction called cholinergic urticaria when their body temperature rises due to physical activity, stress, or heat. Causes of Cold Allergies Allergies can appear when the skin is exposed to cold weather and are at risk of appearing in windy and humid conditions. Research has found that this condition is caused by the release of histamine and chemicals into the bloodstream triggered by cold air. People who suffer from it will experience a rash or itching on the skin after: Eat or drink something cold. Put ice on the skin. Swim or soak in cold water. Walking outdoors in cold weather. There are three most common types of cold allergies, namely: Essential cold allergy. This type occurs in people who have no family history of the disease. Symptoms can appear within minutes of exposure to cold. Then, symptoms can subside within an hour or two. Familial or hereditary cold allergy. This type runs in families. Symptoms take a long time to appear, usually 30 minutes to 48 hours after exposure. However, symptoms can last for one to two days. Autoimmune. This type occurs when the body releases histamine in response to cold. Histamine is a chemical made by the immune system in response to allergies. However, the reason for the release of histamine is unknown. Cold Allergy Diagnosis Cold urticaria can be diagnosed by placing an ice cube on the skin for five minutes. If you do have this disease, a red bump may form a few minutes after the ice cube is removed. In addition, this disorder can also be influenced by the immune system. Therefore, the doctor may need to do a blood test or other supporting tests. Cold Allergy Treatment In severe cases of cold allergies, it can have fatal consequences, such as swelling of the throat and tongue. As a result, this can cause difficulty breathing, anaphylactic reactions causing low blood pressure, heart palpitations, fainting, and swelling of the arms and legs (torso). Generally, this condition can disappear on its own within weeks to months, but some can last quite a long time. For this reason, if you suddenly feel signs of an allergy, you should immediately see a doctor. Depending on the severity of the condition, the sufferer may need to manage existing conditions before or after exposure. The doctor may also prescribe medications such as: Antihistamines. These drugs can counteract histamine or the substance that triggers itching. Sufferers can use antihistamines before exposure to cold to prevent a reaction or after exposure to control a reaction that has already occurred. Desensitization. This treatment involves gradually exposing your body to increasingly cold temperatures. For example, taking a cold shower that gets colder and colder over time. Desensitization can help your body adjust and control its reaction to cold. However, never try this treatment without talking to your doctor first. Epinephrine or adrenaline injection. This medication can slow down a severe allergic reaction. This injection can only be given by a doctor in a hospital. Some people who are at risk for a severe reaction may carry an epinephrine auto-injector. Cold Allergy Prevention For sufferers, it is recommended not to swim in cold water. When the entire surface of the skin is exposed to cold, it can cause a severe reaction, causing the sufferer to lose consciousness and drown. Well, there are several other ways that can be done to reduce the possibility of cold urticaria symptoms, namely: Wear protective clothing when the weather is cold, such as jackets, hats, gloves, and scarves. Make sure all parts of the skin are covered. Check the water temperature before you dip in and be sure to avoid cold water. If you like swimming, be sure to choose a heated pool and warm weather. Take a shower with warm water. Do not consume cold food and drinks. Take antihistamines before exposure to cold. If your doctor prescribes an epinephrine autoinjector, always carry it with you to prevent serious reactions. If you need to have certain surgeries, talk to your surgeon about your cold allergy. The surgical team can take steps to prevent symptoms in the operating room. Cold Allergy Complications The main possible complication of cold allergies is a severe reaction that occurs after the skin area is exposed to cold. For example, when swimming in cold water. So, is it true that cold allergies can cause sinusitis? When to See a Doctor? If you experience the signs and symptoms of a cold allergy above, talk to your doctor immediately to find out the cause and get the right treatment. Seek emergency care immediately if you are suddenly exposed to a cold and experience an anaphylactic response or difficulty breathing.",

        "title": "Peanut Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "What Is a Peanut Allergy? A peanut allergy is a common condition in which a person\u2019s body reacts to the proteins contained in certain nuts. Nuts that commonly cause allergic reactions include peanuts, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachios. Peanut allergies can cause severe, even life-threatening symptoms and affect a person\u2019s quality of life. A peanut allergy occurs when a person\u2019s immune system perceives the proteins in peanuts as foreign and produces chemicals that damage the body to fight the proteins. When these substances are released into the blood, they cause allergic symptoms. An allergy occurs when the body mistakenly identifies nuts as a harmful food. When you consume nuts, your immune system overreacts, causing a serious, even life-threatening response. Peanut allergies can occur in people of all ages but are most common in children. Some people can outgrow a peanut allergy, but for those who are more sensitive, a peanut allergy can cause a very severe reaction. Nuts that commonly cause allergic reactions include peanuts, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachios. Additionally, Brazil nuts, filbert nuts, Macadamia nuts, pecans, and cashews can also cause allergic reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, it is very important to provide first aid. Peanut Allergy Symptoms Peanut allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe and can occur within minutes of consuming peanuts or even hours later. Some common symptoms of a peanut allergy include: Diarrhea Difficulty breathing Skin rash Nausea and vomiting Stomach cramps Swelling, usually on the tongue or lips More severe peanut allergy symptoms such as anaphylaxis can occur within minutes of consuming peanuts. Anaphylaxis is a very severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Hard to breathe Fast and irregular heartbeat Low blood pressure Cold and pale skin Bloating, nausea, and vomiting Chest pain or discomfort in the chest Death The allergic reactions that appear in each sufferer will be different. In fact, one sufferer may have different allergic reactions when consuming different types of nuts. Risk Factors for Peanut Allergy There are several risk factors that can increase a person\u2019s risk of experiencing a peanut allergy. History of Allergies or Asthma If someone has a history of allergies or asthma, then they have a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy. People who have a history of other allergies, such as other food allergies, are also at higher risk. Family History As explained previously, if a family member has a peanut allergy, the risk of peanut allergies in other family members will increase. Age Children are at higher risk of developing peanut allergies than adults. However, adults can also experience peanut allergies, especially if they have a history of allergies or asthma. Gender Several studies have shown that men have a higher risk of developing peanut allergies than women. Ethnicity Some ethnic groups are at higher risk for developing peanut allergies than others. For example, Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans Causes of Peanut Allergies The exact cause of peanut allergy is not known for certain. However, there are several factors that are thought to play a role in the development of this condition. Genetics Peanut allergies can be passed from parents to their children. If one or both parents have a peanut allergy, their child has a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy. Immune System A peanut allergy occurs when the immune system responds to the proteins in peanuts as harmful foreign substances. The body then produces antibodies to fight these proteins, and each time these proteins enter the body, the immune system releases histamine and other chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Early Exposure to Peanuts Early exposure to peanuts can increase a child\u2019s risk of developing a peanut allergy. Several studies have shown that giving foods containing nuts to babies before the age of 6 months can increase the risk of peanut allergies in the baby. Peanut Allergy Diagnosis The diagnostic process is carried out by a specialist doctor based on the results of interviews and complaints experienced by the sufferer. The following are some supporting examinations including: Medical History The first step in diagnosing a peanut allergy is to conduct a medical interview to determine the patient\u2019s allergy history and symptoms. The doctor will ask about the patient\u2019s allergy history and whether they have had any allergic symptoms after consuming peanuts or foods containing peanuts. The doctor will also ask for information about symptoms by the patient, such as skin rashes, itching, swelling, nausea, vomiting and even difficulty breathing. Skin Test Skin testing is one of the most common methods in diagnosing peanut allergies. The skin test involves injecting a small amount of peanut protein into the patient\u2019s skin and then waiting for a reaction. If an allergic reaction occurs, the skin will become red and itchy. Blood Test Blood tests involve taking a sample of the patient\u2019s blood and testing whether they have antibodies to peanut proteins. This blood test is known as the immunoglobulin E (IgE) test and can help determine whether or not a patient has a peanut allergy. However, blood tests are not always accurate and cannot determine the severity of the allergy. Elimination and Provocation Test An elimination test involves removing nuts from the patient\u2019s diet for a period of time to see if symptoms improve. After that, the patient will be given food containing nuts and then observed to see if the symptoms reappear. An elimination test can help identify a peanut allergy, but it is not always accurate. Meanwhile, provocation tests should be performed under medical supervision and involve gradually introducing foods containing peanuts to see if the patient experiences an allergic reaction. This test can help identify the severity of the allergy and help the doctor plan the appropriate treatment. Diagnostic Tools There are also several tools that can help in the diagnosis of peanut allergies. Peanut Allergy Detector A peanut allergy detector is a device that can detect peanut proteins in food and beverages. This tool works by measuring the levels of peanut protein in food or beverage samples. If the protein content of the peanut is high, then the food may contain peanuts and could potentially cause an allergic reaction. Epinephrine Auto-Injector This is a device used to administer epinephrine injections in an emergency Peanut Allergy Symptoms Prevention To prevent the emergence of allergic reactions to nuts, here are some steps you can take: Read the packaging labels before purchasing groceries. Ask the restaurant waiter before ordering food. Do not breathe air containing peanut residue. Wear a bracelet stating if your child has a peanut allergy. Carry medications such as antihistamines with you wherever you go to treat mild allergic reactions. Carry an epinephrine shot with you wherever you go to treat severe allergic reactions. Peanut Allergy Treatment Medications can help reduce the symptoms of a peanut allergy. Here are some medications your doctor may prescribe to treat a peanut allergy: Antihistamines Antihistamines can help reduce allergy symptoms, such as itching, skin rashes, and nasal congestion. Some examples of available antihistamines are cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. Corticosteroids These compounds can help reduce inflammation and swelling caused by peanut allergies. Corticosteroids are available in pill or injection form. Some examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone. Epinephrine This compound is a drug used to treat serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. Epinephrine works by narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate, thereby helping to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, itching, and swelling.",

        "title": "Food Allergies Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Food Allergies A food allergy is a condition in which the immune system mistakenly assumes a substance, such as a protein in a particular food, is harmful to the body. As a result, the immune system will react to food substances that are classified as dangerous or allergens. Even small amounts of an allergenic food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, this allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. In addition, this condition can be acute or sudden, but it can also be chronic or last for a long time. Food allergies are often confused with another health condition, food intolerance. However, they are two different health conditions. Because food intolerance is a reaction from the digestive system. It has nothing to do with antibodies like food allergies. Food Allergy Symptoms A person who experiences this condition can experience various symptoms in his body. A person can experience these symptoms with mild or high intensity depending on the amount of allergen they consume. The symptoms include: A reddish rash that appears on the surface of the skin. Itchy rash. Tingling in the oral cavity. Difficulty swallowing. Swelling of the mouth, face, and other parts of the body. Nausea and vomiting. Itchy eyes. Sneeze. Shortness of breath or labored breathing. Dizzy. Stomach ache or diarrhea. Dry, cracked, red, and itchy skin. The genital and anal areas appear reddish. Constipation. Heartburn. More frequent bowel movements. There is mucus or blood in the stool when defecating. Pale skin. Seems more fussy in babies. In addition, food allergies in some cases can cause anaphylaxis, the symptoms of which can include: Heart beats fast. Hard to breathe. Sudden anxiety and fear. Blood pressure drops drastically. Unconscious or fainting. Food Allergy Risk Factors Anyone can experience it, but there are several factors that can increase the risk, such as: 1. Family history Allergies can run in families. If a close family member has asthma or any allergic disease, including food allergies, eczema, and seasonal allergies, the person is more likely to develop the condition. 2. History of other food allergies If you already have an allergy to one food, you may be at higher risk of developing allergies to other foods. Likewise, if you have other types of allergic reactions, such as hay fever or eczema, your risk of developing a food allergy is greater. 3. Age Babies and children are more susceptible to food allergies. However, as they get older, their digestive tracts become more mature in digesting foods that can trigger allergies. 4. Gut bacteria Some studies suggest that people with peanut or seasonal allergies may have altered gut bacteria conditions. Foods That Are Prone to Causing Allergies There are several types of food that accumulate approximately 90 percent of allergies that people have. These foods also fall into the category of eight major allergens. Here are the types of food and drinks. Egg. Fish. Milk. Nuts that come from trees. Peanuts. Seafood. Soya bean. Wheat. Causes of Food Allergies Not a few people have difficulty finding the cause of their allergies. However, this condition usually occurs due to the following: 1. Immune system Antibodies are special proteins produced by the immune system to protect the body. Well, antibodies work by identifying potential dangers that threaten the body, such as bacteria and viruses. The job of antibodies is to signal the immune system to release chemicals to kill the threat and prevent the spread of infection. In the most common type of allergy, antibodies known as immunoglobulin E (IgE), mistakenly target certain proteins in food as a threat. IgE can cause several chemicals to be released, the most important of which is histamine. 2. Histamine Most of the typical symptoms that appear during an allergic reaction are due to histamine. Well, this substance can cause symptoms such as: Dilation of small blood vessels, so the skin becomes red and swollen. Affects the nerves in the skin, causing itching. Increases the amount of mucus produced in the lining of the nose which causes itching and burning sensations. In most cases, histamine release is limited to a specific part of the body, such as the mouth, throat, or skin. 3. Non-IgE mediated allergies Another type of food allergy is non-IgE-mediated food allergy, which occurs due to different cells in the immune system. This condition is much more difficult for doctors to diagnose because there is no accurate test to confirm a non-IgE-mediated food allergy. This type of reaction is mostly limited to the skin and digestive system, causing symptoms such as heartburn, indigestion, and eczema. In infants, non-IgE-mediated food allergies can also cause diarrhea and reflux, where stomach acid rises into the throat. 4. Certain foods In children, the foods that most often cause allergic reactions are eggs, milk and milk products, soy, wheat, and nuts. In adults, foods that often cause allergic reactions are nuts, fish, and seafood. Food Allergy Diagnosis To make a diagnosis, the doctor needs to ask a number of questions and perform tests. If symptoms develop rapidly, your doctor may recommend a skin prick test or blood test. However, if symptoms develop more slowly, your doctor may suggest a food elimination test. 1. Ask questions First of all, the doctor will ask you several questions about the patterns and symptoms you are experiencing, such as: How long does it take for symptoms to appear after exposure to food? How long do the symptoms last? How severe are the symptoms? Is this the first time these symptoms have occurred? If not, how often do they occur? What foods might be the culprit and how much to consume? Do you have any allergies or other allergic conditions? Is there a history of allergies in the family? Is (or is) the child breastfed or bottle-fed? In children, the doctor may need to assess the child\u2019s weight and size to ensure that their growth is appropriate for their age. 2. Skin prick test During a skin prick test, your doctor will place a drop of food extract on your arm. The skin is then pricked with a small lancet, allowing the allergen to come into contact with cells of the immune system. Itching, redness, and swelling are signs that indicate a positive reaction. The test is usually painless. 3. Blood test An alternative to the skin prick test is a blood test. This test aims to measure the amount of allergic antibodies in the blood to certain foods. To perform this test, the doctor will take a blood sample for examination in the laboratory. 4. Food elimination test In a food elimination test, a person must avoid foods that are likely to cause an allergic reaction for 2-6 weeks. The food is then reintroduced afterward. If symptoms disappear when food consumption stops, but reappear after the allergic person consumes the food, then this condition usually indicates a food allergy or intolerance. Food Allergy Complications Food allergies rarely cause serious complications. However, in severe cases, they can cause serious complications. Well, here are some food allergy complications that you need to be aware of, namely: 1. Anaphylaxis In some people, allergies can trigger a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. This condition can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, such as: Narrowing and tightening of the airways. A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in the throat that makes it difficult for a person to breathe. Shock with severe drop in blood pressure. Rapid pulse. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness, Seek medical help immediately or go to the emergency room if you or someone around you experiences the above signs. 2. Atopic dermatitis Eczema or atopic dermatitis is another complication of this allergy. This condition can cause itchy skin reactions and redness of the skin (eczema). Food Allergy Treatment The only way to completely treat an allergic reaction is to avoid the food that causes the allergy. However, there are several things you can do to ease the reaction. For mild allergic reactions, over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines can help reduce symptoms. You can take this medicine after being exposed to food that causes allergies to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines cannot treat severe allergic reactions. For severe allergic reactions, you may need an emergency epinephrine injection. If your doctor has prescribed epinephrine for you to use, you should make sure that both you and those around you understand how to operate the injection in an emergency. In addition, make sure to always have an injection ready in case you suddenly experience an allergy. Having extra, unexpired epinephrine on hand is also a good safety measure. Researchers have studied the use of oral immunotherapy as a treatment for food allergies. This therapy delivers small doses of the food you are allergic to. The doctor will ask the patient to swallow or place the food under the tongue (sublingual). Then the dose will be increased gradually under the supervision of a doctor. Food Allergy Prevention The most appropriate way to prevent allergic reactions is to know and avoid foods that cause allergies. Always read food and drink labels carefully to see if there are any ingredients that could cause allergies. If you are visiting a restaurant, ask the waiter about the ingredients on the menu that you want. The goal is to make sure there are no ingredients that can trigger allergies. If there are food and drink ingredients that can trigger allergies, ask the chef to remove them. For children, don\u2019t forget to tell the teacher or childcare staff if your little one has certain food allergies.",

        "text": "You must have seen someone whose skin and hair are white. This condition occurs because the person has albinism. This disorder occurs because the body lacks or does not have the pigment melanin. Albinism has several levels of severity, ranging from white skin and hair, thin hair, to vision problems. It can affect anyone, but the likelihood depends on the region. In Africa, albinism can affect one in every 5,000-15,000 people. In Europe and the United States, albinism can affect one in every 17,000-20,000 people. Albinism can affect both sexes equally and all races. What is Albinism? Albinism is a hereditary disease characterized by a much lower level of melanin production than normal people. Melanin is a pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color. People with albinism generally have lighter skin and hair than their family members or people around them. In addition, they may also have vision problems, which is common for them. Melanin normally protects the skin from damage caused by sunlight or ultraviolet. Therefore, someone with albinism will be more sensitive to sun exposure. In addition, people with albinism are also at risk of developing skin cancer if exposed to sunlight for too long. Facts about Albinism Here are some facts about albinism that you may not know: Although albinism is one of the safest genetic disorders a person can have, it can also cause certain health problems. The most common problem is a vision problem called ocular albinism. Certain types of albinism can be passed from mother to child and can cause serious problems, such as blindness. Even if no damage occurs, the lack of pigmentation in the eyes can cause extreme sensitivity to light and abnormal retinal development. The physical appearance of a person with albinism looks different from normal people. Generally, albino people have blue or gray eyes. Even in some cases, the eyes of sufferers of this disorder are pink or red. A person with albinism must pay more attention to their eye health because their vision is considered low. These people must use contact lenses or glasses to correct their weak vision. A person with this skin color disorder does not have the pigmentation that can protect their skin from direct exposure to sunlight. Albinism not only occurs in humans but can also occur in animals. This skin pigmentation disorder cannot be transmitted, either through blood transfusion, skin contact, or through organisms that can spread the disease. Albinism is an incurable disorder, as the root cause of the disease is genetic. However, the eye and skin problems are a result of the disorder and can be treated in the right way.",

        "title": "Alkaptonuria Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria or black urine disease is a rare disease that occurs due to a genetic mutation of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD). The HGD gene mutation that occurs causes the homogentisate oxidase enzyme to fail to work properly. This enzyme functions to break down and decompose two amino acids called tyrosine and phenylalanine. People with this disease experience a buildup of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body, causing urine and certain body parts to turn dark. This disease can occur since childhood but can go undetected until adulthood because it sometimes does not cause symptoms. This disease is quite rare because it only occurs in one in every 250,000 people in the world. There are certain countries that have more cases of this disease than other countries. However, you need to know that this disease can occur in men and women of all ages. Symptoms of Alkaptonuria The typical early symptom of too much HGA in the body is dark to black urine, which usually occurs from birth. Beyond that, symptoms of this condition can occur in almost any part of the body, from tendons, bones, nails, ears, and liver. 1. Ochronosis and ochronotic osteoarthropathy Sufferers can experience ochronosis and ochronotic osteoarthropathy in adulthood with symptoms that are slow. Ochronosis is a bluish-black patch/color due to the accumulation of HGA in certain parts of the body, such as connective tissue. These symptoms usually begin to appear in the 3rd\u20135th decade and are found in the eyes and ears, and can also be present on the skin. In addition to the occurrence of a bluish-black color in the ears, thickening can also occur, such as in the ear cartilage. 2. Joint problems Symptoms such as pain or stiffness in the joints can also occur. Initially, the pain will be felt in the lower back, then spread to the knees, waist, and shoulders. These symptoms are similar to those of osteoarthritis. In severe cases, the sufferer\u2019s cartilage can also potentially weaken and become damaged. This can lead to joint damage and the need for joint replacement surgery. 3. Accumulation of homogentisic acid This can happen to connective tissues such as ligaments, bones (arthropathy), and tendons. These tissues will become blackish, weak, and easily damaged. This can cause thickening of the tendons or inflammation (tendonitis) in sufferers. 4. Organ problems Sufferers can also experience aortic valve stenosis in the heart, kidney stones, and prostate stones. This can occur due to homogentisic acid deposits in the organs so that the organs and blood vessels harden. 5. Discoloration of eyes, skin, and nails This disease can also cause black and brown spots to appear on the whites of the eyes. In addition, the skin and nails can also change color to have bluish or blackish spots. Skin color can change throughout the body. These changes are most visible in areas that have sweat glands such as the cheeks, forehead, and armpits. Risk Factors for Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria is a hereditary disease. This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning it can be inherited when both parents have the same abnormal gene but do not have symptoms. However, if one parent is normal and the other has alkaptonuria, the child is at risk of developing alkaptonuria but without symptoms. This disease can be experienced by anyone, both men and women. However, in men, this condition is more likely to develop with quite severe symptoms. Causes of Alkaptonuria The cause of alkaptonuria is a mutation in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene. This gene functions to control the production of the homogentisate oxidase enzyme which functions to break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine in the body. In the case of alkaptonuria sufferers, this gene is malfunctioning, which causes the sufferer\u2019s body to not have enough enzymes to break down both amino acids. As a result, homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulates in the sufferer\u2019s body. Under normal conditions, if there is excess homogentisic acid it will be excreted from the body by the kidneys. However, alkaptonuria disease causes homogentisic acid to not be excreted completely, so it accumulates in various body tissues and causes symptoms of alkaptonuria. Diagnosis of Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria can usually be diagnosed based on its typical symptoms, family history, and homogentisic acid level testing. In cases of family history, the disease occurs hereditarily from the parents\u2019 genes. A person must inherit two abnormal HGD genes, one from their mother and one from their father, to develop the disease. This is so rare that the condition is considered rare. In some cases, people with alkaptonuria have bone or joint inflammation at a young age, but do not have complaints of dark urine. Homogentisic acid examination can be checked through urine examination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Another way can be done using X-ray and CT scan methods (imaging methods). This is done to determine the presence of joint, spinal, and heart valve disorders. Finally, by detecting HGD gene mutations with molecular examination. Treatment of Alkaptonuria Until now there is no treatment or therapy that can cure alkaptonuria. Because this disease occurs throughout life, the treatment is done to reduce symptoms and reduce the risk of worsening of the disease. Here are some ways to treat the disease that your doctor might recommend. 1. Nitisinone This drug can reduce the level of homogentisic acid in the body. Nitisinone can slow the rate of disease progression and its consumption needs to be with a doctor\u2019s recommendation. Nitisinone can be consumed by sufferers together with pain relievers. 2. Physiotherapy Doing physiotherapy can also be an option for people with alkaptonuria. If stable and routine, physiotherapy can build muscles and strengthen joints. Physiotherapy can also reduce the symptoms that sufferers experience. It is best to avoid strenuous activities while you are undergoing physiotherapy. You can also find out more about whether exercises such as Pilates Can Prevent Alkaptonuria. 3. Meet certain nutritional needs People with this disease should also consume foods low in tyrosine and phenylalanine protein, as well as consume ascorbic acid (vitamin C). A low-protein diet can also reduce the side effects of taking nitisinone. Complications of Alkaptonuria There are several complications that can occur due to this disease. Usually, the complications that occur are due to the severity of the disease and how long the sufferer has had this disease. The complications that can occur are: Arthritis. Heart disease. Kidney disorders. Prevention of Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria can be prevented by gene testing for every couple who are going to get married as an early detection. Especially, if one of the partners has a family history of this disease. When to See a Doctor? If you or your family have indications of symptoms or signs that point to alkaptonuria, immediately discuss it with a doctor to get the right treatment.",

        "title": "Alkalosis Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alkalosis Alkalosis is a medical condition that occurs when the pH level of human blood rises above the normal value, which is around 7.35 to 7.45. Under normal circumstances, human blood pH is well maintained in this range because it plays an important role in healthy body functions. However, when blood pH is too high, it can have negative effects on the human body. Alkalosis can be divided into two types, namely respiratory alkalosis and metabolic alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when a person hyperventilates or takes in too much oxygen. While metabolic alkalosis occurs when the body loses too much acid or produces too much bicarbonate. Symptoms of Alkalosis Minimal alkalosis can cause some unpleasant symptoms, although they are usually not serious. Some of the most common symptoms of minimal alkalosis include: Tingling and numbness in the hands and feet Unusual tiredness and fatigue Muscle cramps or spasms Headache Sleep disturbance or insomnia If the condition is not treated immediately, symptoms will get worse and can progress. These symptoms can lead to shock or even coma. Call emergency medical care immediately if someone experiences symptoms such as: Dizzy; Difficulty breathing; Confusion; Faint; Coma. Risk Factors for Alkalosis The following risk factors can increase the risk of alkalosis: Chronic lung disease; Chronic lung infection; Chronic kidney disease; Acute kidney injury; Loss of excessive fluids (dehydration) Causes of Alkalosis There are several factors that can cause alkalosis. Some of them include: Hyperventilation When someone hyperventilates, they take in too much oxygen and expel too much carbon dioxide from their body. This can cause the blood pH to rise, resulting in alkalosis. Increase consumption of alkaline foods Foods that contain a lot of alkali, such as fruits and vegetables, can increase blood pH. If someone consumes too much of these foods, it can cause alkalosis. Use of certain medications Some medications, such as diuretics and antacids, can cause the body to lose acid and lead to alkalosis. Diagnosis of Alkalosis The symptoms of this condition can be similar to other medical conditions, so it\u2019s important not to try to diagnose yourself. Make an appointment with your doctor to have a health evaluation. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. They will likely order tests to rule out other conditions. Common tests include: Urinalysis; Urine pH level test; Basic metabolic panel; Arterial blood gas analysis. Complications of Alkalosis The following are some complications that can occur in alkalosis: Paralysis Severe alkalosis can cause paralysis, which usually begins in the hands and feet. This condition results from decreased levels of calcium ions in the blood, which affects nerve and muscle function. Seizures Alkalosis can increase the likelihood of seizures. This is because high blood pH can affect nerve activity and trigger seizures. Calcium Loss Alkalosis can cause calcium loss from the bones and can affect long-term bone health. This is especially true in metabolic alkalosis, which is usually due to loss of stomach acid or the use of certain medications. Electrolyte Imbalance Disorders High pH levels can affect the electrolyte balance in the body, which can affect the function of organs and systems in the body. Alkalosis can cause disturbances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels, which can affect general health and fluid balance in the body. Heart Failure and Death Severe alkalosis can affect heart function and can lead to heart failure or death. This is especially true of severe respiratory alkalosis, which is usually the result of a serious medical condition, such as a heart attack or stroke. Treatment and Prevention of Alkalosis Treatment of alkalosis depends on the cause. In mild cases of alkalosis, treatment can be done by stopping the triggering factor, such as stopping drugs that affect the blood\u2019s pH balance. In more severe cases of alkalosis, treatment involves providing therapy aimed at restoring the blood\u2019s pH balance. One treatment for alkalosis is the administration of intravenous fluids containing sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). This therapy aims to increase chloride levels in the blood and reduce bicarbonate levels. If alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation (breathing too fast), then the treatment that can be done is to reduce the frequency and depth of breathing. This therapy can be done by calming the patient or giving sedatives. It is important to identify and treat alkalosis quickly, as it can affect the function of organs such as the heart and brain. If you experience symptoms of alkalosis such as difficulty breathing, muscle cramps, or confusion, contact your doctor immediately for proper treatment. Prevention of alkalosis is also very important, namely by maintaining the acid-base balance in the body by consuming a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. If you have a history of alkalosis or a disease that can cause alkalosis, do not hesitate to consult a doctor for advice and proper treatment.",

        "title": "Egg Allergy Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Egg Allergy Egg allergy is a condition that causes an abnormal reaction from the immune system to egg protein. In this condition, the immune system recognizes eggs as a substance that can be harmful to the body. This then causes the immune system to push the body to release histamine. This is what causes allergy symptoms to appear. People with this condition can experience mild to severe symptoms. In general, egg white is the part of the egg that most often triggers allergies than the yolk. This allergy generally occurs in babies and will disappear before entering adolescence. Egg Allergy Symptoms Symptoms of this condition usually appear a few moments to a few hours after the sufferer consumes eggs or foods containing eggs. Some symptoms that appear due to this allergy are: Red rash on the skin. Itchy. Stuffy or runny nose and sneezing. Stomach cramps. Nausea and vomiting. Stomach ache. Diarrhea. Shortness of breath accompanied by wheezing. Cough. Chest pain. In rare cases, allergies to these foods can cause severe, life-threatening symptoms (anaphylaxis). Symptoms that can appear include: Rapid pulse. Swelling in the throat. Blood pressure drops drastically. Dizzy. Loss of consciousness or fainting. Egg Allergy Risk Factors There are several risk factors that make someone more susceptible to allergies, including: 1. Age Babies and children are more susceptible to allergies because their digestive tracts are not yet mature and perfect. The body\u2019s organs are also still unable to digest certain types of food properly, resulting in side effects on the body. 2. Family history Egg allergies can be hereditary. This means that someone can experience it if there are family members who are also allergic to the proteins contained in eggs. Hereditary allergies occur because certain genes are inherited from parents to children. 3. History of other allergies in the family Not only the same allergy, someone can also have a food allergy if one or both parents have other types of allergies. For example eczema, asthma, or rhinitis. This condition can affect the child\u2019s genes and cause allergies to certain foods. 4. Atopic dermatitis People with atopic dermatitis or skin inflammation are at higher risk of developing food allergies because their skin condition is already sensitive. Just like when allergies form, atopic dermatitis also appears in childhood. Causes of Egg Allergy Food allergies can occur because the body\u2019s immune system reacts more strongly than it should. In the context of foods such as eggs, the immune system identifies egg proteins as substances that are harmful to the body and not food. As a result, the body reacts by releasing histamine into the blood and causing an allergic reaction. Allergies can occur due to the egg white, the yolk, or both. In children, the most common allergy is egg white allergy. While in adults, egg yolks are more likely to cause allergies. In breastfed infants, allergies usually occur due to the mother\u2019s breast milk consuming eggs. This condition is also triggered by the imperfect digestive tract of infants and children. Egg Allergy Diagnosis You can get an egg allergy diagnosis through a complete medical examination with a doctor. In general, allergy testing can occur in several different ways, namely blood tests, physical, and consumption. Previously, the doctor will ask for a history of the disease and symptoms experienced by the sufferer, as well as a history of allergic diseases in both parents of the sufferer. Then, the doctor can do one or more tests to prove allergies. First, the doctor can perform a physical examination to see signs of allergies that appear on the sufferer\u2019s body. The doctor will place a small amount of egg protein on the surface of the sufferer\u2019s skin and observe the symptoms of allergies that arise. In addition, doctors can also give sufferers a small amount of eggs to consume so that symptoms can appear. Of course, this test is safe because the amount of allergen consumption is very small. The last option is to have a blood test to see the immune system\u2019s response to eggs by measuring the amount of antibodies in the blood. Once the patient is proven to have an allergy, the doctor will gradually advise the sufferer to eliminate eggs from their daily menu while observing the symptoms that arise. Egg Allergy Treatment Treatment for this allergy is to not consume eggs or foods containing eggs. Medicines from doctors aim to reduce the symptoms that arise. Some commonly used medicines are: 1. Antihistamine Antihistamines are a type of medication that can relieve allergy symptoms. You can use this medication after consuming eggs and feeling the symptoms. The purpose of its use is to avoid severe allergic reactions. For those with severe allergies, it is best to always have this medicine on hand to avoid serious side effects. 2. Adrenaline Not only hormones in the body, adrenaline is also an allergy reliever. Allergy sufferers can use this drug by injecting it into the skin to treat serious allergic reactions in the form of anaphylaxis. Sufferers with serious symptoms should go to the hospital immediately for further treatment. Egg Allergy Prevention The best way to prevent allergies is to not consume eggs or foods and drinks that contain eggs. Some efforts to prevent egg allergies that can be done include: Be careful about the contents of every food consumed, especially when eating out. Ask the waiter or chef about the egg content in the menu you are going to eat. Carefully read the labels on food packaging. In some cases, small amounts of egg content can also trigger allergy symptoms. For breastfeeding mothers whose babies have egg allergies, avoid consuming eggs because they can enter the breast milk that the baby will drink. Replace eggs with other commonly used substitute ingredients for food processing. Use a special bracelet or necklace for allergy sufferers when traveling outside the home. Tell your child\u2019s family or caregiver that your child has an egg allergy and explain what to do when allergy symptoms appear. Discuss with your doctor every time your child is going to be vaccinated because some vaccines, such as influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and yellow fever contain egg protein which can trigger allergic symptoms. Contact This Doctor If You Have an Egg Allergy If you experience signs and symptoms of allergies such as a red rash on the skin, itching, stuffy nose or runny nose and sneezing, or stomach cramps, after eating eggs, contact a doctor immediately. The doctor will provide consultation, advice, and treatment needed according to your condition.",

        "text": "Milk Allergy Milk allergy is a condition in which a person\u2019s immune system reacts to cow\u2019s milk protein and its derivatives. This allergy is prone to targeting children, although some adults can also experience this allergy throughout their lives. These allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe and can affect the digestive system, skin, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. This allergy can also mean a reaction of the immune system to products derived from milk. This condition is generally prone to occur in children, especially when consuming cow\u2019s milk or its derivatives. However, it is possible that this condition can be caused by goat\u2019s milk, sheep\u2019s milk, or other mammals. The milk proteins that most often cause allergies are whey and casein. Milk Allergy Symptoms Allergy symptoms usually appear one hour after consuming milk. Symptoms include: Vomit. The breath sounds wheezy. Redness of the skin. Itchy. Swollen. Diarrhea or loose stools accompanied by blood in the stool. Stomach cramps. Cough. Runny nose. Watery eyes. Itchy red rash around the mouth. The presence of colic in babies is characterized by the baby crying non-stop and without any clear reason. Allergy symptoms usually appear within minutes to hours after consuming cow\u2019s milk products and their derivatives. However, in some cases, symptoms may appear within 24 to 48 hours. In severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) the following symptoms may occur: The airways and throat are blocked, resulting in shortness of breath. Blood pressure drops drastically. Red face and itching all over the body. First-aid measures should be taken if anaphylaxis occurs. Sufferers should immediately receive medical help at the hospital. Risk Factors Some people are at higher risk of developing allergies (susceptible) than others. Some of these include: There is a history of allergies in family members, for example asthma, eczema, rhinitis, hay fever. Babies and children are more susceptible to it because their digestive system is not yet perfect. However, this condition will improve with age and maturity of the digestive tract. There is a history of atopic dermatitis (skin inflammation originating from allergies in children). Having allergies to other foods that generally develop after the allergy occurs. Causes of Milk Allergy The main cause of this allergy is a disruption in the sufferer\u2019s immune system which incorrectly identifies the protein in milk as a substance that is harmful to the body. This triggers the immune system to produce Immunoglobulin E to neutralize the allergen and release histamine into the blood, causing allergy symptoms. Milk allergy is different from lactose intolerance. If the allergy is caused by a disorder of the immune system, while lactose intolerance occurs because the body is not yet able to accept certain substances, and has nothing to do with the sufferer\u2019s immune system. This allergy occurs when a person\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies cow\u2019s milk protein as a threat and produces antibodies to fight it. It causes allergic reactions when a person consumes cow\u2019s milk products and its derivatives. Some of the most common cow\u2019s milk proteins that cause allergies are casein and whey. Risk factors for developing this allergy include: Family history of allergies This allergy History of other food allergies Age: children are more likely to experience this allergy than adults. Digestive disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) High environmental exposure to allergens Milk Allergy Diagnosis Some steps that the doctor will take to confirm the diagnosis are as follows: Asking about the sufferer and their family\u2019s history of allergies, including what foods and drinks they have eaten, the allergy symptoms that arise, and whether the symptoms decrease or disappear when the food is stopped. Physical examination to check for indications of allergies in the sufferer\u2019s body. Blood sample testing to check the levels of Immunoglobulin E antibodies in the sufferer\u2019s blood. Test through the skin, usually by making a small wound on the surface of the sufferer\u2019s skin. The small wound on the skin will show a small amount of milk protein. If during observation a small itchy lump appears in the area, it indicates a milk allergy. Milk Allergy Complications Children who experience this condition are at greater risk of experiencing other health problems, such as: Allergies to other foods, such as eggs, soy, peanuts, or beef. Hay fever. This is a common reaction to pet dander, dust mites, grass pollen, and other substances. Milk Allergy Treatment In children, this condition will disappear with age. However, in some cases, there are children who continue to have allergies into adulthood. The most important treatment is to avoid milk and food products containing milk. Consumption of drugs to reduce allergy symptoms are: Antihistamines have the benefit of reducing discomfort due to symptoms originating from allergic reactions. Adrenaline to treat severe allergy symptoms (anaphylaxis) by injection by a doctor. Milk Allergy Prevention Avoiding allergies to milk is by not consuming milk or products containing milk or milk protein. Some products that contain milk or its proteins are butter, yogurt, pudding, cakes, ice cream, cheese, foods containing lactose or lactate, candy, chocolate, caramel, and products containing whey and casein. In breastfeeding mothers, the way to prevent cow\u2019s milk allergy in babies is to provide exclusive breastfeeding without adding formula milk or other drinks and foods during the first 6 months of the baby\u2019s life. Breast milk is considered the best food and can prevent allergies in babies. If a baby has been diagnosed with this allergy, the doctor will advise the mother not to consume cow\u2019s milk or products containing cow\u2019s milk so that the substance does not enter the baby through breast milk. If your child is not breastfed, there are several alternatives. Giving hypoallergenic formula milk, soy milk, or rice milk can be an alternative substitute to prevent symptoms. Mothers can consult a doctor if their child has symptoms and provide replacement formula milk according to the doctor\u2019s recommendations.",

        "text": "Allergies in Children Allergies are a problem with the immune system. Normally, the human body defends itself against harmful things, such as viruses or bacteria. However, sometimes the defense system violently attacks something that is actually harmless, such as dust, pollen, or mold. Allergy triggers are called allergens. When a child with allergies is exposed to that allergen, their immune system mistakenly believes it is harmful to their body. As a result, their body\u2019s defenses overreact, treating the substance as an invader and trying to fight it off. To protect the body, the immune system makes antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). These cause certain cells to release chemicals (including histamine) into the bloodstream to defend against the allergen \u201cinvader.\u201d The release of these chemicals is what causes allergic reactions. Reactions can affect the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and future exposure to the same allergen will trigger the allergic response again. Allergy Symptoms in Children Allergic reactions can occur anywhere in the body. This includes the skin, eyes, stomach lining, nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. This is where immune system cells can be found to fight germs that are inhaled, swallowed, or come into contact with the skin. Allergic reactions can cause children to experience the following symptoms: Stuffy nose, sneezing, itching, or runny nose, and itching in the ears or roof of the mouth. Red, itchy, watery eyes. Red, itchy, dry skin. Hives or itchy bumps. Itchy rash. Asthma symptoms, such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing. A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can also occur. This can cause difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, fainting, or death. Risk Factors for Allergies in Children Any child can develop allergies, but the condition is more common in children from families with a history of allergies. This is because allergies can be passed down through genes from parents to children. However, it does not mean that children who have parents with allergies will definitely experience it too. A person usually does not inherit a specific allergy, but only the possibility of having an allergy. Some children can develop the health condition, even though no family member has allergies. In addition to genetics, children who are allergic to one thing are also at high risk of developing allergies to others. Causes of Allergies in Children There are many things that can trigger allergic reactions in children. However, the most common triggers or allergens are: Tree, grass, and weed pollen. Natural rubber latex. Mold. Dust mites. Fur, urine, or oil from animal skin. Certain types of foods, such as eggs, nuts, milk. Some types of drugs. Hair. Bee sting. Pests such as cockroaches and rats. Diagnosis of Allergies in Children If your child has flu-like symptoms that last more than a week or two or has the \u2018flu\u2019 at the same time every year, take him to the doctor. The doctor will likely take your child\u2019s complete medical history and recommend allergy testing. Here are some tests that can be used to diagnose allergies in children: 1. Skin test This is the most common allergy test. A skin test measures the presence of IgE antibodies to a specific allergen (such as food, pollen, or animal dander). In this test procedure, a small amount of diluted allergen is placed on the skin. The area is pricked or scratched. If a person is allergic to the allergen, a small bump (like a mosquito bite) appears after about 15 minutes. 2. Blood test This test measures IgE antibodies to specific allergens in the blood. A blood test may be used if your child cannot have a skin test because they have a skin condition or if they are very sensitive to a particular allergen. However, a positive blood test does not always mean that the child has a specific allergy. The positive result still needs to be interpreted by a doctor who is familiar with the test and the child\u2019s medical history. 3. Challenge test This test needs to be supervised by an allergist. A small amount of the allergen will be given to the child by mouth (consumed) or inhaled. Only a challenge test can tell how severe an allergy is. A skin or blood test reaction only tells you the likelihood of some type of reaction, not how severe it is. Allergy Treatment in Children There is no cure for allergies, but you can manage the symptoms. The best way to manage them is to avoid the allergen. Parents should talk frequently with their children about allergies themselves and the reactions they may experience if they consume or come into contact with allergens. Tell all caregivers, from nurses to teachers, about your child\u2019s allergies. If avoiding allergens is not possible, your doctor can prescribe medications, including antihistamines, eye drops, and nasal sprays. In some cases, doctors recommend allergy shots (immunotherapy) to help desensitize a child to an allergen. However, this treatment is only useful for allergens such as dust, mold, pollen, animals, and insect stings. Allergy shots are not used for food allergies. Allergy Complications in Children Here are some allergy complications that can occur in children: Anaphylaxis. This is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening for a child. Asthma. If a child has allergies, they are more likely to develop asthma. This is triggered by exposure to allergens in the environment (allergy-induced asthma). Sinusitis and ear or lung infections. The risk of developing these conditions is higher if you have a cold or asthma. Allergy Prevention in Children Here are some ways that can be done to prevent allergies: Stay indoors on windy days to avoid blowing pollen around. Clean as much dust as possible in the house, especially in the child\u2019s bedroom. Use air conditioning instead of opening windows. Place the dehumidifier in a humid area of \u200b\u200byour home. But remember to clean it often. After playing outside, ask your child to immediately take a shower or bath, wash his hair, and change clothes. Avoid traveling or vacationing to places where pollen is high, such as parks, etc.",

        "text": "What is a Drug Allergy? A drug allergy is an allergic reaction of the immune system to a particular drug. The immune system misidentifies a drug as a substance that is harmful to the body. Both chemical and herbal drugs can cause allergic reactions. The immune system basically helps protect the body from disease. The immune system is designed to fight disease-causing agents, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and other harmful substances. However, in cases of drug allergies, the immune system mistakes the drug entering the body as one of the body\u2019s invaders. The body responds to the drug as a threat, so the immune system begins to make antibodies. It is a special protein programmed to attack threats. But unfortunately in this case it is a drug that is being attacked. Drug Allergy Symptoms Symptoms usually occur a few hours after taking the drug. However, symptoms can also develop gradually, not appearing immediately when first using the drug. In some cases, new symptoms appear after a few days or weeks of using the drug. Common symptoms experienced by sufferers include: Red rash or bumps on the skin. Itchy. Fever. Swollen. Shortness of breath or noisy breathing. Runny nose. Cough. Itchy and watery eyes. In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis may be accompanied by: The heart beats fast. The airways and throat narrow, making it difficult to breathe. Restless and anxious. Dizzy. Loss of consciousness or fainting. Blood pressure drops drastically. In very serious and life-threatening conditions, symptoms may be accompanied by: The skin is reddish and painful. The outer skin peels off. The skin looks blistered. Fever. The rash or blisters spread to the eyes, mouth, and genital area. If severe or very serious allergy symptoms are found, the sufferer must be rushed to the hospital immediately. Causes of Drug Allergies It\u2019s possible that you may not be aware of your initial exposure to a drug. Some evidence suggests that some drugs, such as antibiotics, may be good for the immune system in making antibodies. Some drug allergic reactions may occur through a different process. Researchers believe that some drugs may bind directly to a type of white blood cell (T cell) in the immune system. This event triggers the release of chemicals that can cause an allergic reaction the first time a person uses the drug. Allergies are also caused by the immune system incorrectly identifying a drug as a substance that is harmful to the body. As a result, the body will produce antibodies and cause allergic symptoms to arise. Some drugs that can cause allergies are: Antibiotics (for example Penicillin). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (anti-inflammatory). Aspirin. Corticosteroid creams or lotions. Anti-seizure (anticonvulsant). Autoimmune disease medications. Herbal medicines. Insulin. Vaccine. Hyperthyroidism medications. Chemotherapy drugs. Drugs for HIV and AIDS infections. Bee pollen products. Contrast materials used in imaging tests ( radiocontrast media ). Anesthetics. Drug Allergy Risk Factors Not everyone is at risk for it. Some risk factors are: Increased exposure to a drug, for example, due to repeated use, over a long period of time, or at high doses. Heredity. If a family member has an allergy to a drug, a person is at greater risk of developing it. Having other types of allergies, such as food allergies. Having allergies to other drugs, for example, someone who is allergic to penicillin will also be allergic to amoxicillin. Having certain diseases, such as HIV or Epstein-Barr virus infection. Drug Allergy Diagnosis Diagnosis is carried out through several steps, including: Travel history of drug allergies, history of other allergies, and family history of allergies. Physical examination related to allergy symptoms, including red rashes, blisters, and checking the condition of the sufferer\u2019s respiratory tract and heart. Laboratory tests include skin tests and blood tests. Drug Allergy Treatment How to manage this condition depends on how severe it is. With a severe reaction, a person should avoid the drug completely. The doctor may replace the drug with another type of anti-inflammatory drug that does not cause allergies. If someone has a mild reaction, their doctor may still prescribe it. However, it is also possible that the doctor will prescribe other medications to control allergic reactions. Certain medications can help block the immune response and reduce symptoms. These medications include: Antihistamines The body makes histamine when an allergen enters the body. The release of histamine can trigger allergy symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation. Antihistamines block the production of histamine and can calm the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Antihistamines come in the form of pills, eye drops, creams, and nasal sprays. Corticosteroids This condition can cause swelling of the airways and other serious symptoms. Corticosteroids can help reduce the inflammation that causes these problems. Bronchodilator If allergies cause wheezing or coughing, your doctor may recommend a bronchodilator. This medicine helps open the airways and makes breathing easier. Bronchodilators are available as liquids and powders for use in inhalers or nebulizers. Drug Allergy Prevention If you have a drug allergy, the best prevention is to avoid the problem drug. Steps you can take to prevent this include: Inform your doctor or healthcare provider. Make sure that the allergy is clearly identified in your medical records. Also inform other healthcare providers, such as your dentist or other medical specialists. Wear identification that shows drug allergies. This can be a medical alert bracelet that identifies allergies. This information can ensure proper care in an emergency.",

        "text": "Health Benefits of Black Rice: Black rice, also known as forbidden or purple rice, is a variety of rice that belongs to the Oryza sativa L. species. The distinctive black-purple color of black rice comes from a pigment called anthocyanin, which has powerful antioxidant properties. This deep purple-black rice variety is not only beautiful but also has a long history of being consumed by the wealthy and royalty. In ancient China, it was forbidden for all but royalty to eat black rice. However, today it is a staple in numerous cuisines around the world, due to its mild, nutty flavor, chewy texture, and nutritional benefits. There are two varieties of Oryza sativa rice, japonica and indica. Japonica is a stickier and short-grained rice that is grown in drier, upland fields, while indica is a long-grained rice that is grown in submerged, lowland fields.5 Health Benefits of Turmeric CoffeeBlack rice has a number of health benefits. The deep color of the grain is attributed to the presence of anthocyanins, which have potent antioxidant properties. These pigments help to protect cells against damage, and they can also help to reduce inflammation and the risk of cardiovascular conditions. In addition, eating black rice can help to improve heart health and overall fitness.Let us read some more health benefits of black rice below.1. Improves Heart Health: Research on black rice\u2019s impact on heart health is limited. However, many of its antioxidants, including flavonoids and anthocyanins, have been found to contribute to heart health. Flavonoids have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease and death, while anthocyanins may improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels.2. Supports Weight Loss: Black rice is a good source of protein and fiber. These nutrients can aid in weight loss by reducing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness. Early animal research suggests that anthocyanins, present in black rice, may contribute to reduced body weight and body fat percentage. While human studies on black rice\u2019s role in weight loss are limited, it is effective in promoting weight reduction when combined with brown rice.5 Health Benefits of Sparkling Water3. Promotes Eye Health: Black rice contains high amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are carotenoids that support eye health. These compounds act as antioxidants, protecting the eyes from potentially harmful free radicals. Lutein and zeaxanthin, in particular, have been shown to safeguard the retina by filtering out harmful blue light waves.4. Reduces Cancer Risk: Black rice contains anthocyanins, which have been linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, according to a review of population-based studies. More research is needed to fully understand the ability of anthocyanins in black rice to prevent and combat the spread of specific types of cancer.5 Health Benefits of Jasmine Rice5. Helps in Managing Diabetes: Flavonoids, such as anthocyanins present in black rice, have a positive impact on the body. They enhance insulin sensitivity, allowing the cells to make better use of glucose. Additionally, they reduce sugar digestion in the small intestines, leading to low blood sugar levels.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "text": "Health Benefits of Probiotics: Probiotic supplements are live microorganisms that claim to enhance human health by altering the bacteria and other microorganisms in the digestive tract. Probiotics are found in fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, kombucha, and pickles. They are also available as dietary supplements.Although probiotics are gaining popularity due to their potential to promote digestive health and improve symptoms of certain medical conditions, they are not safe for everyone.Probiotic supplements contain high concentrations of beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts. They may contain a single or multiple strains of probiotics. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most common probiotic species in these supplements. Let us read about the health benefits of probiotics below.5 Health Benefits of Black RiceFollowing are some of the impressive health benefits of probiotics.1. Maintain Microbiome: Probiotics alter the levels of microorganisms in the intestines, improving the overall composition, which is referred to as microbiome. When that composition is out of balance, doctors refer to it as dysbiosis. Probiotics can treat dysbiosis by increasing the number of beneficial bacteria and decreasing the number of harmful bacteria.2. Promote Weight Loss: It is believed that probiotics can aid in weight loss as the microbes in our gut play a vital role in breaking down food and converting it into energy. A healthy microbiome is thought to enhance calorie burning and reduce fat storage. Research has revealed differences in gut microbes between obese and lean individuals. However, studies on the effectiveness of probiotics for weight loss have yielded inconsistent findings. Some studies have shown that individuals consuming probiotics experienced greater weight and body fat loss compared to those who did not, while other studies reported no significant difference. Surprisingly, a few studies even observed weight gain among those taking probiotics.5 Health Benefits of Turmeric Coffee3. Prevents Infections: The beneficial microbes that live in different parts of our bodies help us in a variety of ways. One of the most important ways is by fighting off the more harmful types of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites that might also want to live with us. Probiotics, in theory, fight on the side of our beneficial microbes. Many probiotic products are formulated with beneficial bacteria and yeasts to prevent or recover from bacterial or yeast infections in different body parts, including atopic dermatitis of the skin, dental cavities, vaginal and urinary tract infections (UTIs), and more.4. Enhance Mental Health: Several studies have linked gut health to mood and mental health. According to researchers, probiotic supplements may play a critical role in some mental health disorders. Supplementing for 1-2 months with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains has been shown to enhance anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and memory, as per a review of human studies.5 Health Benefits of Sparkling Water5. Promote Heart Health: Probiotics may contribute to heart health by lowering LDL bad) cholesterol and blood pressure. Certain lactic acid-producing bacteria can reduce cholesterol by breaking down bile in the gut. Bile, a naturally occurring fluid primarily composed of cholesterol, aids in digestion. By breaking down bile, probiotics prevent its reabsorption in the gut, thereby reducing the amount of cholesterol that can enter the blood. High cholesterol level in the blood is one of the main reasons behind many heart issues.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Hepatitis E: Here's Everything You Need To Know",
        "text": "Hepatitis E is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). It is a waterborne disease that primarily affects the liver and is most common in regions with poor sanitation, such as parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Central America. Hepatitis E can be acute but usually does not become chronic, and in most cases, people recover fully. However, it can be dangerous for pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems. In this article, we discuss the signs, causes, and prevention tips for hepatitis E. Causes 1. Contaminated water The virus is most often spread through drinking water that has been contaminated with faeces containing the hepatitis E virus. Outbreaks typically occur in areas with poor sanitation or during natural disasters that disrupt water systems. 2. Undercooked or contaminated food In some cases, eating raw or undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish (which may carry HEV) can also transmit the virus, especially in developed countries. 3. Poor hygiene practices The virus can be transmitted through contact with an infected person's stool, such as when hygiene practices (like handwashing) are not followed after using the bathroom. 4. Blood transfusions Rarely, hepatitis E can spread through transfusions of infected blood, especially in countries where the virus is endemic. Signs Hepatitis E usually presents symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 6 weeks. While some cases may be asymptomatic (especially in children), the common signs and symptoms of hepatitis E include: Fatigue: Feeling unusually tired and weak.Jaundice: A yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by increased bilirubin levels.Dark Urine and Pale Stools: The liver's reduced ability to process bilirubin causes darker urine and pale, clay-coloured stools.Abdominal Pain: Typically felt in the upper right side of the abdomen, where the liver is located.Nausea and Vomiting: A general feeling of sickness, including loss of appetite and frequent vomiting.Fever: A mild fever may accompany other symptoms.Joint and Muscle Pain: Body aches are common during the acute phase.Enlarged Liver (Hepatomegaly): In some cases, the liver may become swollen and tender. Prevention tips Preventing hepatitis E involves proper hygiene and sanitation practices, especially in areas where the virus is prevalent. Here are some prevention strategies: Always drink clean, safe, and treated water. If you are in a region with questionable water quality, boil water before drinking, or use bottled water for drinking and cooking.Especially in areas with poor sanitation, avoid eating raw or undercooked meats (especially pork and shellfish) and fruits or vegetables that may have been washed in contaminated water.Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water, especially after using the bathroom, handling food, or coming into contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or materials.Ensure proper disposal of human waste and use appropriate sewage treatment systems to avoid contaminating water sources.In regions where hepatitis E is common, blood donations should be carefully screened for HEV.Although not widely available, a vaccine for hepatitis E (Hecolin) is licensed in China and may become more available in the future, especially in high-risk areas. Follow these prevention tips and look out for the signs and causes to reduce your risk of hepatitis E. Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Cod liver oil, a popular supplement derived from Atlantic cod fish, boasts a wealth of health benefits due to its rich content of essential nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. While similar to regular fish oil, cod liver oil stands out due to its higher vitamin D content, making it a valuable source of this often-deficient vitamin.Consuming cod liver oil may positively impact blood lipid levels, reduce inflammation, and strengthen bones. Athletes commonly use it to aid in muscle recovery.Both cod liver oil and regular fish oil are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are known for their anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects. However, cod liver oil is particularly noteworthy for its vitamin A content, crucial for immune system function, cellular growth, eye health, and reproduction.5 Health Benefits of Ridge GourdVitamin D, another abundant nutrient in cod liver oil, plays a vital role in bone health and brain development. Deficiency in vitamin D is a global concern, affecting over a billion people, and has been linked to various health issues, including bone fractures, metabolic syndrome, and potentially heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.Supplementing with cod liver oil offers a potent way to increase the intake of these essential vitamins and fatty acids, potentially providing numerous health advantages.Following are some of the impressive health benefits of cod liver oil.1. Improves Heart Health: The high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in cod liver oil helps reduce triglycerides, a type of fat in the body, and may contribute to preventing heart disease. While limited studies have specifically examined the effects of cod liver oil, numerous studies support the positive role of omega-3 fatty acids in heart health.2. Reduces Blood Lipid Levels: Cod liver oil can help balance lipid levels in the body, potentially reducing the risk of hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol. Although research specifically on cod liver oil is limited, some studies have observed a decrease in lipid levels when participants combined cod liver oil with cholesterol medications.5 Health Benefits of Probiotics3. Decreases Inflammation: Cod liver oil exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties. Vitamins A and D, both found in cod liver oil, act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, aiding in muscle recovery from soreness caused by inflammation.4. Improves Bone Health: Preserving bone health is of paramount importance as you advance in age. This is because your body starts losing bone mass after you turn 40. This can lead to fractures later in life, especially after menopause. Cod liver oil is an excellent dietary source of vitamin D and may reduce age-related bone loss. It does this by aiding your body in the absorption of calcium from the gut, which is a vital mineral for strong bones.5 Health Benefits of Black Rice5. Supports Eye Health: Over 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from vision loss, which is a serious health issue. Although there are many causes of vision loss, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma are two of the more common ones, and both can be caused by persistent inflammation. According to certain studies, glaucoma risk factors such as nerve damage and ocular pressure are decreased by omega-3 fatty acids. Cod liver oil is rich in Vitamin A, which in turn serves many health benefits. Diets rich in vitamin A may greatly reduce the risk of glaucoma and AMD compared to the low vitamin A diets. Although vitamin A is excellent for eye health, taking excessive amounts may lead to vitamin A toxicity and several associated health issues.(Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated by AI and published after the content was editorially modified and verified by a human based on their own judgement and expertise.

        "title": "Alopecia Areata Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Alopecia Areata Alopecia is the medical term for hair loss. One type is alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease, a condition in which the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body itself. This disease attacks hair follicles. Hair follicles are the structures where hair grows. This disease causes hair follicles on the head, face, or body to become smaller and stop producing hair, initially causing hair loss and eventually baldness if left untreated. Symptoms of Alopecia Areata Symptoms caused by alopecia areata include: Baldness in a circular pattern in one or more areas where hair used to grow, which is temporary but can also be permanent. Baldness that can spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) and even the entire body (alopecia universalis). Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, in the form of nails that change shape, have white lines with a thin and rough surface or are split. Baldness that can be accompanied by a burning or itching sensation on the scalp. Risk Factors for Alopecia Areata Various risk factors for alopecia areata include: History of the same disease in family members. Increasing age. Other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus erythematosus. Having abnormal nail color, shape, texture, or thickness. Psychological problems, such as stress, depression, anxiety, or paranoid disorders. Causes of Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system mistakenly attacks other parts of the body, in this case hair follicles. When this happens, hair growth shrinks and slows, and hair begins to fall out, often in clumps. The more hair follicles the immune system attacks, the more hair will fall out. The extent of hair loss varies. In some cases, it occurs in only a few places. However, hair loss can be more extensive. In some rare cases, a person can lose all the hair on their head (alopecia areata totalis) or their entire body (alopecia areata universalis). It is still not known for certain why the immune system attacks hair follicles. It is believed that a person\u2019s genetic makeup can be a trigger for autoimmune reactions to alopecia areata. In addition to genetics, alopecia areata can also be triggered by other autoimmune disorders. In a study found that people with a family history of alopecia areata, also have a personal history or other family members who suffer from other autoimmune disorders such as atopy. Atopy is a disorder characterized by a tendency towards hypoallergic, thyroiditis, and vitiligo. Types of Alopecia Areata There are several types of alopecia areata. Each type is characterized by the level of hair loss and other symptoms that may be experienced. Here are the types of alopecia areata: Patchy alopecia areata, the main characteristic of this type is that there are areas or patches of hair loss that only occur in certain areas of the body. Alopecia totalis occurs when hair loss affects the entire scalp. Alopecia universalis is hair loss that occurs not only in the head area but also other areas of the body. For example, the face, eyebrows, even eyelashes. Diffuse alopecia areata, this condition occurs when hair thins suddenly all over the scalp. Ophiasis alopecia is hair loss that occurs along the sides and in the lower scalp area. Diagnosis of Alopecia Areata There are several ways to diagnose alopecia areata. These include a physical examination, a medical interview, and if necessary, taking a skin biopsy sample and blood tests. Physical examination The doctor will examine the area of \u200b\u200bhair loss and the level of hair loss. In the area of \u200b\u200bhair loss, the hair will be pulled out slowly and it will be observed whether the hair comes off easily. Next, the doctor will examine the hair and follicles to see what their shape is, whether it is normal or not. Then the doctor will examine the nails. Medical interview Such as asking about current illnesses or family medical history. Performing a scalp biopsy sample The goal is to find out other causes of hair loss, such as a fungal infection called tinea capitis. During the biopsy, a small portion of the scalp is removed and then analyzed in a laboratory using a microscope. Blood test This supporting examination is performed if the patient is suspected of having an autoimmune disease. Blood tests are intended to check for abnormal antibodies, C-reactive protein levels, iron, thyroid hormones, testosterone hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Complications of Alopecia Areata Some complications of alopecia areata include: Baldness becomes permanent. Have a greater risk of developing or having a family history of asthma, allergies, and other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease and vitiligo. Psychological disorders in the form of emotional disorders due to lost self-confidence, which can develop into depression. Alopecia Areata Treatment Until now, a suitable treatment to cure alopecia areata has not been found. The treatment given aims to stimulate hair growth to grow back faster. The most common forms of alopecia areata treatment are corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs that can suppress the immune system. Most of these treatments are given through local injections, ointments, or oral medications. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that affect the body\u2019s immune system. They can be injected through the scalp or other areas. Corticosteroids can also be given as pills or applied to the skin as ointments, creams, or foams. Topical immunotherapy is a type of therapy used to treat baldness and stimulate hair growth. The treatment method is to apply chemicals to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction. If successful, this reaction can cause hair to grow back. Other medications prescribed to promote hair growth and suppress the immune system include minoxidil, anthralin, SADBE, and DCPC. While they help hair regrowth, they do not prevent new bald patches from forming. In addition to the treatment, alopecia areata sufferers are also advised to provide more protection in bald areas. Alopecia areata sufferers can use sunscreen when doing outdoor activities, or wear glasses to protect the eyes from sunlight and dirt. In addition, sufferers also need to use head protection such as hats, wigs, and scarves so that the scalp can be protected from sunlight, or to keep the scalp warm when the air is cold. Prevention of Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata cannot be prevented because the cause is unknown. This autoimmune disorder may be caused by several factors. Including family history, other autoimmune conditions, and even other skin conditions. However, there are several preventive measures that can be taken, including: Limit the use of hair care devices that risk damaging or drying out hair. Limit the use of chemicals for hair.",

        "text": "Tirupati: The SVR Ruia Government General Hospital here will soon have some additional facilities. The hospital development society (HDS) has decided to upgrade its medical services and infrastructure to \u201cbetter serve the underprivileged communities.\u201d The decision was made at an HDS meeting on Friday, chaired by district collector Venkateswar, in the presence of city MLA Arani Srinivasulu and municipal commissioner Mourya. The HDS stressed its commitment to providing quality medical care to the poor. The initiatives include the installation of 11 new CCTV cameras in key areas and four new Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants near operation theatres, ensuring clean water for critical medical facilities.The installation of the RO plants will be funded through the NTR Medical Services. The participants stressed the importance of collaboration among medical staff, engineers, and officials to strengthen the hospital\u2019s role in supporting the underprivileged communities. Venkateswar said this was the second HDS meeting under his leadership, and proposed regular discussions to address various long-pending issues. No meeting had taken place in the last 18 months. Only eight HDS meetings had been held in the last five years. The committee approved recruitment of two biomedical engineers and three oxygen technicians to enhance the hospital\u2019s operations. In addition, the purchase of 10 air conditioners for critical units like the SNCU, NICU, PICU and NRC was approved with funding provided by the college development society. HDS has limited resources. The hospital will install a glow sign board for better visibility of emergency services and build new restrooms near the Emergency department with a budget of `5 lakh, promised from the college development society. The meeting also discussed ongoing efforts to secure corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for emergency equipment and ambulance rental services for patient transfers. DM&HO, Dr Sreehari, hospital superintendent Dr Ravi Prabhu, SV Medical College principal Dr Chandrasekharan and representatives from various hospital departments, sanitation agencies, security services, and junior doctors were present.",

        "text": "At least seven people died on Saturday when part of a ferry dock collapsed on Sapelo Island, Georgia, during cultural day celebrations. The event was organised by the island\u2019s Gullah-Geechee community, descendants of Black slaves.The incident occurred at around 4:30 pm when a boat struck the dock, causing a gangway at the dock to collapse, plunging people into the water during the annual celebrations.\"Several people fell into the water after the collapse,\" a McIntosh County commissioner said, as reported by CNN.Authorities said that several individuals were taken to hospitals following the collapse. The exact number of injured remains unclear, according to the Georgia department of natural resources. The US coast guard, McIntosh County fire department, and Georgia department of natural resources are searching the water for more victims.\u201cThere have been seven confirmed fatalities,\u201d said natural resources department spokesperson Tyler Jones. \u201cMultiple people have been transported to area hospitals, and we are continuing to search the water for individuals.\u201dAccording to Jones, there were about 20 people on the dock when it collapsed. Among the fatalities was a chaplain for the state agency, Jones added.Search efforts involved helicopters and boats equipped with side-scanning sonar. Authorities are investigating the cause of the collapse.Georgia governor Brian Kemp expressed his sorrow over the incident, saying, \u201cAs state and local first responders continue to work this active scene, we ask that all Georgians join us in praying for those lost, for those still in harm\u2019s way, and for their families.\u201dSapelo Island, located about 60 miles south of Savannah, is accessible only by boat.

        "title": "Aortic Aneurysm Symptoms, Risk Factors & Treatment | Diseases List A-Z",
        "text": "Aortic Aneurysm\n\nAn aortic aneurysm is a condition where there is a balloon-like bulge that usually occurs due to weakening of the muscles in the aorta wall.\n\nThe aorta is the largest and most important blood vessel in the human body. Its function is to distribute oxygenated blood from the heart to all parts of the body.\n\nThe aorta has thick walls so it can maintain its shape even though the blood pressure inside it is relatively high.\n\nThis wall is actually strong and thick. However, in this condition, the wall becomes weak so that it is unable to withstand blood pressure.\n\nAs a result, the wall will start to enlarge. If the wall is torn or broken, this condition can cause bleeding, and can even be fatal.\n\nSymptoms of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nSymptoms of an aortic aneurysm can vary depending on its location. For example, in the abdominal aorta, chest (thoracic) or both (thoraco-abdominal).\n\nHowever, abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common than thoracic or both locations.\n\nIn some conditions, aneurysms with small swelling or bulging usually do not show any symptoms.\n\nHowever, if it gets bigger, then the sufferer will start to feel many symptoms depending on its location. For abdominal aneurysm sufferers, the symptoms that appear are:\n\nProlonged pain in the inner or side of the abdomen.\nPain in the back.\nIt feels like a throbbing sensation around the navel.\n\nMeanwhile, the symptoms that appear if you experience a thoracic or chest aneurysm include:\n\nBreath becomes short.\nFrequent coughing.\nThe voice becomes hoarse.\nFeeling pressure and pain in the chest.\nPain in the back.\n\nFurthermore, symptoms that may appear if the aortic aneurysm tears or ruptures (dissection), namely:\n\nSevere pain that occurs suddenly in the back, chest, and abdomen.\nDifficulty breathing.\nThe body feels very weak.\nMy head felt like it was spinning.\nThe heart beats very fast.\n\nMake sure a ruptured aortic aneurysm is treated immediately. Otherwise, it can cause severe bleeding which can be fatal.\n\nRisk Factors for Aortic Aneurysm\n\nIt is important to know the risk factors for aortic aneurysm, as this condition often appears during examinations for other conditions.\n\nWell, here are the various risk factors:\n\nThe risk of aortic aneurysm tends to increase with age. Older people have a greater chance of developing an aortic aneurysm.\n\nMen are at higher risk than women. However, women who have a family history of aortic aneurysm or other risk factors are also at higher risk.\n\nSmoking is a major risk factor for developing an aortic aneurysm. The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the artery walls and weaken them.\n\nFamily history\n\nIf a family member has had an aortic aneurysm, your risk of having one may increase because there are genetic factors involved.\n\nHypertension and heart disease\n\nHigh blood pressure can damage artery walls and increase the risk of this disease.\n\nSome congenital heart defects or medical conditions that affect blood flow in the body can also increase the risk of an aortic aneurysm.\n\nHistory of infection and injury\n\nInfections in the wall of the aorta, such as endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), can cause inflammation and damage the artery wall.\n\nInjury to the chest or abdomen, such as in a car accident or other traumatic event, can cause damage to the aortic wall and trigger the formation of an aneurysm.\n\nConnective tissue disease\n\nSome diseases that affect connective tissue, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, or other connective tissue diseases, can weaken the artery walls and increase the risk of aneurysm.\n\nThis condition can increase pressure on the arteries and worsen the risk of aneurysm.\n\nIn addition, doctors usually recommend that someone with the following criteria undergo screening:\n\nAged 65 or older.\nMale gender.\nHaving a bad habit of smoking.\nHave high blood pressure.\nSuffering from high cholesterol.\nThe presence of diabetes mellitus.\nHaving a family history of aneurysms.\nHaving a genetic disorder, such as Marfan syndrome. You can read the article Marfan Syndrome for complete information on this disease.\n\nCauses of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nThe cause of an aortic aneurysm is the weakening of one part of the blood vessel, resulting in a lump that is at risk of rupturing at any time.\n\nThe exact cause of this weakening of the blood vessels can vary from person to person, ranging from blood vessel disease, injury, to uncertain conditions.\n\nThis condition is divided into two types, namely:\n\n1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs along the abdominal aorta. This type of aneurysm is the most common, accounting for about \u00be of cases.\n\nThe cause of abdominal aortic aneurysm is still uncertain, but it is likely related to atherosclerosis, smoking, high blood pressure, and genetics.\n\n2. Thoracic aortic aneurysm\n\nThoracic aortic aneurysms occur along the thoracic aorta. This type of aneurysm is less common.\n\nThis condition is usually genetically related or can occur in people born with bicuspid aortic valve conditions, Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome.\n\nOther causes that can lead to the emergence of an aortic aneurysm are high blood pressure, infection, atherosclerosis, high cholesterol, and trauma.\n\nDiagnosis of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nThe doctor will diagnose an aortic aneurysm by conducting a physical examination, medical interview, and radiological examination.\n\nDuring a physical examination, the doctor will examine the patient\u2019s heart to detect blood flow problems. Then, the doctor will examine the legs and feet.\n\n1. Medical interview\n\nAt this stage, the doctor will ask questions covering the symptoms experienced by the sufferer.\n\nFor example, when the symptoms started, whether the sufferer smokes or not, the patient\u2019s and family\u2019s medical history, and whether the patient has had a recent chest injury.\n\n2. Radiological examination\n\nThis examination has several purposes.\n\nSuch as determining the location of the aneurysm, estimating the size of the lump, how fast it is growing, finding out if there are other blood vessels that are infected, and looking for blood clots or inflammation.\n\nThese tests include ultrasound, CT SCAN or MRA, echocardiogram, and angiogram.\n\nThe ultrasound test aims to help doctors check the size of the aneurysm.\n\nAdditionally, doctors perform this test to follow any changes in the aneurysm and help measure the risk of rupture of the aneurysm.\n\n4. CT scan and MRA\n\nThe doctor will perform a computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) examination if a more detailed examination is necessary.\n\nThis examination aims to determine the relationship between the aneurysm and the renal blood vessels or other organs, as well as to see the growth of the thoracic aortic aneurysm.\n\n5. Echocardiogram\n\nAn echocardiogram is an ultrasound that is used to study the heart.\n\nIn order to diagnose a thoracic aneurysm, a person may undergo one of these procedures, either a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).\n\n6. Angiogram\n\nAn angiogram is a procedure that can help doctors determine the size of the aneurysm, check for aortic dissection or blood clots, and see if other blood vessels are involved.\n\nAortic Aneurysm Treatment\n\nThe main goal of aortic aneurysm therapy or treatment is to prevent the blood vessel from rupturing.\n\nThe doctor will look at the size and other possible risk factors in the sufferer to determine the type of therapy.\n\nHere\u2019s how to treat it based on the type of aneurysm:\n\n1. Abdominal Aneurysm\n\nSpecifically for abdominal aneurysms, doctors usually determine the choice of therapy based on their size.\n\n3-4.4 centimeters: the size is still small, so the doctor will recommend having a routine ultrasound examination every year to monitor the enlargement of the aneurysm.\n4.5\u20145.4 centimeters: medium size, so you need an ultrasound examination every three months to monitor the enlargement of the aneurysm.\n5.5 centimeters or more: size in the large category, usually requires surgery to prevent further enlargement or rupture of the aneurysm.\n\nIn addition to regular check-ups, doctors also prescribe medication to prevent or reduce the risk of a ruptured or torn aorta.\n\nSome types of drugs include:\n\nStatin drugs are used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of aortic blockage due to atherosclerosis.\nBeta-blockers are a group of drugs that help lower blood pressure by slowing the heart rate.\nAngiotensin 2 receptor blocker (ARB) drugs are used to lower blood pressure if beta blocker drugs do not provide optimal results.\n\n2. Thoracic Aneurysm\n\nMeanwhile, in thoracic aortic aneurysm, doctors provide treatment based on the size of the aneurysm, the severity of the symptoms that appear, and the risk of surgery.\n\nThoracic aortic aneurysm therapy includes:\n\nRoutine monitoring\n\nThis type of therapy is a therapeutic option for small aneurysms that are not at risk of rupture.\n\nUsually, the doctor will recommend a routine CT scan or MRI every 6 months (depending on the size of the aneurysm) to see if the aneurysm is enlarged.\n\nBecause it is potentially fatal, you also need to know what first aid is like when experiencing this condition.\n\nConventional surgery\n\nDoctors will recommend this procedure in cases where the aneurysm is large and at risk of rupture.\n\nConventional surgery is performed using general anesthesia and the installation of a special device (graft) to prevent blood flow from pressing on the aneurysm further.\n\nEndovascular surgery\n\nIt is a less invasive surgical procedure. This method uses a special tool that is inserted into the aorta through a small tear or through a catheter inserted into a leg vein.\n\nAfter the surgical procedure, the doctor will usually ask the patient to be disciplined in adopting a healthy lifestyle and diet.\n\nNot only does this habit help speed up the healing process, it also helps reduce the risk of aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\nSome of the efforts that doctors recommend include:\n\nDo not smoke.\nAvoid excessive thoughts and anxiety that can trigger stress.\nDo not do heavy physical activities, such as weight lifting.\nLimit fat intake so that blood cholesterol levels decrease.\n\nComplications of Aortic Aneurysm\n\nComplications from an aortic aneurysm can be life-threatening. Some conditions that may occur include:\n\nAortic dissection, which is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta wall. This condition causes blood to collect between the inner and middle layers of the aorta wall. As a result, the aorta can rupture or organs cannot get enough blood.\nAortic insufficiency and aortic regurgitation. Both occur when the aortic valve does not close properly because the adjacent part of the aorta is enlarged. This allows some blood to flow back into the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder, which can lead to heart failure.\nRupture of the aorta, which causes dangerous bleeding in the body and leads to shock.\nCardiac tamponade. This is compression of the heart due to increased fluid in the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart.\nKidney failure, due to lack of blood flow to the kidneys.\nLack of blood flow to the intestines, which causes inflammation and injury to the colon.\n\nAortic Aneurysm Prevention\n\nSome efforts you can try to reduce the risk of developing an aortic aneurysm are:\n\nImplement a healthy diet\n\nConsume foods that are rich in fiber, low in saturated fat, and low in salt to maintain healthy blood vessels.\n\nFruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and nuts are healthy food choices that can help maintain blood vessel elasticity.\n\nControl blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) can increase the risk of this condition. Therefore, measure your blood pressure regularly and follow your doctor\u2019s recommended guidelines for controlling your blood pressure.\n\nStop smoking\n\nSmoking can damage blood vessel walls and increase the risk of aneurysm.\n\nQuitting smoking is a very important step in maintaining healthy blood vessels and heart. This is why smokers are more susceptible to aortic aneurysm disorders.\n\nStay active\n\nExercising regularly can help maintain a healthy weight, improve blood circulation, and strengthen the heart muscle.\n\nTry to live an active lifestyle by doing physical activities that you enjoy.\n\nCholesterol control\n\nHigh cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increase the risk of aneurysms.\n\nControl cholesterol levels by eating low-cholesterol foods, exercising, and having regular check-ups.\n\nControl diabetes\n\nUncontrolled diabetes can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of this condition. Managing blood sugar levels well is an important step in preventing aneurysms.\n\nReduce stress\n\nChronic stress can negatively impact heart and blood vessel health. Find ways to reduce stress such as meditation, yoga, or enjoyable hobby activities.\n\nRoutine health checks\n\nHaving regular health checks can help detect risk factors or health conditions that require early attention.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nImmediately carry out an examination if you feel the symptoms as previously mentioned.\n\nAlso ask your doctor if you have high risk factors for this disease, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, genetics, or the bad habit of smoking.",

        "text": "Brain Aneurysm\n\nA brain aneurysm is a balloon-shaped bulge that forms in a blood vessel in the brain. At first glance, the bulge looks like a berry hanging from the brain stem. A brain aneurysm can leak or rupture and cause bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).\n\nA ruptured brain aneurysm most often occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A ruptured aneurysm is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nHowever, most cases are unruptured brain aneurysms. This condition does not cause any health problems or cause any symptoms. It is usually detected when the sufferer is undergoing an examination to diagnose another medical condition. In some cases, treatment for an unruptured brain aneurysm can prevent a future rupture.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Symptoms\n\nThe symptoms that appear are differentiated based on the severity of the disease experienced by the sufferer. The two types are unruptured brain aneurysm and ruptured brain aneurysm. Here is an explanation of each:\n\n1. Unruptured Brain Aneurysm\n\nUnruptured brain aneurysms generally do not cause symptoms in sufferers. New symptoms will appear when the size of the aneurysm gets bigger and presses on the nerve tissue in the brain. The following are symptoms experienced by sufferers of unruptured brain aneurysms:\n\nVision problems, such as vision loss or double vision.\nPain above or around the eye.\nNumbness or weakness on one side of the face.\nDifficulty speaking.\n\nLoss of balance.\nDifficulty concentrating.\nHaving problems with short-term memory.\n\n2. Ruptured Brain Aneurysm\n\nSymptoms of a ruptured brain aneurysm start with a sudden and excruciating headache. The pain is like being hit by a blunt object and feels very painful. The following are the symptoms experienced by people with a ruptured brain aneurysm:\n\nLoss of consciousness.\nConvulsions.\nFeeling sick.\nBlurred or double vision.\nSudden confusion.\nNeck feels stiff or sore.\nDecreased sensitivity to light.\nWeakness on one side of the body or a particular limb.\n\nCauses of Brain Aneurysm\n\nA brain aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. The brain requires a large blood supply. This blood supply is sent through 4 major blood vessels that run from the neck to the brain. These blood vessels divide into smaller vessels.\n\nIf you can imagine it, it is like a tree trunk that splits into branches and twigs. Most aneurysms develop at points where blood vessels divide and branch because these areas are considered weaker than other areas.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Risk Factors \n\nThere are several conditions or habits that increase a person\u2019s risk of developing a brain aneurysm. Here are some of them:\n\nSmoking. Smoking can significantly increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm. This is due to the harmful substances in tobacco smoke that damage the walls of blood vessels.\nHigh blood pressure. The risk is higher if you are a high blood pressure sufferer who is obese, consumes a lot of salt, eats less vegetables and fruits, and consumes excessive alcohol.\n\nFamily history. Having a parent, brother or sister with a history of brain aneurysm is an unavoidable risk factor.\n\nAge. The risk of developing a brain aneurysm increases with age. Most cases are diagnosed in people over the age of 40.\n\nGender. Women are at greater risk of developing a brain aneurysm than men because estrogen levels are significantly lower after menopause.\n\nWeakness in the blood vessels. In some cases, brain aneurysms are caused by a weakness in the blood vessels that is present at birth.\n\nSevere head injury. Brain aneurysms can develop after a severe brain injury, especially if blood vessels in the brain are damaged. This trigger is rare.\n\nAutosomal polycystic kidney disease. This is a genetic condition that causes many cysts to develop in the kidneys. Cysts are characterized by small, fluid-filled sacs.\n\nTissue disorders. Tissue disorders in people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan syndrome cause weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the body, including the brain.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta. This condition is characterized by a narrowing of the main artery in the body (aorta), which is present from birth. This disease is a common type of congenital heart disease.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Diagnosis \n\nThe correct step in diagnosing a brain aneurysm is to perform an examination. First of all, the sufferer will be asked about symptoms, previous illness history and family history of illness, as well as daily activities.\n\nIf there is a suspicion of a brain aneurysm, the doctor will perform a number of supporting examinations to confirm the diagnosis. Some of these supporting examinations include:\n\n1. CT Scan (A Computerized Tomography)\n\nThe patient is positioned lying down in this examination. Then the doctor will insert a contrast agent or dye into the patient\u2019s body. The goal is so that the aneurysm can be seen when the image of the brain\u2019s blood vessels is taken.\n\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\nSimilar to a CT scan, the patient will lie down. Then the doctor will scan the blood vessels in the brain. Aneurysms that are larger than 3\u20135 millimeters can be detected using an MRI or CT scan.\n\n3. Angiogram\n\nAngiogram can show weak points in blood vessels is a good test to detect aneurysms. In this test, the sufferer will be given anesthesia and a tube-like device is inserted through the blood vessels in the legs, up to the blood vessels in the head.\n\nThen, the dye will be inserted by the doctor into the blood vessels of the brain and the condition of the blood vessels will be seen on the monitor screen. If there is an aneurysm in the brain, it can be seen directly with this examination.\n\n4. Examination of Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid)\n\nThis supporting examination is carried out by taking spinal fluid using a special needle to see if there are any signs of bleeding.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Treatment\n\nBased on the stages, brain aneurysm therapy is divided into two types. In small aneurysms, which have not ruptured, and do not cause symptoms, therapy is carried out with routine observation, as well as taking preventive measures so that the aneurysm does not get bigger and rupture.\n\nSome efforts made, such as:\n\nDo not take stimulant drugs.\nNo smoking.\nMaintain normal blood pressure.\nAvoid foods that contain high fat.\nGet used to a healthy diet.\nLimit caffeine consumption.\nDo not lift heavy objects.\nLose weight with a healthy diet.\n\nSurgery is recommended if the aneurysm is at risk of rupturing. If a brain aneurysm ruptures, it is a medical emergency, and immediate surgery is required. This therapy aims to prevent blood from flowing to the site of the ruptured aneurysm. The procedures performed include:\n\n1. Surgical Clipping\n\nThis surgery is performed by opening the skull and then attaching a clamp to the ruptured aneurysm.\n\n2. Endovascular Coiling\n\nThis procedure is done by inserting a special tube (catheter) into a blood vessel in the leg until it reaches the head. Next, the doctor will install a device to close the bleeding (coil). This surgery is done without opening the skull.\n\n3. Flow Diverter Surgery\n\nThis procedure is performed if the previous two procedures are not possible. In this type of surgery, a device called a stent will be installed in the blood vessel, so that blood can flow without leaking back. All surgical procedures are therapies that can cause the risk of complications, such as brain damage or stroke.\n\nBrain Aneurysm Prevention \n\nAneurysms cannot always be prevented. However, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing an aneurysm.\n\nQuit or don\u2019t smoke.\nConsume a balanced nutritious diet and reduce salt intake.\nReduce alcohol consumption.\nMaintain ideal body weight by following a healthy diet.\nExercise regularly.\nReduce caffeine intake.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor?\n\nIt is recommended to immediately check yourself when a number of the symptoms mentioned appear. The right steps can save you from potential complications. Remember, losing your life is a fatal impact that can occur.",

        "text": "Angina Pectoris\n\nAngina pectoris is a disease that occurs due to disruption of oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart muscle. The typical symptom of this disease is chest pain that can interfere with daily activities.\n\nThe blood supply to the heart muscle can be disrupted due to narrowing or blockage in the blood vessels. This disease can occur suddenly and can affect anyone.\n\nHowever, there are several factors that can increase the risk of angina, starting from high cholesterol levels, having diabetes, having a history of hypertension, stress, being overweight or obese, and actively smoking. A history of heart disease, and rarely exercising can also increase the risk of angina.\n\nSymptoms of Angina \n\nMost people with angina describe chest pain or pressure. Most people also describe a squeezing or tightness sensation in the chest.\n\nMeanwhile, a small number of others said the symptoms of angina felt like indigestion. However, the rest of the sufferers said it was difficult to describe angina symptoms specifically.\n\nWhen angina occurs, here are a number of symptoms that sufferers can feel, including:\n\nChest pain that can spread to the left arm, neck, jaw, and back.\nThe chest feels like it is being squeezed or pressed by a heavy object.\nHard to breathe.\nThe body feels tired.\n\nExcessive sweating.\n\nCauses of Angina\n\nIn order to function properly, the heart needs enough oxygen-rich blood. Two large vessels, called the coronary arteries, supply blood to the heart.\n\nThe main cause of angina is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries. If you look at the triggers, there are three types of angina, namely:\n\n1. Stable angina\n\nGenerally, this condition is triggered by physical activity, such as exercise. When exercising, the heart organ requires more oxygen supply from the bloodstream.\n\nHowever, these needs will not be met if there is a blockage or narrowing of the coronary vessels. Stable angina attacks can also occur due to other things, such as smoking, stress, overeating, and cold air.\n\n2. Unstable angina\n\nThis condition occurs due to fat deposits or blood clots that reduce or block blood flow to the heart.\n\nEven though the sufferer has taken medication and rested, chest pain due to unstable angina will still persist.\n\nIf not treated properly, unstable angina attacks can develop into heart attacks.\n\n3. Variant angina (Prinzmetal\u2019s sitting angina)\n\nIn this condition, there is a temporary narrowing of the heart arteries due to spasm or stiffness of the blood vessels. This type of angina can even attack people who are resting. Because this variant of angina can occur at any time.\n\nTemporary narrowing of the blood vessels causes the oxygen supply from the blood flow to the heart to decrease and chest pain occurs. Symptoms of this type of angina can be treated with medication.\n\nDiagnosis of Angina\n\nIn addition to conducting a physical examination and asking about the history of symptoms experienced by the sufferer, there are several other examinations that doctors will generally perform, such as:\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). The use of an ECG or heart recording aims to see whether the patient\u2019s blood flow is disturbed or decreased.\nEchocardiogram. This examination aims to assess the function of heart muscle contraction and heart valve function which can decrease if there is damage to the heart muscle, due to impaired blood flow or parts of the heart that do not receive enough blood flow.\nExercise Tolerance Test ( Exercise Tolerance Test ). The main purpose of this examination is to measure the heart\u2019s endurance during physical activity before angina symptoms arise.\nCardiac scintigraphy. This examination aims to determine whether blood flow in the blood vessels is disturbed.\nCoronary angiography. This examination aims to determine whether the coronary blood vessels are blocked and how severe the blockage is.\nBlood test. This type of test aims to measure the level of cardiac enzymes in the blood to determine heart damage due to a heart attack.\nChest X-ray (X-ray). This examination aims to see whether the symptoms experienced by the sufferer are due to conditions other than angina or to see if there is an enlarged heart.\nCT scan of the heart. This examination aims to determine how severe the narrowing of the heart vessels is, and whether there is an enlargement of the heart that is not very visible from the results of the chest X-ray.\n\nAngina Treatment\n\nCan angina pectoris be cured? The answer is that angina pectoris cannot be cured. But angina pectoris can be treated if the symptoms appear at any time.\n\nThe goal of angina treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms and reduce the risk of heart attack and death.\n\nThe following are options for angina treatment including:\n\n1. Sitting Wind First Aid\n\nThere are several ways you need to do immediately if you experience angina symptoms. First aid that you can do for yourself, including:\n\nStop Activities and Take a Rest Immediately\n\nIf you experience chest pain during activity, immediately stop the activity and rest, such as sitting or lying down.\n\nTaking Medicines\n\nIf symptoms do not subside after resting, take a dose of angina medication. You are advised to sit or lie down before taking the medication, as the medication can make you dizzy. Take the smallest dose you usually take. For example, a full tablet, half or even a quarter of a tablet. Here\u2019s how to use angina medication:\n\nSpray medication. Spray once under the tongue.\nTablets. Place the medicine under the tongue, but do not swallow. When symptoms stop, spit out the remaining tablet.\nWait Before Taking Additional Doses\n\nWait 5 minutes. If angina symptoms persist, take another dose, then wait another five minutes.\n\nTell the Family\n\nTell your family or closest people about your condition so they can help.\n\nContact the Nearest Hospital\n\nIf angina does not improve after 10 minutes of waiting or gets worse, immediately contact the nearest hospital for an ambulance and emergency medical treatment.\n\n2. Lifestyle changes \n\nHeart disease is a common cause of angina. Making lifestyle changes to maintain heart health is an important part of angina treatment.\n\nHere are some efforts that can be made:\n\nDon\u2019t smoke and avoid exposure to cigarette smoke. It is common knowledge that smoking is one of the habits that can increase many health problems.\nExercise and manage your weight. As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day. If you are overweight, talk to your doctor about safe weight-loss options. Ask your doctor what weight is best for you.\nChange your diet. Eat healthy foods low in salt and saturated fat, and choose healthy foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\nManage other health conditions. Diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol can cause angina. Therefore, it is important for people with these conditions to manage and monitor their conditions.\nPractice stress relief. Exercising more, practicing mindfulness, and connecting with others in a support group are some ways to reduce emotional stress.\nAvoid or limit alcohol. If you choose to drink alcohol, drink in moderation.\n\n3. Medical action \n\nMedical treatment options for angina are divided into two options, namely the use of medication and surgical procedures.\n\nUse of drugs\n\nIf lifestyle changes such as healthy eating and exercise don\u2019t improve heart health and relieve angina pain, medications may be the answer.\n\nMedications to treat angina may include:\n\nNitrates. These drugs help relax and widen blood vessels so more blood can flow to the heart. The most common form of nitrate doctors prescribe for angina is nitroglycerin.\nAspirin. This medication can reduce blood clotting, making it easier for blood to flow through narrowed heart arteries. Preventing blood clots can reduce the risk of heart attack.\nClot-preventing medications. Certain medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta), make blood platelets less likely to stick together, so your blood doesn\u2019t clot.\nBeta-blockers. Beta-blockers cause the heart to beat more slowly and with less force, which lowers blood pressure.\n\nSometimes, a non-drug option or Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) may be recommended by your doctor to improve blood flow to the heart.\n\nWith EECP, your doctor will place a blood pressure-type cuff around your calf, thigh, and pelvis.\n\nEECP requires several treatment sessions. EECP can help reduce symptoms in people with frequent, uncontrolled angina (refractory angina).\n\nOperating procedure \n\nThere are a number of surgical procedures that your doctor may recommend to treat angina, including:\n\nAngioplasty surgery. This procedure involves placing a stent in the blood vessels of the heart. This procedure is the main procedure in treating coronary artery blockages.\nBypass surgery. This procedure aims to divert blood flow so that it does not pass through blocked or damaged blood vessels by using blood vessels from other parts of the body.\n\nRecommended Medicine for Angina Pectoris\n\nThere are various choices of angina medication with a doctor\u2019s prescription that you can take, including:\n\nConcor 1.25 mg 10 Tablets. Antihypertensive drug containing bisoprolol fumarate 1.25 mg. This drug can help treat hypertension, angina, and chronic heart failure.\nZendalat 10 mg 10 Tablets. Zendalat contains nifedipine 10 mg, which can help prevent certain types of chest pain, including angina. It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.\nCardio Aspirin 100 mg 10 Tablets. Aspirin class drug that works as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet. How it works, prevents the platelet aggregation process in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina patients.\nAspilets 80 mg 10 Chewable Tablets. These chewable tablets contain acetylsalicylic acid 80 mg, which is a non-steroidal analgesic compound. You can use this medicine to treat unstable angina, as well as temporary ischemic brain attacks.\nCardicap 5 mg 10 Tablets. Antihypertensive drug Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB), which can be used as first-line treatment for hypertension, stable angina, and variant angina.\nIntervask 5 mg 10 Tablets. Contains amlodipine, a drug that works as an antihypertensive Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB). You can use this drug as a first-line treatment for variant angina and stable angina.\nAdalat Oros 30 mg 10 Tablets. Used to treat hypertension and angina. It contains nifedipine which works by relaxing the heart muscles and blood vessels so that blood flows easily and the heart load is reduced.\n\nIn addition to taking medication, angina sufferers also need to know how to provide first aid when experiencing it.\n\nPrevention of Angina\n\nAngina pectoris is a condition that you can prevent. There are several preventive measures you can take, including:\n\nExercise regularly. If you want to know when is the right time to exercise.\nEat heart-healthy foods.\nAvoid foods that are harmful to the heart.\nMaintain ideal body weight.\nLimit consumption of alcoholic beverages.\nQuit smoking.\n\nAngina Complications\n\nChest pain that occurs with angina can make everyday activities uncomfortable. However, one of the most dangerous complications is a heart attack.\n\nWarning signs and symptoms of a heart attack include:\n\nA feeling of pressure, fullness, or squeezing pain in the middle of the chest, lasting more than a few minutes.\nThe pain spreads beyond the chest to the shoulders, arms, back, or even to the teeth and jaw.\n\nIncreased episodes of chest pain.\nNausea and vomiting.\nContinuous pain in the upper abdominal area.\nHard to breathe.",

        "text": "For four days billionaire Elon Musk toured Pennsylvania, putting his money and fame into helping Republican Donald Trump's campaign to take back the White House in November.Musk drew praise from conservatives at his rallies while fielding questions about artificial intelligence, government regulation, sentient robots and vaccines.He also made a string of false claims about election fraud, some of them echoing those made by Trump the last four years.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of the X social media platform, Musk also handed out two $1 million checks to randomly picked people who signed his online petition backing US constitutional rights to freedom of speech and bear arms.Musk, 53, has more than a passing interest in Trump's success. If reelected, Trump promises to make Musk head of a government efficiency commission, a job Musk vows will help rid the country of regulations he views as bad for the economy and a deterrent to doing business.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");CASHMusk shocked a crowd of roughly 1,500 at a nondenominational church in the Pennsylvania capital of Harrisburg on Saturday when he announced he was giving away $1 million. The first winner was John Dreher, who rushed to the stage in a signature red MAGA cap, pumping his arms in the air.\"I've been following you for 10 years, got your biography 10 years ago and been watching ever since,\" Dreher said to Musk.On Sunday, Musk awarded another $1 million check to Kristine Fishell, who appeared stunned as her name was called and she took the stage in a red Trump T-shirt.\"Thank you so much for ... I mean I truly believe everything you're doing, truly. You don't need to be doing it, I know a lot of us feel the same way.\"Musk said the winners are picked randomly but must have signed his petition and be registered voters in the battleground states that will decide November's election, such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona.His handouts have stirred legal questions.CONSPIRACIESMusk has also embraced conspiracy theories pushed by Trump, and is spinning some of his own.He revived false theories claiming that voting machines rig elections - an assertion that has been repeatedly debunked since it was pushed by those seeking to overturn Trump's 2020 loss.He mentioned Dominion Voting Systems, which last year sued Fox News for defamation over false claims that the company engaged in a vote-rigging conspiracy. Dominion agreed to a landmark $787 million settlement with the network.\"There's always a sort of question of like, say, the Dominion voting machines. It is weird that the, you know, I think they're used in Philadelphia and in Maricopa County (Arizona), but not in a lot of other places.\"In a statement, Dominion pointed to inaccuracies in Musk's comments, including the fact they don't operate in Philadelphia.Musk also accused Democrats of channeling vast numbers of migrants who enter the US illegally into battleground states.Presenting no evidence, he alleged that Harris would legalize the migrants after the election if she wins, giving Democrats clear majorities in those states.The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Similar claims have been debunked in the past.'POST THE EVIDENCE'For many at the events, the idea the 2020 election was stolen from Trump was taken as fact despite a lack of evidence.One attendee in Harrisburg asked Musk what he was doing to prevent a recurrence. Musk responded by leaning into the unfounded allegations.\"I mean if the margin of victory is high enough, then I think it can exceed any sort of cheating that may take place. So we're going to aim for just a massive margin,\" Musk said.He encouraged people to use his X platform, formerly known as Twitter, to shine a spotlight on potential election cheating.\"If people think there's a fraud, then they should post the images, post the videos, post the evidence,\" he said.SHARKS AND WHALESMusk has millions of dollars in government contracts and his companies face significant and at times costly government regulations which typically are designed to protect things like consumers, drinking water and wildlife.Musk was asked if in such a job he would take a flamethrower to stacks of regulations and post a video of it. \"I think a bonfire of nonsense regulations would be epic,\" Musk said.Musk recounted how SpaceX was forced to conduct a study to determine whether his rockets would hurt sharks when landing in the water.\"I'm like, it's a big ocean, you know, there's a lot of sharks. It's not impossible, but it's very unlikely,\" Musk said.Reluctantly, they conducted the study only to be told to do a similar review on potential threats to whales, Musk said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Meta announced that it's testing facial recognition technology to detect scam ads and assist users in faster account recovery on Monday. The social media giant is specifically targeting \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams, where scammers use images of celebrities and public figures to lure users into interacting with the ad and clicking malicious links. Additionally, the Menlo Park-based tech giant is also testing using video selfies to let users quickly regain access to their compromised accounts. The company said it aims to proactively remove harmful content from its platforms to create a safer experience for users.\r\n\r\nMeta Testing Facial Recognition Technology\r\n\r\nIn a newsroom post, the social media giant detailed its approach to using facial recognition technology. Meta is currently working on using the technology in two ways \u2014 detecting \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams and identity verification for quicker account recovery.\r\n\r\nHighlighting the issue of \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams on Facebook and Instagram, the company said that scammers often use images of public figures to make users interact with ads. Users are asked to click on fraudulent links, and because of the trust factor of the celebrity, some fall for scams.Meta AI on WhatsApp Might Soon Be Able to Remember Your Preferences\r\n\r\nSo far, Meta has used the native ad review system to detect fake ads from legitimate ones. This system is based on machine learning and reviews millions of ads that run on its platforms. The automated system analyses the text, images, and videos featured in the ad. Now, to further bolster the system, the social media giant is testing facial recognition.\r\n\r\nThe company is currently using facial recognition on a limited scale to \u201ccompare faces in an ad to the public figure's Facebook and Instagram profile pictures.\u201d In case a match is confirmed and it is determined that the ad is a scam, Meta said it will automatically block it. The technology is also being used to detect and block accounts that impersonate a public figure.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Meta is in early stages of testing and is using a small group of celebrities and public figures to check and improve the speed and efficacy of detection. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we'll start showing in-app notifications to a larger group of public figures who've been impacted by celeb-bait letting them know we're enrolling them in this protection,\u201d the company added. Public figures who enrol in this protection will be allowed to opt out via Account Centre.Meta Unveils New Facebook Video Tab and AI-Powered Video Ad Tools\r\n\r\nFacial Recognition in Account Recovery\r\n\r\nMeta is also testing the use of facial recognition to help users regain access to compromised accounts. Many times, Meta's automated systems can flag an account incorrectly and lock it. This could be due to suspicious activity or if a hacker attempted to break into the user's account. Alternatively, proving identity is also necessary if users forget their account passwords. In such cases, users so far were asked to verify their identity by submitting a government identity card.\r\n\r\nNow, the social media giant is testing the use of video selfies to quickly let users regain access to their accounts. Users will have to upload a video selfie, and by running facial recognition technology, the company will compare the data to the profile pictures on the account they are trying to access.\r\n\r\nIn both use cases, Meta claims that it will not store any facial data generated after the comparison is made, regardless if there is a match or not. Additionally, in video selfies, the company stated that the video data will be encrypted and \u201cwill never be visible on their profile, to friends or to other people on Facebook or Instagram.\u201d\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "title": "The expanding horizons of physiotherapy: Integrating technology with holistic care",
        "text": "The integration of new technologies is revolutionising physical therapy. Wearable sensors are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of physiotherapy Khyatee The critical role of physiotherapy in promoting workforce health, addressing sedentary lifestyle issues, correcting postural imbalances, and enhancing productivity is increasingly being recognised not only by the common man but also by the corporate sector.Needless to say, physiotherapy is a holistic approach that aids individuals in recovering, maintaining, and enhancing their mobility and overall well-being. This evolving field which is continually shaped by technological advancements and shifts in healthcare practices, enhances its effectiveness in patient care in different arenas. Expanding Roles in Mental Health: Physical therapists are increasingly involved in mental health care, particularly in managing depression and anxiety. By leveraging the mind-body connection, physical therapists can offer low-intensity psychological interventions to address symptoms related to mental health conditions. Electroceuticals like Deep Brain Stimulation can help reduce insomnia, anxiety, and depression. We can also help in the well-being of children with autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Deficit. This shift towards integrating physical therapy with mental health care reflects a broader trend toward holistic patient management. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is transforming physical therapy by enabling more personalized and efficient patient care. Advanced algorithms analyse extensive patient data to create tailored rehabilitation programs and forecast pain patterns. AI-powered wearables and immersive technologies like virtual and augmented reality are enhancing therapeutic interventions, allowing for real-time adjustments and improved patient engagement. Adoption of the PRISM Pain Model: The Pain Recovery and Integrative Systems Model (PRISM), developed through collaboration between the APTA and the National Institutes of Health, is set to revolutionize pain management in physical therapy. PRISM addresses the complex nature of pain beyond traditional models, facilitating more effective decision-making and treatment approaches. Boon in Geriatric conditions: Elders are susceptible to various illnesses usually including musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiopulmonary problems, mental illness, balance problems, and chronic pain. Physiotherapy treatment has been successful in managing each of these ailments. Emphasis on Primary Care Physical Therapy: The trend towards preventive and patient-centred care is spotlighting primary care physical therapy. By focusing on non-pharmacological interventions and early intervention, physical therapists are providing alternatives to manage pain and chronic conditions. This approach not only reduces healthcare costs but also enhances patient outcomes through collaborative, holistic care. For instance, take the case of stroke rehabilation. Physical therapy helps stroke survivors regain motor functions and improve muscle strength, coordination, and balance through targeted exercises and treatments. Similarly, the therapy promotes neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganie and form new neural connections. Therapists use techniques to encourage the brain to adapt and compensate for damaged areas.In functional training, therapy includes functional training to help patients perform everyday tasks, which can significantly enhance their quality of life and self-sufficiency. Growing Popularity of Aquatic Therapy: Aquatic therapy, or hydrotherapy, continues to gain recognition for its benefits, including reduced joint stress and increased flexibility. This low-impact therapeutic option is particularly effective for patients with musculoskeletal issues and is becoming a more common feature in rehabilitation facilities. Innovations in Technology: The integration of new technologies is revolutionizing physical therapy. Motion capture technology and wearable sensors are enhancing the precision of care plans. Virtual reality and interactive video games are improving patient engagement and adherence to therapy. Additionally, rehabilitation robotics, such as exoskeletons and intelligent prosthetics, are offering tailored support that adapts to patients' progress. Telehealth is also on the rise, providing patients with flexible, convenient access to therapy. Increasing Need for Referrals: As physical therapists take on more comprehensive roles, collaboration with physicians becomes increasingly important. Physicians are recognizing the benefits of physical therapy interventions, leading to a higher demand for referrals. These trends highlight the ongoing evolution in physical therapy, emphasizing a shift towards more personalized, technology-driven, and integrated approaches.

        "title": "Harvard Students Develop App to Identify Anyone Using Meta Smart Glasses",
        "text": "Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses were used by two Harvard engineering students to build an app that can reveal sensitive information about people without them realising it. The students posted a demo of the video on X (formerly known as Twitter) and showcased the app's capability. Notably, the app is not being made publicly available to users, instead, they made it to highlight the dangers of AI-powered wearable devices that use discreet cameras that can capture photos and images of people. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Used to Build a Doxxing App The app, dubbed I-Xray, uses artificial intelligence (AI) for facial recognition and then uses processed visual data to doxx individuals. Doxxing, a popular Internet slang which is a portmanteau of \u201cdropping dox (informal of docs or documents)\u201d, is the act of revealing personal information about someone without their consent. It was integrated with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, but the developers said that it would work with any smart glasses with discreet cameras. It uses an AI model similar to PimEyes and FaceCheck for reverse facial recognition. The technology can match the face of an individual to publicly available images of them online and scour the URLs. Another large language model (LLM) is then fed these URLs and an automatic prompt is generated to find out the person's name, occupation, address, and other similar data. The AI model also looks through publicly available government data such as voter registration databases. Additionally, an online tool named FastPeopleSearch was also used for this. Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance? @CaineArdayfio and I offer an answer to protect yourself here:https://t.co/LhxModhDpk pic.twitter.com/Oo35TxBNtD \u2014 AnhPhu Nguyen (@AnhPhuNguyen1) September 30, 2024 In a short video demonstration, Harvard students AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio also showcased the workings of this app. They were able to meet strangers with the camera already turned on, and ask their name, and the AI-powered app could take over from there to find personal data about the individual. In a Google Docs file, the developers said, \u201cThis synergy between LLMs and reverse face search allows for fully automatic and comprehensive data extraction that was previously not possible with traditional methods alone.\u201d The students have stated that they do not intend to make the app publicly available and only developed it to highlight the risks of an AI-enabled wearable device that can discreetly record people. However, this does not mean that bad actors cannot make a similar app using a similar methodology. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

The deceased has been identified as Arun, 40, a resident of Mettupalayam in Coimbatore. However, his identity remains to be verified. The incident was reported near the Kaippamangalam fisheries school on Monday around 11.30 p.m. It has since emerged that a four-member gang in a car had summoned the ambulance to take the deceased to a nearby hospital under the pretext that he was injured in an accident. The gang then allegedly fled after having promised the ambulance driver that they would follow the ambulance. The victim was dead by the time the ambulance reached the hospital. Following this, the ambulance driver alerted the Kaippamangalam police. In the ensuing investigation it emerged that the victim was assaulted to death in connection with a money transaction, reportedly to the tune of \u20b910 lakh, for a rice puller. One of the accused had reportedly invested the money with Arun who failed to deliver on the promise. According to the police, the victim who was asked to come near the Paliyekkara toll was abducted by the gang and then beaten up at a secret location. He was being taken around in a car when the gang allegedly summoned the ambulance at Kaippamangalam. As per preliminary information, all the accused were residents of Kannur.

        "text": "Visakhapatnam: Alluri Sitarama Raju district is home to many beautiful waterfalls that attract tourists, especially youngsters from across the state. Unfortunately, many tourists have lost their lives in waterfall-related accidents in the district due to a lack of awareness about the risks. This is because often the youth try to perform adventurous tasks for selfies and short videos. On this problem, ASR district collector A.S. Dinesh Kumar held a meeting with tourism officials. When Deccan Chronicle contacted, Srinivasa Phani, the regional director of the AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC), said, \u201cIn last week's meeting, we discussed that the APTDC has received Rs 30 crore funds under the Swadeshi Darshan 2.0 scheme from the central government. We have proposed that some of this fund be used to develop infrastructure that prevents accidents at these waterfalls.\u201d The Anantagiri Saria Falls gained recognition as a tourist destination since 2015, attracting many visitors from the North Andhra districts. However, several tragic incidents took place at this spot. According to CPI (M) ASR district secretary D. Venkanna, more than 40 reported fatalities occurred at the falls between 2015 and 2024. Worried about these events, the district authorities enhanced safety measures. Notably, at the first step of Saria Falls, where many accidents had occurred, fencing and warning boards were erected. These measures have prevented accidents in the past two years.Unfortunately, a recent incident at Bahubali Waterfalls, the second step of the falls, resulted in the loss of two lives. The recovery of the bodies was quite a challenge for the officials. Pittalaborra Waterfalls at Ginnelakota village in Pedabayalu mandal has been identified as hazardous due to its history of accidents. A tragic incident occurred three months ago when a young man from the Araku area lost his life after slipping into a waterfall while taking a selfie. His body was recovered two days later.Similarly, Duduma waterfalls, situated at a height of 2,600 feet on the border of Andhra and Odisha, has witnessed multiple fatalities, with six reported deaths in 2024. In response, the Odisha government has implemented preventive measures, resulting in fewer accidents at the site. The Gadigummi Falls in Koyyuru mandal is deemed extremely dangerous, with no documented cases of individuals surviving falls. Local reports suggest that approximately 40 fatalities have occurred at this location. On a different note, the Polluru Waterfall at Mothugudem is renowned for its popularity as a filming location. It has also seen several fatal incidents, with around 35 recorded deaths attributed to quicksand in the boulder area near the waterfall.The Chaparai Waterfall in Dumbriguda is a captivating attraction for tourists, including foreigners. Adjacent to the waterfall, there is a hazardous area known as the Hanuma Stone, which had several accidents due to its beautiful nature, uninformed tourists often meet with accidents here. Local guides have reported approximately 30 fatalities in the past decade. However, two years ago, the authorities took protective measures at the waterfalls area. They have demolished the hazardous Hanuma Stone, installed a fence and taken additional protective measures. As a result, the number of accidents at Chaparai Waterfalls has decreased over the past two years.",

The event, which provides students from across the State to showcase their talent, is held every year prior to the commencement of the Dasara festival. The presence of Kannada actors Srimurali and Rukmini Vasanth added more glitter to the inaugural event. While Srimurali was addressing the gathering, youth demanded him to sing for which the actor obliged with the song \u2018Hudugir Kannu Loaded Gannu\u2026\u2019 from his movie \u2018Rathavara\u2019 which set the tone for the celebrations. Srimurali, who said that \u2018Our Nada Habba is Our Pride,\u2019 added that it was only in Mysuru that a grandeur Dasara could be witnessed and no other place in the country. Later, the actor, promoting his upcoming movie \u2018Bhageera,\u2019 urged the youth to watch the film in theatres. Earlier, inaugurating the event, District Minister Dr. H.C. Mahadevappa said that among the 470 colleges which had applied to take part in the Yuva Sambhrama, 150 colleges were selected and another 120 colleges out of those not selected would be given an opportunity to showcase their talent by extending the event by a day.

A delayed inauguration The students and audience present at the Open Air Theatre, who had arrived much earlier to scheduled time of inauguration (5 pm as per the banners at the venue; 6 pm as per the invitation) waited for more than two hours for the guests to arrive. Finally, the event was inaugurated at 8.20 pm which caused a great inconvenience to the students who had to wait for long wearing their costumes. On day-1, Holenarasipur Govt.

        "title": "Scientists Reveal It Wasn't Just One Asteroid That Wiped Out Dinosaurs",
        "text": "The massive asteroid that ended the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was not an isolated event, new research has revealed. The study, published in Nature, detailed scans of an underwater crater off the coast of Guinea. It revealed that another large asteroid struck Earth around the same time, potentially contributing to the cataclysmic conditions that led to the dinosaurs' extinction. Scientists recently mapped the Nadir crater, spanning over 8 km in diameter, and revealed that it was created by an asteroid measuring 400 metres wide. This asteroid struck the planet at nearly 72,000 kmph between 65 million and 67 million years ago. While it was smaller than the asteroid linked to the mass extinction, it was still powerful enough to leave a significant mark on Earth. \u201cThe new images paint a picture of the catastrophic event,\u201d said Dr Uisdean Nicholson, a marine geologist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He discovered the Nadir crater in 2022, but the impact details were unclear until now. Using advanced 3D seismic imaging, researchers managed to explore the crater's rim and the geological features lying 300 metres beneath the ocean floor. Dr Nicholson called it \u201cexquisite,\u201d saying, \u201cThere are around 20 confirmed marine craters worldwide, and none of them has been captured in anything close to this level of detail.\u201d The findings suggest the impact triggered intense tremors that liquefied sediments beneath the sea bed, resulting in faults and landslides that left traces of damage visible for thousands of square miles beyond the crater's edge. Furthermore, the collision unleashed a massive tsunami, estimated to have exceeded 800 metres in height, which would have surged across the Atlantic Ocean. Although the exact timing of this asteroid's impact remains uncertain, its discovery raises intriguing possibilities about a cluster of impacts occurring at the end of the Cretaceous period \u2013 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs created a much larger crater \u2013 160 km wide \u2013 at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Dr Nicholson said the \u201cclosest humans have come to seeing something like this is the 1908 Tunguska event\u201d, when a 50-metre asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded in the skies above Siberia. He pointed out that the new 3D seismic data across the Nadir crater provides an unrivalled opportunity to test impact crater hypotheses and develop new models of crater formation in marine environments.",

        "text": "The Delhi High Court on Thursday issued a notice to the Centre and three private entities regarding a plea that seeks the establishment of norms to regulate the resale of concert tickets and to block illegal ticket-selling websites. The division bench, led by Chief Justice Manmohan, while seeking the response of all respondents, including Union ministries of information and broadcasting and electronics and information technology, tagged the matter with ongoing PIL and recently moved against ticket scalping, which is listed for hearing on February 18, 2025.The plea, prompted by recent concerts featuring Coldplay, Diljit Dosanjh, etc.The petition stated that the resellers have also acted in violation of the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, as the resellers do not carry out any verification of the tickets being sold on their platform, nor they require any undertaking from the sellers, as is also evident from their terms and conditions. Thus, an individual with no ticket can also advertise via Resellers and secure unjust and unlawful benefits. Moreover, the resellers have no effective grievance redressal mechanism in place which may protect the interests of the purchasers if the seller fails to abide by its contractual obligations. Moreover, in the absence of a ticket or non-delivery of a legal ticket, it is the resellers who are to gain, as they further charge 25 euros per issue from the seller as \u2018administrative fees\u2019 for resolution of any issue raised by the purchaser. Such fees are independent of any successful resolution, and no compensation is provided to the buyer.It is further stated that Section 112 of BNS was also introduced with a similar aim to curb the practice of black-marketing and unauthorised dealing of tickets. The legislature intended to safeguard the public interest by outlawing any transactions for the sale of tickets that were without the express authority of the authorised ticketing platform or organiser. Prior to BNS, the state legislatures had prohibited such black-marketing activities via state legislation, as it deprived the state of a substantial amount of tax revenue and also resulted in the innocent public being cheated by the criminal elements. Thus, Section 112 of Bharatiya Nagarik Sanhita, 2023 [\u2018BNS\u2019] aimed to protect the public by curbing the said acts of black-marketing with a severe punishment of imprisonment extending up to 7 years and imposition of fine. On October 9, the Delhi High Court sought the response of all respondents authorities against the practice of \u201cticket scalping,\u201d which involves reselling event tickets at inflated prices.The plea filed in the Delhi High Court challenges the illegal practice of ticket scalping, where event tickets are resold at inflated prices for profit, harming the general public.The petition also claims that scalping contributes to a black market for counterfeit tickets, further victimising consumers. Additionally, it argued that these transactions, often unregulated, evade the official tax system, resulting in lost government revenue. This situation fosters a shadow economy that deprives the state of funds that could support public services and infrastructure.The petitioner called for a comprehensive legal framework, effective enforcement, and technological solutions to mitigate the negative impacts of ticket scalping. The goal is to promote fair ticketing practices, ensure consumer protection, and integrate revenue from ticket sales into the formal economy",

        "text": "Bengaluru (Karnataka): A five-year-old boy died after falling into a shaft opened for the installation of a lift in an under-construction building in Kadugodi on Thursday, according to the Bengaluru police. Police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Sunil, who was the owner and caretaker of the building, following the complaint filed by the minor's mother. The five-year-old deceased, identified as Suhas Gowad, died after he fell into the open pit around 9 am. The child was playing with his friends near the under-construction building. A five-foot-deep pit was dug to accommodate a lift shaft that caused the death of the minor. The boy while playing with his friends fell in the five-foot-deep shaft that was filled with water after heavy rains battered the city and drowned. It was alleged that the owner was negligent in following safety measures around the pit. After the incident, friends of the deceased rushed to inform the locals, where people rushed to rescue the boy and took him to the hospital. However, the boy was pronounced dead, the police said. The police further said that when the locals protested, a barrier was made so that proper safety measures were followed. A local stated that if precautionary measures had been taken earlier, the death would not have happened. According to the Bengaluru police, a case of negligence has been registered against Sunil, the owner and caretaker of the under-construction building. Earlier, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah inspected the site of the building collapse at Huramavu Agara area of Bengaluru. According to official sources, the collapse on Tuesday had claimed the lives of 8 people, and injured 6 others.

The BJP now plans to utilise Paswan as a star campaigner for the Jharkhand elections, hoping to replicate his success in appealing to Dalit voters.\n\nPolling in Jharkhand is scheduled in two stages on November 13 and November 20, with the results to be declared on November 23.",

The candidates demanding the postponement of exams argue that GO 29 will rearrange the prelims list upside down. About 22 cases challenging the GO are pending in the High Court. They say that the GO tweaked the reservation policy and this would limit the chances of candidates from reserved categories.\n\nThe Group-I Main exams to fill 563 posts in various departments are scheduled to be held from October 21 to 27.\n\nGoing ahead with the conduct of the examination, authorities reviewed preparations. Chief Secretary Santhi Kumari held a meeting with officials of various departments and directed them to make fool-proof arrangements. A total of 31,383 candidates will appear in the exam to be conducted at 46 centres in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, and Medchal Malkajgiri districts.\n\nThe candidates qualified for the Group-1 Mains examination out of around 3.02 lakh who appeared for the preliminary examination held in June. The Group-1 prelims have been marred by controversies over paper leaks and legal battles for not following the norms and irregularities in 2022 and 2023. The Chief Secretary directed officials to make necessary security arrangements around the exam centres to prevent any irregularities or untoward incidents. TGSPSC Chairman Mahender Reddy said that since Group-I Mains are being held for the first time since 2011, the officials should take all precautions to ensure smooth conduct of the exam.",
