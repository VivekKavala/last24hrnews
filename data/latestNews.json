        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 4 (IANS) The auspicious four-day festival of Chhath Puja is set to begin from Tuesday. The festival, spanning over next four days will see a series of meticulously planned rituals and offerings.\n\nThe festival begins with Nahay Khay (bathing and feasting), where participants take a ritualistic bath and consume a simple meal. The subsequent day, devotees observe Kharna, which involves fasting throughout the day, breaking it only after sunset as an offering to the deities. The person observing the fast takes the meal of roti (chappati) and kheer (rice pudding) before the family members and friends gather to eat the same meal on a banana leaf together.\n\nOn the third day, the main ritual having immense devotion ascribed to it, takes place. Chhath devotees gather at the water bodies including rivers, ponds and something, before sunrise. Standing waist-deep in water, they offer \u2018arghya\u2019 (offering of water) to the rising Sun, chanting prayers.\n\nDevotees, clad in traditional attire, gather at riverbanks and sacred water bodies, engaging in elaborate rituals that include singing devotional songs and performing dances, creating a vibrant atmosphere of community and spirituality. The sight of colourful decorations, offerings laid on woven baskets, and the collective spirit of devotion paints a striking picture of unity and faith.\n\nIn essence, Chhath is not just a festival; it is a celebration of life, health, and the enduring connection between humanity and nature. As Bihar residents around the world partake in these rituals, the festival continues to thrive as a symbol of cultural identity and spiritual richness, bridging the past with the present in a beautiful tapestry of tradition.\n\nThe festival is dedicated to the worship of Lord Surya and his sister Chhathi Maiya, the sixth form of Devi Prakriti and is popularly observed in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal.\n\nDuring the festival, the devotees observe fasting to express gratitude to the Sun god for sustaining life on Earth. This year, the festival is being celebrated from November 5 (Tuesday) to November 8 (Friday).\n\nThis year, Chhath Puja will take place from November 6th to November 9th.",

Today, Kolhan is determined to uproot the corrupt JMM government.\u201d\n\nHe prophesied that BJP will be next to form government in the state..\n\n\u201cThis is my second rally here, and from the enthusiasm I see, I can confidently say that BJP will form the government with record-breaking seats.\u201d\n\nPM Modi underscored the BJP\u2019s commitment to Jharkhand, invoking a popular slogan that has gained traction among the masses: \u201cRoti, beti aur maati ki pukaar, Jharkhand me BJP-NDA sarkar,\u201d affirming that if the NDA assumes power, it will focus on addressing local demands symbolised by \u201cRoti, Beti, Maati\u201d (livelihood, daughters, and land).\n\nHe praised the BJP\u2019s historical role in advancing Adivasi rights, stating, \u201cWhen the BJP first formed a government at the Centre, it was under Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s leadership that Adivasis were granted their own states, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. For the past decade, we have tirelessly advocated for Adivasi demands nationally and globally.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister contrasted BJP\u2019s pro-Adivasi approach with the Congress, RJD, and JMM, accusing them of being \u201canti-Adivasi\u201d forces.\n\n\u201cNo one has been a bigger enemy to the Adivasi community than Congress and RJD,\u201d he asserted, urging young people to remember the Gua Goli Kand incident of the 1980s, where Adivasis were reportedly oppressed and even shot at under the Congress government in Bihar for demanding statehood for Jharkhand.\n\nContinuing his critique, PM Modi claimed that RJD leaders once vowed that Jharkhand would only be formed \u201cover their dead bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the JMM is aligned with the RJD, which resisted Jharkhand\u2019s formation from the start. No party has been a bigger enemy of Jharkhand than the Congress and RJD,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Prime Minister also highlighted that the Congress, with \u201cAdivasi blood on its hands,\u201d is now supporting JMM, illustrating what he described as the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Adivasi aspirations by these alliances.\n\nThe Prime Minister pointed out that, unlike the Congress, the BJP has appointed Adivasi leaders to top positions, including President Droupadi Murmu, Chhattisgarh\u2019s Vishnu Deo Sai and Union Minister Savitri Thakur.\n\nHe noted that the BJP-led NDA was responsible for giving India its first female Adivasi President.\n\n\u201cEven when we chose an Adivasi woman as the President of India, these Congress leaders opposed it,\u201d he said, underlining BJP\u2019s commitment to empowering the Adivasi community.\n\nPM Modi also accused the Congress, JMM, and RJD of repeatedly \u201cinsulting\u201d the Adivasi community, citing the dismissal of Champai Soren from the Chief Minister post as a direct affront to Adivasis.\n\n\u201cToday, the voice of Adivasis is represented by our President, but Congress, JMM, and their allies cannot tolerate an Adivasi President. They didn\u2019t shy away from hurling insults at her,\u201d he stated, concluding with a strong appeal to Jharkhand\u2019s electorate.",

        "text": "Bengaluru, Nov 4 (IANS) Karnataka Leader of the Opposition (LoP) R. Ashoka wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 Jagadambika Pal on Monday and demanded to stop all registrations of the Waqf Board.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the recent atrocities by Karnataka Waqf Board, I have written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, Jagadambika Pal, urging them to instruct the Chief Secretary of Karnataka to immediately stop all registrations and land transactions involving Waqf Board in Karnataka,\u201d he said.\n\nAshoka stated in the letter that the development has come to light following farmers claiming that in Vijayapura district they have served notice to acquire 15,000 acres of land.\n\n\u201cReportedly, the Waqf Board is attempting to register approximately 10,000 acres in each district across the state in a clandestine manner. This rush to register lands under the Waqf Board is resulting in thousands of poor families and farmers losing ancestral lands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the Waqf Board has claimed ownership of temple lands, monasteries, and other Hindu religious institutions, with even Hindu cremation grounds reportedly being listed as Waqf property.\n\n\u201cThe claims by the Waqf board include 1.28 acres belonging to the historic Virakta Math in Sindagi, the Someshwara Temple in Vijayapura, and the Birdevara Gudi in Kalaburagi. This has led to fears among farmers that they might lose their lands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged that merely withdrawing notices is insufficient and demanded that farmers\u2019 names be restored in property records and that the 1974 gazette notification be repealed.\n\n\u201cThis has caused public unrest, leading to violence and riots in places like Haveri. In light of these events, Ashoka has urged the JPC to engage with Karnataka\u2019s Chief Secretary and immediately halt the registration of Waqf-related lands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the Central government has established the JPC to draft the Waqf Amendment Bill with a focus on ensuring efficient and transparent management of Waqf properties.\n\n\u201cHowever, the state government and Waqf Board in Karnataka are attempting to alter revenue records and acquire ownership of farmers\u2019 lands,\u201d Ashoka stated.\n\n\u201cI am writing this to bring to your attention the recent developments in Karnataka where hasty attempts are made to register lands claimed by the Waqf board perhaps in anticipation of the amendment that Joint Parliamentary Committee could bring to the Waqf Act,\u201d he stated.\n\nAshoka noted that as part of this pre-emptive attempt, the state government and Waqf board have reportedly begun altering land revenue records, transferring ownership of farmers\u2019 lands to the Waqf board.\n\n\u201cThis hurried whitewashing and registering of unjust claims of land to Waqf boards will deprive thousands of farmers and poor people of Karnataka of their just and ancestral property rights,\u201d he said.",

Srikanth laid a wreath at Vijay Smarak in Fort William to pay tribute to bravehearts, who made the supreme sacrifice in the service to the nation, in the morning. Several events were organised during the day, including interactions between officers and troops.\n\nAccording to an official, the Eastern Command was raised in Lucknow on November 1, 1920. It then had territorial jurisdiction over Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and Assam. Thereafter, the Command headquarters moved to Barrackpore, Ranchi and back to Lucknow. After the India-China War of 1962, the Command settled down permanently at Fort William in Kolkata.\n\n\u201cEastern Command continues to remain the Army\u2019s largest operational command with its jurisdiction covering eight states. It monitors 8,350 km of land borders with five neighbouring countries. The Eastern Command has actively participated in all wars fought by India but the crowning glory was the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War that led to the Liberation of Bangladesh. The \u2018Warriors of the East\u2019 have also conducted successful counter-insurgency operations in the northeastern states whenever required,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe command is also entrusted with managing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the states of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.

        "title": "\u2018Judicial legacy\u2019: 10 landmark verdicts authored by CJI Chandrachud",
        "text": "New Delhi, Nov 1 (IANS) After a two-year-long stint as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud is due to retire on November 10 on attaining the age of 65 years. During the period, he pronounced several notable judgements. \n\nHere are the 10 key judgments authored by him when he was in the highest judicial office of the country after taking over as the CJI on November 9, 2022.\n\n1. Revocation of Article 370\n\nA 5-judge Constitution Bench, headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, had upheld the revocation of Article 370. It had ordered the Election Commission of India to take steps to conduct elections to the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Constitution Bench, also comprising Justices S.K. Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, had left open the question of whether Parliament can extinguish the character of statehood by converting a state into one or more union territories, relying on the statement made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that statehood would be restored to Jammu and Kashmir, but, it had said that \u201crestoration of statehood shall take place at the earliest and as soon as possible\u201d.\n\nThe Supreme Court had upheld the status of Ladakh as a union territory under Article 3(a) read with Explanation I of the Constitution, which permits the formation of a union territory by separating a territory from any state.\n\nIn May this year, the apex court refused to review the Constitution Bench verdict and dismissed a batch of review pleas filed against the decision upholding the revocation of Article 370 as valid.\n\n2. Same-sex marriage\n\nA 5-judge bench headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud had declined to strike down or read into gender-neutral \u201cperson\u201d in place of \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d existing under the Special Marriage Act. All five judges of the Constitution Bench had unanimously agreed that there exists no unqualified right to marriage and accepted the Centre\u2019s proposal that a committee to be headed by the Cabinet Secretary be set up to examine what administrative steps could be taken to address basic social benefit concerns relating to same-sex couples.\n\nThe Constitution Bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Hima Kohli, B.V. Nagarathna and P.S. Narasimha, had left it to the legislature to take a call on enacting the marriage equality law. It had asked the Union and state governments to ensure that the LGBTQ+ community is not discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation and queer individuals are not refused access to any goods or services.\n\n3. Electoral bonds\n\nA five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, had struck down the electoral bonds scheme, saying that denying voters the right to know the details of funding of political parties would lead to a dichotomous situation and the funding of political parties cannot be treated differently from that of the candidates who contest elections.\n\nIn a unanimous verdict, the Bench, also comprising Justices B.R. Gavai, Sajiv Khanna, J.B. Padriwala and Manoj Misra, had directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to forthwith stop the issuance of electoral bonds and ordered the Election Commission of India (ECI) to publish on its official website the details of the political parties which have received contributions through electoral bonds since April 2019.\n\nSubsequently, a bench headed by CJI Chandrachud declined to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a Special Investigative Team (SIT) probe under the supervision of a retired apex court judge into an alleged scam in poll financing using electoral bonds.\n\nThe top court said that an SIT cannot be formed to probe \u201cquid pro quo\u201d unless there is an FIR already registered on the issue espoused in the PIL, adding that the ordinary course of law may remedy the allegations raised in the plea.\n\n4. Caste-based division of labour in prisons\n\nA bench headed by CJI DY Chandrachud held it unconstitutional the practice of employing \u201clower caste\u201d jail inmates in cleaning and manual scavenging work in prisons. The Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, directed that the \u201ccaste\u201d column and any references to caste in prisoners\u2019 registers inside the prisons be deleted.\n\nIn its October 2024 verdict, the Supreme Court asked all states and union territories to revise their prison rules providing caste-based division of labour in jails within three months. It also asked the Union government to make changes in the Model Prison Manual 2016 and the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act 2023 within three months.\n\n5. Effective implementation of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006\n\nA bench headed by CJI Chandrachud issued a slew of directions for the effective implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, ordered the state governments and union territories to appoint officers solely responsible for discharging the functions of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers (CMPOs) at the district level.\n\nIt said that child marriage deprives children of their agency, autonomy and right to fully develop and enjoy their childhood. \u201cBoth sexes are adversely affected by forced and early marriage. Marrying in childhood has the effect of objectifying the child. The practice of child marriage imposes mature burdens on children who are not physically or mentally prepared to comprehend the significance of marriage,\u201d ordered SC.\n\n6. Section 6A of Citizenship Act\n\nA Constitution Bench, headed by CJI Chandrachud, upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which was inserted to give effect to the Assam Accord and formed the basis of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam in 2019.\n\nThe 5-judge Bench was dealing with a clutch of petitions challenging Section 6A of the Citizenship Act 1955, on the ground that it violates Articles 6,7,14, 29 and 355 of the Constitution.\n\nIn his opinion, CJI Chandrachud held that Section 6A of the Citizenship Act does not have the effect of amending Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution, which prescribe a cut-off date for conferring citizenship for migrants from East and West Pakistan at the \u201ccommencement of the Constitution\u201d (i.e., on January 26, 1950).\n\n7. NEET-UG 2024\n\nRefusing to order a fresh exam, a bench headed by CJI Chandrachud observed there was no systematic leak of the question paper of the NEET-UG 2024 examination.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said there was no sufficient material available on the record to order a re-test but clarified that its judgment won\u2019t prevent authorities from taking action against candidates who had secured admission using malpractices.\n\n8. Adani-Hindenburg controversy\n\nA bench presided over by CJI Chandrachud refused to form any SIT or group of experts to conduct the investigation in the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and said the facts of the case did not warrant a transfer of investigation from SEBI.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said that reports prepared by third-party organisations such as the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Hindenburg Research cannot be regarded as \u201cconclusive proof\u201d.\n\n9.
