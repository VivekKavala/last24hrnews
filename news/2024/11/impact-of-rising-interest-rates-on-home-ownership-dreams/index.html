                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Interest rate hikes are driven by efforts to curb inflation, but they are making mortgage loans more expensive, which is directly affecting affordability for potential homeowners.</p>

Global overview of the rising interest rates and impact on home affordability 

Global financial markets have been heavily influenced by interest rate hikes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Central banks, including the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve, have consistently increased rates over the last two years to counter inflation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This global trend is mirrored in countries like India, where the RBI has also increased rates to contain inflation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

High interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, making monthly mortgage payments considerably more expensive.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In the US, for example, mortgage rates surged from below 3% to over 7% in less than two years.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This is particularly impactful on young adults and first-time buyers, who now find their purchasing power significantly reduced due to higher home loan costs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

However, in India, we are seeing millennials and Gen Z view property as a viable investment option.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For many young buyers, real estate isn’t just about owning a home; it’s about creating a source of income by buying properties to rent.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This trend is growing as the rental market strengthens, with many seeing potential returns from rising rental demand, especially in urban centers.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Overview of the Indian scenario 

In India, homeownership is culturally significant as it is seen as a source of security and a mark of success.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Interest rate hikes have posed unique challenges in this country.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The RBI has increased the repo rate several times since early 2022, leading banks to raise lending rates.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For instance, mortgage lenders like ICICI and HDFC Bank have raised their home loan interest rates by as much as 50 basis points in recent months.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> As a result, monthly home loan EMIs have increased, which adds financial pressure on middle- and lower-income groups who aspire to own homes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If you are considering applying for a home loan, you must first check your eligibility for home loan offers and calculate your monthly EMIs before making a decision.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Impact of increasing interest rates:

– Decreased affordability – Reduction in home affordability is a key impact of higher interest rates.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> As per Livemint, a 1% increase in interest rates decreases a buyer’s affordability by approximately 7.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>4%.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This means that many prospective buyers must either delay purchasing altogether or reduce their property expectations.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Additionally, higher interest rates directly impact the loan-to-value ratio and eligibility criteria, making homeownership even harder to attain.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

– Stagnant income growth and increased property prices – Despite the challenges presented by rising interest rates, property prices in India have shown resilience, especially in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Surveys indicate that property prices in these metropolitan cities are expected to increase.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This price rice, along with higher interest rates, places significant strain on the home affordability index for Indian buyers.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This issue is further compounded due to the lack of proportional wage growth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

However, there’s also a glimmer of hope for potential homeowners as RBI has kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>5%.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The RBI governor in his monetary policy statement has said that domestic growth has sustained its momentum and world trade is showing signs of improvement.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Also, the unchanged repo rate means predictable EMIs, especially for home loan borrowers with floating interest rates.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

The growing rental market and income opportunities

Many young Indians today view renting as a practical choice, especially in cities with high real estate costs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Renting offers flexibility, but it also drives an interesting trend: property investment to generate rental income.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Many millennials and Gen Z buyers see real estate as a stable investment with the potential to generate passive income.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> As a result, even with rising interest rates, some buyers are choosing to invest in properties specifically to rent, thereby generating income that can help offset mortgage costs and build wealth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

This shift has potential long-term implications for the real estate market, with developers increasingly catering to the rental segment.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Government-backed affordable housing initiatives also play a significant role in accommodating this shift, reinforcing the growing demand for residential properties with rental potential.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Government interventions and developer strategies to tackle affordability issues 

The developers and the Indian government are actively exploring ways to alleviate the burden of interest rate hikes on prospective homeowners.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For example, national and state governments are employing various incentives and subsidy schemes for first-time homebuyers, such as PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana).</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

Furthermore, several property developers are offering flexible payment options, such as interest-free EMIs and extended payment terms, to attract buyers who might otherwise be priced out of the market.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 

However, rising interest rates may reduce the effectiveness of such subsidies, especially if lending rates continue to outpace these benefits.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

What does the future hold? Are interest rates likely to decline?

While current economic forecasts suggest high rates may persist in the short term, a gradual reduction could be possible if inflationary pressures ease.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The RBI’s current decision to maintain the repo rate shows a balanced approach, and if inflation subsides, this could open doors for rate reductions, directly benefiting the real estate market and affordability.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

For potential homeowners in India, lower interest rates would mean improved loan eligibility, reduced EMIs, and better affordability—key factors that could ease their path to homeownership.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Strategies for aspiring homeowners

For aspiring homeowners, it is essential to adopt a proactive approach to financial planning.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Building a substantial down payment, exploring flexible loan options, and researching government assistance programs can help mitigate the impact of high-interest rates.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Financial advisors also recommend buyers consider fixed-rate mortgages, which provide stability amid volatile interest rates.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>
