She revealed that the \u201cfirst half is amazing, the second half is even more so.\u201d\r\n\r\nRashmika took to Instagram, where she shared a picture from the dubbing session, which she captioned as: \u201c#Pushpa The Rule #Dubbing Session On.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe then \u201cgot down to business\u201d and revealed details about the upcoming film, which is directed by Sukumar.\r\n\r\nShe wrote: \u201cNow that the fun and games are over, let's get down to business!! Meaning- 1- Pushpa shoot is almost done.. 2- Pushpa the rule - duo for the first half is over.. 3-1 am Dubbing for the second half and MY GOD!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe actress went on to reveal: \u201cThe film's-first half is already freaking amazing and the second half is even more so..

They wrote in the caption, \u201cTeam #Pushpa2TheRule welcomes The Dancing Queen @sreeleela14 on board for the #Kissik Song of the Year. This song is going to be a dance feast and a musical delight. GRAND RELEASE WORLDWIDE ON 5th DECEMBER, 2024. #Pushpa2TheRuleOnDec5th\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe song is choreographed by Ganesh Acharya. The song, which is expected to be a key highlight of the film, will feature Sreeleela in a glamorous avatar similar to Samantha Ruth Prabhu\u2019s appearance in \u2018 Oo Antava\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2018Pushpa 2: The Rule\u2019 also stars Fahadh Faasil in pivotal roles. Pushpa has indeed become a brand in the country that has set a new benchmark of success.\r\n\r\nDirected by Sukumar and produced by Mythri Movie Makers, the music of the film is from T Series. \u2018Pushpa 2: The Rule\u2019 went through production delays as the makers moved its release date from August 15 to December 6.\r\n\r\nThe release date was once again changed to December 5. The film was earlier supposed to clash with the Vicky Kaushal-starrer \u2018Chhaava\u2019 which is based on the life of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the son of Indian warrior-king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.\r\n\r\nHowever, the makers of \u2018Chhaava\u2019 have reportedly moved the film\u2019s release date in order to avoid the clash.\r\n\r\n\u2018Pushpa 2: The Rule\u2019 is set to arrive in cinemas on December 5, 2024.",

        "title": "Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Review",
        "text": "Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 is not only a big leap in terms of design but also comes with a host of new features. Design and features aside, these are also the first commercially available earbuds specifically designed to let you summon and have a conversation with Google's new Gemini Live virtual AI assistant. Some of these features, including the ability to speak to Gemini Live, are available on the older Buds Pro. However, Google has put its first-ever audio chip, called the Tensor A1, to use in other places. And the differences it brings are sure make the Buds Pro 2 a solid upgrade over the previous model.\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Design: Eggstatic\n\n Size - 22.74mm x 23.08mm x 17.03mm (Buds); 49.9mm x 63.3mm x 25.00mm (Case) Weight - 4.7 (Buds); 65.0g (Case) Water and dust resistance - IP54 (Buds); IPX4 (Case) Colours - Peony, Porcelain, Wintergreen and Hazel\n\nThe egg-shaped case appears the same as before. The texture of its polycarbonate shell still feels like the surface of an egg and is also equally good at picking up colours from the various surfaces you can place it on. In one instance, it even picked up the blue colour from my used jeans when I placed it in the small pocket. But there's no need to worry, as a quick wipe with a tissue and some water makes it look as good as new.\n\nSave for the added speaker cutout, it's hard to tell the Buds Pro 2 case (right) from the Buds Pro (left)\n\nThere's one new addition on the outside, and you will find it at the bottom of the case. Next to the Type-C charging port, you will find a second cavity which is for the speaker. This speaker produces a sound when you are looking for it via the Find My Device app. The sound is loud enough to be picked up in a large house or a quiet park, but not on city streets (especially in Mumbai).\n\nThe design of the Buds Pro 2 (right) has changed for the better\n\nAs for the earbuds, their new design is smaller and lighter than the previous Buds Pro, which now feels excessively bulky and heavy. The smaller design does not bulge out of my ear (which is useful if I fall asleep wearing them), and they fit a lot better because they have a smaller footprint. I had no trouble wearing the Buds Pro 2 for hours on end and almost forgot I was wearing them at times, which is unlike the Buds Pro, which felt heavy and obtrusive.\n\nThe stabiliser (winglet) ensures that the Buds Pro 2 remain in your ears even when jogging\n\nThe new (twist-to-adjust) winglet or stabiliser adds good support when running or moving around. But you have to make sure to try out all the silicone ear tips, as the medium ones left me with a nasty ear ache on day one. It turns out that I had to switch to the smaller tips when using Buds Pro 2. My regular go-to fit for earphones is medium tips.\n\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 was inserted into the case the wrong way (top) and the right way (below).\n\nOne annoying detail about their design is that it's hard to tell whether you have placed them correctly in the charging case. The odd design of the case also allows the buds to be placed in the wrong cavity. And once you have inserted them, you will quickly realise they have been placed incorrectly when you attempt to shut the case. I faced this dilemma several times and somehow wished the cavities that hold the buds in the charging case were designed better.\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2 App and Specifications: Feature-packed!\n\n Processor - Google Tensor A1 Driver - Custom 11 mm dynamic driver Companion App - Google Pixel Buds Gesture controls - Yes\n\nThe Pixel Buds companion app works great on non-Pixel smartphones as well\n\nThe Pixel Buds app ensures that the essential features of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are also available on non-Pixel smartphones. The app basically packages what is normally available in the Bluetooth Settings of a Pixel smartphone into a separate app for non-Pixel devices and is fairly easy to use. Apart from being able to adjust the equaliser, Multipoint and Audio switching settings, the app is also required for firmware updates on non-Pixel smartphones.\n\nIt's finally easier to pull the Buds Pro 2 out of the charging case as they are a bit raised compared to the Buds Pro\n\nI went through the app on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold (Review) and a OnePlus 12 (Review) and was not surprised to find a few features missing. Without a Pixel smartphone, users will not be able to enjoy features like Spatial audio in particular and the same goes for Head tracking that can be used along with the former.\n\nOther than these two, all other features are accessible on non-Pixel devices by simply installing the app. The same, however, cannot be said about using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with iOS-powered devices, as it only delivers the bare minimum (listening to music), so it's best avoided unless you really have to.\n\nThe Hearing Wellness feature is a nice addition to the Pixel Buds app\n\nIt's nice to see a Hearing Wellness section included in the app. It ensures that you do not go deaf while turning up the volume by alerting users about the same. The section in the app shows the Current level (in dBs) and also provides an Exposure report of the last 24 hours or past 7 days, which is nice to have.\n\nLike the Buds Pro, the Buds Pro 2 also has touch and gesture controls, which worked perfectly during the review period without any issues. The buds also offer Active in-ear pressure relief, which will automatically adjust the pressure in your ears (when using the ANC feature) depending on whether you are in an aeroplane or a bus. The Audio switch feature also works well, provided you are signed into the same Google account on all of your Android devices.\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Performance and Battery Life: Impressive in more ways than one\n\n ANC - Yes Bluetooth - v5.4 Codec Support - SBC, AAC Wireless Charging - Yes (Qi-certified)\n\nThe new Tensor A1 chip weighs in when using active noise cancellation (ANC). I found this to be very effective in blocking unwanted sounds during my day-to-day usage. I live right next to a main road in Mumbai, and things can get quite noisy. The ANC system for a pair of TWS earbuds is very capable of cutting off ambient sounds and also attempts to cut off higher-frequency sounds, which is good. However, it cannot cut out voices. Overall, the ANC system had improved drastically over the Pixel Buds Pro, which also produced a fine hissing sound when the ANC was turned on.\n\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google claims to have focussed on delivering clean sound and it shows. There are some notable improvements over the older Pixel Buds Pro, but the Buds Pro 2 still cannot produce sounds as detailed as Sony's WF-1000XM5. These are priced higher, so it's kind of justified. For most casual listeners, the audio sounds bright, with an emphasis on the highs and some punchy but well-controlled bass. Listening to Chris Cain's Down On The Ground, it is easy to tell the emphasis on the highs where the vocals stood out with the mids while the bass, while present, does not ruin it by taking over. This makes it all sound very enjoyable, almost like a live performance (in this case).\n\nThe balanced sound profile is a good start, and you can tweak the audio to your liking by selecting the preset profiles (plenty to choose from) or going with a custom EQ setting in the app. The Transparency mode works beautifully and feels perfectly natural, almost making me forget that I had the earbuds on.\n\nComing to voice quality, the new Tensor A1 will sound perfectly and naturally clear to the caller, but this only applies to quieter settings. In traffic or noisy/windy settings, audio sounds a bit garbled in the sense that you will be audible to the caller, but some words may get chopped short because of the heavy processing. What it can accomplish while doing all of this is suppressing background sound, and it does quite well.\n\nThe Buds Pro 2 easily lasts a workday with ANC and without the charging case.\n\nNow that we are in 2024, it's easy to conclude that Google was indeed testing the waters with its Buds Pro TWS when it came to assistants and AI. The Buds Pro introduced several Google Assistant features and added several more over the years via its Pixel Drop updates. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 is supposed to be a product that is specifically designed for AI from the ground up, just like the Pixel 9 smartphones.\n\nJust like its predecessor, speaking out \u201cHey, Google\u201d will let you accomplish a barrage of features using just your voice. Add a Gemini Advanced plan to the mix, and you can even ask for more complex queries like fetching unread emails in your Gmail inbox or even asking which emails you think you need to reply to.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg, indeed! You can finally have a knowledgeable exchange or a fun conversation (like speaking to a friend) with Gemini Live, as in the movie Her from 2013. It is indeed both shocking and amazing that we have accomplished this in just over a decade of the movie's release, and all you have to say is, \u201cHey Google, let's talk\u201d, without even reaching for the phone in your pocket.\n\nGemini Live works beautifully for conversations... just don't ask it to do something\n\nSince I had detailed conversations with Gemini Live using both a Pixel 9 Pro Fold and a OnePlus 12, I can conclude that these conversations were more responsive on Google's Pixel. And so, it does seem like a Pixel smartphone (especially a recent one) is a better match for these \u201csmarter than usual\u201d earbuds.\n\nWith no support for higher bit-rate Bluetooth codecs (just like the Apple AirPods Pro), the Pixel Buds Pro 2 easily delivers around two days of continuous listening with the case. The Buds Pro 2 can go on for a whole workday (8-9 hours) of listening with ANC on or a whole day (12 hours) with ANC off. As for charging, Google claims that 5 minutes of charging will keep the buds running for 1.5 hours. And yes, you can always let the case trickle charge on a wireless charging pad.\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2: Verdict\n\nGoogle has finally managed to sculpt its Buds Pro 2 into a refined and polished product that many of us wanted it to be. And now, it's finally here! While some features are reserved for Pixel smartphone owners, it's now finally easier to recommend to non-Pixel users, provided you can swallow its Rs. 22,900 price tag.\n\nFor those not seeking any AI experiences from their earbuds, you are indeed better off going for a Sony (for better codec support and more detailed sound) or Bose's (for better noise cancellation) offerings at this price point. But if you are a Pixel smartphone owner, now is the time to upgrade and close the AI-happy ecosystem loop, as the new Buds Pro 2 comes with fewer compromises than ever before.",

I faced this dilemma several times and somehow wished the cavities that hold the buds in the charging case were designed better.\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2 App and Specifications: Feature-packed!\n\n Processor - Google Tensor A1 Driver - Custom 11 mm dynamic driver Companion App - Google Pixel Buds Gesture controls - Yes\n\nThe Pixel Buds companion app works great on non-Pixel smartphones as well\n\nThe Pixel Buds app ensures that the essential features of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are also available on non-Pixel smartphones. The app basically packages what is normally available in the Bluetooth Settings of a Pixel smartphone into a separate app for non-Pixel devices and is fairly easy to use. Apart from being able to adjust the equaliser, Multipoint and Audio switching settings, the app is also required for firmware updates on non-Pixel smartphones.\n\nIt's finally easier to pull the Buds Pro 2 out of the charging case as they are a bit raised compared to the Buds Pro\n\nI went through the app on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold (Review) and a OnePlus 12 (Review) and was not surprised to find a few features missing. Without a Pixel smartphone, users will not be able to enjoy features like Spatial audio in particular and the same goes for Head tracking that can be used along with the former.\n\nOther than these two, all other features are accessible on non-Pixel devices by simply installing the app. The same, however, cannot be said about using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with iOS-powered devices, as it only delivers the bare minimum (listening to music), so it's best avoided unless you really have to.\n\nThe Hearing Wellness feature is a nice addition to the Pixel Buds app\n\nIt's nice to see a Hearing Wellness section included in the app. It ensures that you do not go deaf while turning up the volume by alerting users about the same. The section in the app shows the Current level (in dBs) and also provides an Exposure report of the last 24 hours or past 7 days, which is nice to have.\n\nLike the Buds Pro, the Buds Pro 2 also has touch and gesture controls, which worked perfectly during the review period without any issues. The buds also offer Active in-ear pressure relief, which will automatically adjust the pressure in your ears (when using the ANC feature) depending on whether you are in an aeroplane or a bus. The Audio switch feature also works well, provided you are signed into the same Google account on all of your Android devices.\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Performance and Battery Life: Impressive in more ways than one\n\n ANC - Yes Bluetooth - v5.4 Codec Support - SBC, AAC Wireless Charging - Yes (Qi-certified)\n\nThe new Tensor A1 chip weighs in when using active noise cancellation (ANC). I found this to be very effective in blocking unwanted sounds during my day-to-day usage. I live right next to a main road in Mumbai, and things can get quite noisy. The ANC system for a pair of TWS earbuds is very capable of cutting off ambient sounds and also attempts to cut off higher-frequency sounds, which is good. However, it cannot cut out voices. Overall, the ANC system had improved drastically over the Pixel Buds Pro, which also produced a fine hissing sound when the ANC was turned on.\n\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google claims to have focussed on delivering clean sound and it shows. There are some notable improvements over the older Pixel Buds Pro, but the Buds Pro 2 still cannot produce sounds as detailed as Sony's WF-1000XM5. These are priced higher, so it's kind of justified. For most casual listeners, the audio sounds bright, with an emphasis on the highs and some punchy but well-controlled bass. Listening to Chris Cain's Down On The Ground, it is easy to tell the emphasis on the highs where the vocals stood out with the mids while the bass, while present, does not ruin it by taking over. This makes it all sound very enjoyable, almost like a live performance (in this case).\n\nThe balanced sound profile is a good start, and you can tweak the audio to your liking by selecting the preset profiles (plenty to choose from) or going with a custom EQ setting in the app. The Transparency mode works beautifully and feels perfectly natural, almost making me forget that I had the earbuds on.\n\nComing to voice quality, the new Tensor A1 will sound perfectly and naturally clear to the caller, but this only applies to quieter settings. In traffic or noisy/windy settings, audio sounds a bit garbled in the sense that you will be audible to the caller, but some words may get chopped short because of the heavy processing. What it can accomplish while doing all of this is suppressing background sound, and it does quite well.\n\nThe Buds Pro 2 easily lasts a workday with ANC and without the charging case.\n\nNow that we are in 2024, it's easy to conclude that Google was indeed testing the waters with its Buds Pro TWS when it came to assistants and AI. The Buds Pro introduced several Google Assistant features and added several more over the years via its Pixel Drop updates. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 is supposed to be a product that is specifically designed for AI from the ground up, just like the Pixel 9 smartphones.\n\nJust like its predecessor, speaking out \u201cHey, Google\u201d will let you accomplish a barrage of features using just your voice. Add a Gemini Advanced plan to the mix, and you can even ask for more complex queries like fetching unread emails in your Gmail inbox or even asking which emails you think you need to reply to.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg, indeed! You can finally have a knowledgeable exchange or a fun conversation (like speaking to a friend) with Gemini Live, as in the movie Her from 2013. It is indeed both shocking and amazing that we have accomplished this in just over a decade of the movie's release, and all you have to say is, \u201cHey Google, let's talk\u201d, without even reaching for the phone in your pocket.\n\nGemini Live works beautifully for conversations... just don't ask it to do something\n\nSince I had detailed conversations with Gemini Live using both a Pixel 9 Pro Fold and a OnePlus 12, I can conclude that these conversations were more responsive on Google's Pixel. And so, it does seem like a Pixel smartphone (especially a recent one) is a better match for these \u201csmarter than usual\u201d earbuds.\n\nWith no support for higher bit-rate Bluetooth codecs (just like the Apple AirPods Pro), the Pixel Buds Pro 2 easily delivers around two days of continuous listening with the case. The Buds Pro 2 can go on for a whole workday (8-9 hours) of listening with ANC on or a whole day (12 hours) with ANC off. As for charging, Google claims that 5 minutes of charging will keep the buds running for 1.5 hours. And yes, you can always let the case trickle charge on a wireless charging pad.\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2: Verdict\n\nGoogle has finally managed to sculpt its Buds Pro 2 into a refined and polished product that many of us wanted it to be. And now, it's finally here! While some features are reserved for Pixel smartphone owners, it's now finally easier to recommend to non-Pixel users, provided you can swallow its Rs. 22,900 price tag.\n\nFor those not seeking any AI experiences from their earbuds, you are indeed better off going for a Sony (for better codec support and more detailed sound) or Bose's (for better noise cancellation) offerings at this price point. But if you are a Pixel smartphone owner, now is the time to upgrade and close the AI-happy ecosystem loop, as the new Buds Pro 2 comes with fewer compromises than ever before.",

        "text": "The most affordable iPad model is set to receive a big upgrade thanks to Apple Intelligence next year. Bringing AI to the entry-level model is part of the broader strategy at Apple to integrate AI across all devices, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman. In his latest Power On Newsletter, Gurman noted that the iPhone SE is expected to gain Apple Intelligence features by March 2025, with the entry-level iPad following suit \u201clater in the year.\u201d\nThe report also highlighted that all of the Apple devices with a screen are expected to receive AI support by the end of 2026. The timeline shows a large gap since the last refresh of the entry-level iPad that happened in October 2022. The delay could be related to the technological challenges of integrating AI capabilities into a low-cost device.\nCurrently, the 10th-generation iPad is the most affordable tablet offered from the company, with a price tag of Rs 34,900. It comes with an A14 Bionic chip, which debuted with the iPhone 12 lineup in 2020. According to MacRumors, the A16 chip, which was unveiled with the iPhone 15 models, is likely to be the preferred choice for the next iPad. However, if Apple aims to make Apple Intelligence more accessible, an A17 Pro or A18 chip may be required.\nThe tech giant recently launched an 8.3-inch iPad Mini, powered by the robust A17 Pro chipset and equipped with Apple Intelligence features.\nApple\u2019s AI is a collection of tools that improves writing, focus and communication on Apple devices.

The pilot scheme included the transfer of liquidity between various UBS companies. UBS said it plans to expand and develop UBS Digital Cash in further steps. The system should allow firms to manage intraday-liquidity and adjust liquidity buffers on their accounts more easily due to increased visibility of their cash positions, UBS said.

        "title": "The importance of Deepawali",
        "text": "Er. Prabhat Kishore\n\nIndia is the land of festivals. Deepawali or Diwali is one of them, which is celebrated on the Amavasya of Kartik Krishna Paksha. The Shanti Mantra from Brihadaranyaka Upnishad \u201cTamso Ma Jyotirgamya\u201d i.e. \u201cLead me from darkness to light\u201d reveals its spiritual spirit.\n\nDeepawali is a 5-day long festival, which starts from Dhanteras and ends on Bhaiya Duj. Deepawali is mentioned in Padma Puran and Skand Puran. It is composed of two Sanskrit words \u201cDeep\u201d i.e. light or candle and meaning that which glows, illuminates or knowledge and \u201cAwali\u201d i.e. rows or series. Thus Deepawali means \u201cRows of Lights\u201d or \u201cFestival of Lights\u201d.\n\nThe first day, Dhanvantari Trayodoshi or Dhanteras is celebrated to commemorate the arrival of Devi Lakshmi from KshirSagar (Ocean) during the Samudra Manthan (churning of the cosmic ocean of milk) by the Devtas and Asuras to receive the Amrit (nector). On this day, Bhagwan Dhanvantari also came out of the ocean with Ayurved for mankind. Bhagwan Kuber, the lord of wealth is also worshipped. Shopping for new items on this day is considered auspicious.\n\nChhoti Diwali, also termed as Narak Chaturdashi or Roop Chaudash, is the second day of the festival. It is celebrated because Bhagwan Krishna and his wife Satyabhama had killed demon king Narkasur of Pragjyotish and released nearly 16000 girls from demon's captivity. It is also believed that Devi Kali had made Narkasur disappear.\n\nOn the third day, the main Diwali is celebrated with great enthusiasm all over the world. Devi Lakshmi and Bhagwan Ganesh are worshiped together to achieve the blessing of wealth & prosperity and the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness. According to mythology, once Goddess Lakshmi was proud of herself that the whole world worships her and yearns to get her. Lord Vishnu understood this feeling of his conscience and with the aim of breaking Lakshmi's pride, he said that Goddess, even though the whole universe yearns to have you, you are not yet complete. Lakshmiji narrated her woes to her friend Parvatiji and asked her to adopt Ganesh, one of her two sons. Lakshmiji adopted Ganesh with the consent of Parvatiji and since then Ganesh was came to be called the adopted son of Devi Lakshmi. Being very pleased Devi Lakshmi gave a boon to Ganesh that I will fulfill the wishes of the devotees only when they will worship you along with me. For this reason, there is a law to worship Ganesh along with Lakshmi in Diwali. Bhagwan Kuber is also worshiped by the devotees on this auspicious day.\n\nThere are several beliefs behind this festival. In Treta Yug, Raja Ramchandra along with Sita, Lakshman & Hanuman returned to Ayodhya from Lanka on this day after victory over Ravan and people celebrated the occasion by lighting Deeyas and decorating Rangolis. On this auspicious day the Nirvan Diwas of Bhagwan Mahavir, 24th Tirthankar of Jain, is observed by the followers of Jainism. The Sikh community celebrates this day to mark the release of Guru Hargovind ji Maharaj from Mugal prison and his arrival at the Holy Swarnmandir, Amritsar.\n\nThe fourth day is the Govardhan Puja or Padwa. Bhagwan Krishna had lifted the Govardhan parvat and held it up to protect the people and cattle from the rain & thunder produced by the angry Indra. When Indra conceded defeat, on the request of Krishna, the people of Brajbhoomi started performing the Govardhan Puja.\n\nBhaiya Duj or Bhai Teeka is the fifth and last day of Diwali. This day is dedicated to sisters. Yamraj (the lord of death) had visited his sister Yamuna on this day and gave her a vardhan (boon) that whoever visits his sister on this day will be liberated from all sins and will achieve Moksha or final emancipation. As per another belief, Krishna had visited his sister Subhadra after defeating Narakasur, who welcomed him with a tilak on his forehead.\n\nThe festival of Deepawali not only has religious or spiritual significance, but it also has scientific importance. The clay Deeyas with oil and cotton wick are eco-friendly and do not leave any harmful residue. During monsoon, the air is moist and full of bacteria & fungus. The heat generated from the Deeya destroys the bacteria, insects, fungus and thus cleans the air. The magnesium present in the Deeya's oil reacts with harmful Sulphur and Carbon Dio-oxide present in the air to form Sulphate and Carbonates and purify the environment.\n\nThe Panch Tatwa (five elements of the universe)-Kshiti (Earth), Jal (Water), Pawak (Fire), Gagan (Sky) & Sameer (Air)- is represented by the Deeya. The Earth element is represented by the clay Deeya, oil & cotton wick, Water is produced during the combustion of oil, Fire by the light generated, Sky by the light around the flame, and Air is the oxygen diffused to the wick.\n\nDeepawali is the season of celebration and there is joy, light and happiness everywhere around us. It illuminates the houses and hearts and spread the message of friendship and togetherness.\n\n(Author is a technocrat \n\nand academician)",

Management believes the strategic consideration between electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids led by polarised policy positioning ahead of the US presidential elections, and regulatory concerns related to Chinese OEMs and associated tariff in the Europe is leading to decision-making delay, tapering of demand, and smaller deal sizes as customers are cautious to committing larger, long-term projects.\n\nThis likely reflects a shift from accelerated adoption to protectionism and pricing pressure which in-turn could moderate capex intensity, a key rationale for our reduce rating. \n\nDespite challenges in the services business, Tata Technologies believes that stable anchor accounts, traction in the aerospace segment supported by recent Airbus accreditations, ramp-up in BMW and Agratas deals and the strength in education are key growth drivers which could help offset near-term challenges while clarity in automotive business could emerge early next year. \n\nUpside risks to our estimates and rating include EV recovery-led growth in the automotive business which, in turn, could help achieve long-term margin aspiration.",

        "text": "Google Pixel 11a could arrive in 2027 as a midrange phone in the company's Pixel A-series, and the handset will reportedly be equipped with the Tensor G6 chip that is expected to debut in 2026 with the Pixel 11 series. This processor is also expected to power the Pixel Tablet 3, which is also expected to launch in 2027. A new report claims that the Pixel 11a and Pixel Tablet 3 will feature a less capable version of the Tensor G6 chip, in order to keep costs low.\r\n\r\nGoogle Pixel 11a, Pixel Tablet 3 Could Arrive With Less Capable Tensor G6 Chip in 2027\r\n\r\nCiting leaked documents from Google's G-Chips division, Android Authority reports that Google plans to launch four devices as part of the Pixel 11 series \u2014 \"Base '26\", \"Premium' 26\", \"Fold '26\" and an \"Entry Phone '27\". These could refer to the Pixel 11, Pixel 11 Pro, Pixel 11 Pro Fold, and Pixel 11a, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe numbers listed above also suggest that the Pixel 11a could be launched in mid 2027, in line with Google's current practice of introducing a new midrange handset six months after its latest Pixel phones are unveiled.Pixel 9a Tipped to Sport 6.3-Inch Screen, 48-Megapixel Camera in New Leak\r\n\r\nThe report states that while all four handsets in the Pixel 11 series will be equipped with a Tensor G6 chip, the Pixel 11a and the Pixel Tablet 3 \u2014 referred to as \u201cTablet Pixel \u201827\u201d \u2014 will be equipped with a less powerful version of the chip.\r\n\r\nWhile Google's current Pixel A-series phones feature Tensor chips with different packaging in order to keep costs low, the publication claims that this will not be possible once the company's chips are produced by TSMC next year.\r\n\r\nInstead, Google will reportedly \"fuse off defective parts of the TPU\" that will allow it to use those chips on the Pixel 11a and Pixel Tablet 3. As a result, these devices are unlikely to be as capable of handling AI tasks as the company's more expensive products.Google Could Make a Long-Overdue SoC Switch With Pixel Watch 5 in 2026\r\n\r\nGoogle's Pixel Tablet 3 Might Offer More Connectivity Options\r\n\r\nThe publication also claims that the Tensor G6 chip on the Pixel Tablet 3 will be equipped with a second USB Type-C port controller. The company is expected to enable support for more expansion options for its tablet, allowing power users to use the tablet for additional functionality.\r\n\r\nGoogle's first-generation Pixel Tablet is equipped with a standard USB 2.0 Type-C port, but it also offers USB 2.0 connectivity via the pogo interface used to dock the tablet. According to the report, the Pixel Tablet 3 will include support for a new USB 3.2 port that will also support DisplayPort output, which could also come in handy for advanced users.\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "For four days billionaire Elon Musk toured Pennsylvania, putting his money and fame into helping Republican Donald Trump's campaign to take back the White House in November.Musk drew praise from conservatives at his rallies while fielding questions about artificial intelligence, government regulation, sentient robots and vaccines.He also made a string of false claims about election fraud, some of them echoing those made by Trump the last four years.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of the X social media platform, Musk also handed out two $1 million checks to randomly picked people who signed his online petition backing US constitutional rights to freedom of speech and bear arms.Musk, 53, has more than a passing interest in Trump's success. If reelected, Trump promises to make Musk head of a government efficiency commission, a job Musk vows will help rid the country of regulations he views as bad for the economy and a deterrent to doing business.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");CASHMusk shocked a crowd of roughly 1,500 at a nondenominational church in the Pennsylvania capital of Harrisburg on Saturday when he announced he was giving away $1 million. The first winner was John Dreher, who rushed to the stage in a signature red MAGA cap, pumping his arms in the air.\"I've been following you for 10 years, got your biography 10 years ago and been watching ever since,\" Dreher said to Musk.On Sunday, Musk awarded another $1 million check to Kristine Fishell, who appeared stunned as her name was called and she took the stage in a red Trump T-shirt.\"Thank you so much for ... I mean I truly believe everything you're doing, truly. You don't need to be doing it, I know a lot of us feel the same way.\"Musk said the winners are picked randomly but must have signed his petition and be registered voters in the battleground states that will decide November's election, such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona.His handouts have stirred legal questions.CONSPIRACIESMusk has also embraced conspiracy theories pushed by Trump, and is spinning some of his own.He revived false theories claiming that voting machines rig elections - an assertion that has been repeatedly debunked since it was pushed by those seeking to overturn Trump's 2020 loss.He mentioned Dominion Voting Systems, which last year sued Fox News for defamation over false claims that the company engaged in a vote-rigging conspiracy. Dominion agreed to a landmark $787 million settlement with the network.\"There's always a sort of question of like, say, the Dominion voting machines. It is weird that the, you know, I think they're used in Philadelphia and in Maricopa County (Arizona), but not in a lot of other places.\"In a statement, Dominion pointed to inaccuracies in Musk's comments, including the fact they don't operate in Philadelphia.Musk also accused Democrats of channeling vast numbers of migrants who enter the US illegally into battleground states.Presenting no evidence, he alleged that Harris would legalize the migrants after the election if she wins, giving Democrats clear majorities in those states.The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Similar claims have been debunked in the past.'POST THE EVIDENCE'For many at the events, the idea the 2020 election was stolen from Trump was taken as fact despite a lack of evidence.One attendee in Harrisburg asked Musk what he was doing to prevent a recurrence. Musk responded by leaning into the unfounded allegations.\"I mean if the margin of victory is high enough, then I think it can exceed any sort of cheating that may take place. So we're going to aim for just a massive margin,\" Musk said.He encouraged people to use his X platform, formerly known as Twitter, to shine a spotlight on potential election cheating.\"If people think there's a fraud, then they should post the images, post the videos, post the evidence,\" he said.SHARKS AND WHALESMusk has millions of dollars in government contracts and his companies face significant and at times costly government regulations which typically are designed to protect things like consumers, drinking water and wildlife.Musk was asked if in such a job he would take a flamethrower to stacks of regulations and post a video of it. \"I think a bonfire of nonsense regulations would be epic,\" Musk said.Musk recounted how SpaceX was forced to conduct a study to determine whether his rockets would hurt sharks when landing in the water.\"I'm like, it's a big ocean, you know, there's a lot of sharks. It's not impossible, but it's very unlikely,\" Musk said.Reluctantly, they conducted the study only to be told to do a similar review on potential threats to whales, Musk said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Meta announced that it's testing facial recognition technology to detect scam ads and assist users in faster account recovery on Monday. The social media giant is specifically targeting \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams, where scammers use images of celebrities and public figures to lure users into interacting with the ad and clicking malicious links. Additionally, the Menlo Park-based tech giant is also testing using video selfies to let users quickly regain access to their compromised accounts. The company said it aims to proactively remove harmful content from its platforms to create a safer experience for users.\r\n\r\nMeta Testing Facial Recognition Technology\r\n\r\nIn a newsroom post, the social media giant detailed its approach to using facial recognition technology. Meta is currently working on using the technology in two ways \u2014 detecting \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams and identity verification for quicker account recovery.\r\n\r\nHighlighting the issue of \u201cceleb-bait\u201d ad scams on Facebook and Instagram, the company said that scammers often use images of public figures to make users interact with ads. Users are asked to click on fraudulent links, and because of the trust factor of the celebrity, some fall for scams.Meta AI on WhatsApp Might Soon Be Able to Remember Your Preferences\r\n\r\nSo far, Meta has used the native ad review system to detect fake ads from legitimate ones. This system is based on machine learning and reviews millions of ads that run on its platforms. The automated system analyses the text, images, and videos featured in the ad. Now, to further bolster the system, the social media giant is testing facial recognition.\r\n\r\nThe company is currently using facial recognition on a limited scale to \u201ccompare faces in an ad to the public figure's Facebook and Instagram profile pictures.\u201d In case a match is confirmed and it is determined that the ad is a scam, Meta said it will automatically block it. The technology is also being used to detect and block accounts that impersonate a public figure.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Meta is in early stages of testing and is using a small group of celebrities and public figures to check and improve the speed and efficacy of detection. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we'll start showing in-app notifications to a larger group of public figures who've been impacted by celeb-bait letting them know we're enrolling them in this protection,\u201d the company added. Public figures who enrol in this protection will be allowed to opt out via Account Centre.Meta Unveils New Facebook Video Tab and AI-Powered Video Ad Tools\r\n\r\nFacial Recognition in Account Recovery\r\n\r\nMeta is also testing the use of facial recognition to help users regain access to compromised accounts. Many times, Meta's automated systems can flag an account incorrectly and lock it. This could be due to suspicious activity or if a hacker attempted to break into the user's account. Alternatively, proving identity is also necessary if users forget their account passwords. In such cases, users so far were asked to verify their identity by submitting a government identity card.\r\n\r\nNow, the social media giant is testing the use of video selfies to quickly let users regain access to their accounts. Users will have to upload a video selfie, and by running facial recognition technology, the company will compare the data to the profile pictures on the account they are trying to access.\r\n\r\nIn both use cases, Meta claims that it will not store any facial data generated after the comparison is made, regardless if there is a match or not. Additionally, in video selfies, the company stated that the video data will be encrypted and \u201cwill never be visible on their profile, to friends or to other people on Facebook or Instagram.\u201d\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "title": "The expanding horizons of physiotherapy: Integrating technology with holistic care",
        "text": "The integration of new technologies is revolutionising physical therapy. Wearable sensors are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of physiotherapy Khyatee The critical role of physiotherapy in promoting workforce health, addressing sedentary lifestyle issues, correcting postural imbalances, and enhancing productivity is increasingly being recognised not only by the common man but also by the corporate sector.Needless to say, physiotherapy is a holistic approach that aids individuals in recovering, maintaining, and enhancing their mobility and overall well-being. This evolving field which is continually shaped by technological advancements and shifts in healthcare practices, enhances its effectiveness in patient care in different arenas. Expanding Roles in Mental Health: Physical therapists are increasingly involved in mental health care, particularly in managing depression and anxiety. By leveraging the mind-body connection, physical therapists can offer low-intensity psychological interventions to address symptoms related to mental health conditions. Electroceuticals like Deep Brain Stimulation can help reduce insomnia, anxiety, and depression. We can also help in the well-being of children with autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Deficit. This shift towards integrating physical therapy with mental health care reflects a broader trend toward holistic patient management. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is transforming physical therapy by enabling more personalized and efficient patient care. Advanced algorithms analyse extensive patient data to create tailored rehabilitation programs and forecast pain patterns. AI-powered wearables and immersive technologies like virtual and augmented reality are enhancing therapeutic interventions, allowing for real-time adjustments and improved patient engagement. Adoption of the PRISM Pain Model: The Pain Recovery and Integrative Systems Model (PRISM), developed through collaboration between the APTA and the National Institutes of Health, is set to revolutionize pain management in physical therapy. PRISM addresses the complex nature of pain beyond traditional models, facilitating more effective decision-making and treatment approaches. Boon in Geriatric conditions: Elders are susceptible to various illnesses usually including musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiopulmonary problems, mental illness, balance problems, and chronic pain. Physiotherapy treatment has been successful in managing each of these ailments. Emphasis on Primary Care Physical Therapy: The trend towards preventive and patient-centred care is spotlighting primary care physical therapy. By focusing on non-pharmacological interventions and early intervention, physical therapists are providing alternatives to manage pain and chronic conditions. This approach not only reduces healthcare costs but also enhances patient outcomes through collaborative, holistic care. For instance, take the case of stroke rehabilation. Physical therapy helps stroke survivors regain motor functions and improve muscle strength, coordination, and balance through targeted exercises and treatments. Similarly, the therapy promotes neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganie and form new neural connections. Therapists use techniques to encourage the brain to adapt and compensate for damaged areas.In functional training, therapy includes functional training to help patients perform everyday tasks, which can significantly enhance their quality of life and self-sufficiency. Growing Popularity of Aquatic Therapy: Aquatic therapy, or hydrotherapy, continues to gain recognition for its benefits, including reduced joint stress and increased flexibility. This low-impact therapeutic option is particularly effective for patients with musculoskeletal issues and is becoming a more common feature in rehabilitation facilities. Innovations in Technology: The integration of new technologies is revolutionizing physical therapy. Motion capture technology and wearable sensors are enhancing the precision of care plans. Virtual reality and interactive video games are improving patient engagement and adherence to therapy. Additionally, rehabilitation robotics, such as exoskeletons and intelligent prosthetics, are offering tailored support that adapts to patients' progress. Telehealth is also on the rise, providing patients with flexible, convenient access to therapy. Increasing Need for Referrals: As physical therapists take on more comprehensive roles, collaboration with physicians becomes increasingly important. Physicians are recognizing the benefits of physical therapy interventions, leading to a higher demand for referrals. These trends highlight the ongoing evolution in physical therapy, emphasizing a shift towards more personalized, technology-driven, and integrated approaches.

        "title": "Harvard Students Develop App to Identify Anyone Using Meta Smart Glasses",
        "text": "Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses were used by two Harvard engineering students to build an app that can reveal sensitive information about people without them realising it. The students posted a demo of the video on X (formerly known as Twitter) and showcased the app's capability. Notably, the app is not being made publicly available to users, instead, they made it to highlight the dangers of AI-powered wearable devices that use discreet cameras that can capture photos and images of people. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Used to Build a Doxxing App The app, dubbed I-Xray, uses artificial intelligence (AI) for facial recognition and then uses processed visual data to doxx individuals. Doxxing, a popular Internet slang which is a portmanteau of \u201cdropping dox (informal of docs or documents)\u201d, is the act of revealing personal information about someone without their consent. It was integrated with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, but the developers said that it would work with any smart glasses with discreet cameras. It uses an AI model similar to PimEyes and FaceCheck for reverse facial recognition. The technology can match the face of an individual to publicly available images of them online and scour the URLs. Another large language model (LLM) is then fed these URLs and an automatic prompt is generated to find out the person's name, occupation, address, and other similar data. The AI model also looks through publicly available government data such as voter registration databases. Additionally, an online tool named FastPeopleSearch was also used for this. Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance? @CaineArdayfio and I offer an answer to protect yourself here:https://t.co/LhxModhDpk pic.twitter.com/Oo35TxBNtD \u2014 AnhPhu Nguyen (@AnhPhuNguyen1) September 30, 2024 In a short video demonstration, Harvard students AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio also showcased the workings of this app. They were able to meet strangers with the camera already turned on, and ask their name, and the AI-powered app could take over from there to find personal data about the individual. In a Google Docs file, the developers said, \u201cThis synergy between LLMs and reverse face search allows for fully automatic and comprehensive data extraction that was previously not possible with traditional methods alone.\u201d The students have stated that they do not intend to make the app publicly available and only developed it to highlight the risks of an AI-enabled wearable device that can discreetly record people. However, this does not mean that bad actors cannot make a similar app using a similar methodology. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",
