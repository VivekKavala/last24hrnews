                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In an exclusive interview to The Hindu, Finland’s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said, “We would like to see India lend its support to Ukraine’s Peace Formula, which is the only peace plan based on respecting the UN Charter and key principles of international law.</p>

Why India refused to back the Ukraine summit statement?

“We would prefer to see all parties, including India, use their own international clout to exert influence on Russia to change course and respect the UN Charter.</p>

Finland, which is a part of the EU, has imposed sanctions on Russia.</p>
