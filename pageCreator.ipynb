The appointment was the first of what is expected to be a flurry of staffing announcements as Trump girds for a return to the White House on Jan. 20.

The low-key Wiles, 67, will be the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected, Trump said in a statement. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud. Trump has been secluded at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, since defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election. He is considering a wide array of people for top jobs in his administration, many of them familiar figures from his 2017-2021 presidency, four sources said. Wiles, a long-time Florida-based political strategist, and fellow campaign manager Chris LaCivita are credited with running a more disciplined operation for Trump's third presidential bid compared with his past campaigns. Trump thanked them both during his victory speech early on Wednesday. Susie likes to stay in the back, let me tell you, Trump said, as she stood toward the back of the stage. We call her the ice maiden. Several people who have worked with Wiles said in interviews on Thursday that she would provide stability and sage counsel to Trump in the White House. Trump ran through four chiefs of staff - an unusually high number - during his 2017-2021 term as they struggled to rein in the famously undisciplined president. Susie is a strong woman and a true leader with a proven track record of getting things done, said Florida-based Republican consultant David Johnson. Wiles previously worked on Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and helped Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis win election in 2018. She served as a senior adviser on Trump's 2016 and 2020 bids. Trump chose Wiles over former House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who is close to Trump and has been a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago. Sources said McCarthy had been in contention as well as Brooke Rollins, who was the former acting director of Trump's Domestic Policy Council. A fierce Trump ally, New York Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, is under consideration to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a source familiar with the matter said. Former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who was an acting intelligence chief in Trump's first term and was with him when he recently met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in New York, is under consideration for secretary of state. Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan, is also under consideration for that position, the sources said. Hagerty, asked by CNN about being considered for a role in Trump's administration, said, I'll leave the speculation to the speculators.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff.

Wiles is widely credited within and outside Trump’s inner circle for running what was, by far, his most disciplined and well-executed campaign, and was seen as the leading contender for the position. She largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning. She resisted the formal title of campaign manager, avoiding becoming a target, given Trump’s history of cycling through people in that role. Wiles’ hire is Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration, as he must quickly build the team that will help run the massive federal government. Wiles doesn’t bring much federal government experience to the role, but has a close relationship with the president-elect. On the campaign, Wiles was able to do what few others have been able to: help control Trump’s impulses — not by chiding him or lecturing, but by earning his respect and showing him that he was better off when he followed her advice than flouting it. Eight years ago, Trump tossed the careful planning of his transition team and instead hired a motley assortment of campaign aides, family members and Republican insiders who spent the better part of his first year in office engaged in infighting that dominated news coverage of the new administration. It was what many experts consider a foundational mistake that hamstrung a president who was new to Washington and government upon his swearing in. Trump went through four chiefs of staff — including one who served in an acting capacity for a year — during his first administration, part of a record-setting personnel churn. Many top aides were cast out by Trump in his first term, who resented being made to feel managed or condescended to, while others got caught up in ideological spats within the factionalized West Wing. Trump aides see hope that Wiles’ selection marks a sign that the president-elect is aiming to build a more cohesive team, though one that will almost certainly remain less conventional than his Democratic or Republican predecessors. Trump, who promised in 2016 to hire “only the best people” has since repeatedly said that he believes the biggest mistake of his first term was hiring the wrong people. He was new to Washington then, he has said, and didn’t know any better. But now, Trump said, he knows the “best people” and those to avoid for roles in his administration. “Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,\" Trump said in a statement. \"It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.” Successful chiefs of staff serve as the president’s confidant, help execute a president’s agenda and balance competing political and policy priorities. They also tend to serve as a gatekeeper, helping determine whom the president spends his time with and whom he speaks to — an effort Trump chafed under inside the White House. The chief of staff is “absolutely critical to an effective White House,” said Chris Whipple, whose book “The Gatekeepers” details how the White House chief of staff role shapes and defines a presidency. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn’t want to hear.\" “On the plus side, she’s shown that she can manage Trump, that she works with him and can sometimes tell him hard truths, and that’s really important,\" said Whipple. “On the minus side, she really has no White House experience and hasn’t really worked in Washington in 40 years. And that’s a real disadvantage.” Wiles is a longtime Florida-based Republican strategist who ran Trump’s campaigns in the state in 2016 and 2020, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\\' successful bid for office in 2018. Before that, she ran Rick Scott’s 2010 campaign for Florida governor and briefly served as the manager of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential campaign. Wiles also worked in the offices of former Jacksonville mayors John Delaney and John Peyton. Chris LaCivita, who along with Wiles served as de-facto campaign manager, described Wiles as someone who is inclusive in conversations, who seeks input from others and is steadfastly loyal. “Susie is just functionally built differently because she has that rare commodity to be able to work on so many different important issues simultaneously,” ...', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-names-susie-wiles-as-chief-of-staff-first-woman-in-the-post-1836299', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/08/1860357-aa-3420617.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 00:49:41', 'author': 'Associated Press', 'authors': ['Associated Press'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.116}, {'id': 263447852, 'title': 'Who is Susie Wiles, first woman White House chief of staff', 'text': \"US President-elect Donald Trump in a historic move appointed Susie Wiles as the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. A veteran political strategist and key figure in Trump’s 2024 campaign, Wiles is widely known for her strategic expertise and her ability to navigate the complexities of Trump's political style. The selection was confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance, who described her as “the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump’s highly successful 2024 Campaign for President.”Wiles has deep roots in Republican politics, particularly in Florida, where she managed multiple successful campaigns. Known for steering Trump’s Florida efforts in both 2016 and 2020, she also contributed to the 2018 gubernatorial campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Her political career began in the 1970s in Washington, working in the office of New York Representative Jack Kemp, followed by roles in Ronald Reagan’s campaign and administration. She later transitioned to Florida politics, where she helped Rick Scott secure the governorship in 2010.Trump praised her as “tough, smart, innovative, and universally admired,” adding, “It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”A trusted advisor with strategic edgeWiles’ success with Trump lies in her ability to balance his temperament while maintaining a disciplined campaign structure. She worked alongside co-manager Chris LaCivita to lead a more organised campaign than Trump’s previous runs. Known for her low-profile approach, Wiles avoided the spotlight, even refraining from speaking at Trump’s victory event. 115067735Her role as chief of staff will involve coordinating the president-elect’s agenda, managing personnel, and acting as a close advisor. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” said Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers. Whipple acknowledged her skill but noted her limited Washington experience as a possible disadvantage.Climbing Florida's political ladderDaughter of NFL legend Pat Summerall, launched her political career in Washington before establishing herself as a formidable strategist in Florida's high-stakes political landscape. She played a pivotal role in Rick Scott's successful 2010 gubernatorial bid and briefly worked on Jon Huntsman's 2012 presidential campaign. However, her relationship with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis grew tense, ultimately leading to a split. This division escalated during the 2024 primaries, where she led Donald Trump’s campaign against DeSantis.Wiles’ influence within Trump’s team reportedly fueled the campaign’s strategy, often using insider knowledge from her past work with DeSantis. After DeSantis suspended his presidential bid, Wiles posted a succinct farewell on social media: “Bye, bye.”Throughout the campaign, Trump’s aides, emboldened by Wiles’ insights, seized opportunities to mock DeSantis, targeting everything from his mannerisms to his footwear.A Pragmatic approach to Trump’s leadership styleWiles’ pragmatic approach earned her Trump’s respect, allowing her to guide him without lecturing or reprimanding. During a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania, Wiles reportedly managed to communicate disapproval by standing nearby and staring in silence depicting her unique approach to managing Trump’s behaviour. Trump has publicly acknowledged her contributions, describing her leadership as “incredible” and calling her campaign management his “best-run campaign.”Challenges ahead in West WingWiles’ appointment signals a potential shift from Trump’s first term, where he experienced high turnover in the chief of staff role. Trump has remarked that he feels more prepared for his second term, having learned from past personnel decisions. While Wiles’ ability to balance discipline and Trump’s dynamic style has been effective, only time will tell if her role will bring more stability to the administration as she steps into one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.\", 'summary': \"Veteran Republican strategist Susie Wiles has been appointed as the first female White House Chief of Staff by US President-elect Donald Trump.

It was his first appointment since winning Tuesday's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Here are some key facts about Wiles, who is set to run day-to-day operations at the White House:Disciplined operationWiles, a longtime Republican strategist, is widely credited - along with co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita - with running the most disciplined and sophisticated of Trump's three presidential campaigns. She did not always succeed at stopping Trump from going off-script, but she kept damaging media leaks to a relative minimum, launched a bold and successful strategy to win over some Latino and Black voters and led the former president to a decisive win.Party establishmentWiles got her start working for Republican President Ronald Reagan's successful 1980 campaign. For years, she worked with some moderate Republicans who promoted dramatically different policies than those of Trump. Early in her career, she worked for Republican U.S. representatives Jack Kemp, an ardent advocate of free trade, and Tillie Fowler, who was widely considered a moderate on several issues, including gun control. She also served briefly as the manager of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr.'s 2012 presidential campaign. Huntsman was arguably the most moderate Republican in the field that year. He sharply criticized Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump's supporters.Working for the enemyLater in her career, Wiles started working for more combative party figures, some of whom would become Trump allies, including U.S. Senator Rick Scott of Florida. Notably, she was a key figure in Ron DeSantis' successful 2018 Florida gubernatorial campaign. She was dismissed by DeSantis after he took office. When Trump and DeSantis squared off in the Republican presidential primary, she presided over an aggressive and successful strategy to portray her old boss as personally off-putting and out of touch on some key policy issues. Ice Maden While Wiles is personally friendly, she is relatively little-known and enigmatic for a political strategist of her stature. She rarely gives televised interviews and avoids speaking engagements. Like many successful campaign managers, she can be ruthless when merited. Her personality contrasted with that of LaCivita, who was notably garrulous and outspoken. During his victory speech, Trump referred to Wiles as the ice maiden. Prominent FamilyWiles is the daughter of Pat Summerall, who was a prominent football player and sportscaster. Summerall played in the National Football League for a decade and later announced 16 Super Bowls. He died in 2013.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump appointed Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff, following his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.

The person manages White House staff, organises the President’s time and schedule, and maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers.\\nWiles, a long-time Florida-based political strategist, and fellow campaign manager Chris LaCivita are credited with running a more disciplined operation for Trump’s third presidential bid compared with his past campaigns.\\nSUSIE’S ROLE IN TRUMP’S RACE FOR WHITE HOUSE\\nShortly before DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race in January, Wiles made a rare appearance on social media. She responded to a message that DeSantis had cleared his campaign website of upcoming events with a short but clear message: “Bye, bye.”\\nJoining up with Trump’s third campaign in its nascent days, Wiles is one of the few top officials to survive an entire Trump campaign and was part of the team that put together a far more professional operation for his third White House bid — even if the former president routinely broke through those guardrails anyway.\\nShe largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning.\\nHowever, she showed she was not above taking on tasks reserved for volunteers. At one of Trump’s appearances in Iowa in July of last year, as the former President posed for pictures with a long line of voters, Wiles grabbed a clipboard and started approaching people waiting to get them to fill out cards committing to caucus for Trump in the leadoff primary contest.\\n“If we leave the conference room after a meeting and somebody leaves trash on the table, Susie’s the person to grab the trash and put it in the trash can,” said Chris LaCivita, who served as campaign co-chair along with Wiles.\\nAnother of her three posts on X this year was in the closing days of the campaign, clapping back after billionaire Mark Cuban remarked that Trump didn’t have “strong, intelligent women” in his orbit. After Wiles’s selection as White House chief of staff, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Trump backer, quipped on X that the president-elect had chosen a “strong, intelligent woman” as his chief of staff.\\nWiles was able to help control Trump’s worst impulses — not by chiding him or lecturing, but by earning his respect and showing him that he was better off when he followed her advice than flouted it. At one point late in the campaign, when Trump gave a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania in which he strayed from his talking points and suggested he wouldn’t mind the media being shot, Wiles came out to stare at him silently.\\nTrump often referenced Wiles on the campaign trail, publicly praising her leadership of what he said he was often told was his “best-run campaign.”\\n“She’s incredible. Incredible,” he said at a Milwaukee rally earlier this month.', 'summary': 'Trump chose Wiles over former House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who is close to Trump and has been a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago.', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/world/susie-wiles-white-house-chief-of-staff-who-is-susie-wiles-donald-trump-us-election-2024-9112964.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/whatsapp-image-2024-11-08-at-08.13.01-2024-11-7859d6b2da9f3c3db1f1a3895d29f97a-16x9.jpeg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 02:47:10', 'author': 'News18', 'authors': ['News18'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.113}, {'id': 263451482, 'title': 'Why Did Trump Pick Susie Wiles As His Chief of Staff? Here’s What You Need To Know', 'text': 'Donald Trump has made a major announcement regarding his campaign leadership. Susie Wiles, his long-time campaign manager, will now serve as his White House chief of staff. This marks a historic moment as Wiles becomes the first female to hold this prestigious position in U.S. history.\\n\\nA Proven Political Strategist\\n\\nWiles, who played a pivotal role in Trump’s successful 2016 and 2020 campaigns, was praised by the former president for her toughness, intelligence, and innovative approach to politics. “Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history,” Trump stated in his announcement. Her leadership has earned her respect across the political spectrum, with Trump noting that she is “universally admired and respected.”\\n\\nThe Role of a Chief of Staff\\n\\nThe chief of staff is one of the most important positions in the White House. Known as the president’s confidant, the chief of staff is responsible for managing the president’s agenda, balancing political and policy priorities, and ensuring smooth operations within the West Wing. Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers, emphasized the importance of the role, noting that the chief of staff must sometimes deliver hard truths to the president.\\n\\nWiles’ Strengths and Challenges\\n\\nWiles’ extensive experience managing Trump’s campaigns, especially in Florida, has given her unique insight into his leadership style. Chris Whipple highlighted her ability to manage Trump and even challenge him when needed—an essential quality for anyone in the role of chief of staff.\\n\\nHowever, Wiles faces challenges due to her lack of experience in Washington, D.C. and the White House. Despite her long political career, she has not worked in the capital for nearly 40 years, which could put her at a disadvantage in navigating the complexities of the political environment.\\n\\nWiles’ Political Background\\n\\nSusie Wiles, a Florida-based Republican strategist, has had a long and varied career in American politics. She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in 2016 and 2020, and previously managed Rick Scott’s 2010 Florida gubernatorial campaign. Wiles also briefly worked as the campaign manager for Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential bid. She has a rich background, having worked for key political figures such as Rep. Jack Kemp, as well as the Reagan administration. In the 1990s, she served as a chief of staff to Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney and advised the city’s mayor, John Peyton, from 2004 to 2009.\\n\\nWiles is the daughter of the late football broadcaster Pat Summerall. Her personal life also includes a divorce from fellow Republican consultant Lenny Wiles in 2017.\\n\\nWhat’s Next for Susie Wiles?\\n\\nAs Trump prepares for the 2024 election, Wiles will play a crucial role in shaping his strategy and helping execute his agenda. Her appointment to chief of staff signals a shift in how Trump plans to manage his campaign and the White House, with a focus on strong leadership and innovative strategies.\\n\\nHer legacy as the first female chief of staff could also inspire more women to pursue leadership roles in politics. As the nation watches closely, Wiles’ tenure will be a key factor in Trump’s continued political journey.\\n\\nALSO READ: WATCH: California Wildfire Forces Thousands To Evacuated, Dozens Of Homes Destroyed', 'summary': 'Donald Trump has made a major announcement regarding his campaign leadership.

Wiles, a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery, will now oversee daily White House operations, marking a new chapter in her long political career.Who is Susie Wiles?Following his victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susie Wiles, his campaign chief, as his White House Chief of Staff. This marks Trump’s first major appointment post-election. Here’s a closer look at key facts about Wiles, who will be overseeing daily operations at the White House.A Disciplined Campaign LeaderA seasoned Republican strategist, Wiles, alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, is credited with leading one of Trump’s most structured and disciplined campaigns. While it wasn’t always possible to keep Trump on-script, she managed to minimise leaks, crafted an effective strategy to appeal to Latino and Black voters, and ultimately helped secure a decisive win.Roots in Party EstablishmentWiles began her political career on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign and has since worked with moderate Republicans. Her experience includes roles with figures like Jack Kemp, a free-trade advocate, and Tillie Fowler, known for moderate positions on issues like gun control. She also managed Jon Huntsman Jr.’s 2012 presidential campaign, supporting a candidate known for his moderate stance and criticism of Trump following the Capitol attack on January 6th.Working with Trump’s RivalsIn later years, Wiles collaborated with several high-profile Republicans, including Trump ally Senator Rick Scott. She played a key role in Ron DeSantis’s successful 2018 campaign for Florida governor but was later dismissed by DeSantis after his election. When DeSantis entered the Republican primary against Trump, Wiles spearheaded an assertive strategy that highlighted DeSantis’s perceived weaknesses.The \\'Ice Maiden\\'Known for her restrained and enigmatic demeanour, Wiles rarely appears in televised interviews or public speaking events, contrasting with the more vocal Chris LaCivita. Trump even referred to her as the \"ice maiden\" during his victory speech, acknowledging her disciplined and sometimes ruthless approach to campaign management.Here’s a look at Trump’s former Chiefs of Staff and their perspectives on his leadership:Reince Priebus (January 20, 2017 – July 31, 2017): Trump’s first Chief of Staff, Priebus maintained a low profile after his tenure, offering little public commentary on Trump’s style or approach to governing.John F. Kelly (July 31, 2017 – January 2, 2019): A former Marine Corps General, Kelly has been openly critical, describing Trump in stark terms and voicing concerns about how he might govern if given another term.Mick Mulvaney (Acting, January 2, 2019 – March 31, 2020): Mulvaney has presented a balanced view, acknowledging both positives and negatives in Trump’s administration. While he has expressed concerns about certain decisions, he has been more reserved in his criticism than some other former officials.Mark Meadows (March 31, 2020 – January 20, 2021): Meadows has remained a strong ally of Trump, consistently supporting his actions both during and after his presidency. Despite facing scrutiny over his involvement in January 6-related events, Meadows continues to align with Trump’s political direction.', 'summary': 'In a swift move following his win over Kamala Harris, President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles, his campaign chief, as White House Chief of Staff.

Legal Dispute Explained', 'text': 'The Supreme Court on Friday overruled the 1967 judgment that became the basis for denying minority status to the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). \\nThe seven-judge Constitution bench of Supreme Court, headed by outgoing Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, left the decision to a three-judge bench to determine whether to grant the status to AMU based on the principles evolved in this judgement.\\nThe CJI said there were four separate opinions, including three dissenting verdicts, in the AMU case. The CJI said he has written the majority verdict for himself and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, whereas Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma have penned their separate dissenting verdicts.\\nLet us understand the dispute over the 1967 judgment, and Article 30 of the Constitution that establishes rights of minorities to establish educational institutions.\\nWhat is the Background of the Case?\\nMuslim reformer Sir Syed Ahmed Khan founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College (MAO College) at Aligarh to address Muslim educational backwardness while protecting Islamic values. When the Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920 (AMU Act) was passed, the MAO college and the Muslim University Association was incorporated into AMU. \\nIn 1951, the AMU Act was amended, removing compulsory religious education for Muslims and the exclusive Muslim representation mandate in the University Court. The Act was further amended in 1965, and the powers of the Court were redistributed among other bodies including the executive, with the President of India nominating members to the governing body.\\nThen Comes The 1967 Judgment\\nThe dispute began in 1967 when the top court in S. Azeez Basha vs Union of India (UOI) reviewed the 1951 and 1965 amendments in the AMU Act, which argued that they deprived the Muslim community, which has established the university, of the right to administer it. However, the five-judge SC bench upheld the amendments, and said the AMU was neither established nor administered by the Muslim minority, stressing the AMU Act’s enactment through Central legislation.\\nThe 1951 amendment to the Act allowed non-Muslims to be the members of the University Court, which was the supreme governing body at that time. It replaced the university’s Lord Rector with the Visitor, who was the President of India.\\nThe 1965 amendment gave more powers to the AMU’s Executive Council, which meant that the University Court would no longer be the supreme governing body.\\nAfter witnessing nationwide protests over the ruling, the government amended the AMU Act in 1981, affirming the university’s minority status.\\nThe AMU in 2005 for the first time provided 50% reservation for Muslims in post-graduate medical programmes. The Allahabad High Court struck down the reservation policy holding the 1981 amendment ultra vires.\\nConsequently, the University and the Union of India appealed to the SC in 2006. But in 2016, the Union government withdrew from the appeal, refusing to acknowledge the University’s minority status. \\nWhat Does Minority Status Mean For AMU?\\nThe top court is dealing with two aspects of the case: first, to determine minority status of an educational institution, and second, whether an institution established under a statute can enjoy such a status.\\nUnder Article 15(5), introduced in the Constitution in 2006, minority educational institutions are exempt from reserving seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Since AMU’s minority status is sub judice, and the SC directed in 2006 that status quo be maintained, the university does not have SC/ST quotas.\\nAlthough the petitioners argue that AMU is entitled to the minority status, the Union government is now endorsing the S. Azeez Basha verdict.\\nThe Centre argued before the Supreme Court this year that if AMU is declared a minority institution, “it will continue not to provide for reservation for SCs/STs/OBCs/EWS, [in jobs and seats, but] it will provide for reservation for Muslims which can be up to 50% or even more”.\\nThe Centre also argued that “a large national institute like AMU ought to maintain its secular origins and serve the larger interest of the nation first”.\\nSubmission submitted on behalf of AMU stated that it was “fallacious” for the Centre to hold that AMU’s minority status “would be contrary to public interest as it would exempt them from reserving seats for other disadvantaged groups”, since this negates the Constitutional provision that shields special rights of minorities.\\nOn reservation not being applicable to AMU, Sibal stated that “Article 30 is itself a recognition of rights of communities that also require special protection”. Therefore, the exemption for minority educational institutions provided by Article 15(5) is “not an exception to equality but simply a different facet of it, which seeks to balance the needs of different sections of society whether on the basis of religion, or caste and class”.\\nWhat Is Article 30 Of the Constitution?\\nArticle 30 of the Indian constitution consists of provisions that safeguard various rights of the minority community in the country keeping in mind the principle of equality as well.\\nArticle 30(1) in Part III of the Constitution empowers all religious and linguistic minorities with a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.\\nArticle 30(1A) deals with the fixation of the amount for acquisition of property of any educational institution established by minority groups.\\nArticle 30(2) states that the government should not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language, while giving aid.\\nWhile Article 30 and Article 29 of the Constitution do not specify ‘minorities’ in India, it is classified into religious minorities and linguistic minorities. Section 2, clause (c) of the National Commission of Minorities Act, declares six communities as minority communities. They are: Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains and Zoroastrians (Parsis).', 'summary': 'The dispute began in 1967 when the Supreme Court reviewed the 1951 and 1965 amendments in the Aligarh Muslim University Act, which argued that they deprived the Muslims community, which had established the university, of the right to administer it.

Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, who led the bench, authored the majority opinion with Justices Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra. Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and Satish Chandra Sharma wrote dissenting opinions.\\n\\nThe court had reserved judgment on this matter in February after eight days of hearings. The issue of AMU’s minority status was a point of contention, particularly regarding the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act, which aimed to grant the institution minority status but, according to the Court, did not fully restore its original character prior to the 1951 amendment.\\n\\nThe AMU Act of 1920 established the university as a Muslim teaching institution, but the 1951 amendment removed the mandate for religious education for Muslim students.\\n\\nChief Justice Chandrachud questioned whether the 1981 amendment truly returned the university to its 1920 status. He suggested that if the amendment had explicitly reinstated AMU’s original minority character, it would have been more effective.\\n\\nWhat Is Aligarh Muslim University Minority Case?\\n\\nHistorically, AMU was founded as Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 by Muslim community leaders, including Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and was converted into a university under British rule in 1920. The question of its minority status has been debated through numerous legal proceedings and legislative discussions over the years.\\n\\nIn 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in the Azeez Basha case that AMU, as a central government-funded university, could not be considered a minority institution. The current case reopens this debate, as various arguments have been made for and against AMU’s minority status.\\n\\nSupporters of minority status, including senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, argued that the limited number of Muslim members on AMU’s governing council does not negate its identity as a Muslim minority institution. Conversely, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued that a university receiving substantial central funding and designated as a national institution cannot claim minority status.\\n\\nThis issue has been a point of legal contention for decades, and the Allahabad High Court had previously nullified the 1981 law granting minority status to AMU. Appeals challenging that decision reached the Supreme Court, and in 2019, the issue was referred to a larger seven-judge bench.\\n\\nThe Congress-led UPA government had appealed the Allahabad High Court’s 2006 ruling, which overturned the 1981 amendment.\\n\\nHowever, in 2016, the BJP-led NDA government stated it would withdraw the appeal, citing the 1967 Supreme Court judgment as grounds to argue that AMU, as a central university, does not qualify as a minority institution.\\n\\nALSO READ:Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors', 'summary': 'In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in the Azeez Basha case that AMU, as a central government-funded university, could not be considered a minority institution.

Whether the AMU is minority or not will be decided as per this judgement,” said Chandrachud.', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/sc-overrules-1967-order-denying-amu-minority-status-new-bench-to-decide/videoshow/115077817.cms', 'image': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115077817,width-1070,height-580,overlay-economictimes/videoshow.jpg', 'video': 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-115077817,imgsize-98646.cms', 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 08:06:56', 'author': 'Et Online', 'authors': ['Et Online'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.089}, {'id': 263496418, 'title': 'Supreme Court Orders New Bench for AMU Minority Status Hearing', 'text': \"TCF vendors\\n\\nExponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: Probabilistic identifiers, Privacy choices, Browsing and interaction data, Users’ profiles, Device identifiers, IP addresses, Non-precise location datamoreCookie duration resets each session.

The court said this while hearing the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) minority status-related case. A 7-judge bench of the Supreme Court (by a 4:3 majority) reversed the 1967 ruling in S. Azeez Basha vs. Union of India, which declared that an institution incorporated by legislation cannot claim to be a minority institution. The Supreme Court, however, stated that a separate three-judge bench will decide whether Aligarh Muslim University is a minority institution.\\n\\n“The view in Azeez Basha that minority character stops when statute comes into force is overruled. Whether AMU is a minority or not will be decided as per this (today’s) judgment,” the Court said.\\n\\nThe Court stated that when determining whether an institution is a minority institution, who established the institution needs to be taken into consideration.\\n\\n“The court has to consider the genesis of the institute and the court must see who was the brain behind the establishment of the institution. It has to be seen who got funds for the land and if minority community helped,” the Court said adding that administration by non-minority members will not eliminate an institution’s minority character.\\n\\n“We have held that to be a minority institution, it only had to be established by the minority and not necessarily be administered by the minority members. Minority institutions may wish to emphasise secular education and for that minority members are not needed in administration,” the court held.\\n\\nNotably, Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud delivered the judgement on behalf of the majority which included himself, Justices Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra), while Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and SC Sharma dissented.\\n\\nThe Court ruled that the government may regulate minority educational institutions till it does not violate their minority status. “An educational institution established by any citizen can be regulated under Article 19(6). This court has maintained that the right under Article 30 is not absolute. Regulation of minority educational institution is permitted under Article 19(6) provided it does not infringe the minority character of the institute,” the Court said.\\n\\nThe Court also ruled that Article 30 of the Constitution, which grants minorities the basic right to create and run educational institutions, applies to institutions founded by minorities before the Constitution went into effect.\\n\\n“Article 30 shall stand diluted if it applies to only institutes those which have been established after the Constitution came into force. Thus, educational institutions established by minorities which were established before the constitution came into force, will also be governed by Article 30,” the court said, as reported by Bar and Bench.\\n\\nIn his dissenting judgement, Justice Surya Kant stated that a minority can establish an institute under Article 30, but it must be recognised by law as well as by the University Grants Commission, a statutory authority within the Education Ministry. \\n\\n“The legislative intent behind a statute incorporating a university or institution would be necessary to decide its minority status,” Justice Suryakant said. In his verdict, Justice Dipankar Datta stated that AMU was not a minority institution. \\n\\nJustice Datta: I have clearly held that AMU is not a Minority institution and cannot come under Article 30@AMUofficialPRO #SupremeCourt— Bar and Bench (@barandbench) November 8, 2024\\n\\nBack in 2005, the AMU further introduced a policy that reserved 50% of postgraduate medical seats for Muslim candidates. This was challenged in the Allahabad High Court, which, the same year, reversed the reservation and declared the 1981 Act invalid. The court determined that the AMU could not maintain an exclusive reservation because, according to the Supreme Court’s decision in the S. Azeez Basha case, it was not classified as a minority institution. In 2006, a series of eight petitions, including one from the Union government, challenged the High Court’s verdict in the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIn 2016, the NDA government told the Supreme Court that it was dropping its case, stating that “as the executive government at the Centre, we can’t be seen as setting up a minority institution in a secular state.” On February 12, 2019, a three-judge bench led by the then-CJI Ranjan Gogoi referred the case to a seven-judge bench. And, today (8th November 2024), the Supreme Court delivered its verdict while also ruling that a separate three-judge bench, which will decide whether AMU can be deemed a minority university.', 'summary': 'In his\\xa0dissenting judgement, Justice Surya Kant stated that a minority can establish an institute under Article 30, but it must be recognised by law as well as by the University Grants Commission, a statutory authority within the Education Ministry.', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/sc-overrules-1967-verdict-new-bench-to-decide-amus-minority-status/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/supreme-court.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 08:47:33', 'author': 'OpIndia Staff', 'authors': ['OpIndia Staff'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.2}, {'id': 263502122, 'title': 'Supreme Court Reverses Critical 1967 Judgement on Aligarh University', 'text': 'In a landmark 4:3 decision, a seven-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court had on Monday overturned a pivotal 1967 judgement on Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), leaving open, however, the question of restoring its minority status. This “judgement on Aligarh University,” led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud on what would be his last day in office, took a hard look at whether the varsity, established by Muslims, qualifies as a minority institution.\\n\\nThe majority opinion threw up the distinction to be drawn between an institution being “established” by a minority community and one that was subsequently “incorporated” through legislation. AMU, which originated as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 and was upgraded to university status in 1920, had its antecedents in a Muslim Minority. However, its gradual evolution into a central university had muddied the waters of its minority status under Indian law.\\n\\nJudgement on Aligarh University: Will It Be Minority Institution Anymore?\\n\\nSpeaking for the majority, the Chief Justice noted that institutions need not to be controlled by a minority community or supplied with exclusively religious education to qualify as minority institutions. Secular education in those establishments, he added, does not negate their minority origins.\\n\\nThe dissenting voices came from Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and SC Sharma. The others in the majority were Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna-the next Chief Justice of India-followed by Justices JB Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, and Chief Justice Chandrachud.\\n\\nThis case traces back to Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, wherein it is entitled that minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions. AMU had held on to this privilege till the judgement of the court in the case of S. Azeez Basha vs. Union of India in 1967, wherein it was held that as AMU enjoyed the status of a central institution, it could not be granted the status of a minority institution.\\n\\nIn 1981, an amendment was brought in to reverse the earlier restrictions that had upset the minority status of AMU but Chief Justice has only observed partially effective saying it’s a “half-hearted job.”\\n\\nEarlier, the Union government wanted to defeat the minority status of AMU and favored the judgment of 1967. The Supreme Court now has left the question of minority status for the conclusive scrutiny by a regular bench at some point in the future.\\n\\nAlso, see: Head of Microsoft’s AI unit Mustafa Suleyman says India is powerhouse of talent', 'summary': 'In a landmark 4:3 decision, a seven-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court had on Monday overturned a pivotal 1967 judgement on Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), leaving open, however, the question of restoring its minority status.

Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said that the law and order subject is completely under the control of the union government and the Lieutenant Governor, and asked whether the statements given by Amit Shah on curbing terrorism are false or not.“Only yesterday Amit Shah gave a statement that everything is under control in J&K. An incident occurred the day before yesterday, and today again with the Village Defence Guards, so many lies are being told. The law and order situation in J&K is completely under the jurisdiction of BJP-led central government, under the Lieutenant Governor. Not only this, but the terrorists have taken responsibility for the attack too. So does that mean that the statement by Amit Shah on terrorism is a false statement? The terror acts in the region are increasing,” Tiwari told ANI.Lieutenant Governor (LG) Manoj Sinha paid homage to the two deceased on Thursday, Nazir Ahmad and Kuldeep Kumar who were killed in the attack and reiterated the Government’s resolve to destroy all terror outfits and avenge the barbaric act.Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday warned against “borderless and invisible” terror threats and stressed the need for cutting-edge technology to deal with them effectively.Congress leader Rashid Alvi mentioned that the government should get to the root of the problem and find out the reason for these terror attacks, saying that the terrorists should be caught alive instead of killed in encounters. “When someone dies it is only after that that efforts are made to know who is behind all this. Why doesn’t the government find out who is behind all these terror attacks before it happens? I have said this earlier I will say it again that till the time those spreading terrorism in J&K are caught alive the truth will never be known,” he told ANI.He further criticised the government, saying that it was claimed that after the abrogation of article 370, the situation was supposed to be normalised, instead calling these are “abnormal” times. “Also there is such a presence of our security forces there, what is the LG doing? Indian government has said repeatedly that after the abrogation of Article 370 the situation is normal, but are these normal times? These are even more abnormal times,” he added.Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the killing of the two VDGs, and said that he is “deeply” saddened and concerned by the attack.Abdullah further said that security forces should ensure that such attacks are stopped “completely.”“Deeply saddened & concerned by the attack that resulted in the deaths of Kuldeep Kumar & Nazeer Ahmed Padder of Kuntwara in Kishtwar, members of the local village defence committee.

As of now, KL Rahul and Abhimanyu Easwaran are the ones who can play that role,\" Uthappa, expert JioCinema & Sports18, said in a virtual media interaction.\"I don\\'t see anyone else who can take on that responsibility. Everyone likes to play positively, aggressively, and score runs at a quick pace, including someone like Shubman Gill.

You might be taking away his game.\" Pujara had played a key role in India\\'s historic wins Down Under in 2018-19 and 2020-21 but this time India will be travelling him as Saurashtra veteran has fallen out of favour.\"KL Rahul and Abhimanyu Easwaran can really play that anchor role, with everyone else revolving around them.

Check why Putin said this\", 'text': \"India's rapid economic growth that is faster than in any other country and immense potential make it deserving to be included in the list of global superpowers, said Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi, Putin praised India's progress, describing it as unparalleled in the global arena. Russia is strengthening its relationship with India on multiple fronts, with a high level of trust underpinning their bilateral ties, he added.“India should undoubtedly be added to the list of superpowers, with its billion-and-a-half population, the fastest growth among all economies in the world, ancient culture, and very good prospects for further growth,” Putin said during the plenary session.Highlighting the strong bilateral relationship, Putin emphasized Russia’s commitment to strengthening ties with India. “We are developing relations with India in all directions. India is a great country, now the largest in terms of population: 1.5 billion people, plus 10 million every year,” he noted.According to Putin, India leads the world in economic growth, which reinforces its role on the global stage. “Our vision of where and at what pace our relations will develop is based on today’s realities. The volume of our cooperation is increasing many times over, every year,” he said, as reported by Russian news agency Tass.Defense and security cooperation remain a pillar of India-Russia relations, Putin added, citing the deep trust underpinning the partnership. “Look at how many types of Russian military equipment are in service with the Indian armed forces. There is a great degree of trust in this relationship. We don’t just sell our weapons to India; we design them jointly,” he said.Putin pointed to the BrahMos cruise missile project as an example of this collaboration, noting its adaptability across air, sea, and land environments for India’s defense needs. “These projects demonstrate a high level of mutual trust and cooperation. This is what we will keep doing in the near term, and, I hope, will continue to do in the more distant future,” he stated.The Russian President also acknowledged ongoing tensions between India and China, expressing optimism about diplomatic progress. “Wise and competent people who keep the future of their nations in mind are searching for compromises and will eventually find them. If this approach continues to gain momentum, compromises can be found, and they will be found,” he said.India-China relations soured after the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, the most severe military confrontation in decades. However, recent diplomatic breakthroughs have brought new hope.

The attack, which took place on Sunday, targeted security forces and resulted in the injury of 12 civilians. Authorities confirmed that the individuals arrested—Usama Yasin Sheikh, Umar Fayaz Sheikh, and Afnan Mansoor Sheikh—are residents of the Ikhrajpora area in Srinagar. The police have linked the attack to Pakistan-based terror handlers, who allegedly orchestrated the violence with the aim of destabilizing the region.\\n\\nThe Grenade Attack: Aimed at Security Forces, Civilians Injured\\n\\nThe grenade attack occurred near a busy flea market in Srinagar, where terrorists hurled grenades from a flyover, aiming at the security forces stationed in the area. However, the grenades exploded near a paramilitary vehicle, injuring 12 civilians who were caught in the blast. This attack is seen as part of a larger pattern of violence in Jammu and Kashmir, which has witnessed a series of terror strikes and encounters, particularly following the swearing-in of the region’s first elected government after the revocation of Article 370 in 2019.\\n\\nIn the wake of the attack, authorities have emphasized the continuing threat posed by militant groups operating in the region. The police have invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against the arrested trio, further highlighting the gravity of the crime.\\n\\nMUST READ: ‘This Aghadi’s Vehicle Has No Wheels Or Brakes’, PM Modi Mocks MVA \\n\\nPolice Resolve the Case, and Authorities React\\n\\nInspector General of Police Kashmir Zone, V K Birdi, confirmed the arrests and noted that the police had successfully solved the case with the apprehension of the three suspects. Birdi added that the attack had been carried out at the direction of Pakistan-based terror handlers, who have long aimed to disrupt the peace and stability of the region.\\n\\nLieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha responded strongly to the attack, urging security forces to take decisive action against terrorist outfits operating in the region. He emphasized that the forces had “full freedom” to act firmly and eliminate terror networks. “You have full freedom to crush terror outfits and leave no stone unturned to complete this mission,” Sinha remarked.\\n\\nOn the political front, Jammu and Kashmir’s former Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah, condemned the grenade attack, calling it a deliberate attempt to disturb the region’s peace. Abdullah also pointed out that such incidents had increased following the formation of the new government after the recent assembly elections. He stressed the need for strict and immediate action to address the ongoing militancy in the valley. “This proves that militancy is still there in the valley,” Abdullah noted. “The Central government has the entire law and order and security apparatus in its hand. We call for strict action.”\\n\\nIncreasing Violence and Rising Tensions\\n\\nThe grenade attack marks yet another chapter in the ongoing conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, where security forces are engaged in constant efforts to tackle militancy and ensure peace. With the region’s political landscape evolving after the revocation of Article 370, there has been a noticeable uptick in violence in recent months. Analysts have warned that the return of an elected government in Jammu and Kashmir, while seen as a step toward restoring normalcy, has also triggered a resurgence of militant activity in the region.\\n\\nThe involvement of Lashkar-e-Taiba in the latest attack only underscores the persistent threat from Pakistan-backed terror groups. As the investigation continues, authorities are likely to take additional measures to neutralize militant cells and enhance security across the Kashmir Valley.\\n\\nALSO READ: ‘I apologize For Any Harm Caused’: CJI DY Chandrachud Delivers Farewell Address', 'summary': 'Three LeT terror associates arrested in connection with the grenade attack in Srinagar that injured 12 civilians.

The report added that those involved appeared to be “acting according to their own agenda.”The alleged incident, which took place on October 21 during a program at the CID headquarters, led to a full inquiry by a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). The inquiry sought to understand which officers and staff members were responsible for the oversight.The Chief Minister visited the CID headquarters to inaugurate the Cyber wing’s new Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System (CFCFRMS) station. However, instead of the CM, the samosas and cake were served to his staff, sparking an internal CID investigation. DGP, Atul Verma said that the matter is being investigated by the CID and not by the police headquarters.The investigation report details that an Inspector General (IG) officer asked a sub-inspector to procure food from a five star hotel in Shimla’s Lakkar Bazaar for the chief minister’s program. Following this order, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a head constable driver retrieved three boxes of samosas and cake, handing them over to a woman officer of Inspector rank. This officer, unaware of the items’ intended recipient, instructed for the boxes to be placed in a senior officer’s room, where they were then moved between rooms.When questioned, the officers involved claimed that they had confirmed with tourism department personnel on duty, who reportedly stated that the items in the boxes were not on the CM’s menu. The investigation further noted that an MTO (Motor Transport Officer) and HASI (Head Assistant Sub-Inspector) were assigned to manage refreshments like tea and paan for the CM’s staff. According to her statement, the woman Inspector was not informed that the items inside the boxes were meant for the CM. Without opening the boxes, she directed them to the MT section.The IG’s orderly, HASI, testified that the boxes were opened by a sub-inspector and a head constable and intended for the DSP and staff in the IG’s office. Following these instructions, the food was served with tea to approximately 10-12 people in the room.Based on statements from those involved, the CID report indicates that only a sub-inspector was aware that the boxes contained refreshments for the CM.

The probe has called the incident an \"anti-government\" act, sparking strong reactions from political parties. The incident occurred on October 21 when the Chief Minister visited the CID headquarters. During the visit, refreshments that included samosas and cakes were mistakenly served to Sukhu\\'s security personnel instead of the Chief Minister himself. This error raised concerns about miscommunication and failure to follow protocols, as noted in the CID report. A senior CID officer commented that certain individuals involved in the incident acted according to their \"own agenda,\" which, they believe, showed a disregard for government authority. Following this, the opposition party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), criticized the Congress-led state government, suggesting that it is overly focused on minor issues rather than important development goals. The BJP coined the phrase \"Chief Minister’s Samosa\" to underline their point, using it to question the government\\'s priorities. The confusion began when the refreshment boxes were sent from Hotel Radisson Blue in Lakkar Bazaar to the Chief Minister\\'s event. The protocol required that an Inspector General (IG)-level officer oversee the refreshments. However, due to a mix-up in communication, the refreshments were served to the Chief Minister\\'s security staff instead. A deputy superintendent of police (SP) conducted an investigation and found that the police, responsible for handling the refreshments, were wrongly informed by tourism department staff who claimed that the items were not intended for the Chief Minister. Only the sub-inspector who placed the order knew the intended recipient. As tensions rose, BJP spokesperson Randhir Sharma stated, \"The state government is neglecting the development of the state, focusing only on trivial matters like the \\'Chief Minister’s Samosa.\\'\" He added that the incident reveals significant coordination issues within the administration, especially concerning events involving high-ranking officials like the Chief Minister. The incident has not only highlighted internal communication issues but has also become a topic of political debate in Himachal Pradesh, with the opposition using it to question the efficiency of the current government.

Significantly, the Congress fought the election in J&K in an alliance with National Conference, but it had not promised restoration of Article 370, trying to steer away from the contentious issue.

Responding to the case, Surya stated that he would refrain from relying on the source that provided the information. He attributed the widespread anxiety over recent Waqf conversion notices to farmers as a reason for initially believing the report. The incident has heightened focus on Waqf land issues, with BJP leaders calling for a review of land designations and reportedly questioning the involvement of certain officials in land reclassification.This incident comes amid rising tensions over Waqf land issues across Karnataka, as Joint Parliamentary Committee Chairman Jagdambika Pal recently visited several districts with Tejasvi Surya to meet with concerned farmers. Pal has announced that a fact-finding report on Waqf properties will be presented in the winter session of Parliament. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has directed officials to cease issuing new Waqf notices to farmers and to withdraw existing notices where applicable.

This move, reflecting a cautious approach towards inflation and employment risks, could have far-reaching effects on global currency markets. The dollar index saw a slight increase, suggesting a minor strengthening against a group of six major currencies.Domestically, the Sensex and Nifty experienced slight declines, pointing to a cautious sentiment among investors. The Sensex dropped by 14.23 points, while the Nifty fell by 15.45 points. This period also saw Foreign Institutional Investors pulling out a substantial amount, with sales amounting to Rs 4,888.77 crore, indicating a retreat from Indian markets.The pressure on the rupee and the anticipated response from the RBI highlight the interconnectedness of global and domestic financial landscapes. With potential adjustments in future Federal Reserve rates and shifts in investor confidence, there remains a possibility for the rupee to stabilize, particularly if the dollars surge eases. Pabari speculates that the RBI might aim to keep the rupee within a specific band, navigating through these uncertainties with strategic interventions.Oil Prices and Market ReactionsIn related developments, Brent crude oil prices saw a decrease, further complicating the economic outlook. The drop to USD 75.14 per barrel could influence inflationary trends and economic planning. The evolving scenario presents challenges and opportunities for Indias financial strategy, with currency stability being a critical focus area.The rupees fall to an all-time low against the dollar reflects broader global economic shifts and domestic financial pressures.

This statement was made during a rally in Maharashtra on November 7, 2024, where Shah emphasized that the abrogation of Article 370 is a significant achievement of the current government. Pawar, leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had previously expressed concerns about the implications of this decision on regional stability and governance.\\n\\nShah’s Firm Stance on Article 370\\n\\nAt a rally in Maharashtra, Amit Shah reiterated the government’s position on Article 370, highlighting that its removal has led to increased development and integration of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India. He stated, “The abrogation of Article 370 has brought peace and progress to the region,” countering Pawar’s assertion that restoring the article would help address local grievances. During this rally, Shah criticized the Congress for its alliance with regional parties like the National Conference, suggesting that such partnerships threaten national security.

The top court was hearing a reference arising out of the 2006 verdict of the Allahabad High Court which held that the university was not a minority institution. The court also considered the validity of a 1967 Supreme Court case which rejected the minority status of the university, as well as the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act that granted minority status. During the hearing, the bench had expressed concerns over the 1981 amendment, stating it did a \"half-hearted job\" in restoring the university\\'s pre-1951 status.The 1951 amendment abolished the requirement for compulsory religious instruction for Muslim students at the university.This complex issue has consistently tested both Parliament\\'s authority to legislate and the judiciary\\'s ability to interpret such laws.\"One thing which is worrying us is that the 1981 amendment does not restore the position as it stood prior to 1951. In other words, the 1981 amendment does a half-hearted job,\" Chief Justice Chandrachud said during the hearing. Previously, the BJP-led NDA government refused to accept the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act. Instead, they argued that the court should follow a 1967 ruling by a five-judge Constitution bench, which ruled that since the institution was a central university, it cannot be classified as a minority institution.Supporters of minority status, represented by Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, argue that the university’s status is valid under Article 30 of the Constitution, which gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and manage educational institutions. They also argue that the university’s minority character is not affected by the fact that only 37 of its 180 governing council members are Muslim.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, argued that Aligarh Muslim University, being a central university funded heavily by the government and declared an institution of national importance, cannot claim minority status. They add that the institution surrendered its minority character after the 1951 AMU Act amendment, especially since it began receiving central government funding.The Allahabad High Court had previously struck down the 1981 law granting AMU minority status, prompting appeals to the Supreme Court.

The bench also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Surya Kant, J B Pardiwala, Dipankar Datta, Manoj Misra and Satish Chandra Sharma had reserved its verdict on the question on February 1 after hearing arguments for eight days. On February 1, grappling with the intractable issue of the AMU\\'s minority status, the top court said the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act, which effectively accorded it a minority status, only did a \"half-hearted job\" and did not restore to the institution the position it had prior to 1951. While the AMU Act, 1920 speaks about incorporating a teaching and residential Muslim university in Aligarh, the 1951 amendment does away with compulsory religious instructions for the Muslim students at the university.

However, Donald Trump managed to secure a victory, significantly increasing his support among American men, especially young men.\\n\\n Trump’s Appeal to Young Men\\n\\nAlthough younger voters generally lean liberal, Trump’s campaign successfully resonated with young men by appealing to traditionally masculine interests, such as combat sports and cryptocurrency. The campaign leveraged male-focused platforms, including popular podcasts. Conservative youth activist Charlie Kirk implied that masculinity itself was at stake, suggesting that male voters should align with Trump.\\n\\nTrump Breaking the Trend Among Young Voters\\n\\nWhile Trump garnered 54% of the male vote overall—up from 51% in 2020—the increase among men aged 18 to 29 was particularly striking, with 49% of young men voting for him. This shift contrasted with young women under 29, who overwhelmingly supported Harris with a 61% majority. Figures like Elon Musk, a high-profile Trump supporter, noted that this surge in support was a pivotal moment for Trump’s campaign.\\n\\nEconomic Concerns and Machismo Appeal\\n\\nThe economic policies promoted by Trump’s campaign attracted young Black men in particular, despite instances of divisive rhetoric. Spencer Thomas, a Howard University student who voted for Harris, observed that many peers focused on economic concerns over issues like abortion rights. Analysts, like media science professor Tammy Vigil, suggested that some Black and Latino men resonated with Trump’s machismo, which allowed them to overlook other controversial aspects of his campaign.\\n\\nPolitical scientist Kathleen Dolan added that Trump’s appearance on male-oriented platforms, such as the “Joe Rogan Experience,” was part of his strategy to energize young male voters.

The antitrust investigation against Swiggy and its top rival Zomato began in 2022 after a complaint by National Restaurant Association of India about the impact on food outlets due to anti-competitive practices of the platforms. Food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato have in recent years reshaped how Indians order food, as hundreds of thousands of outlets listed on their apps just when smartphone use, and online ordering, both grew rapidly. Swiggy, which on Friday is closing bids for its $1.4 billion IPO - India's second biggest this year, and Zomato both in recent years also pushed restaurants to maintain a parity on prices, directly reducing competition in the market.

Israeli fans, who had traveled to the Netherlands to support their team, were reportedly assaulted after leaving the stadium.

Danny Danon, Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, likened the violence to a modern-day pogrom, calling it a stark reflection of the extremist forces Israel faces. “We are receiving very disturbing reports of extreme violence against Israelis and Jews on the streets of Holland. There is a pogrom currently taking place in Europe in 2024,” Danon wrote.

Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) linked the violence to the rising tide of anti-Semitic rhetoric around the world, particularly as a result of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “The hysterical and hyperbolic demonization of Israel has led to a global outbreak of antisemitic vitriol, vandalism, and violence,” Torres said, adding that the violence in Amsterdam represented “the single most monstrous manifestation of antisemitism.”\\n\\nRep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) also joined the calls for justice, demanding that the Netherlands government take immediate action to protect Jewish citizens. “This is outrageous. The government of the Netherlands must protect Jews from these attacks and prosecute the assailants,” he said.

The proposed laws, set to be tabled in parliament next week, would place responsibility on social media platforms to enforce age restrictions.\\n\\n“This one is for the mums and dads, They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,” Albanese said in his announcement.\\n\\nUnder the proposal, the ban would apply to young people already using social media, with no exemptions for parental consent. Compliance will be overseen by the eSafety Commissioner, Australia’s online regulator, which will enforce the legislation. There will be no penalties for users, instead, the onus will fall on tech platforms to demonstrate they have taken ‘reasonable steps’ to prevent access by under-16s. If the legislation passes, it would come into effect in 12 months and would be reviewed after implementation.\\n\\nDebate over the efficacy of such a measure has divided experts. While many agree on the potential harm of social media for adolescents, some argue a ban could merely delay exposure without equipping children to navigate online spaces. Previous efforts by the European Union to restrict social media access have encountered resistance from tech companies and mixed results, particularly in relation to age-verification requirements that can be circumvented.\\n\\nThe Australian Child Rights Taskforce, has called the proposed legislation \\'too blunt an instrument.\\' In an open letter sent to the government last month and signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the group advocated for \\'safety standards\\' rather than an outright ban. It cited UN advice urging national policies to focus on providing safe access to digital spaces, allowing children to benefit from online engagement.\\n\\nThe 36Months initiative, a grassroots campaign supporting the legislation, argues children are not yet \"ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16. With over 125,000 signatures, the petition claims that \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness.\"\\n\\nWhen asked if the government would consider alternative approaches, such as increased digital education, Albanese dismissed the idea as insufficient.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don\\'t want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,” he said. “These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour.\"\\n\\nThe proposed legislation comes amid global discussions about the impact of social media on young users. It remains to be seen whether Australia’s government can successfully implement and enforce such a ban and whether it will withstand scrutiny from technology firms and civil society groups alike.', 'summary': \"Australia's government will introduce what it describes as &lsquo;world-leading&rsquo; legislation to ban children under 16 from social media, a move aimed at mitigating the online 'harm' facing Australian youth, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Just to feel normal for two months – for me, my family – it was a surreal experience. Couldn’t have been more grateful to God for the opportunity to spend time with the family.

He will retire on Sunday and hand over the baton to Justice Sanjiv Khanna.\\n\\nIn a fitting end to his tenure, on his last working day, Justice Chandrachud headed a Constitution bench that delivered an important verdict on minority status for the Aligarh Muslim University. In a 4:3 verdict, the bench decided to overturn a 1967 judgment that stripped the university of minority status but said a three-judge bench would decide if it should be granted again.\\n\\nHere\\'s a look at some of Justice Chandrachud\\'s key judgments as the Chief Justice:\\n\\nElectoral Bonds Case\\n\\nIn February, ahead of this year\\'s Lok Sabha elections, a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud struck down the Electoral Bonds scheme for political funding, which had been in place since 2018. \\n\\nThe scheme, Chief Justice Chandrachud said, was unconstitutional and arbitrary and could lead to a quid pro quo arrangement between political parties and donors. \\n\\nThe bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai, Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to stop issuing electoral bonds immediately and ordered the Election Commission of India to publish details of the political parties which have received contributions through electoral bonds since April 2019 on its website.\\n\\nPrivate Property Verdict\\n\\nEarlier this month, a nine-judge Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud, in an 8:1 majority judgment, said all privately owned properties did not qualify as community resources that the State could take over for the common good.\\n\\nThe case related to Article 31C of the Constitution, which protects laws made by the State to fulfil directive principles of state policy. Among them is Article 39B, which stipulates that the State shall direct its policy towards ensuring that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.\\n\\n \"Does material resource of a community used in 39B include privately owned resources? Theoretically, the answer is yes, the phrase may include privately owned resources. However, this court is unable to subscribe itself to the minority view of Justice Iyer in Ranganath Reddy. We hold that not every resource owned by an individual can be considered a material resource of a community only because it meets the qualifier of material needs,\" Chief Justice Chandrachud said. \\n\\nArticle 370\\n\\nIn December 2023, a five-judge Constitution bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud upheld the scrapping of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. \\n\\nChief Justice Chandrachud said Article 370 was a temporary provision to ease Jammu and Kashmir\\'s merger with India.\\n\\nThe court said that restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, which was divided into two Union Territories, including Ladakh \"shall take place at the earliest and as soon as possible\". It also asked for Assembly elections to be held in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024.\\n\\nSame-Sex Marriage\\n\\nA five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud had, in October 2023, refused to accord legal recognition to same-sex marriage, saying there was \"no unqualified right\" to marriage with the exception of those that are recognised by law.\\n\\nLeaving it to the legislature to take a call on enacting the marriage equality law, the judges also noted the centre\\'s submission that a panel headed by the cabinet secretary will look into practical difficulties faced by same-sex couples. The bench agreed that difficulties faced by queer couples in accessing basic services are discriminatory and said the government panel must look into them.\\n\\nIn October, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a key citizenship rule that recognised the Assam Accord, granting citizenship to Bangladeshi refugees who had arrived before 1971.\\n\\nSection 6A of the Citizenship Act was introduced in 1985 to allow refugees from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), who had entered India between 1966-1971, to register as Indian citizens.\\n\\nThe judgment was delivered by a five-judge Constitutional bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud with a 4:1 majority. \\n\\nCaste-Based Discrimination in Prisons\\n\\nThe same month, a bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud banned caste-based discrimination like division of manual labour, segregation of barracks and bias against prisoners of de-notified tribes and habitual offenders and held as \"unconstitutional\" the jail manual rules of 10 states for fostering such biases. \\n\\nObserving that the \"right to live with dignity extends even to the incarcerated\", the bench asked the Centre and states to amend their prison manuals and laws within three months, and file compliance reports.\"Criminal laws of the colonial era continue to impact the postcolonial world,\" the bench said. \\n\\nUP Madrasa Law\\n\\nEarlier this month, a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud upheld the validity of a 2004 law that regulates the functioning of madrasas in Uttar Pradesh and set aside an Allahabad High Court judgment that had declared the law unconstitutional and violative of the principle of secularism \\n\\nThe bench held that the high court had erred in holding that the statute must be struck down if it violates the secularism principle. \"The state can regulate the standards of education (in madrasas)... regulations relating to the quality of education do not interfere with the administration of the madrasas,\" the Chief Justice said.\\n\\nNEET-UG Re-Exam\\n\\nAmid the controversy over a string of paper leaks, the Supreme Court in July refused to cancel the 2024 NEET UG exam for entrance to medical colleges saying that the paper leak was not \"systemic\" or widespread enough that it affected the \"integrity\" of the exam.\\n\\nThe bench, headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud, said there wasn\\'t sufficient material available on the record to order a re-test but clarified that its judgment would not prevent authorities from taking action against candidates who had secured admission using malpractices.\\n\\nImmunity For MPs And MLAs\\n\\nIn March, a Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud ruled that an MP or MLA cannot claim immunity from prosecution if he or she is accused of taking a bribe for a vote or a speech in the legislature. \\n\\nNoting that corruption and bribery by legislators can potentially destroy the functioning of Indian Parliamentary democracy, the court held that taking a bribe is an independent crime and has no link with what a lawmaker says or does inside the Parliament or legislative Assembly. Hence, the immunity from prosecution enjoyed by lawmakers will not shield them.\\n\\nChild Marriage\\n\\nA bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud, in October, issued several directions for the effective implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 and said that child marriage deprives children of their agency, autonomy and right to fully develop and enjoy their childhood. \\n\\nThe bench ordered that state governments and Union Territories appoint officers solely responsible for discharging the functions of child marriage prohibition officers at the district level.\\n\\n\"Both sexes are adversely affected by forced and early marriage.

In a 4:3 decision, the bench reversed a 1967 ruling that had removed the university’s minority status, although it decided that a three-judge bench would determine whether it should be reinstated.\\n\\nHere’s a summary of some of Justice Chandrachud’s key decisions during his tenure:\\n\\nArticle 370\\n\\nIn December 2023, a five-judge Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud upheld the revocation of Article 370, which had granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The court explained that the provision was intended as a temporary arrangement to aid Jammu and Kashmir’s integration into India. The bench also emphasized the need for the restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir and the holding of Assembly elections by September 30, 2024.\\n\\nDY Chandrachud Delivered Electoral Bonds Case Judgment\\n\\nIn February, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Chief Justice Chandrachud led a five-judge Constitution bench that declared the Electoral Bonds scheme, which had been in effect since 2018, unconstitutional. He criticized the scheme for being arbitrary and prone to fostering quid pro quo relationships between political parties and donors. The bench ordered the State Bank of India to halt the issuance of electoral bonds and mandated the Election Commission to publish the details of political parties receiving such funds since 2019.\\n\\nPrivate Property Verdict By DY Chandrachud\\n\\nEarlier this month, a nine-judge Constitution bench, under Justice Chandrachud’s leadership, ruled in an 8:1 majority that privately owned properties could not be classified as community resources for the State to seize for public benefit. The case pertained to Article 31C, which safeguards laws made by the State to fulfill directive principles of state policy. Justice Chandrachud clarified that privately owned resources could not automatically be considered as material resources for the community unless they meet certain criteria.\\n\\nSame-Sex Marriage\\n\\nIn October 2023, Chief Justice Chandrachud presided over a five-judge bench that denied legal recognition to same-sex marriages. The bench concluded that there was no unqualified right to marriage, except for those recognized by law. While the court left it to the legislature to consider enacting a marriage equality law, it acknowledged the challenges faced by same-sex couples in accessing essential services, calling for the government to address these issues.\\n\\nSection 6A Judgment By Chandrachud\\n\\nIn October 2023, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, which grants citizenship to Bangladeshi refugees who entered India before 1971. The ruling, delivered by a five-judge bench, recognized the Assam Accord and allowed refugees who arrived between 1966-1971 to be registered as Indian citizens.\\n\\nCaste-Based Discrimination in Prisons\\n\\nA bench led by Justice Chandrachud in October ruled against caste-based discrimination in prisons, particularly practices like segregating prisoners based on caste or tribe. The court declared such practices unconstitutional and ordered the government to amend the jail manuals of 10 states within three months to eliminate these biases.\\n\\nUP Madrasa Law\\n\\nEarlier this month, Chief Justice Chandrachud headed a bench that upheld a 2004 law regulating madrasas in Uttar Pradesh. The bench overturned a ruling by the Allahabad High Court that had declared the law unconstitutional. The Supreme Court held that the state could regulate madrasa education standards without violating the principle of secularism.\\n\\nNEET-UG Re-Exam\\n\\nAmid controversies surrounding paper leaks, the Supreme Court, in July, refused to cancel the 2024 NEET UG exam, ruling that the leaks did not sufficiently affect the integrity of the exam. However, it stated that authorities could take action against those involved in malpractices.\\n\\nImmunity For MPs and MLAs\\n\\nIn March, a Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud ruled that Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) could not claim immunity from prosecution if they were accused of bribery in exchange for a vote or speech in the legislature. The court emphasized that such acts of corruption were independent offenses that could not be shielded by parliamentary immunity.\\n\\nChild Marriage\\n\\nIn October, Chief Justice Chandrachud’s bench issued directives for the effective enforcement of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The court highlighted the detrimental effects of child marriage on children’s autonomy and development. It instructed state governments and Union Territories to appoint district-level officers responsible for enforcing child marriage prohibitions.\\n\\nJustice Chandrachud’s leadership has marked a significant chapter in India’s judicial history, with landmark rulings that have shaped various aspects of Indian law.\\n\\nRead More: AMU Minority Institution SC Verdict Decoded In 10 Points', 'summary': 'Chief Justice DY Chandrachud concluded his two-year tenure at the helm of India’s judiciary, delivering a landmark judgment on his final working day.

Known also for his many pithy statements, DY Chandrachud leaves an imprint all his own on the annals of legal history.He has judgments such as the Ayodhya land dispute, the decriminalisation of consensual gay sex and abortion rights for unmarried women that shaped society and politics to his name.DY Chandrachud has recommended the most senior justice, Sanjiv Khanna, to be the next CJI. \"There is not going to be any difference when I leave this court because a person as stable as Justice Khanna will take over and is so dignified,\" he said at his farewell event on Friday.DY Chandrachud assumed office as the Chief Justice on November 11, 2022, after being elevated to the Supreme Court in 2016. According to the Supreme Court Observer, he has been a part of 1,275 benches. India Today sheds light on five significant rulings that would have a lasting impact on society.VERDICT ON RIGHT TO PRIVACYA nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled in August 2017 that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. CJI Chandrachud authored the judgment, highlighting that privacy is intrinsic to freedom and dignity. This decision has since influenced other judgments related to data protection, Aadhaar, and personal liberty.It all began in 2012 when retired justice KS Puttaswamy challenged the constitutional validity of the Aadhar Act. The Aadhar Act legitimised India\\'s Unique Identity Number programme.VERDICT ON HOMOSEXUALITYOn September 6, 2018, a unanimous five-judge Supreme Court bench partially struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 158-year-old law that criminalised same-sex relations between consenting adults.The Court ruled that the section’s provisions regarding homosexuality would remain in effect.In a detailed concurring opinion, CJI Chandrachud highlighted the harm Section 377 had caused by marginalising an entire class of citizens. Citing his prior judgment in the Puttaswamy case, which affirmed the right to privacy, he argued that denying the right to sexual orientation was also a denial of privacy.He stressed that human sexuality should not be “reduced to a binary” or narrowly defined as merely a means of procreation.VERDICT ON AYODHYA DISPUTEIn the most significant judgment, a five-judge bench headed by CJI Chandrachud awarded the disputed Ayodhya land to build the Ram temple and the Uttar Pradesh government was directed to provide an alternative site in Ayodhya for the construction of the mosque. The judgment came in November 2019 and settled the fractious issue going back more than a century.The Supreme Court aside a 2010 decision of the Allahabad High Court which in its judgment had divided the disputed land and gave it to the temple and mosque trusts for the construction of these structures.CJI Chandrachud earlier said that he had prayed to God for a solution to the Ayodhya dispute, remarks that sparked a row in the political spectrum.ABORTION RIGHTS FOR UNMARRIED WOMEN In a crucial ruling, CJI Chandrachud expanded the rights of unmarried women by allowing them access to abortion under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act up to 24 weeks, on par with married women.The judgment stressed the reproductive autonomy of women, affirming that a woman’s marital status should not impact her rights over her body and her choices related to pregnancy.Published By: Vadapalli Nithin KumarPublished On: Nov 8, 2024READ | Chief Justice DY Chandrachud\\'s last day at work: Forgive me if I ever hurt anyoneMust Watch', 'summary': 'As Chief Justice DY Chandrachud retires, a look at 5 landmark verdicts by him', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/law-news/story/dy-chandrachud-retirement-last-working-day-supreme-court-significant-judgments-right-to-privacy-ram-mandir-verdict-2630345-2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202411/dy-chandrachud-083414228-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=cDFmwJugjPw3wRzAp8htdqPR6wf3SQDs?size=1280:720', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:06:38', 'author': 'Law Today Web Desk', 'authors': ['Law Today Web Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.15}]}, {'news': [{'id': 263513180, 'title': 'Maruti Suzuki Dzire Achieves 5-Star Safety Rating in Latest Global NCAP Crash Test', 'text': 'The new Maruti Suzuki Dzire, launched in India this week, has set a new safety benchmark by earning a 5-star rating for adult occupant protection and 4 stars for child safety in Global NCAP crash tests.\\nThis makes the Dzire the first Maruti Suzuki model to achieve a top 5-star safety rating.\\nEquipped with six airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), and pedestrian protection as standard, the Dzire offers impressive safety features.

I have no doubt that she will make our country proud. Trump has been secluded at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, since defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election. He is considering a wide array of people for top jobs in his administration, many of them familiar figures from his 2017-2021 presidency, four sources said. Wiles, a long-time Florida-based political strategist, and fellow campaign manager Chris LaCivita are credited with running a more disciplined operation for Trump's third presidential bid compared with his past campaigns. Trump thanked them both during his victory speech early on Wednesday. Susie likes to stay in the back, let me tell you, Trump said, as she stood toward the back of the stage. We call her the ice maiden. Several people who have worked with Wiles said in interviews on Thursday that she would provide stability and sage counsel to Trump in the White House. Trump ran through four chiefs of staff - an unusually high number - during his 2017-2021 term as they struggled to rein in the famously undisciplined president. Susie is a strong woman and a true leader with a proven track record of getting things done, said Florida-based Republican consultant David Johnson. Wiles previously worked on Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and helped Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis win election in 2018. She served as a senior adviser on Trump's 2016 and 2020 bids. Trump chose Wiles over former House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who is close to Trump and has been a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago. Sources said McCarthy had been in contention as well as Brooke Rollins, who was the former acting director of Trump's Domestic Policy Council. A fierce Trump ally, New York Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, is under consideration to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a source familiar with the matter said. Former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who was an acting intelligence chief in Trump's first term and was with him when he recently met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in New York, is under consideration for secretary of state. Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan, is also under consideration for that position, the sources said. Hagerty, asked by CNN about being considered for a role in Trump's administration, said, I'll leave the speculation to the speculators.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff.

Wiles is widely credited within and outside Trump’s inner circle for running what was, by far, his most disciplined and well-executed campaign, and was seen as the leading contender for the position. She largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning. She resisted the formal title of campaign manager, avoiding becoming a target, given Trump’s history of cycling through people in that role. Wiles’ hire is Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration, as he must quickly build the team that will help run the massive federal government. Wiles doesn’t bring much federal government experience to the role, but has a close relationship with the president-elect. On the campaign, Wiles was able to do what few others have been able to: help control Trump’s impulses — not by chiding him or lecturing, but by earning his respect and showing him that he was better off when he followed her advice than flouting it. Eight years ago, Trump tossed the careful planning of his transition team and instead hired a motley assortment of campaign aides, family members and Republican insiders who spent the better part of his first year in office engaged in infighting that dominated news coverage of the new administration. It was what many experts consider a foundational mistake that hamstrung a president who was new to Washington and government upon his swearing in. Trump went through four chiefs of staff — including one who served in an acting capacity for a year — during his first administration, part of a record-setting personnel churn. Many top aides were cast out by Trump in his first term, who resented being made to feel managed or condescended to, while others got caught up in ideological spats within the factionalized West Wing. Trump aides see hope that Wiles’ selection marks a sign that the president-elect is aiming to build a more cohesive team, though one that will almost certainly remain less conventional than his Democratic or Republican predecessors. Trump, who promised in 2016 to hire “only the best people” has since repeatedly said that he believes the biggest mistake of his first term was hiring the wrong people. He was new to Washington then, he has said, and didn’t know any better. But now, Trump said, he knows the “best people” and those to avoid for roles in his administration. “Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,\" Trump said in a statement. \"It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.” Successful chiefs of staff serve as the president’s confidant, help execute a president’s agenda and balance competing political and policy priorities. They also tend to serve as a gatekeeper, helping determine whom the president spends his time with and whom he speaks to — an effort Trump chafed under inside the White House. The chief of staff is “absolutely critical to an effective White House,” said Chris Whipple, whose book “The Gatekeepers” details how the White House chief of staff role shapes and defines a presidency. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn’t want to hear.\" “On the plus side, she’s shown that she can manage Trump, that she works with him and can sometimes tell him hard truths, and that’s really important,\" said Whipple. “On the minus side, she really has no White House experience and hasn’t really worked in Washington in 40 years. And that’s a real disadvantage.” Wiles is a longtime Florida-based Republican strategist who ran Trump’s campaigns in the state in 2016 and 2020, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\\' successful bid for office in 2018. Before that, she ran Rick Scott’s 2010 campaign for Florida governor and briefly served as the manager of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential campaign. Wiles also worked in the offices of former Jacksonville mayors John Delaney and John Peyton. Chris LaCivita, who along with Wiles served as de-facto campaign manager, described Wiles as someone who is inclusive in conversations, who seeks input from others and is steadfastly loyal. “Susie is just functionally built differently because she has that rare commodity to be able to work on so many different important issues simultaneously,” ...', 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-names-susie-wiles-as-chief-of-staff-first-woman-in-the-post-1836299', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/08/1860357-aa-3420617.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 00:49:41', 'author': 'Associated Press', 'authors': ['Associated Press'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.116}, {'id': 263447852, 'title': 'Who is Susie Wiles, first woman White House chief of staff', 'text': \"US President-elect Donald Trump in a historic move appointed Susie Wiles as the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. A veteran political strategist and key figure in Trump’s 2024 campaign, Wiles is widely known for her strategic expertise and her ability to navigate the complexities of Trump's political style. The selection was confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance, who described her as “the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump’s highly successful 2024 Campaign for President.”Wiles has deep roots in Republican politics, particularly in Florida, where she managed multiple successful campaigns. Known for steering Trump’s Florida efforts in both 2016 and 2020, she also contributed to the 2018 gubernatorial campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Her political career began in the 1970s in Washington, working in the office of New York Representative Jack Kemp, followed by roles in Ronald Reagan’s campaign and administration. She later transitioned to Florida politics, where she helped Rick Scott secure the governorship in 2010.Trump praised her as “tough, smart, innovative, and universally admired,” adding, “It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”A trusted advisor with strategic edgeWiles’ success with Trump lies in her ability to balance his temperament while maintaining a disciplined campaign structure. She worked alongside co-manager Chris LaCivita to lead a more organised campaign than Trump’s previous runs. Known for her low-profile approach, Wiles avoided the spotlight, even refraining from speaking at Trump’s victory event. 115067735Her role as chief of staff will involve coordinating the president-elect’s agenda, managing personnel, and acting as a close advisor. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” said Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers. Whipple acknowledged her skill but noted her limited Washington experience as a possible disadvantage.Climbing Florida's political ladderDaughter of NFL legend Pat Summerall, launched her political career in Washington before establishing herself as a formidable strategist in Florida's high-stakes political landscape. She played a pivotal role in Rick Scott's successful 2010 gubernatorial bid and briefly worked on Jon Huntsman's 2012 presidential campaign. However, her relationship with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis grew tense, ultimately leading to a split. This division escalated during the 2024 primaries, where she led Donald Trump’s campaign against DeSantis.Wiles’ influence within Trump’s team reportedly fueled the campaign’s strategy, often using insider knowledge from her past work with DeSantis. After DeSantis suspended his presidential bid, Wiles posted a succinct farewell on social media: “Bye, bye.”Throughout the campaign, Trump’s aides, emboldened by Wiles’ insights, seized opportunities to mock DeSantis, targeting everything from his mannerisms to his footwear.A Pragmatic approach to Trump’s leadership styleWiles’ pragmatic approach earned her Trump’s respect, allowing her to guide him without lecturing or reprimanding. During a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania, Wiles reportedly managed to communicate disapproval by standing nearby and staring in silence depicting her unique approach to managing Trump’s behaviour. Trump has publicly acknowledged her contributions, describing her leadership as “incredible” and calling her campaign management his “best-run campaign.”Challenges ahead in West WingWiles’ appointment signals a potential shift from Trump’s first term, where he experienced high turnover in the chief of staff role. Trump has remarked that he feels more prepared for his second term, having learned from past personnel decisions. While Wiles’ ability to balance discipline and Trump’s dynamic style has been effective, only time will tell if her role will bring more stability to the administration as she steps into one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.\", 'summary': \"Veteran Republican strategist Susie Wiles has been appointed as the first female White House Chief of Staff by US President-elect Donald Trump.

It was his first appointment since winning Tuesday's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Here are some key facts about Wiles, who is set to run day-to-day operations at the White House:Disciplined operationWiles, a longtime Republican strategist, is widely credited - along with co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita - with running the most disciplined and sophisticated of Trump's three presidential campaigns. She did not always succeed at stopping Trump from going off-script, but she kept damaging media leaks to a relative minimum, launched a bold and successful strategy to win over some Latino and Black voters and led the former president to a decisive win.Party establishmentWiles got her start working for Republican President Ronald Reagan's successful 1980 campaign. For years, she worked with some moderate Republicans who promoted dramatically different policies than those of Trump. Early in her career, she worked for Republican U.S. representatives Jack Kemp, an ardent advocate of free trade, and Tillie Fowler, who was widely considered a moderate on several issues, including gun control. She also served briefly as the manager of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr.'s 2012 presidential campaign. Huntsman was arguably the most moderate Republican in the field that year. He sharply criticized Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump's supporters.Working for the enemyLater in her career, Wiles started working for more combative party figures, some of whom would become Trump allies, including U.S. Senator Rick Scott of Florida. Notably, she was a key figure in Ron DeSantis' successful 2018 Florida gubernatorial campaign. She was dismissed by DeSantis after he took office. When Trump and DeSantis squared off in the Republican presidential primary, she presided over an aggressive and successful strategy to portray her old boss as personally off-putting and out of touch on some key policy issues. Ice Maden While Wiles is personally friendly, she is relatively little-known and enigmatic for a political strategist of her stature. She rarely gives televised interviews and avoids speaking engagements. Like many successful campaign managers, she can be ruthless when merited. Her personality contrasted with that of LaCivita, who was notably garrulous and outspoken. During his victory speech, Trump referred to Wiles as the ice maiden. Prominent FamilyWiles is the daughter of Pat Summerall, who was a prominent football player and sportscaster. Summerall played in the National Football League for a decade and later announced 16 Super Bowls. He died in 2013.\", 'summary': \"President-elect Donald Trump appointed Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff, following his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.

Jack Kemp in the 1970s. Following that were stints on Ronald Reagan’s campaign and in his White House as a scheduler.\\nWiles then headed to Florida, where she advised two Jacksonville mayors and worked for Rep. Tillie Fowler. After that came statewide campaigns in rough and tumble Florida politics, with Wiles being credited with helping businessman Rick Scott win the governor’s office.\\nAfter briefly managing Utah Governor Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential campaign, she ran Trump’s 2016 effort in Florida, when his win in the state helped him clinch the White House.\\nTwo years later, Wiles helped get Ron DeSantis elected as Florida’s Governor. But the two would develop a rift that eventually led to DeSantis to urge Trump’s 2020 campaign to cuts its ties with the strategist, when she was again running the then-president’s state campaign.\\nWiles ultimately went on to lead Trump’s primary campaign against DeSantis and trounced the Florida governor.\\nTrump campaign aides and their outside allies gleefully taunted DeSantis throughout the race — mocking his laugh, the way he ate and accusing him of wearing lifts in his boots — as well as using insider knowledge that many suspected had come from Wiles and others on Trump’s campaign staff who had also worked for DeSantis and had had bad experiences.\\nWHAT WOULD BE SUSIE WILES’s ROLE?\\nWith her selection as President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, veteran Florida political strategist Susie Wiles moves from a largely behind-the-scenes role of campaign co-chair to the high-profile position of the president’s closest adviser and counsel.\\nAs gatekeeper to the President, the chief of staff typically wields great influence. The person manages White House staff, organises the President’s time and schedule, and maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers.\\nWiles, a long-time Florida-based political strategist, and fellow campaign manager Chris LaCivita are credited with running a more disciplined operation for Trump’s third presidential bid compared with his past campaigns.\\nSUSIE’S ROLE IN TRUMP’S RACE FOR WHITE HOUSE\\nShortly before DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race in January, Wiles made a rare appearance on social media. She responded to a message that DeSantis had cleared his campaign website of upcoming events with a short but clear message: “Bye, bye.”\\nJoining up with Trump’s third campaign in its nascent days, Wiles is one of the few top officials to survive an entire Trump campaign and was part of the team that put together a far more professional operation for his third White House bid — even if the former president routinely broke through those guardrails anyway.\\nShe largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning.\\nHowever, she showed she was not above taking on tasks reserved for volunteers. At one of Trump’s appearances in Iowa in July of last year, as the former President posed for pictures with a long line of voters, Wiles grabbed a clipboard and started approaching people waiting to get them to fill out cards committing to caucus for Trump in the leadoff primary contest.\\n“If we leave the conference room after a meeting and somebody leaves trash on the table, Susie’s the person to grab the trash and put it in the trash can,” said Chris LaCivita, who served as campaign co-chair along with Wiles.\\nAnother of her three posts on X this year was in the closing days of the campaign, clapping back after billionaire Mark Cuban remarked that Trump didn’t have “strong, intelligent women” in his orbit. After Wiles’s selection as White House chief of staff, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Trump backer, quipped on X that the president-elect had chosen a “strong, intelligent woman” as his chief of staff.\\nWiles was able to help control Trump’s worst impulses — not by chiding him or lecturing, but by earning his respect and showing him that he was better off when he followed her advice than flouted it. At one point late in the campaign, when Trump gave a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania in which he strayed from his talking points and suggested he wouldn’t mind the media being shot, Wiles came out to stare at him silently.\\nTrump often referenced Wiles on the campaign trail, publicly praising her leadership of what he said he was often told was his “best-run campaign.”\\n“She’s incredible.

Wiles, a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery, will now oversee daily White House operations, marking a new chapter in her long political career.Who is Susie Wiles?Following his victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susie Wiles, his campaign chief, as his White House Chief of Staff. This marks Trump’s first major appointment post-election. Here’s a closer look at key facts about Wiles, who will be overseeing daily operations at the White House.A Disciplined Campaign LeaderA seasoned Republican strategist, Wiles, alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, is credited with leading one of Trump’s most structured and disciplined campaigns. While it wasn’t always possible to keep Trump on-script, she managed to minimise leaks, crafted an effective strategy to appeal to Latino and Black voters, and ultimately helped secure a decisive win.Roots in Party EstablishmentWiles began her political career on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign and has since worked with moderate Republicans. Her experience includes roles with figures like Jack Kemp, a free-trade advocate, and Tillie Fowler, known for moderate positions on issues like gun control. She also managed Jon Huntsman Jr.’s 2012 presidential campaign, supporting a candidate known for his moderate stance and criticism of Trump following the Capitol attack on January 6th.Working with Trump’s RivalsIn later years, Wiles collaborated with several high-profile Republicans, including Trump ally Senator Rick Scott. She played a key role in Ron DeSantis’s successful 2018 campaign for Florida governor but was later dismissed by DeSantis after his election. When DeSantis entered the Republican primary against Trump, Wiles spearheaded an assertive strategy that highlighted DeSantis’s perceived weaknesses.The \\'Ice Maiden\\'Known for her restrained and enigmatic demeanour, Wiles rarely appears in televised interviews or public speaking events, contrasting with the more vocal Chris LaCivita. Trump even referred to her as the \"ice maiden\" during his victory speech, acknowledging her disciplined and sometimes ruthless approach to campaign management.Here’s a look at Trump’s former Chiefs of Staff and their perspectives on his leadership:Reince Priebus (January 20, 2017 – July 31, 2017): Trump’s first Chief of Staff, Priebus maintained a low profile after his tenure, offering little public commentary on Trump’s style or approach to governing.John F. Kelly (July 31, 2017 – January 2, 2019): A former Marine Corps General, Kelly has been openly critical, describing Trump in stark terms and voicing concerns about how he might govern if given another term.Mick Mulvaney (Acting, January 2, 2019 – March 31, 2020): Mulvaney has presented a balanced view, acknowledging both positives and negatives in Trump’s administration. While he has expressed concerns about certain decisions, he has been more reserved in his criticism than some other former officials.Mark Meadows (March 31, 2020 – January 20, 2021): Meadows has remained a strong ally of Trump, consistently supporting his actions both during and after his presidency. Despite facing scrutiny over his involvement in January 6-related events, Meadows continues to align with Trump’s political direction.', 'summary': 'In a swift move following his win over Kamala Harris, President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles, his campaign chief, as White House Chief of Staff.

Legal Dispute Explained', 'text': 'The Supreme Court on Friday overruled the 1967 judgment that became the basis for denying minority status to the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). \\nThe seven-judge Constitution bench of Supreme Court, headed by outgoing Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, left the decision to a three-judge bench to determine whether to grant the status to AMU based on the principles evolved in this judgement.\\nThe CJI said there were four separate opinions, including three dissenting verdicts, in the AMU case. The CJI said he has written the majority verdict for himself and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, whereas Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma have penned their separate dissenting verdicts.\\nLet us understand the dispute over the 1967 judgment, and Article 30 of the Constitution that establishes rights of minorities to establish educational institutions.\\nWhat is the Background of the Case?\\nMuslim reformer Sir Syed Ahmed Khan founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College (MAO College) at Aligarh to address Muslim educational backwardness while protecting Islamic values. When the Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920 (AMU Act) was passed, the MAO college and the Muslim University Association was incorporated into AMU. \\nIn 1951, the AMU Act was amended, removing compulsory religious education for Muslims and the exclusive Muslim representation mandate in the University Court. The Act was further amended in 1965, and the powers of the Court were redistributed among other bodies including the executive, with the President of India nominating members to the governing body.\\nThen Comes The 1967 Judgment\\nThe dispute began in 1967 when the top court in S. Azeez Basha vs Union of India (UOI) reviewed the 1951 and 1965 amendments in the AMU Act, which argued that they deprived the Muslim community, which has established the university, of the right to administer it. However, the five-judge SC bench upheld the amendments, and said the AMU was neither established nor administered by the Muslim minority, stressing the AMU Act’s enactment through Central legislation.\\nThe 1951 amendment to the Act allowed non-Muslims to be the members of the University Court, which was the supreme governing body at that time. It replaced the university’s Lord Rector with the Visitor, who was the President of India.\\nThe 1965 amendment gave more powers to the AMU’s Executive Council, which meant that the University Court would no longer be the supreme governing body.\\nAfter witnessing nationwide protests over the ruling, the government amended the AMU Act in 1981, affirming the university’s minority status.\\nThe AMU in 2005 for the first time provided 50% reservation for Muslims in post-graduate medical programmes. The Allahabad High Court struck down the reservation policy holding the 1981 amendment ultra vires.\\nConsequently, the University and the Union of India appealed to the SC in 2006. But in 2016, the Union government withdrew from the appeal, refusing to acknowledge the University’s minority status. \\nWhat Does Minority Status Mean For AMU?\\nThe top court is dealing with two aspects of the case: first, to determine minority status of an educational institution, and second, whether an institution established under a statute can enjoy such a status.\\nUnder Article 15(5), introduced in the Constitution in 2006, minority educational institutions are exempt from reserving seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Since AMU’s minority status is sub judice, and the SC directed in 2006 that status quo be maintained, the university does not have SC/ST quotas.\\nAlthough the petitioners argue that AMU is entitled to the minority status, the Union government is now endorsing the S. Azeez Basha verdict.\\nThe Centre argued before the Supreme Court this year that if AMU is declared a minority institution, “it will continue not to provide for reservation for SCs/STs/OBCs/EWS, [in jobs and seats, but] it will provide for reservation for Muslims which can be up to 50% or even more”.\\nThe Centre also argued that “a large national institute like AMU ought to maintain its secular origins and serve the larger interest of the nation first”.\\nSubmission submitted on behalf of AMU stated that it was “fallacious” for the Centre to hold that AMU’s minority status “would be contrary to public interest as it would exempt them from reserving seats for other disadvantaged groups”, since this negates the Constitutional provision that shields special rights of minorities.\\nOn reservation not being applicable to AMU, Sibal stated that “Article 30 is itself a recognition of rights of communities that also require special protection”. Therefore, the exemption for minority educational institutions provided by Article 15(5) is “not an exception to equality but simply a different facet of it, which seeks to balance the needs of different sections of society whether on the basis of religion, or caste and class”.\\nWhat Is Article 30 Of the Constitution?\\nArticle 30 of the Indian constitution consists of provisions that safeguard various rights of the minority community in the country keeping in mind the principle of equality as well.\\nArticle 30(1) in Part III of the Constitution empowers all religious and linguistic minorities with a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.\\nArticle 30(1A) deals with the fixation of the amount for acquisition of property of any educational institution established by minority groups.\\nArticle 30(2) states that the government should not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language, while giving aid.\\nWhile Article 30 and Article 29 of the Constitution do not specify ‘minorities’ in India, it is classified into religious minorities and linguistic minorities. Section 2, clause (c) of the National Commission of Minorities Act, declares six communities as minority communities. They are: Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains and Zoroastrians (Parsis).', 'summary': 'The dispute began in 1967 when the Supreme Court reviewed the 1951 and 1965 amendments in the Aligarh Muslim University Act, which argued that they deprived the Muslims community, which had established the university, of the right to administer it.

Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, who led the bench, authored the majority opinion with Justices Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra. Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and Satish Chandra Sharma wrote dissenting opinions.\\n\\nThe court had reserved judgment on this matter in February after eight days of hearings. The issue of AMU’s minority status was a point of contention, particularly regarding the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act, which aimed to grant the institution minority status but, according to the Court, did not fully restore its original character prior to the 1951 amendment.\\n\\nThe AMU Act of 1920 established the university as a Muslim teaching institution, but the 1951 amendment removed the mandate for religious education for Muslim students.\\n\\nChief Justice Chandrachud questioned whether the 1981 amendment truly returned the university to its 1920 status. He suggested that if the amendment had explicitly reinstated AMU’s original minority character, it would have been more effective.\\n\\nWhat Is Aligarh Muslim University Minority Case?\\n\\nHistorically, AMU was founded as Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 by Muslim community leaders, including Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and was converted into a university under British rule in 1920. The question of its minority status has been debated through numerous legal proceedings and legislative discussions over the years.\\n\\nIn 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in the Azeez Basha case that AMU, as a central government-funded university, could not be considered a minority institution. The current case reopens this debate, as various arguments have been made for and against AMU’s minority status.\\n\\nSupporters of minority status, including senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, argued that the limited number of Muslim members on AMU’s governing council does not negate its identity as a Muslim minority institution. Conversely, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued that a university receiving substantial central funding and designated as a national institution cannot claim minority status.\\n\\nThis issue has been a point of legal contention for decades, and the Allahabad High Court had previously nullified the 1981 law granting minority status to AMU. Appeals challenging that decision reached the Supreme Court, and in 2019, the issue was referred to a larger seven-judge bench.\\n\\nThe Congress-led UPA government had appealed the Allahabad High Court’s 2006 ruling, which overturned the 1981 amendment.\\n\\nHowever, in 2016, the BJP-led NDA government stated it would withdraw the appeal, citing the 1967 Supreme Court judgment as grounds to argue that AMU, as a central university, does not qualify as a minority institution.\\n\\nALSO READ:Jet Airways Faces Liquidation As Supreme Court Invokes Article 142: What It Means For Creditors', 'summary': 'In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in the Azeez Basha case that AMU, as a central government-funded university, could not be considered a minority institution.

The court said this while hearing the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) minority status-related case. A 7-judge bench of the Supreme Court (by a 4:3 majority) reversed the 1967 ruling in S. Azeez Basha vs. Union of India, which declared that an institution incorporated by legislation cannot claim to be a minority institution. The Supreme Court, however, stated that a separate three-judge bench will decide whether Aligarh Muslim University is a minority institution.\\n\\n“The view in Azeez Basha that minority character stops when statute comes into force is overruled. Whether AMU is a minority or not will be decided as per this (today’s) judgment,” the Court said.\\n\\nThe Court stated that when determining whether an institution is a minority institution, who established the institution needs to be taken into consideration.\\n\\n“The court has to consider the genesis of the institute and the court must see who was the brain behind the establishment of the institution. It has to be seen who got funds for the land and if minority community helped,” the Court said adding that administration by non-minority members will not eliminate an institution’s minority character.\\n\\n“We have held that to be a minority institution, it only had to be established by the minority and not necessarily be administered by the minority members. Minority institutions may wish to emphasise secular education and for that minority members are not needed in administration,” the court held.\\n\\nNotably, Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud delivered the judgement on behalf of the majority which included himself, Justices Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra), while Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and SC Sharma dissented.\\n\\nThe Court ruled that the government may regulate minority educational institutions till it does not violate their minority status. “An educational institution established by any citizen can be regulated under Article 19(6). This court has maintained that the right under Article 30 is not absolute. Regulation of minority educational institution is permitted under Article 19(6) provided it does not infringe the minority character of the institute,” the Court said.\\n\\nThe Court also ruled that Article 30 of the Constitution, which grants minorities the basic right to create and run educational institutions, applies to institutions founded by minorities before the Constitution went into effect.\\n\\n“Article 30 shall stand diluted if it applies to only institutes those which have been established after the Constitution came into force. Thus, educational institutions established by minorities which were established before the constitution came into force, will also be governed by Article 30,” the court said, as reported by Bar and Bench.\\n\\nIn his dissenting judgement, Justice Surya Kant stated that a minority can establish an institute under Article 30, but it must be recognised by law as well as by the University Grants Commission, a statutory authority within the Education Ministry. \\n\\n“The legislative intent behind a statute incorporating a university or institution would be necessary to decide its minority status,” Justice Suryakant said. In his verdict, Justice Dipankar Datta stated that AMU was not a minority institution. \\n\\nJustice Datta: I have clearly held that AMU is not a Minority institution and cannot come under Article 30@AMUofficialPRO #SupremeCourt— Bar and Bench (@barandbench) November 8, 2024\\n\\nBack in 2005, the AMU further introduced a policy that reserved 50% of postgraduate medical seats for Muslim candidates. This was challenged in the Allahabad High Court, which, the same year, reversed the reservation and declared the 1981 Act invalid. The court determined that the AMU could not maintain an exclusive reservation because, according to the Supreme Court’s decision in the S. Azeez Basha case, it was not classified as a minority institution. In 2006, a series of eight petitions, including one from the Union government, challenged the High Court’s verdict in the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIn 2016, the NDA government told the Supreme Court that it was dropping its case, stating that “as the executive government at the Centre, we can’t be seen as setting up a minority institution in a secular state.” On February 12, 2019, a three-judge bench led by the then-CJI Ranjan Gogoi referred the case to a seven-judge bench. And, today (8th November 2024), the Supreme Court delivered its verdict while also ruling that a separate three-judge bench, which will decide whether AMU can be deemed a minority university.', 'summary': 'In his\\xa0dissenting judgement, Justice Surya Kant stated that a minority can establish an institute under Article 30, but it must be recognised by law as well as by the University Grants Commission, a statutory authority within the Education Ministry.', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2024/11/sc-overrules-1967-verdict-new-bench-to-decide-amus-minority-status/', 'image': 'https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/supreme-court.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 08:47:33', 'author': 'OpIndia Staff', 'authors': ['OpIndia Staff'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.2}, {'id': 263502122, 'title': 'Supreme Court Reverses Critical 1967 Judgement on Aligarh University', 'text': 'In a landmark 4:3 decision, a seven-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court had on Monday overturned a pivotal 1967 judgement on Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), leaving open, however, the question of restoring its minority status. This “judgement on Aligarh University,” led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud on what would be his last day in office, took a hard look at whether the varsity, established by Muslims, qualifies as a minority institution.\\n\\nThe majority opinion threw up the distinction to be drawn between an institution being “established” by a minority community and one that was subsequently “incorporated” through legislation. AMU, which originated as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 and was upgraded to university status in 1920, had its antecedents in a Muslim Minority. However, its gradual evolution into a central university had muddied the waters of its minority status under Indian law.\\n\\nJudgement on Aligarh University: Will It Be Minority Institution Anymore?\\n\\nSpeaking for the majority, the Chief Justice noted that institutions need not to be controlled by a minority community or supplied with exclusively religious education to qualify as minority institutions. Secular education in those establishments, he added, does not negate their minority origins.\\n\\nThe dissenting voices came from Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and SC Sharma. The others in the majority were Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna-the next Chief Justice of India-followed by Justices JB Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, and Chief Justice Chandrachud.\\n\\nThis case traces back to Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, wherein it is entitled that minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions. AMU had held on to this privilege till the judgement of the court in the case of S. Azeez Basha vs. Union of India in 1967, wherein it was held that as AMU enjoyed the status of a central institution, it could not be granted the status of a minority institution.\\n\\nIn 1981, an amendment was brought in to reverse the earlier restrictions that had upset the minority status of AMU but Chief Justice has only observed partially effective saying it’s a “half-hearted job.”\\n\\nEarlier, the Union government wanted to defeat the minority status of AMU and favored the judgment of 1967.

BJP members held a mock session in the lawns of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly after half of its members were marshaled out while the other half staged a walkout of the House to protest against the special status resolution. Soon after the BJP MLAs were marshaled out from the Assembly, all the 28 MLAs of BJP Friday staged a parallel Assembly in the laws of Legislative Assembly complex Srinagar. Charging the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Abdul Rahim Rather with behaving like a ruling party MLA, the Leader of the Opposition, Sunil Sharma alleged that the resolution seeking special status for Jammu and Kashmir was drafted by Rather. \"It is very unfortunate instead of working neutral, the Speaker is behaving like the ruling party member in the House. On the directions of the Speaker, Marshals of the Assembly manhandled BJP MLAs on Thursday just to terrorize opposition members\", Sharma said and regretted that violent means were used to stifle the voice of opposition in the Assembly. \"Today will be marked as a dark day in the history of Jammu and Kashmir and its democratic traditions. For the past three days, the Speaker has acted in favor of the National Conference and has been suppressing the opposition\\'s voice\", Sharma said. BJP leader acts as Speaker in parallel Assembly Former Minister and BJP leader Sham Lal Sharma acted as the \"Speaker of the House\" in the parallel Legislative Assembly and other members spoke the way they spoke in the real House. Sitting in a circle on the lawn of the Assembly complex, Sham Lal Sharma sat on a Chair to look like the Speaker of the House while other BJP MLAs spoke one by one as if a \"real assembly was going on.\" \"The NC wants bloodshed in Kashmir again. I want to thank Speaker Abdur Rahim Rather for allowing us to hold this real Assembly,\" he said. Sham Lal Sharma said now he calls upon BJP MLA R S Pathania to speak. \"This the real Assembly, not the one that is inside. We came here to raise the people\\'s issues but we saw business being changed. We came here to speak at the LG\\'s address but we saw a resolution on special status,\" he said. Pathania said that before bringing any resolution, 15 advance notice is supposed to be given to the members of the House.

Referring to the recent elections for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Vijayan claimed that Jamaat-e-Islami planned to contest three or four seats there, ultimately focusing on the seat where CPI(M) leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami was standing. \"The goal was to defeat Tarigami, and the BJP shared this objective. However, despite this alliance of extremists and the BJP, the people chose Tarigami,\" the CPI(M) veteran said. He said the Jamaat-e-Islami in Wayanad claims they are different from the Jamaat-e-Islami in Kashmir. \"However, the ideology remains the same--one that does not accept any form of democratic governance. This time, they feel like supporting the Congress-led UDF,\" he said. Targeting the Congress, Vijayan asked, \"Shouldn\\'t those who stand for secularism oppose all forms of sectarianism?\" \"Can the Congress do that? The Congress and allies, including the Muslim League, seem to be making certain \\'sacrifices\\' to maintain their alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami.

The CPI(M) Politburo member urged Congress leaders to recall a statement by the late Marxist leader EMS Namboodiripad, highlighting his firm stance against communal alliances. He said in a by-election in Thalassery, EMS had openly stated, \"We do not want RSS votes.\" Referring to this example, Vijayan questioned whether Congress could take a similarly principled stand. Vijayan made similar allegations while addressing a by-election meeting in support of the Left candidate in Wayanad, CPI\\'s Sathyan Mokeri. Kozhikode Corporation Councillor Navya Haridas is the BJP candidate in the hill constituency. The Wayanad by-election was triggered after Rahul Gandhi, who won seats in both Wayanad and Raebareli, chose to vacate the Wayanad seat. The by-election will be held on November 13.

The attack, which took place on Sunday, targeted security forces and resulted in the injury of 12 civilians. Authorities confirmed that the individuals arrested—Usama Yasin Sheikh, Umar Fayaz Sheikh, and Afnan Mansoor Sheikh—are residents of the Ikhrajpora area in Srinagar. The police have linked the attack to Pakistan-based terror handlers, who allegedly orchestrated the violence with the aim of destabilizing the region.\\n\\nThe Grenade Attack: Aimed at Security Forces, Civilians Injured\\n\\nThe grenade attack occurred near a busy flea market in Srinagar, where terrorists hurled grenades from a flyover, aiming at the security forces stationed in the area. However, the grenades exploded near a paramilitary vehicle, injuring 12 civilians who were caught in the blast. This attack is seen as part of a larger pattern of violence in Jammu and Kashmir, which has witnessed a series of terror strikes and encounters, particularly following the swearing-in of the region’s first elected government after the revocation of Article 370 in 2019.\\n\\nIn the wake of the attack, authorities have emphasized the continuing threat posed by militant groups operating in the region. The police have invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against the arrested trio, further highlighting the gravity of the crime.\\n\\nMUST READ: ‘This Aghadi’s Vehicle Has No Wheels Or Brakes’, PM Modi Mocks MVA \\n\\nPolice Resolve the Case, and Authorities React\\n\\nInspector General of Police Kashmir Zone, V K Birdi, confirmed the arrests and noted that the police had successfully solved the case with the apprehension of the three suspects. Birdi added that the attack had been carried out at the direction of Pakistan-based terror handlers, who have long aimed to disrupt the peace and stability of the region.\\n\\nLieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha responded strongly to the attack, urging security forces to take decisive action against terrorist outfits operating in the region. He emphasized that the forces had “full freedom” to act firmly and eliminate terror networks. “You have full freedom to crush terror outfits and leave no stone unturned to complete this mission,” Sinha remarked.\\n\\nOn the political front, Jammu and Kashmir’s former Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah, condemned the grenade attack, calling it a deliberate attempt to disturb the region’s peace. Abdullah also pointed out that such incidents had increased following the formation of the new government after the recent assembly elections. He stressed the need for strict and immediate action to address the ongoing militancy in the valley. “This proves that militancy is still there in the valley,” Abdullah noted. “The Central government has the entire law and order and security apparatus in its hand. We call for strict action.”\\n\\nIncreasing Violence and Rising Tensions\\n\\nThe grenade attack marks yet another chapter in the ongoing conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, where security forces are engaged in constant efforts to tackle militancy and ensure peace. With the region’s political landscape evolving after the revocation of Article 370, there has been a noticeable uptick in violence in recent months. Analysts have warned that the return of an elected government in Jammu and Kashmir, while seen as a step toward restoring normalcy, has also triggered a resurgence of militant activity in the region.\\n\\nThe involvement of Lashkar-e-Taiba in the latest attack only underscores the persistent threat from Pakistan-backed terror groups.

A senior officer in the report, described this act as an “anti-government” act condemning it as an offence against the intended respect for the VVIP’s presence. The report added that those involved appeared to be “acting according to their own agenda.”The alleged incident, which took place on October 21 during a program at the CID headquarters, led to a full inquiry by a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). The inquiry sought to understand which officers and staff members were responsible for the oversight.The Chief Minister visited the CID headquarters to inaugurate the Cyber wing’s new Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System (CFCFRMS) station. However, instead of the CM, the samosas and cake were served to his staff, sparking an internal CID investigation. DGP, Atul Verma said that the matter is being investigated by the CID and not by the police headquarters.The investigation report details that an Inspector General (IG) officer asked a sub-inspector to procure food from a five star hotel in Shimla’s Lakkar Bazaar for the chief minister’s program. Following this order, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a head constable driver retrieved three boxes of samosas and cake, handing them over to a woman officer of Inspector rank. This officer, unaware of the items’ intended recipient, instructed for the boxes to be placed in a senior officer’s room, where they were then moved between rooms.When questioned, the officers involved claimed that they had confirmed with tourism department personnel on duty, who reportedly stated that the items in the boxes were not on the CM’s menu. The investigation further noted that an MTO (Motor Transport Officer) and HASI (Head Assistant Sub-Inspector) were assigned to manage refreshments like tea and paan for the CM’s staff. According to her statement, the woman Inspector was not informed that the items inside the boxes were meant for the CM. Without opening the boxes, she directed them to the MT section.The IG’s orderly, HASI, testified that the boxes were opened by a sub-inspector and a head constable and intended for the DSP and staff in the IG’s office. Following these instructions, the food was served with tea to approximately 10-12 people in the room.Based on statements from those involved, the CID report indicates that only a sub-inspector was aware that the boxes contained refreshments for the CM. Nevertheless, these boxes, overseen by a woman Inspector, were ultimately passed to the MT section without higher clearance, and the items were inadvertently served to the CM’s staff instead', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/11/himachal-cid-probe-into-how-samosas-meant-for-chief-minister-sukhu-were-served-to-his-staff/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/himachal-cid-probe-into-how-samosas-meant-for-chief-minister-sukhu-were-served-to-his-staff.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 08:08:35', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.591}, {'id': 263499696, 'title': 'Samosas, cakes meant for Himachal Pradesh CM Sukhu served to his security staff instead; CID probe on', 'text': 'Samosas and cakes meant for Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu were served to his security staff instead, the goof-up snowballing into controversy and necessitating a CID probe that termed it an \"anti-government\" act.\\n\\nThose responsible acted according to their own agenda, a highly placed official in the CID said in his note on the October 21 incident when the Chief Minister was visiting the CID headquarters.\\n\\nAttacking the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh, the opposition BJP said the Sukhu dispensation is not concerned about the development of the state but its only concern seems to be the \"Chief Minister\\'s Samosa\".\\n\\nThe brouhaha started when three boxes of refreshments were brought from Hotel Radisson Blue in Lakkar Bazaar to be served to the Chief Minister who had gone to the CID headquarters to attend a function.

The probe has called the incident an \"anti-government\" act, sparking strong reactions from political parties. The incident occurred on October 21 when the Chief Minister visited the CID headquarters. During the visit, refreshments that included samosas and cakes were mistakenly served to Sukhu\\'s security personnel instead of the Chief Minister himself. This error raised concerns about miscommunication and failure to follow protocols, as noted in the CID report. A senior CID officer commented that certain individuals involved in the incident acted according to their \"own agenda,\" which, they believe, showed a disregard for government authority. Following this, the opposition party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), criticized the Congress-led state government, suggesting that it is overly focused on minor issues rather than important development goals. The BJP coined the phrase \"Chief Minister’s Samosa\" to underline their point, using it to question the government\\'s priorities. The confusion began when the refreshment boxes were sent from Hotel Radisson Blue in Lakkar Bazaar to the Chief Minister\\'s event. The protocol required that an Inspector General (IG)-level officer oversee the refreshments. However, due to a mix-up in communication, the refreshments were served to the Chief Minister\\'s security staff instead. A deputy superintendent of police (SP) conducted an investigation and found that the police, responsible for handling the refreshments, were wrongly informed by tourism department staff who claimed that the items were not intended for the Chief Minister. Only the sub-inspector who placed the order knew the intended recipient. As tensions rose, BJP spokesperson Randhir Sharma stated, \"The state government is neglecting the development of the state, focusing only on trivial matters like the \\'Chief Minister’s Samosa.\\'\" He added that the incident reveals significant coordination issues within the administration, especially concerning events involving high-ranking officials like the Chief Minister. The incident has not only highlighted internal communication issues but has also become a topic of political debate in Himachal Pradesh, with the opposition using it to question the efficiency of the current government.

He said BJP MLAs who opposed the resolution in the J&K Assembly were thrown out of the House. Significantly, the Congress fought the election in J&K in an alliance with National Conference, but it had not promised restoration of Article 370, trying to steer away from the contentious issue. Congress also did not join the NC government in J&K, perhaps anticipating that such an association would cost it in Maharashtra elections as NC had vowed to bring back Article 370 in its manifesto.\\nBut the Prime Minister has brought this issue to the centre-stage in the Maharashtra elections, saying the restoration of Article 370 will again deprive the SCs, STs and OBCs of reservation benefits in J&K and, hence, the Congress stands against reservation.\\nModi also raised the slogan of ‘Ek Hain Toh Safe Hain’ (we are safe if we are one) to stress on Hindu unity and said the Congress was doing the biggest conspiracy against the country by trying to divide people on the basis of caste.\\n“The unity of OBC, SCs and STs is important — Yuvraaj (Rahul Gandhi) is playing a dangerous game of making one caste fight the other.

Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi – all did not want reservation,” Modi said.\\nHe also said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi car was one without brakes and wheels, and there was fight over who will be in the driver’s seat.

One can hear different kinds of horns,” he said.\\n\\nMVA has no intention to work for the development of people and the state and the goal of its leaders is to loot the public, he said.

Every woman should be wary of the MVA,” he said.\\n\\nModi also touched upon the “imported maal” comment by Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant for Mahayuti’s Mumbadevi candidate Shaina NC.

Surya also accused Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Minister BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan of causing distress amongst farmers in the state through \"catastrophic effects.\"The FIR was filed after the Haveri Superintendent of Police clarified that the farmer’s suicide, which took place in January 2022, was due to loan burdens and crop loss rather than land ownership issues. Police stated that the case was already closed after a final report under Section 174 CrPC, which deals with the procedure for investigating unnatural deaths, was submitted.Editors of Kannada Duniya E-Paper and Kannada News E-Paper also face charges for publishing a headline implying the farmer’s suicide was due to a Waqf land entry in his records. The news article alleged that farmers in Haveri were protesting against Waqf notices, reportedly causing mental distress to Rudrappa. Responding to the case, Surya stated that he would refrain from relying on the source that provided the information. He attributed the widespread anxiety over recent Waqf conversion notices to farmers as a reason for initially believing the report. The incident has heightened focus on Waqf land issues, with BJP leaders calling for a review of land designations and reportedly questioning the involvement of certain officials in land reclassification.This incident comes amid rising tensions over Waqf land issues across Karnataka, as Joint Parliamentary Committee Chairman Jagdambika Pal recently visited several districts with Tejasvi Surya to meet with concerned farmers. Pal has announced that a fact-finding report on Waqf properties will be presented in the winter session of Parliament.

This decline was primarily due to continuous foreign fund withdrawals and a lackluster performance in Indian stock markets.

This movement underscores a broader trend of volatility, with the rupee ending 1 paisa lower at a record 84.32 in the prior session. Analysts predict continued fluctuations, with the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) response to these changes keenly awaited. In such a dynamic environment, only those who adapt swiftly will thrive in the market ahead, remarked Amit Pabari, Managing Director of CR Forex Advisors.Global Economic Shifts and Domestic ChallengesThe US Federal Reserves decision to lower its benchmark rate to between 4.5% and 4.75% has signaled a significant shift. This move, reflecting a cautious approach towards inflation and employment risks, could have far-reaching effects on global currency markets. The dollar index saw a slight increase, suggesting a minor strengthening against a group of six major currencies.Domestically, the Sensex and Nifty experienced slight declines, pointing to a cautious sentiment among investors. The Sensex dropped by 14.23 points, while the Nifty fell by 15.45 points. This period also saw Foreign Institutional Investors pulling out a substantial amount, with sales amounting to Rs 4,888.77 crore, indicating a retreat from Indian markets.The pressure on the rupee and the anticipated response from the RBI highlight the interconnectedness of global and domestic financial landscapes. With potential adjustments in future Federal Reserve rates and shifts in investor confidence, there remains a possibility for the rupee to stabilize, particularly if the dollars surge eases. Pabari speculates that the RBI might aim to keep the rupee within a specific band, navigating through these uncertainties with strategic interventions.Oil Prices and Market ReactionsIn related developments, Brent crude oil prices saw a decrease, further complicating the economic outlook. The drop to USD 75.14 per barrel could influence inflationary trends and economic planning. The evolving scenario presents challenges and opportunities for Indias financial strategy, with currency stability being a critical focus area.The rupees fall to an all-time low against the dollar reflects broader global economic shifts and domestic financial pressures. With the RBIs strategies in focus, the market awaits how India navigates these turbulent waters.

However, the Indian athlete has downplayed concerns over his injuries and is optimistic about his recovery.\\n\\nIn a conversation with PTI on September 27, Chopra revealed that while the injury had disrupted his season, he was confident that he would be “100 percent fit for the new season.” He emphasized that his focus would be on refining his technique ahead of the 2024 season, which is set to be crucial for defending his titles and surpassing personal milestones.\\n\\nA New Chapter For Chopra’s Coaching\\n\\nNeeraj Chopra recently parted ways with his long-time coach, Klaus Bartonietz, after a successful five-year partnership. The change comes at a time when Chopra is preparing to defend his World Championships gold medal and attempt to break the coveted 90-meter mark, which has eluded him so far.

This statement was made during a rally in Maharashtra on November 7, 2024, where Shah emphasized that the abrogation of Article 370 is a significant achievement of the current government. Pawar, leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had previously expressed concerns about the implications of this decision on regional stability and governance.\\n\\nShah’s Firm Stance on Article 370\\n\\nAt a rally in Maharashtra, Amit Shah reiterated the government’s position on Article 370, highlighting that its removal has led to increased development and integration of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India. He stated, “The abrogation of Article 370 has brought peace and progress to the region,” countering Pawar’s assertion that restoring the article would help address local grievances. During this rally, Shah criticized the Congress for its alliance with regional parties like the National Conference, suggesting that such partnerships threaten national security. He declared that Article 370 is “gone for good” and will never return.\\n\\nBackground Context\\n\\nThe abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 marked a pivotal moment in Indian politics, revoking the special status previously granted to Jammu and Kashmir. This move has been met with mixed reactions; while some celebrate it as a step towards national integration, others argue it has exacerbated tensions in the region. Sharad Pawar’s recent remarks reflect a growing concern among opposition leaders regarding the socio-political climate in Jammu and Kashmir since the change.

Directed by Hansal Mehta and written by Aseem Arrora, Kashyap Kapoor, and Raghav Raj Kakker, The Buckingham Murders is produced by Mahana Films and TBM Films, presented by Balaji Telefilms. The production is helmed by Shobha Kapoor, Ektaa R Kapoor, and marks Kareena Kapoor Khan’s debut as a producer.\\nNews18 gave the film 4 out of 5 stars for its powerful performances, intention and brilliant cinematography. Our review read, “The Buckingham Murders is a slow-burn police procedural, mounted on the able shoulders of Kareena Kapoor Khan. It is a two-hour testament to Kareena’s brilliance as an actor. Mehta brings out the best in her. The actress, who once called herself ‘the most commercial heroine’, impresses with her unglamorous, nuanced expression of unresolved grief and devastation.

The top court was hearing a reference arising out of the 2006 verdict of the Allahabad High Court which held that the university was not a minority institution. The court also considered the validity of a 1967 Supreme Court case which rejected the minority status of the university, as well as the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act that granted minority status. During the hearing, the bench had expressed concerns over the 1981 amendment, stating it did a \"half-hearted job\" in restoring the university\\'s pre-1951 status.The 1951 amendment abolished the requirement for compulsory religious instruction for Muslim students at the university.This complex issue has consistently tested both Parliament\\'s authority to legislate and the judiciary\\'s ability to interpret such laws.\"One thing which is worrying us is that the 1981 amendment does not restore the position as it stood prior to 1951. In other words, the 1981 amendment does a half-hearted job,\" Chief Justice Chandrachud said during the hearing. Previously, the BJP-led NDA government refused to accept the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act. Instead, they argued that the court should follow a 1967 ruling by a five-judge Constitution bench, which ruled that since the institution was a central university, it cannot be classified as a minority institution.Supporters of minority status, represented by Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, argue that the university’s status is valid under Article 30 of the Constitution, which gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and manage educational institutions. They also argue that the university’s minority character is not affected by the fact that only 37 of its 180 governing council members are Muslim.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, argued that Aligarh Muslim University, being a central university funded heavily by the government and declared an institution of national importance, cannot claim minority status. They add that the institution surrendered its minority character after the 1951 AMU Act amendment, especially since it began receiving central government funding.The Allahabad High Court had previously struck down the 1981 law granting AMU minority status, prompting appeals to the Supreme Court.

The bench also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Surya Kant, J B Pardiwala, Dipankar Datta, Manoj Misra and Satish Chandra Sharma had reserved its verdict on the question on February 1 after hearing arguments for eight days. On February 1, grappling with the intractable issue of the AMU\\'s minority status, the top court said the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act, which effectively accorded it a minority status, only did a \"half-hearted job\" and did not restore to the institution the position it had prior to 1951. While the AMU Act, 1920 speaks about incorporating a teaching and residential Muslim university in Aligarh, the 1951 amendment does away with compulsory religious instructions for the Muslim students at the university.

However, Donald Trump managed to secure a victory, significantly increasing his support among American men, especially young men.\\n\\n Trump’s Appeal to Young Men\\n\\nAlthough younger voters generally lean liberal, Trump’s campaign successfully resonated with young men by appealing to traditionally masculine interests, such as combat sports and cryptocurrency. The campaign leveraged male-focused platforms, including popular podcasts. Conservative youth activist Charlie Kirk implied that masculinity itself was at stake, suggesting that male voters should align with Trump.\\n\\nTrump Breaking the Trend Among Young Voters\\n\\nWhile Trump garnered 54% of the male vote overall—up from 51% in 2020—the increase among men aged 18 to 29 was particularly striking, with 49% of young men voting for him. This shift contrasted with young women under 29, who overwhelmingly supported Harris with a 61% majority. Figures like Elon Musk, a high-profile Trump supporter, noted that this surge in support was a pivotal moment for Trump’s campaign.\\n\\nEconomic Concerns and Machismo Appeal\\n\\nThe economic policies promoted by Trump’s campaign attracted young Black men in particular, despite instances of divisive rhetoric. Spencer Thomas, a Howard University student who voted for Harris, observed that many peers focused on economic concerns over issues like abortion rights. Analysts, like media science professor Tammy Vigil, suggested that some Black and Latino men resonated with Trump’s machismo, which allowed them to overlook other controversial aspects of his campaign.\\n\\nPolitical scientist Kathleen Dolan added that Trump’s appearance on male-oriented platforms, such as the “Joe Rogan Experience,” was part of his strategy to energize young male voters.

Zomato entered into exclusivity contracts with partners in return for lower commissions, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain players if they listed exclusively on its platform, according to non-public documents prepared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Exclusivity arrangements between Swiggy, Zomato and their respective restaurant partners prevent the market from becoming more competitive, the CCI's investigation arm noted in its findings reviewed by Reuters on Friday.

Their findings have not been previously reported. Zomato declined to comment, while Swiggy and the CCI did not respond to Reuters queries. The antitrust investigation against Swiggy and its top rival Zomato began in 2022 after a complaint by National Restaurant Association of India about the impact on food outlets due to anti-competitive practices of the platforms. Food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato have in recent years reshaped how Indians order food, as hundreds of thousands of outlets listed on their apps just when smartphone use, and online ordering, both grew rapidly. Swiggy, which on Friday is closing bids for its $1.4 billion IPO - India's second biggest this year, and Zomato both in recent years also pushed restaurants to maintain a parity on prices, directly reducing competition in the market. That practice affects restaurants as they cannot offer lower prices on other online platforms, the CCI documents stated.

Israeli fans, who had traveled to the Netherlands to support their team, were reportedly assaulted after leaving the stadium.

Danny Danon, Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, likened the violence to a modern-day pogrom, calling it a stark reflection of the extremist forces Israel faces. “We are receiving very disturbing reports of extreme violence against Israelis and Jews on the streets of Holland. There is a pogrom currently taking place in Europe in 2024,” Danon wrote.

Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) linked the violence to the rising tide of anti-Semitic rhetoric around the world, particularly as a result of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “The hysterical and hyperbolic demonization of Israel has led to a global outbreak of antisemitic vitriol, vandalism, and violence,” Torres said, adding that the violence in Amsterdam represented “the single most monstrous manifestation of antisemitism.”\\n\\nRep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) also joined the calls for justice, demanding that the Netherlands government take immediate action to protect Jewish citizens. “This is outrageous. The government of the Netherlands must protect Jews from these attacks and prosecute the assailants,” he said.

The proposed laws, set to be tabled in parliament next week, would place responsibility on social media platforms to enforce age restrictions.\\n\\n“This one is for the mums and dads, They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,” Albanese said in his announcement.\\n\\nUnder the proposal, the ban would apply to young people already using social media, with no exemptions for parental consent. Compliance will be overseen by the eSafety Commissioner, Australia’s online regulator, which will enforce the legislation. There will be no penalties for users, instead, the onus will fall on tech platforms to demonstrate they have taken ‘reasonable steps’ to prevent access by under-16s. If the legislation passes, it would come into effect in 12 months and would be reviewed after implementation.\\n\\nDebate over the efficacy of such a measure has divided experts. While many agree on the potential harm of social media for adolescents, some argue a ban could merely delay exposure without equipping children to navigate online spaces. Previous efforts by the European Union to restrict social media access have encountered resistance from tech companies and mixed results, particularly in relation to age-verification requirements that can be circumvented.\\n\\nThe Australian Child Rights Taskforce, has called the proposed legislation \\'too blunt an instrument.\\' In an open letter sent to the government last month and signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the group advocated for \\'safety standards\\' rather than an outright ban. It cited UN advice urging national policies to focus on providing safe access to digital spaces, allowing children to benefit from online engagement.\\n\\nThe 36Months initiative, a grassroots campaign supporting the legislation, argues children are not yet \"ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16. With over 125,000 signatures, the petition claims that \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness.\"\\n\\nWhen asked if the government would consider alternative approaches, such as increased digital education, Albanese dismissed the idea as insufficient.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don\\'t want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,” he said. “These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour.\"\\n\\nThe proposed legislation comes amid global discussions about the impact of social media on young users. It remains to be seen whether Australia’s government can successfully implement and enforce such a ban and whether it will withstand scrutiny from technology firms and civil society groups alike.', 'summary': \"Australia's government will introduce what it describes as &lsquo;world-leading&rsquo; legislation to ban children under 16 from social media, a move aimed at mitigating the online 'harm' facing Australian youth, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Virat Kohli has often expressed that he loves spending time with his family in London where they are not recognised. “We were not in the country. Just to feel normal for two months – for me, my family – it was a surreal experience. Couldn’t have been more grateful to God for the opportunity to spend time with the family. It’s an amazing experience to just be another person on the road and not be recognised,” Virat Kohli said in March this year.\\nAs per a Hindustan Times report, Anushka and Virat are also directors of a UK-based company.

He will retire on Sunday and hand over the baton to Justice Sanjiv Khanna.\\n\\nIn a fitting end to his tenure, on his last working day, Justice Chandrachud headed a Constitution bench that delivered an important verdict on minority status for the Aligarh Muslim University. In a 4:3 verdict, the bench decided to overturn a 1967 judgment that stripped the university of minority status but said a three-judge bench would decide if it should be granted again.\\n\\nHere\\'s a look at some of Justice Chandrachud\\'s key judgments as the Chief Justice:\\n\\nElectoral Bonds Case\\n\\nIn February, ahead of this year\\'s Lok Sabha elections, a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud struck down the Electoral Bonds scheme for political funding, which had been in place since 2018. \\n\\nThe scheme, Chief Justice Chandrachud said, was unconstitutional and arbitrary and could lead to a quid pro quo arrangement between political parties and donors. \\n\\nThe bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai, Sanjiv Khanna, JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to stop issuing electoral bonds immediately and ordered the Election Commission of India to publish details of the political parties which have received contributions through electoral bonds since April 2019 on its website.\\n\\nPrivate Property Verdict\\n\\nEarlier this month, a nine-judge Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud, in an 8:1 majority judgment, said all privately owned properties did not qualify as community resources that the State could take over for the common good.\\n\\nThe case related to Article 31C of the Constitution, which protects laws made by the State to fulfil directive principles of state policy. Among them is Article 39B, which stipulates that the State shall direct its policy towards ensuring that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.\\n\\n \"Does material resource of a community used in 39B include privately owned resources? Theoretically, the answer is yes, the phrase may include privately owned resources. However, this court is unable to subscribe itself to the minority view of Justice Iyer in Ranganath Reddy. We hold that not every resource owned by an individual can be considered a material resource of a community only because it meets the qualifier of material needs,\" Chief Justice Chandrachud said. \\n\\nArticle 370\\n\\nIn December 2023, a five-judge Constitution bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud upheld the scrapping of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. \\n\\nChief Justice Chandrachud said Article 370 was a temporary provision to ease Jammu and Kashmir\\'s merger with India.\\n\\nThe court said that restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, which was divided into two Union Territories, including Ladakh \"shall take place at the earliest and as soon as possible\". It also asked for Assembly elections to be held in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024.\\n\\nSame-Sex Marriage\\n\\nA five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud had, in October 2023, refused to accord legal recognition to same-sex marriage, saying there was \"no unqualified right\" to marriage with the exception of those that are recognised by law.\\n\\nLeaving it to the legislature to take a call on enacting the marriage equality law, the judges also noted the centre\\'s submission that a panel headed by the cabinet secretary will look into practical difficulties faced by same-sex couples. The bench agreed that difficulties faced by queer couples in accessing basic services are discriminatory and said the government panel must look into them.\\n\\nIn October, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a key citizenship rule that recognised the Assam Accord, granting citizenship to Bangladeshi refugees who had arrived before 1971.\\n\\nSection 6A of the Citizenship Act was introduced in 1985 to allow refugees from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), who had entered India between 1966-1971, to register as Indian citizens.\\n\\nThe judgment was delivered by a five-judge Constitutional bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud with a 4:1 majority. \\n\\nCaste-Based Discrimination in Prisons\\n\\nThe same month, a bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud banned caste-based discrimination like division of manual labour, segregation of barracks and bias against prisoners of de-notified tribes and habitual offenders and held as \"unconstitutional\" the jail manual rules of 10 states for fostering such biases. \\n\\nObserving that the \"right to live with dignity extends even to the incarcerated\", the bench asked the Centre and states to amend their prison manuals and laws within three months, and file compliance reports.\"Criminal laws of the colonial era continue to impact the postcolonial world,\" the bench said. \\n\\nUP Madrasa Law\\n\\nEarlier this month, a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud upheld the validity of a 2004 law that regulates the functioning of madrasas in Uttar Pradesh and set aside an Allahabad High Court judgment that had declared the law unconstitutional and violative of the principle of secularism \\n\\nThe bench held that the high court had erred in holding that the statute must be struck down if it violates the secularism principle. \"The state can regulate the standards of education (in madrasas)... regulations relating to the quality of education do not interfere with the administration of the madrasas,\" the Chief Justice said.\\n\\nNEET-UG Re-Exam\\n\\nAmid the controversy over a string of paper leaks, the Supreme Court in July refused to cancel the 2024 NEET UG exam for entrance to medical colleges saying that the paper leak was not \"systemic\" or widespread enough that it affected the \"integrity\" of the exam.\\n\\nThe bench, headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud, said there wasn\\'t sufficient material available on the record to order a re-test but clarified that its judgment would not prevent authorities from taking action against candidates who had secured admission using malpractices.\\n\\nImmunity For MPs And MLAs\\n\\nIn March, a Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud ruled that an MP or MLA cannot claim immunity from prosecution if he or she is accused of taking a bribe for a vote or a speech in the legislature. \\n\\nNoting that corruption and bribery by legislators can potentially destroy the functioning of Indian Parliamentary democracy, the court held that taking a bribe is an independent crime and has no link with what a lawmaker says or does inside the Parliament or legislative Assembly. Hence, the immunity from prosecution enjoyed by lawmakers will not shield them.\\n\\nChild Marriage\\n\\nA bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud, in October, issued several directions for the effective implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 and said that child marriage deprives children of their agency, autonomy and right to fully develop and enjoy their childhood. \\n\\nThe bench ordered that state governments and Union Territories appoint officers solely responsible for discharging the functions of child marriage prohibition officers at the district level.\\n\\n\"Both sexes are adversely affected by forced and early marriage.

In a 4:3 decision, the bench reversed a 1967 ruling that had removed the university’s minority status, although it decided that a three-judge bench would determine whether it should be reinstated.\\n\\nHere’s a summary of some of Justice Chandrachud’s key decisions during his tenure:\\n\\nArticle 370\\n\\nIn December 2023, a five-judge Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud upheld the revocation of Article 370, which had granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The court explained that the provision was intended as a temporary arrangement to aid Jammu and Kashmir’s integration into India. The bench also emphasized the need for the restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir and the holding of Assembly elections by September 30, 2024.\\n\\nDY Chandrachud Delivered Electoral Bonds Case Judgment\\n\\nIn February, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Chief Justice Chandrachud led a five-judge Constitution bench that declared the Electoral Bonds scheme, which had been in effect since 2018, unconstitutional. He criticized the scheme for being arbitrary and prone to fostering quid pro quo relationships between political parties and donors. The bench ordered the State Bank of India to halt the issuance of electoral bonds and mandated the Election Commission to publish the details of political parties receiving such funds since 2019.\\n\\nPrivate Property Verdict By DY Chandrachud\\n\\nEarlier this month, a nine-judge Constitution bench, under Justice Chandrachud’s leadership, ruled in an 8:1 majority that privately owned properties could not be classified as community resources for the State to seize for public benefit. The case pertained to Article 31C, which safeguards laws made by the State to fulfill directive principles of state policy. Justice Chandrachud clarified that privately owned resources could not automatically be considered as material resources for the community unless they meet certain criteria.\\n\\nSame-Sex Marriage\\n\\nIn October 2023, Chief Justice Chandrachud presided over a five-judge bench that denied legal recognition to same-sex marriages. The bench concluded that there was no unqualified right to marriage, except for those recognized by law. While the court left it to the legislature to consider enacting a marriage equality law, it acknowledged the challenges faced by same-sex couples in accessing essential services, calling for the government to address these issues.\\n\\nSection 6A Judgment By Chandrachud\\n\\nIn October 2023, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, which grants citizenship to Bangladeshi refugees who entered India before 1971. The ruling, delivered by a five-judge bench, recognized the Assam Accord and allowed refugees who arrived between 1966-1971 to be registered as Indian citizens.\\n\\nCaste-Based Discrimination in Prisons\\n\\nA bench led by Justice Chandrachud in October ruled against caste-based discrimination in prisons, particularly practices like segregating prisoners based on caste or tribe. The court declared such practices unconstitutional and ordered the government to amend the jail manuals of 10 states within three months to eliminate these biases.\\n\\nUP Madrasa Law\\n\\nEarlier this month, Chief Justice Chandrachud headed a bench that upheld a 2004 law regulating madrasas in Uttar Pradesh. The bench overturned a ruling by the Allahabad High Court that had declared the law unconstitutional. The Supreme Court held that the state could regulate madrasa education standards without violating the principle of secularism.\\n\\nNEET-UG Re-Exam\\n\\nAmid controversies surrounding paper leaks, the Supreme Court, in July, refused to cancel the 2024 NEET UG exam, ruling that the leaks did not sufficiently affect the integrity of the exam. However, it stated that authorities could take action against those involved in malpractices.\\n\\nImmunity For MPs and MLAs\\n\\nIn March, a Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud ruled that Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) could not claim immunity from prosecution if they were accused of bribery in exchange for a vote or speech in the legislature. The court emphasized that such acts of corruption were independent offenses that could not be shielded by parliamentary immunity.\\n\\nChild Marriage\\n\\nIn October, Chief Justice Chandrachud’s bench issued directives for the effective enforcement of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The court highlighted the detrimental effects of child marriage on children’s autonomy and development. It instructed state governments and Union Territories to appoint district-level officers responsible for enforcing child marriage prohibitions.\\n\\nJustice Chandrachud’s leadership has marked a significant chapter in India’s judicial history, with landmark rulings that have shaped various aspects of Indian law.\\n\\nRead More: AMU Minority Institution SC Verdict Decoded In 10 Points', 'summary': 'Chief Justice DY Chandrachud concluded his two-year tenure at the helm of India’s judiciary, delivering a landmark judgment on his final working day.

Known also for his many pithy statements, DY Chandrachud leaves an imprint all his own on the annals of legal history.He has judgments such as the Ayodhya land dispute, the decriminalisation of consensual gay sex and abortion rights for unmarried women that shaped society and politics to his name.DY Chandrachud has recommended the most senior justice, Sanjiv Khanna, to be the next CJI. \"There is not going to be any difference when I leave this court because a person as stable as Justice Khanna will take over and is so dignified,\" he said at his farewell event on Friday.DY Chandrachud assumed office as the Chief Justice on November 11, 2022, after being elevated to the Supreme Court in 2016. According to the Supreme Court Observer, he has been a part of 1,275 benches. India Today sheds light on five significant rulings that would have a lasting impact on society.VERDICT ON RIGHT TO PRIVACYA nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled in August 2017 that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. CJI Chandrachud authored the judgment, highlighting that privacy is intrinsic to freedom and dignity. This decision has since influenced other judgments related to data protection, Aadhaar, and personal liberty.It all began in 2012 when retired justice KS Puttaswamy challenged the constitutional validity of the Aadhar Act. The Aadhar Act legitimised India\\'s Unique Identity Number programme.VERDICT ON HOMOSEXUALITYOn September 6, 2018, a unanimous five-judge Supreme Court bench partially struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 158-year-old law that criminalised same-sex relations between consenting adults.The Court ruled that the section’s provisions regarding homosexuality would remain in effect.In a detailed concurring opinion, CJI Chandrachud highlighted the harm Section 377 had caused by marginalising an entire class of citizens. Citing his prior judgment in the Puttaswamy case, which affirmed the right to privacy, he argued that denying the right to sexual orientation was also a denial of privacy.He stressed that human sexuality should not be “reduced to a binary” or narrowly defined as merely a means of procreation.VERDICT ON AYODHYA DISPUTEIn the most significant judgment, a five-judge bench headed by CJI Chandrachud awarded the disputed Ayodhya land to build the Ram temple and the Uttar Pradesh government was directed to provide an alternative site in Ayodhya for the construction of the mosque. The judgment came in November 2019 and settled the fractious issue going back more than a century.The Supreme Court aside a 2010 decision of the Allahabad High Court which in its judgment had divided the disputed land and gave it to the temple and mosque trusts for the construction of these structures.CJI Chandrachud earlier said that he had prayed to God for a solution to the Ayodhya dispute, remarks that sparked a row in the political spectrum.ABORTION RIGHTS FOR UNMARRIED WOMEN In a crucial ruling, CJI Chandrachud expanded the rights of unmarried women by allowing them access to abortion under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act up to 24 weeks, on par with married women.The judgment stressed the reproductive autonomy of women, affirming that a woman’s marital status should not impact her rights over her body and her choices related to pregnancy.Published By: Vadapalli Nithin KumarPublished On: Nov 8, 2024READ | Chief Justice DY Chandrachud\\'s last day at work: Forgive me if I ever hurt anyoneMust Watch', 'summary': 'As Chief Justice DY Chandrachud retires, a look at 5 landmark verdicts by him', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/law-news/story/dy-chandrachud-retirement-last-working-day-supreme-court-significant-judgments-right-to-privacy-ram-mandir-verdict-2630345-2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202411/dy-chandrachud-083414228-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=cDFmwJugjPw3wRzAp8htdqPR6wf3SQDs?size=1280:720', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:06:38', 'author': 'Law Today Web Desk', 'authors': ['Law Today Web Desk'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.15}, {'id': 263513180, 'title': 'Maruti Suzuki Dzire Achieves 5-Star Safety Rating in Latest Global NCAP Crash Test', 'text': 'The new Maruti Suzuki Dzire, launched in India this week, has set a new safety benchmark by earning a 5-star rating for adult occupant protection and 4 stars for child safety in Global NCAP crash tests.\\nThis makes the Dzire the first Maruti Suzuki model to achieve a top 5-star safety rating.\\nEquipped with six airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), and pedestrian protection as standard, the Dzire offers impressive safety features.

Roblox, which allows users to create their own games and share them with other players, will now be restricting kids under 13 from finding games that may be inappropriate for their age, alongside the platform’s social hangouts feature and 2D free form user creation.\\n\\nRoblox will now require creators to answer a questionnaire if they want their game to be available to children under 13. This age group will not be able to view or search for “unrated experiences” by default, from December 3. In addition, creators have to ensure that their game’s description and thumbnail matches the “All Ages or 9” content recommendations, which still includes “mild violence, heavy unrealistic blood, mild crude humor, and/or mild fear.”\\n\\nRoblox described social hangouts as club-like social places within the platform, while 2D free form user creation gave users the ability to draw 2d art and share them with other users. Both of these features will now be inaccessible to users aged 12 or younger.\\n\\nWhy This Matters:\\n\\nJust last month, activist investor Hindenburg published a report on Roblox, where it termed the platform as a “pedophile hellscape.” The report described chatrooms where users traded child pornography openly, alongside unmoderated games centering around topics like mass shootings and sexual abuse, accessible by any age group. Hindenburg further alleged that the platform outsourced its moderation to call centres in the Philippines to cut costs and was prioritising growth over children’s safety.\\n\\nA number of news reports have also covered problems such as children being asked images of themselves, or being exposed to explicit material. In one instance, an 11 year old girl was kidnapped by a man she met on Roblox.\\n\\nThe safety features presented may be insufficient as well. Concerns that arise include the fact that it will be a fairly straightforward matter for creators to lie about the content of their game, which would be difficult to find out without human moderation. Secondly, the safety features are not applicable to children aged 13 and above, which leaves them vulnerable to exploitation.

The judgement provided parameters for the exercise of the eminent domain power – the authority of the state to compulsorily acquire private property for public use, provided fair compensation is given to the owner.\\n\\nThe ruling is significant for property rights in India. It affirms that the government cannot broadly claim private property as “material resources” without considering its communal value and impact. This decision marks a shift from earlier interpretations, where the state had wider leeway to acquire private property under the guise of public good.\\n\\nThe judgement balances the Directive Principles with the need to respect private property rights. It reflects India’s shift towards a liberalised economy that fosters private enterprise while acknowledging the state’s role in ensuring social welfare. The Supreme Court’s case-by-case approach signals that future policies involving private property must meet rigorous constitutional scrutiny.\\n\\nThe judgement carries immense implications. It may shape legislative efforts related to property acquisition and social welfare. It might influence how political parties approach economic reforms and property rights in elections.\\n\\nThe decision underscores that any state action involving private property must carefully balance public interest and individual rights.\\n\\nThe matter began with challenges to Chapter VIIIA of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976, amended in 1986. The provision allowed the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board to acquire cessed properties with the consent of 70% of residents for restoration and distribution to “needy persons” and “occupiers”. The Property Owners’ Association, representing over 20,000 landowners, contested this, arguing that it violated their constitutional rights.\\n\\nThe Bombay High Court rejected their claims, citing Article 31C of the Constitution. Article 31C protects laws enacted in furtherance of Article 39(b) of the Constitution from being invalidated for violating the fundamental rights to equality and freedom guaranteed by the Constitution. In turn, 39(b) is part of the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution. It directs the state to ensure “that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to sub serve the common good”.\\n\\nThe case then reached the Supreme Court. The court was asked to define the limits of “material resources” in this context. The term, used in Article 39(b) refers to assets, including natural and man-made resources, intended for distribution or use in a manner that benefits the public and serves the common good. In some judgements, courts had held that this could encompass only state-owned resources. In other judicial interpretations, privately held resources were held to be part of “material resources” too if they significantly impact public welfare.\\n\\nInitially heard by a three-judge bench in 1996, the matter was referred to a five-judge bench and subsequently to a seven-judge bench in 2001. Finally, it was brought before a nine-judge bench in 2002. The judgement was delivered with an 8:1 majority. Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud authored the main opinion for himself and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Rajesh Bindal, Satish Chandra Sharma and Augustine George Masih. Justice B.V. Nagarathna partially agreed with this in a concurring opinion, while Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia wrote a dissenting opinion.\\n\\nMajority verdict\\n\\nThe majority opinion held that not all private property could be considered “material resources of the community” under Article 39(b) Chandrachud reasoned that an expansive interpretation, advocating state control over all private resources, echoed an outdated “rigid economic dogma”. He said that India’s economy had evolved from being state-controlled to a mixed economy, incorporating both public and private investments.\\n\\nThe ruling distinguished between resources essential for public welfare and those that do not meet this criterion. Chandrachud held that determining whether a private asset qualifies as a “material resource” must be done on a case-by-case basis. Factors to consider include the resource’s inherent value, its impact on public welfare and the consequences of concentrated private ownership.\\n\\nChandrachud also confirmed that Article 31C, as upheld by a 13-judge bench of the court in its landmark Kesavananda Bharati verdict in 1973, protects laws implementing Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution. However, he emphasised that such laws must still adhere to constitutional guarantees, including those under Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 300A (right to property). Both Nagarathna and Dhulia agreed on this point with him.\\n\\nNagarathna’s partial concurrence\\n\\nNagarathna agreed that some private resources could theoretically fall under “material resources” if they serve public welfare. However, she stressed that personal belongings and everyday assets should be exempt.\\n\\nNagarathna, however, differed from Chandrachud on his approach towards past judicial interpretations. She argued that his characterisation of some previous court judgments as biased towards a single economic ideology was unfair. She stated that these judgments reflected the socio-economic challenges and policies of their times.\\n\\nNagarathna emphasised that prior judges, such as Justice VR Krishna Iyer, should not be viewed as undermining the Constitution. Instead, their interpretations should be seen in the context of the era’s vision and needs.\\n\\nDhulia’s dissent\\n\\nDhulia’s lone dissent held that excluding private property from Article 39(b) overlooked the potential benefits of equitable distribution of certain private resources. He warned that a strict exclusion could undermine the Directive Principles’ goals, particularly in light of persistent economic disparities.\\n\\nHe viewed private resources as part of the “material resources” necessary for achieving social and economic justice. Unlike Chandrachud, who placed specific boundaries on how and when private property can be considered community resources, Dhulia held that these resources should always be viewed broadly to support redistribution for the common good.\\n\\nDhulia also called Chandrachud’s critique of Krishna Iyer “harsh” and cautioned against demeaning past judges' contributions.\\n\\nHistorical context \\n\\nThe debate over balancing fundamental rights and Directive Principles has a long history. Article 31C, introduced through the 25th Constitutional Amendment in 1971, sought to protect laws made under Article 39(b) and (c) from constitutional challenges based on the fundamental rights to equality and freedoms. \\n\\nThis provision was reviewed in the Kesavananda Bharati case, where it was partially upheld. The court had ruled that while Article 31C’s bar on judicial review was unconstitutional, protecting laws under Articles 39(b) and (c) was valid. The Supreme Court reinforced this stance in its Minerva Mills judgement in 1980, asserting that fundamental rights form the “basic structure” of the Constitution.\\n\\nTuesday’s judgement revisited this complex interplay, maintaining that while Article 31C shields specific laws from certain challenges, judicial oversight remains crucial to prevent misuse.\", 'summary': 'The Supreme Court ruled that not all private property can be deemed public resources by the government, balancing property rights and public welfare.', 'url': 'https://scroll.in/article/1075419/explained-how-a-new-supreme-court-ruling-curtails-governments-rights-to-acquire-private-property', 'image': 'https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/201539-fazejgandk-1718717818.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:30:00', 'author': 'Vineet Bhalla', 'authors': ['Vineet Bhalla'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'IN', 'sentiment': 0.131}, {'id': 263564178, 'title': 'Naga insurgent group seeks ‘third-party’ mediation in talks with Centre, warns of violence', 'text': 'Naga insurgent group National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) on Thursday called for “third-party intervention” in its talks with the Centre, failing which it threatened to resume “violent armed resistance” against the government.\\n\\nThiungaleng Muivah, the general secretary of the insurgent group, accused the Centre of betraying the letter and spirit of a Framework Agreement that it signed on August 3, 2015.

बिन्दुओं की शक्ल में, सूक्तिपरक उद्धरणों के कलेवर में तथा व्यक्तिगत स्तर पर स्वयं से संवाद करने की सूरत में यह पाठ्य सामग्री आप सभी के सामने है।\\n\\nइन वैचारिक टिप्पणियों के सन्दर्भ में कुछ बातें अलग से ध्यान आकर्षित करती हैं, जिनके कारण कुँवर नारायण जैसे रचनाकार के चिन्तक मन की सृजनशीलता पूरी संवेदनात्मकता के साथ खुलती नज़र आती है। उनका मानना है कि साहित्य और कलाओं का पक्ष मूलतः मानवीय होता है। वे मानवीय के भाव को बुद्धिमत्ता के श्रेष्ठतम उदाहरणों तक बारीकी से विस्तृत करते हैं। यह लेखक की स्थाई चिन्ता रही है, जिसकी ओर वह बार-बार लौटता है, जब भी वह बाहर की दुनिया में विसंगतियाँ, विकृतियाँ, अन्याय, क्रूरताएँ और हिंसाएँ देखता है। वह मनुष्य की सभ्यता और संस्कृतियों के उस दूसरे इतिहास को याद करता है, जो उसकी रचनात्मक चेष्टाओं और उसके उदात्त नैतिक प्रयासों में पढ़ी जा सकती हैं । जीवन-रक्षा ( सरवाईवल) की दृष्टि से भी उन्हें वह आदमी की आक्रामक वृत्तियों की अपेक्षा, अधिक वैज्ञानिक मानता है। यह अकारण नहीं है कि उनके जैसा रचनाकार इन्हीं आशयों के चलते विनम्रता की लचीली शक्ति में जीवन - विकास की बेहतर सम्भावनाओं को देखता है।\\n\\nकुँवर जी के इन नोट्स की तुलना हिन्दी में उपलब्ध डायरियों और नोटबुकों से नहीं की जा सकती, क्योंकि इन्हें कवि ने अपनी शर्तों और चिन्तन की कसौटियों पर लिखा है। वे कई स्थानों पर अपने डायरी लिखे जाने के सरोकारों को भी लक्ष्य करते हुए कहते हैं— 'नोट्स लिखना मेरे लिये चिन्तन मनन का एक तरीका है। एक ऐसा एकान्त जिसमें बैठकर मैं अपने और सबके बारे में अपनी तरह सोचता हूँ : कभी अपने बारे में ज्यादा, तो कभी दूसरों के बारे में ज़्यादा, लेकिन इस सोचने में विभाजन नहीं है, एक समावेशी ढंग है।' ज़ाहिर है, उनकी वैचारिकता के आँगन में आने वाला अपने और दूसरों के जीवन को जोड़कर समावेशी संसार रचने का एक विनम्र उपक्रम ही, इन टिप्पणियों की सार्थकता है। अतः कई मायनों में उनके जैसे कवि-चिन्तक ने नोटबुक के इन पन्नों पर अतीत और आज, समाज और राजनीति, साहित्य और जीवन से होकर गुज़रती हुई अनगिनत मर्मस्पर्शी टिप्पणियों का एक अचीन्हा व अप्रतिहत संसार भी रचा है।\\n\\nऐसे में, यह जानना हमेशा ही हिन्दी साहित्य के परिसर में प्रासंगिक होगा कि एक लम्बा साहित्यिक जीवन जीते हुए, साहित्य, कलाओं तथा अन्य रचनात्मक अभिव्यक्तियों में चिन्तन करते हुए तथा संकोच के साथ अपने जीवन और जीने की मुश्किलों को उजागर करते\\n\\nकुँवर जी ने एक ऐसा समावेशी किस्म का जीवन जिया है, जिस पर बड़ी सी रोशनी यह पुस्तक डालती है। मात्र इतना कहना कि कवि ने अपने बारे में जितना कम कहा है, यह किताब उससे कई गुना ज्यादा उनके बारे में बोलती है - इस किताब की सबसे बड़ी खूबी बनकर उभर सका है।\\n\\nशायद इसीलिए, सब दिशाओं में फैला और खुला हुआ कुँवर नारायण की रचनात्मकता का आकाश कुछ अधिक बड़ा, कुछ अधिक आत्मीय, कुछ अधिक सार्थक बन पाया है।\\n\\nफरवरी 1, 2012\\n\\n– यतीन्द्र मिश्र\\n\\n2 नवम्बर, 1999\\n\\nअकसर लगता मैं रुका हूँ, मेरे घर चल-फिर रहे हैं। एक दिन मेरे सारे घर मुझे छोड़ कर कहीं दूर चले जायेंगे। मैं मिट्टी में मिल जाऊँगा।\\n\\nजब भी किसी नयी जगह ठहरता हूँ उस जगह को सन्देह से देखता हूँ। वह एक धोखा हो सकता है -

Well, need not worry anymore, as we are here to help you out.\\nIf you’re a history buff, this might help you figure out what new place you can explore. The world is full of spectacular destinations that beautifully reflect old civilisations and unique cultures. Here we’ve mentioned some of the historical landmark places that you must visit at least once in your life:\\n\\nTaj Mahal: Starting with our own country, the Taj Mahal is among the seven wonders of the world located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Built in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, it is a symbol of love, devotion, and human creativity. This magnificent white marble mausoleum is nestled amidst lush gardens and reflecting lakes. Its exquisite carvings, symmetrical construction, and romantic history make it a must-see destination for any traveller.\\nEiffel Tower: Located in Paris, France, the famous Eiffel Tower is among the most loved tourist destinations around the world. It provides a unique view of the city from different levels. Some claim the best views are from the second level, which is high enough to see the full city but low enough to pick up on details. The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located at the Champ de Mars in Paris.\\nPyramids of Giza: The Great Pyramid of Giza is the greatest Egyptian pyramid located in Al Haram, Egypt. Built around 2600 BC, it’s the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one that’s mostly intact. These massive monuments, constructed as tombs for the Pharaohs, have survived the test of time for nearly 4,500 years. The exact construction processes behind the pyramids remain a mystery, yet their magnificence continues to amaze people from all over the world. These pyramids should have to be on your travel bucket list.\\nThe Great Wall of China: Next up on the list is the Great Wall of China, which was built around 3,000 years ago and is the longest wall in the world. Reportedly, the overall length of all portions of the Great Wall of China ever built is approx. 21,196 km (13.171 miles), which includes overlapping sections that were rebuilt. Built across several dynasties to safeguard China from invasions, this historic wonder demonstrates the engineering brilliance of its time.\\nLeaning Tower of Pisa: The Leaning Tower of Pisa, located in Italy, is another must-see place that you should add to your travel bucket list. The tower was initially intended to be a freestanding bell tower; however, due to the soft ground beneath its base, the tower began to lean during construction, resulting in the iconic tilt that made it famous.\\n\\nSo which of these landmarks are you planning to visit first?', 'summary': 'Located in Paris, France, the famous Eiffel Tower is among the most loved tourist destinations around the world.', 'url': 'https://www.news18.com/lifestyle/taj-mahal-to-leaning-tower-of-pisa-worlds-best-landmarks-to-add-to-your-travel-bucket-list-9113884.html', 'image': 'https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/image-2024-11-ba3cb582b74e98f4ed84b9a0165b32cf-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:54:35', 'author': 'News18,Riya Ashok Madayi', 'authors': ['News18', 'Riya Ashok Madayi'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.815}, {'id': 263559794, 'title': 'Jalaram Jayanti 2024: Date, History, Rituals And Significance Of Shri Jalaram Bapu', 'text': 'HomeLifestyleJalaram Jayanti 2024: Date, History, Rituals And Significance Of Shri Jalaram Bapu\\n\\nJalaram Jayanti 2024: Date, History, Rituals And Significance Of Shri Jalaram Bapu\\n\\nThis year, the Jalaram Jayanti will be observed on Saturday, November 9.\\n\\nRahul MUpdated: Friday, November 08, 2024, 06:25 PM IST\\n\\nShri Jalaram Bapu | Pinterest\\n\\nEvery year, Jalaram Jayanti honours the life and teachings of Shri Jalaram Bapa.

Shares in Tesla, led by Elon Musk, surged nearly 15%, reflecting market optimism regarding the future under Trump’s influence. Trump had previously referred to Musk as a “super genius,” a remark that likely contributed to the surge in Tesla’s stock.\\n\\nFuture of Social Media After US Election Results\\n\\nFor those who use tech products but don’t own shares, the question arises about whether they are willing to engage on platforms like X, Musk’s social media network, particularly as Musk may play a significant role in Trump’s administration. Trump has suggested Musk could help reform the federal government to improve efficiency and performance, which could grant him considerable power over government agencies regulating tech firms like his own.\\n\\nMusk’s platform, X, has been criticized for spreading misinformation, a concern that became especially prominent during the election. While some argue that content moderation has gone too far, Musk’s close association with Trump could indicate a more lenient approach to misinformation. Industry experts suggest that the focus will likely be on reducing restrictions and amplifying content, rather than deleting it, potentially resulting in more unregulated speech on social media.\\n\\nTrump’s Complex Relationship with Big Tech\\n\\nTrump’s stance on tech monopolies has shifted throughout his career. Initially, as a populist, he pursued actions against large tech firms, including the Justice Department’s investigation into Google for anti-competitive behavior. However, his relationship with tech leaders like Musk has grown closer in recent years. As president, Trump may face challenges in balancing his populist approach with the realities of his ties to Silicon Valley.\\n\\nTrump’s administration will likely continue to grapple with anti-monopoly cases against major tech companies, such as the ongoing investigations into Google, Meta, and others. Some expect the Federal Trade Commission’s anti-monopoly chair, Lina Khan, to be removed from her post. Yet, his vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, has supported parts of Khan’s anti-monopoly stance, signaling potential internal conflict on how to handle tech industry regulation.\\n\\nUS Election Results, National Security, and Global Influence\\n\\nTrump sees the tech giants as essential for maintaining US global power, especially as AI becomes a critical aspect of national security. He has praised Google’s influence and questioned whether breaking it up would be beneficial. His administration’s policies on AI, tech mergers, and trade could significantly impact the industry.

However, this setback seems to have ignited a renewed dedication in Shaw, as he focuses on improving his fitness in hopes of a comeback. With Mumbai currently competing against Odisha in an Elite Group A Ranji Trophy match, Shaw has been making productive use of his time, engaging in fitness drills near the MCA-BKC ground in Mumbai.\\n\\nAccording to a report, the 24-year-old cricketer has been seen performing sprint drills and running exercises under the guidance of Amogh Pandit, a trainer from the Mumbai Cricket Association. Shaw has also been spotted acknowledging teammates fielding near the boundary, showing his support despite being off the field.\\n\\nShaw’s Exclusion From The Squad\\n\\nThe decision to exclude Shaw from the Mumbai squad came from the selection committee led by Sanjay Patil. Initially, he was left out of the 16-member team selected for a crucial third Ranji Trophy match against Tripura, and his name was again absent for subsequent matches. This omission raised questions about Shaw’s fitness and focus, but it also provided a turning point for Shaw to reconsider his approach and physical readiness for future opportunities.\\n\\nIn the midst of these challenges, Shaw received a heartfelt motivational letter from former Australian cricketer and ex-India head coach Greg Chappell. Chappell’s words of encouragement were more than just support; they were a call to action, suggesting that this difficult moment could become the turning point in Shaw’s career.\\n\\nChappell’s Words Of Encouragement\\n\\nIn the letter, Chappell wrote, “Hi Prithvi, I understand you’re facing a challenging time right now, being out of the Mumbai team. It’s natural to feel frustrated and perhaps a bit uncertain, but I want you to know that these moments are often the turning points for athletes, helping to shape both their careers and their character.”\\n\\nReflecting on Shaw’s potential, Chappell recalled, “I remember watching you play for India’s under-19 team, where you showcased an extraordinary talent and a spark that made it clear you were among the most exciting young cricketers of your time. Those of us who recognize your potential are still keenly watching your journey, knowing that the best is yet to come.”\\n\\nChappell also drew on the experience of legendary cricketer Don Bradman as an example. He reminded Shaw that even Bradman faced setbacks, having been dropped from teams at various points. “What made them great was not avoiding challenges, but how they responded to them,” Chappell wrote. He urged Shaw to focus on his fitness, saying, “Take care of your body, get the right amount of rest, and build the strength and focus you need. The door back to the Indian team is open if you’re willing to walk through it, but it takes a commitment to growth and change.”\\n\\nShaw’s Career So Far\\n\\nPrithvi Shaw debuted in Test cricket in 2018 and quickly became a player to watch. However, he struggled to make a lasting impact in the international arena, and his form declined over time. Shaw has played five Tests, six ODIs, and one T20I for India, with a total of 528 runs across these formats. Despite a promising start, his last appearance in a Test match was in 2020 against Australia in Adelaide.\\n\\nIn addition to his struggles in the Ranji Trophy, Shaw was also released by the Delhi Capitals ahead of the latest IPL season. It remains uncertain if he will attract interest from other franchises in the upcoming IPL auction, adding another layer of uncertainty to his professional future.\\n\\nMUST READ | Neeraj Chopra Heads To South Africa For Off-Season Training After Coach’s Retirement', 'summary': \"Prithvi Shaw, sidelined from Mumbai's Ranji squad, is focusing on fitness and training after receiving a motivational letter from Greg Chappell, encouraging him to see this as a turning point.\\n\\n\\nThe post What Prithvi Shaw Is Doing After Receiving Greg Chappell&#8217;s Motivational Letter appeared first on NewsX World.\", 'url': 'https://www.newsx.com/sports/what-prithvi-shaw-is-doing-after-receiving-greg-chappells-motivational-letter/', 'image': 'https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Prithvi-Shaw.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:55:11', 'author': 'Sanjay Patil.

If accessed, these emails could open ways for a plethora of illegal activities, with potentially severe consequences for individuals and businesses alike.A hacker on a private forum claims that purchasing access to these government email accounts can make anyone willing to pay a few thousand rupees “become” a government officer. “Once you purchase the access, you will be able to reset the password or do as you please,” reads a post on the hacking forum.But how exactly could these government emails be misused? Take, for example, \"digital arrest.\" With basic information like a person’s name, phone number, and address--often readily available in public records—cybercriminals posing as law enforcement can “arrest” their victims and extort large sums of money. This tactic, known as \"digital arrest,\" has become a lucrative form of online fraud.Now imagine what a cybercriminal could do if they know what their target purchased, whom they sent money to, what they searched online, which websites they visited, or with whom they chatted on social media. Earlier this week, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning that cybercriminals are using compromised government email accounts and falsified court orders or summons to demand information from US-based private companies.Sale of .gov.in email accountsIndia Today’s Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) team found three listings on a private hacking and data sale platform, the most recent posted on November 6, advertising the sale of email IDs and their passwords.The team reviewed a sample of nine email accounts with the @tn.gov.in domain, belonging to Tamil Nadu government officials, which a seller was offering as part of a batch of 700 such credentials. One of these accounts appeared to belong to an IAS officer.Though government-issued email accounts require two-factor authentication for access, the Indian government mandated the use of the Kavach app, developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), in 2020. This app requires the original user to approve any sign-in attempts from new devices. However, it appears that hackers may have found a workaround to bypass this security measure.Another cybercriminal, in a secure chat with India Today, claimed they charged $150 (about Rs 12,600) for the credentials of a single government email ID.

This will help in creating competitive production capacities for the commodity.\\n\\nCreating a market\\n\\nThe reality is that as of now there is no market in the country for green hydrogen, which is a consequence of there being no market for goods and services that would use the commodity to replace carbon emitting fossil fuels.\\n\\nConventional support mechanisms such as the SIGHT Programme or the PLIs scheme may not deliver the desired outcomes in the absence of a market for green hydrogen and products made from it, it opined.\\n\\nThe report stresses on understanding an investor’s perspective.\\n\\n“He needs to see sufficient sustained demand in a price range where he can get adequate returns on his investment.

The minimum support price (MSP) fixed for this year’s crop is ₹2,275. \\n\\nData from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs show that retail wheat prices have increased by 2.2 per cent in the past month and 4.44 per cent over the past year at ₹31.98 a kg. \\n\\nOfficial sources said last month, the high-level Group of Ministers decided to release more wheat through the public distribution system or ration (PDS) than OMSS. \\n\\nPolitical move?\\n\\n“The government has already restored (release of) some quantity through PDS, which was cut in 2022, and replaced it with rice,” the sources said. Recently, Food Minister Pralhad Joshi said Tamil Nadu has demanded 2 kg of wheat and 3 kg of rice instead of 5 kg rice under PDS as demand for wheat is growing.\\n\\n“The decision to supply more wheat through PDS is political. The move to not begin OMSS means the government is not concerned about the market,” said a Delhi-based trade analyst. \\n\\nThough wheat is available at around ₹2,800 in Uttar Pradesh, the cost when it reaches Coimbatore or Bangalore of Chennai is ₹3,400, traders said.\\n\\n“The Government has probably got its wheat production estimate wrong.

So, the Centre may not consider it now,” he said.\\n\\nTrade sources said the Centre could have considered imports earlier and not when rabi sowing has begun.

Directed by the Farzi and The Family Man fame duo director Raj and DK, the show is about Honey struggling actress and Bunny Stuntman in action films, how their worlds turn after they go against the Citadel universe, and how they reunite for their daughter. This is the basic premise of this 8-episode series on Amazon Prime Video. The series has a stellar star cast including Varun Dhawan, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Kay Kay Menon, Saqib Salim, Sikander Kher, Simran, Shivakit Singh Parihar, Soham Majumdar, and the star of the series Kashvi Majumdar playing the role of Nadia Honey and Bunny's 7-year-old daughter. The film goes back and forth between the late 80s and early 200s, where we get to see a Mumbai that was still Bombay; from the bell bottoms to the Coca-Cola and Goli Sodas to the trunks, everything was perfect, even the clips where the main characters are watching their appearances in the films they have acted in, the VCR, and the nostalgic TV all in for the nostalgia factor. Coming to the action set pieces, Raj and DK have a very realistic approach to how they like to choreograph the action sequences. I loved how the camera moves with the actors in sequences of powerful combat action scenes, especially the ones featuring Samantha and Varun going hand in hand with others. It was realistic because they are shown reloading their guns and there is no over-the-top action of slow-motion walks where the villain is falling behind. The plot of the story is the age-old good over the bad, the group of boys falling apart because of the girl, and many other routine stuff, but the way Raj and DK have beautifully integrated the story and the location is worth the watch. I loved the cameo appearance of Bhuvan, who starred opposite Shahid Kapoor in Farzi, and how they had a whole inside joke about him becoming the hero's best friend. The unique point in this film is how Honey teaches her daughter Nadia to be strong, fearless, and independent, yet at the same time does not steal away her innocent childhood from her. Varun as Bunny did exceptionally well in the action sequences, and so did Samantha in her solo action scenes. All in all, this is a series one can watch with their family and have a nostalgic trip to their 90s childhood, as well as enjoy the action sequences.\", 'summary': '', 'url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/ott/citadel-honey-bunny-review-samantha-and-varun-dhawan-impress-with-stunts-1836493', 'image': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/11/08/1860595-citadelhoneybunnyreview.webp', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:53:21', 'author': 'Bhavana Sharma', 'authors': ['Bhavana Sharma'], 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.505}, {'id': 263560632, 'title': 'GHMC Gets Nod to Acquire Church Land for Amberpet Flyover', 'text': 'Hyderabad: Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana High Court directed the GHMC to proceed with partial land acquisition to complete a disputed flyover project in Amberpet, despite opposition from a local church. The judge was dealing with a writ plea filed by Shalem Bible Church located at Golnaka. The petitioner was challenging the GHMC’s decision to acquire a portion of the church land for the project. The church, a longstanding institution in the community, argued that it was instructed by the authorities in June 2017 to hand over 94.2 square yards of land. The petitioner alleged discrimination, contending that other religious structures along the flyover route, such as temples and dargahs and graveyards, had been exempted from demolition, leaving only the church for potential destruction. The petitioner claimed that the civic body took the decision unilaterally and called for a realignment of the flyover to protect its structure. The petitioner contended that the church lacked official ownership documents but had maintained possession of the land for decades. According to the petitioner, compensation amounting to `1 crore was paid to unofficial respondents, while the church was left out of the discussions and compensation processes. Counsel for the unofficial respondents presented a document from 1964 purportedly proving official ownership of the disputed land, which may weaken the church’s claim. The judge after hearing both the sides instructed the GHMC to continue construction while respecting the integrity of the main church structure. The judge permitted demolition of the compound wall and acquiring the property’s front portion, with instructions to carefully remove the cross at the church. The judge deferred a decision regarding the remainder of the property to a later date.HC to hear writ on spy camera regimeA two-judge panel of the Telangana High Court will examine the regulations relating to the sale of spy cameras by various authorities. The court would do so in the context of a PIL filed for a direction to frame special guidelines or restrictions with regard to the rampant sale of spy cameras, both online and offline. Heaven Homes Society, Hyderabad, complained that the uncontrolled and unregimented sale of such cameras would be a serious affront to the right to privacy. The petitioner contended that the microscopic spy cameras have no known use and could be fitted anywhere in private and public places without anyone’s knowledge. The petitioner alleged that there was an imminent danger for women from illegal spy cameras that are readily available and at are affordable. It was also alleged that photographs and videos captured by spy cameras were later moved to online pornography sites without the victims’ knowledge, which could also prove fatal. The panel, considering the allegations, posted the matter for final hearing in January.HC to hear encroachments of village landA two-judge panel of Telangana High Court took on file a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the action of the Rangareddy district collector and other authorities in not protecting gramakantam land situated at Bachupally village in Kandukur mandal, from encroachers. The panel, comprising Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J. Sreenivas Rao, was dealing with a PIL filed by Kandukuri Srinivas and four others, agriculturists residing in Bachupally village. The petitioners alleged that the unofficial respondents were land-grabbers. Despite repeated written representations, the official respondent authorities failed to take any action against them. The petitioners also alleged that their then sarpanch had created a revision register with no jurisdiction or authorisation from any law or authority, collected taxes from the unofficial respondents, and allotted house numbers to blocks of the land. The petitioners contended that the unofficial respondents were claiming wrongful possession of the land by relying upon the revision register. The panel, after hearing counsel for the petitioners, and the government pleader, directed the respondent authorities to file their response and posted the matter for further adjudication.Compensation formula under HC scannerJustice T.

Amid all the high-pitched debate over whether AMU should retain the minority tag or not, what has gone forgotten is the man who gave the land for the AMU campus. It would be difficult to bracket this man within one single category. For Mahendra Pratap Singh was a raja, a reformer, a Nobel Prize nominee and a member of Parliament. His name was brought back into discourse when Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stated that Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was not given due credit and announced a university in his name. This was the time of UP Assembly polls in 2019. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also validated this.But who was Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, and why does he stand out among the many royals that India had?A freedom fighter, revolutionary, reformer and writer. He was also President of the Provisional Government of India, which served as the government in exile during World War I from Kabul in 1915. He even became a target of the British government due to his activities. Finally, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1932.He returned to India a year before Independence and started his work with Mahatma Gandhi.Singh won the Mathura Lok Sabha seat in 1957 as an Independent candidate. At this time, he was also contesting then Jana Sangh leader, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who would stand fourth in the election.

(Image: Wikimedia Commons) EARLY YEARS OF RAJA'S LIFE AND EDUCATIONBorn to a Jat family in Hathras in 1886, Raja would later inherit the estate from his father.At the age of nine, Raja was enroled to Government High School in Aligarh. He later shifted to Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental Collegiate School founded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, which later became AMU.Both British headmasters and Muslim teachers became an intrinsic part of Raja's education.His home was later converted into a technical school called Prem Mahavidyalaya in 1909.He inherited his estate from his father, Raja Ghanshyam Singh, who had helped Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in establishing AMU.He would also take to helping Sir Syed and AMU and grant land for AMU.First, he would give land for AMU's school and then some land to the university.Due to his immense contribution, the school has been renamed after the Raja. His family had even asked that his portrait be placed inside the AMU. After his death in 1979, the Janata Party government issued a postal stamp in his memory. (Image: Wikimedia Commons) RAJA'S CONTRIBUTION TO INDIA'S FREEDOM STRUGGLESingh's contribution to pre-Independence India is larger than education reforms.He was inspired by Congress leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. He even attended the Calcutta session of the Congress despite his family's apprehensions.During World War I, he left the country to seek international help for the Independence of India.On entering Germany, Kaiser Wilhem-II would come to receive Singh. But he would also go to Switzerland, Turkey and Austria to seek help.Singh would go on to establish the first government of India in exile from Kabul in 1915.He was also the president and Maulavi Barktuallah of Bhopal became the prime minister of the government. During these trips, Singh would develop close relationships with Russian leader Lenin and the Japanese leadership. He was tapping on the support of similar countries, which would be later taken up by Subhas Chandra Bose.Because of his relentless struggle, Singh earned the respect of Mahatma Gandhi for his patriotism and sacrifice.Singh was also nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by Swedish doctor N A Nilsson. He was praised by the nominator for exposing British brutalities in India.Singh's return to India would only come a year before India declared Independence. Upon this return, he met Mahatma Gandhi at his Wardha Ashram.But his efforts to reach out to Germany and Japan, which were fighting World War II with Britain, would keep him in political oblivion in British India.But he would hold political office soon.In 1957, he became a Lok Sabha MP from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh. Among the people he defeated was a young Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was cutting his political teeth in Jana Sangh.After his death in 1979, the Janata Party government issued a postal stamp in his memory. While the Raja and his contributions are being acknowledged and remembered now, his contribution to AMU should become a part of our collective memory.Published By: Priyanjali NarayanPublished On: Nov 8, 2024Must Watch\", 'summary': 'Hindu reformer raja who donated land for AMU defeated Vajpayee in polls', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/hindu-reformer-raja-donated-land-aligarh-muslim-university-uttar-pradesh-raja-mahendra-pratap-2630412-2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202411/raja-mahendra-pratap-singh-contributed-to-aligarh-muslim-universitys-school-and-university-campus-080428211-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=fuLBTkc.Q6op_noi_2Upf.rEoQgR2yNj?size=1280:720', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:56:32', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.37}, {'id': 263561082, 'title': \"DK Shivakumar: BJP wants to finish Siddaramaiah as he is 'powerful mass leader'\", 'text': 'Implying that BJP’s blame tactics to malign Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah as they were afraid of his popularity, Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said on Friday that the BJP was trying to finish the Chief Minister politically because he is a powerful popular leader.“Siddaramaiah is a powerful mass leader.

We made an application in August and now waiting for NOC. Once we get that, we will file Draft Red herring Prospectus (DRHP) with SEBI,” Krishnan said. Once the regulatory review is complete and there is no adverse observation from SEBI, the exchange will proceed with launching its IPO. NSE’s listing has been delayed due to several factors, including investigations into the exchange’s preferential treatment of certain entities.\\n\\nHe also said that the market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies could double in the next 10 years to $12-13 trillion from $5.5 trillion at present by riding on the thriving Indian economy. The exchange took 30 years to reach $5.5 trillion as it has about 3,100 companies listed at present.\\n\\n“We took 30 years to $5.5 trillion, and we have about 3,100 companies on the platform. So very logically, if you just do an extension of this logic, then we should add another 3,000 (to reach the market capitalisation of $12-13 trillion). But in the next 10 years, it should happen because people think that India’s GDP will, anyway, get to $10 trillion,” Krishnan said here.\\n\\nThis growth will be supported by existing companies listed on the NSE, and addition of newer companies on the platform. “There are 100 plus unicorns, many of them are not listed yet, so they could all add to the market cap as and when they get listed,” he added.\\n\\nNSE Clearing Ltd, the exchange’s clearing corporation, further enhances confidence with a substantial settlement guarantee fund of ₹10,500 crore. This robust fund serves as a safety net, providing comfort for foreign and domestic participants alike, given the inherent risk of billions of trades handled by the platform.\\n\\nNew commodity contracts\\n\\nTalking about commodities, he said: “We have applied for new contracts. As soon as we get the approval, we will launch them.” As of now, commodity trading has negligible share in overall business of the exchange. However, with more than 20 crore registered investors on its exchange, it is hopeful of higher business from commodity segment.\\n\\nAccording to Krishnan, focus would be non-agri commodities as there is a lot of certainty in launching these asset classes compared to agri commodities. These additional contracts would be selected from a wide array of SEBI-approved commodities. Moreover, about 240 members have set up already and live on NSE commodities. These included foreign portfolio investors, algo participants and active market makers.\\n\\n“NSE is convinced that commodities are a very big thing which is about to happen in India. We did a lot of analysis on which contracts come out, and FPI feedback to us was that we should come out with contracts which are cash settled,” he said while adding that NSE’s commodities platform can become a stronghold for key products like crude oil and natural gas.', 'summary': 'Aims to strengthen commodities segment, predicts market cap to double in 10 years', 'url': 'https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/nse-awaiting-noc-from-sebi-before-filing-draft-prospectus-for-ipo/article68845273.ece', 'image': 'https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/33egpw/article68827776.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-10-22T070122Z_538488505_RC2EPAA2KSO2_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-NSE.JPG', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-11-08 13:12:00', 'author': None, 'language': 'en', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': 0.014}, {'id': 263556236, 'title': 'Box Office: Vijay Deverakonda Hit Flop Movie List', 'text': \"Vijay Deverakonda is one of the most successful actors in Tollywood who continues to entertain the audience.

India's trade deficit with China stood at over USD 85 billion in FY2024. Had India joined RCEP, the situation could have worsened drastically, as it would face zero-tariff imports from China, risking further imbalance, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said. In 2019, India announced that it would not join the China-backed mega free trade agreement -- Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as negotiations failed to address New Delhi's outstanding issues and concerns. India's decision to opt out of the RCEP was strategically sound, as subsequent developments have validated its concerns over potential economic imbalances, which increasingly favours China over other member nations, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said. 115086098The remarks assume significance as Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam has recently stated that India should be a part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. It added that a major worry for India has been the rising trade deficits of RCEP members with China. This trend, rather than showing signs of improvement, has worsened post-RCEP. ASEAN's trade deficit with China grew sharply from USD 81.7 billion in 2020 to USD 135.6 billion in 2023, GTRI said. Japan's deficit doubled, and for the first time, South Korea is projected to experience a trade deficit with China this year, it added. This indicates that RCEP's gains are disproportionately skewed toward China, leading to unfair competition and validating India's fears that joining would lead to a surge in Chinese imports without corresponding benefits, it said. India already has robust free trade agreements (FTAs) with 13 out of 15 RCEP members, excluding New Zealand and China. 115018913Consequently, the expected benefits from RCEP would have been marginal for India, particularly considering China's opaque trade practices and its history of flooding markets with subsidised goods, Srivastava said. I have not seen solid arguments for how joining RCEP would benefit India. Most arguments do not go beyond the idea that opening up the economy is good. But why open to a country with which we have the largest trade deficit and trust issues, he added.\", 'summary': \"India's decision to stay out of the RCEP trade bloc was a smart move, according to think tank GTRI.
