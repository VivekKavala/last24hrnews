                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The kidneys are two organs shaped like red beans that are located on either side of the upper back of the body, right under the human ribs.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The function of the kidneys includes producing renin, an enzyme that regulates blood pressure.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In addition, the kidneys also produce erythropoietin compounds that function to stimulate red blood cell production.</p>
