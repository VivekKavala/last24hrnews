        "text": "Srinagar, Oct 25: Jammu and Kashmir Bank on Friday reported 45 per cent rise in September quarter standalone profit at Rs 551 crore.\n\nIn the year-ago period, the bank had logged a profit of Rs 381.07 crore.\n\nNet profit in April-September FY25 grew 36.6 per cent to Rs 966.41 crore from Rs 707.52 crore in the same period a year ago, a statement said.\n\nBacked by both core and non-core income growth, the bank's operating profit in Q2 rose more than 47 per cent YoY and 32 per cent QoQ to Rs 787 crore.\n\nNet Interest Income (NII) was up 7.7 per cent YoY to Rs 1,435.93 crore in the September quarter. Other income surged 55.6 per cent YoY to Rs 296.08 crore.\n\nNet Interest Margin (NIM) improved to 3.90 per cent from 3.86 per cent recorded in Q1 while the cost to income ratio improved significantly to 54.56 per cent YoY from 64.93 per cent.\n\nCommenting on the bank's Q2 numbers, MD and CEO Baldev Prakash said the results are almost in line with the expectations.\n\n\u201cThe bottom-line growth underscores our financial prudence and operational excellence while reflecting our commitment to deliver consistent value for our stakeholders as we stay steady on course to achieve the annual numbers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe, with a healthy balance sheet, a diversified portfolio and consistent focus on digital transformation, we are well-positioned to maintain this growth momentum and capitalize on emerging opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe bank's gross NPA ratio decreased by 131 basis points YoY to 3.95 per cent as against 5.26 per cent recorded in September 2023. Net NPA ratio also moderated to 0.85 per cent from 1.04 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, during the quarter the Return on Assets (RoA) jumped to 1.41 per cent YoY. Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) also improved 55 basis-points YoY to 90.54 per cent.\n\nPrakash said keeping gross NPA below 4 per cent highlights the success of the robust risk management practices of the bank.\n\n\u201cWe have been focusing on proactive asset-quality management and ensuring long-term sustainability in lending. Another highlight of this quarter is RoA, which has surged to 1.41 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\nWith continued improvement in key performance indicators, the bank is reinforcing its position as a leading financial institution focused on profitability and sound asset management, he added.\n\nThe bank's CASA stood at 48.60 per cent, which continues to be one of the highest in the industry.\n\nRegarding business growth, the MD and CEO said during September quarter, \u201cour growth in advances is near 10 per cent, while we have maintained the deposit growth within the range of industry average.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, the bank will intensify efforts to strengthen deposit base and increase loan book to achieve its top-line growth numbers, he said.\n\n\u201cWith a CRAR of almost 15 per cent, we remain well-capitalized, ensuring that the bank is positioned to support future growth opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. Pertinently, the CAR is exclusive of half-yearly profit of Rs 966 crore, which would otherwise result in taking the ratio to 16 per cent,\u201d Prakash added.\n\nHe also emphasized on the prioritisation of carrying forward the digital momentum.\n\n\u201cSince our role as a developmental financial institution here is not just to provide credit, we have to take care that businesses are equipped with the tools they need to manage growth sustainably,\u201d he said.\n\nTherefore, by carrying forward the digital momentum, the bank is also revolutionizing the way its customers experience banking, making it more convenient, swift, secure and efficient for them with every passing day, Prakash added.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we have devised a comprehensive road map to help businesses particularly MSMEs get equipped with beneficial, convenient and efficient management solutions, through collaborative banking with our fintech partners, so that these enterprises sustain growth and enjoy prosperity.\u201d",

Another porter and a soldier were injured.\n\nA day later, the famous ski resort, however, witnessed an uninterrupted influx of visitors.\n\nA resident of Tripura visiting the Valley for the first time, Ujjwal said he did not feel any threat to his safety as police personnel and the administration are there to protect them.\n\nHe added that the warmth of Kashmir and its people is so special that travellers feel safe here.\n\n\u201cI have come here with my wife and seven-year-old son. We heard about some terror attack yesterday but we did not feel any threat. Even in Tripura, we have had militancy. If something has to happen, it will happen.\n\n\u201cWe cannot stop living because of fear. Yesterday, my mother called and asked me to take precautions but I said everything was fine. The police and administration are there to take care of things,\u201d Ujjwal said.\n\nHe added that when he asked their driver if it was safe, the man responded, \u201cI will take care of your safety.\u201d\n\nReferring to the October 20 terror attack on a campsite of workers of an infrastructure project in Ganderbal district that left a local doctor and six workers dead, Ujjwal said it was the day they reached Kashmir on vacation.\n\n\u201cThe day we reached here, something similar had happened in some other area but the people here are so nice. They make us feel so comfortable. I think that is what makes this place so special,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite Thursday's attack, local tourism remains steady.\n\nSudesh Kumar, a taxi driver from Jammu, said he has been visiting Kashmir for 23 years and does not feel intimidated by the situation in the Valley.\n\n\u201cI live in Katra and I have been coming here for 23 years now. I first confirmed it with a few people in Gulmarg and they gave a green signal. I arrived here with a Bengali group around 11 am. There is so much security here.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to worry. I am happy tourists are visiting Kashmir. Even the people of Kashmir are happy. It is good for all of us,\u201d Kumar said, adding that business is going on and it should not stop.\n\n\u201cIf not a terrorist attack, I might die in a road accident. So, why die every day? A terrorist has the trigger, he does not see who is on the opposite side. Be it a Hindu or a Muslim, his job is to spread terror.\n\n\u201cI have an EMI of Rs 60,000, how will I survive if I do not work? There are so many like me who have liabilities. I have faith in God and whatever is his will, I will accept that,\u201d he said.\n\nSecurity forces on Friday morning pressed helicopters aerial surveillance around the scene of the terror attack, while a massive counter-insurgency operation in the area along the Line of Control (LoC) is underway.\n\nThere was also a temporary shutdown of the Gondola cable car project in Gulmarg but it was restored. The shutdown, according to officials, was a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of tourists and staff.\n\nHowever, local shopkeepers have a different tale to tell, fearing that the deadly attack is going to have an impact on their businesses before the situation returns to normal in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cThis attack will have an impact on our businesses for a few days. Right now, Gulmarg is trending on every platform on social media, although Bota Pathri is at some distance from here,\u201d a local tea seller said.\n\n\u201cTourists are roaming freely and enjoying the beautiful scenery but it is not how Gulmarg looks like on a normal day. We are dependent on it. Many of the tourists have already cancelled plans and that is worrisome,\u201d he added. (Agencies)",
