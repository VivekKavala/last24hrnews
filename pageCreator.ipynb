CPI state secretary Mahendra Pathak released the list of candidates for the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly polls.This comes as the party expressed disappointment over the current seat-sharing arrangement of the INDIA bloc.

The division bench, led by Chief Justice Manmohan, while seeking the response of all respondents, including Union ministries of information and broadcasting and electronics and information technology, tagged the matter with ongoing PIL and recently moved against ticket scalping, which is listed for hearing on February 18, 2025.The plea, prompted by recent concerts featuring Coldplay, Diljit Dosanjh, etc.The petition stated that the resellers have also acted in violation of the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, as the resellers do not carry out any verification of the tickets being sold on their platform, nor they require any undertaking from the sellers, as is also evident from their terms and conditions. Thus, an individual with no ticket can also advertise via Resellers and secure unjust and unlawful benefits. Moreover, the resellers have no effective grievance redressal mechanism in place which may protect the interests of the purchasers if the seller fails to abide by its contractual obligations. Moreover, in the absence of a ticket or non-delivery of a legal ticket, it is the resellers who are to gain, as they further charge 25 euros per issue from the seller as ‘administrative fees’ for resolution of any issue raised by the purchaser. Such fees are independent of any successful resolution, and no compensation is provided to the buyer.It is further stated that Section 112 of BNS was also introduced with a similar aim to curb the practice of black-marketing and unauthorised dealing of tickets. The legislature intended to safeguard the public interest by outlawing any transactions for the sale of tickets that were without the express authority of the authorised ticketing platform or organiser. Prior to BNS, the state legislatures had prohibited such black-marketing activities via state legislation, as it deprived the state of a substantial amount of tax revenue and also resulted in the innocent public being cheated by the criminal elements. Thus, Section 112 of Bharatiya Nagarik Sanhita, 2023 [‘BNS’] aimed to protect the public by curbing the said acts of black-marketing with a severe punishment of imprisonment extending up to 7 years and imposition of fine. On October 9, the Delhi High Court sought the response of all respondents authorities against the practice of “ticket scalping,” which involves reselling event tickets at inflated prices.The plea filed in the Delhi High Court challenges the illegal practice of ticket scalping, where event tickets are resold at inflated prices for profit, harming the general public.The petition also claims that scalping contributes to a black market for counterfeit tickets, further victimising consumers. Additionally, it argued that these transactions, often unregulated, evade the official tax system, resulting in lost government revenue. This situation fosters a shadow economy that deprives the state of funds that could support public services and infrastructure.The petitioner called for a comprehensive legal framework, effective enforcement, and technological solutions to mitigate the negative impacts of ticket scalping. The goal is to promote fair ticketing practices, ensure consumer protection, and integrate revenue from ticket sales into the formal economy', 'summary': 'The News Mill', 'url': 'https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-norms-to-regulate-re-sale-of-concert-tickets-banning-of-illegal-sites/', 'image': 'https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-norms-to-regulate-re-sale-of-concert-tickets-banning-of-illegal-sites.jpg', 'video': None, 'publish_date': '2024-10-24 07:53:34', 'author': 'ANI', 'authors': ['ANI'], 'language': 'en', 'category': 'politics', 'source_country': 'in', 'sentiment': -0.191}, {'id': 260898206, 'title': 'BJP’s Wayanad LS candidate Navya Haridas files nomination', 'text': 'BJP candidate from Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, Navya Haridas on Thursday filed her nomination papers.

The bye-elections were imposed by them. Congress is not speaking politics here,” Mokeri told reporters after filing his nomination papers.“Are they ready for political debate?

This gathering was part of the weekly caucus meetings that take place while the House of Commons is in session. The Wednesday meeting served as a platform for MPs to voice their concerns and frustrations directly to PM Trudeau. Trudeau is facing mounting pressure from within his own party, with dissident Liberal MPs giving him an ultimatum to decide his future by October 28. During the caucus meeting on Wednesday, a document was presented outlining the case for Trudeau’s resignation, but it didn’t specify any consequences if he fails to meet the deadline.Sources speaking to Radio-Canada said that 24 MPs signed an agreement to call on Trudeau to step down as Liberal leader, CBC News reported.During the meeting, British Columbia MP Patrick Weiler presented a document that argued in favour of Trudeau’s resignation. The document suggested that the Liberal party could experience a resurgence similar to what the Democrats saw after US President Joe Biden opted not to run for re-election for the upcoming presidential elections in the country. MPs were given two minutes each to address the room during the three-hour-long meeting. About 20 — none of them cabinet ministers — stood up to urge Trudeau to step aside before the next election, sources said. But a number of MPs also stood to voice support for the prime minister, CBC News reported.Marc Miller, Immigration Minister has acknowledged the frustrations of some Liberal MPs and expressed respect for those who voiced their concerns directly to Trudeau.“Fundamentally, this is something that has been simmering for some time and it’s important for people to get it out. This isn’t a code red situation. The prime minister can sure as hell handle the truth,” CBC News reported.The latest political rift in Canada has indeed been fuelled by the escalating tensions between India and Canada.

This gathering was part of the weekly caucus meetings that take place while the House of Commons is in session. The Wednesday meeting served as a platform for MPs to voice their concerns and frustrations directly to PM Trudeau.Trudeau is facing mounting pressure from within his own party, with dissident Liberal MPs giving him an ultimatum to decide his future by October 28. During the caucus meeting on Wednesday, a document was presented outlining the case for Trudeau\\'s resignation, but it didn\\'t specify any consequences if he fails to meet the deadline.Sources speaking to Radio-Canada said that 24 MPs signed an agreement to call on Trudeau to step down as Liberal leader, CBC News reported.During the meeting, British Columbia MP Patrick Weiler presented a document that argued in favour of Trudeau\\'s resignation. The document suggested that the Liberal party could experience a resurgence similar to what the Democrats saw after US President Joe Biden opted not to run for re-election for the upcoming presidential elections in the country.MPs were given two minutes each to address the room during the three-hour-long meeting. About 20 -- none of them cabinet ministers -- stood up to urge Trudeau to step aside before the next election, sources said. But a number of MPs also stood to voice support for the prime minister, CBC News reported.Marc Miller, Immigration Minister has acknowledged the frustrations of some Liberal MPs and expressed respect for those who voiced their concerns directly to Trudeau.\"Fundamentally, this is something that has been simmering for some time and it\\'s important for people to get it out.
