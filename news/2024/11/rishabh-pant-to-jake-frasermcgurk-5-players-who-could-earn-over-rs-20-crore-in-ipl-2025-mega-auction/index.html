                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>The mega auction for the 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is scheduled to take place in Jeddah on November 24 and 25.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> As many as 1574 players from India and abroad have registered themselves for the two-day event taking place in the Middle East for the second year in a row.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Many star players from around the globe are expected to attract intense bidding wars between multiple franchises for the acquisition of their services.</p>

As we move closer to the IPL 2025 mega auction, here’s a look at five players who’re expected to attract the highest bid:
Rishabh Pant
Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, who has scored 3284 runs in 111 IPL matches played so far, will be part of the mega auction for the first time in his career.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Since making his debut in 2016, he was part of the Delhi Capitals, but despite leading them in IPL 2024 and finishing as the leading run scorer, he was not retained by the franchise.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Pant is one of the best batters across formats at present times who is capable of winning matches single-handedly and from any situation.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> According to many fans and experts of the game, he will become the highest paid player in IPL history.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Performance in IPL 2024: 446 runs in 13 matches for Delhi Capitals
Overall IPL record: 3283 runs in 111 matches

KL Rahul is one of the most experienced Indian batters who will go under the hammer in the IPL 2025 mega auction.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The 32-year-old right-handed batter has played for RCB, SRH, PBKS, and LSG in the past and has 4683 runs to his name in 132 matches.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Rahul can bat as an opener in the middle order and as a finisher as well.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In addition to that, Rahul can keep the wickets and has huge experience in captaincy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He has consistently scored more than 500 runs in an IPL season, which is why many teams are expected to go behind him.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The 29-year-old is the only captain in IPL history to lead two teams to the final, and due to his leadership skills, he is expected to be very high on demand.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Many teams will enter the mega auction in search of a captain and can target Iyer, who also has scored 3127 runs in 116 matches played so far since making his debut in 2015.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In his short career itself, the 22-year-old right-handed batter has established himself as one of the most dangerous white-ball batters, and with age by his side, many teams can look at him as a long-term investment and break the bank to secure his services.</p>
