                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Americans head to the polls on Tuesday in a mood of discontent and division, with opinion polls showing nearly two-thirds of voters believe the country has been heading in the wrong direction under President Joe Biden.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> While the United States economy is the envy of the industrialized world, emerging from COVID shutdowns with strong job growth and wage increases, many Americans complain those gains were gobbled up by high grocery and housing prices.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Biden's promise of a return to a more humane immigration regime than under Republican former President Donald Trump soon collided with the reality of a spike in illegal border crossings.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The Supreme Court upended the legal landscape around abortion rights by overturning Roe v.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Whoever triumphs in the election - Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris - will inherit the legacy of a Biden administration that made good on some promises, saw others swept off-course by events, and others still only partially fulfilled.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Here's how Biden fared on the defining issues of his presidency.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> IMMIGRATION Biden, a Democrat, started his presidency by reversing many of Trump's restrictive immigration policies.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He haltedconstruction of Trump's border wall; rescinded bans targeting people from certain majority-Muslim countries and other nations; and wound down the remain in Mexico program, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as they pursued their U.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But months into his presidency, illegal crossings spiked, particularly among unaccompanied children from Central America, overwhelming U.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Illegal crossings reached record levels in 2022 and 2023 as more migrants arrived from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and countries outside the hemisphere.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, in 2022 beganbusing arriving migrants north to Democratic cities including New York City and Chicago, which struggled to house them.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In January, Biden backed a bipartisan bill that aimed to tighten border security.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Senate amid Trump's opposition, Biden in June bannedasylum for most migrants crossing the border illegally.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped dramatically, undercutting Trump's false claims that Harris and Democrats support an open border.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Despite the political pressures surrounding migration, Biden created new legal pathways for hundreds of thousands of migrants and oversaw the restoration of the U.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> ABORTION The biggest upheaval on abortion access in decades occurred during Biden's presidency - but because of a decision by the Supreme Court.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In June 2022, the conservative majority formed by Trump's judicial appointments to the court eliminated the nearly 50-year-old federal right to abortion under Roe v.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wade.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The decision ushered in a period in which individual states set their own laws on abortion access.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> More than a dozen states banned abortion in all or most cases.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Biden condemned the Supreme Court ruling, and his administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, laid out guidelines to ensure access to emergency abortion care under federal law and defended the use of the abortion pill before the Supreme Court.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The administration also pushed for expanded access to reproductive health services like contraception through the Affordable Care Act.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The administration won its biggest victory in June when the Supreme Court rejected a case brought by anti-abortion advocates seeking to roll back the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, one of two medications used in the abortion pill regimen.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But the court dismissed on procedural grounds the administration's case arguing that Idaho's severe abortion ban conflicted with a federal law requiring medical providers to offer stabilizing emergency care, including abortions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In October, the court declined to hear a similar administration case about Texas' strict abortion ban.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> While devoutly Catholic Biden was openly uncomfortable about abortion from early in his political career, mitigating the impacts of the dissolution of Roe v.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wade has become a pillar of his presidency.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Democrats more broadly made abortion rights central to their platform in the 2022 midterm elections.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In March, Harris became the first sitting vice president or president to visit an abortion clinic.</p>
