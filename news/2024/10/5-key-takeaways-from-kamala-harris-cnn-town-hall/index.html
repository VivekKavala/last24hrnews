                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>With less than two weeks until the election, Vice President Kamala Harris held a town hall in Pennsylvania—a crucial battleground state—while her rival, Donald Trump, addressed a rally in Georgia.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> During the CNN event, Harris tackled a wide range of pressing topics, from immigration and the economy to the contentious issues of abortion and US foreign policy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Throughout the town hall, Harris maintained her jovial demeanor while clarifying her positions and distinguishing her policy priorities from those of President Biden, suggesting a new approach if she were to assume the presidency.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The border issue, which has been a persistent challenge for her, once again took center stage.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> When pressed on whether she would continue building the wall along the Mexico border, she wants "strengthen our border" but did not provide further clarification.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>During the town hall, Harris also called Trump a "fascist" and a threat to America's democracy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>— KamalaHarris (@KamalaHarris) CNN anchor Jake Tapper noted that Harris tended to sidestep direct questions, focusing instead on critiquing Trump.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “She concentrated much more on Donald Trump than on the specifics of her own plans,” he observed.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Additionally, Dana Bash remarked that Harris’s performance did not quite “close the deal” with undecided voters.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>5 key takeaways from Kamala's CNN TownhallStrengthening border securityWhen asked about her stance on former President Donald Trump’s border wall, Harris was critical of the previous administration's efforts.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “Remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They didn’t,” she remarked with a laugh.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Despite her critique, Harris defended her support for a bipartisan bill that allocates $650 million for border security, including physical barriers.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She emphasised that her focus is on practicality rather than ideology: "We need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Let’s just fix this thing.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>" Although Harris has shifted her view on the wall, she clarified that her objective is to “strengthen our border,” distancing herself from Trump’s approach while acknowledging the need for compromise to address the broken immigration system.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Tackling rising grocery prices and the economyOn the economy, Harris was asked about soaring grocery prices, a concern many Americans feel deeply.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She agreed that prices remain too high and highlighted her background in fighting corporate price gouging as a potential solution.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “Part of my plan is to create a national ban on price gouging,” she said, explaining that companies exploiting consumers would face new consequences.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Harris also addressed the housing crisis, advocating for collaboration with the private sector to cut red tape and increase affordable housing options.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In her response, Harris criticised both parties for not doing enough to tackle housing affordability but stressed that her administration would take a "new approach" focused on tax incentives for home builders and ensuring accountability for corporate monopolies in the housing market.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>— CalltoActivism (@CalltoActivism) Defending abortion rights Harris firmly reiterated her pro-choice stance, criticising the Trump-era Supreme Court appointments that led to the reversal of Roe v.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wade.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> “When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Wade, and they did as he intended,” Harris stated.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She described the ripple effects of the decision, highlighting how some states have introduced draconian abortion bans with no exceptions for rape or incest.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Harris also mentioned conversations with pro-life individuals who were shocked by the unintended consequences of these laws, including women dying from lack of access to essential reproductive care.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> "Women have died because of these laws," she added, making a passionate plea for bipartisan action on the issue of reproductive rights.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Distancing herself from Biden administrationPerhaps one of the most striking moments of the town hall was when Harris made it clear that her administration would not simply be a continuation of Biden’s policies.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> When asked how she would differentiate herself from the current administration, she responded, “I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I represent a new generation of leadership.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>” Harris highlighted issues like housing, health care, and support for small businesses, noting that her approach would focus on practical solutions rooted in her personal experiences.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>While acknowledging that much had been accomplished under Biden, Harris was also clear that "there’s more to do" and that her leadership would bring a fresh perspective to ongoing challenges.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Conflict in IsraelAddressing a question on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Harris called the situation “unconscionable,” particularly the loss of innocent Palestinian lives.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She expressed hope that with the death of Hamas leader Sinmar, there was a chance to bring an end to the war and secure a two-state solution.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Harris advocated for peace efforts that ensure both Israel’s security and Palestinian dignity, saying, “We are now at a place where.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, and work toward a two-state solution.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”Harris acknowledged the strong emotions tied to this issue, but urged voters to consider the bigger picture, including the importance of democracy, practical governance, and personal freedoms.</p>
