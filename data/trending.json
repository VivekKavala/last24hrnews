        "text": "Kartik Aaryan is currently basking in the success of his recently released film Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3. The film has been performing well at the box office. It has crossed the Rs 100 cr mark, and fans are equally excited about it. Well, amid this, the team was seen celebrating the success. Kartik took to his social handle and shared a glimpse of his chill scenes with Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit.\nTaking to his Instagram handle, Kartik Aaryan dropped a photo in which he is seen having enjoyment with Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit. \u201c#AboutLastNight Chill scenes with my Manjus,\u201d read the caption. One of the fans wrote, \u201cYe toh ulta kr diya aapne Kartik sir dono Manjulika ko nhi choda\u201d. Another wrote, \u201cBorn to be besties, Forced to be rivals.\u201d\nTake a look here:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by KARTIK AARYAN (@kartikaaryan)\n\nThe movie had an impressive start, raking in Rs 35.5 crore on its opening day. The momentum picked up even more on Saturday with Rs 37 crore, though there was a slight dip on Sunday, with earnings of Rs 33.5 crore. Despite this minor drop, the film maintained strong occupancy, with a reported 37.45 percent Hindi occupancy on Monday, solidifying its position as a blockbuster.\nKartik Aaryan, who plays the beloved character Rooh Baba, seems thrilled by the overwhelming response. On Sunday, he surprised fans by making an appearance at Mumbai\u2019s iconic Gaiety Galaxy theatre, where he was greeted with roaring applause. Dressed in a casual checkered shirt, Kartik climbed onto his car and held up a \u201cHousefull\u201d sign, soaking in the love from his fans. Sharing the moment on Instagram, he wrote, \u201cH O U S E F U L L boards everywhere. I wanted to take it home as a souvenir but they said they need it again tomorrow!\u201d\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is the latest chapter in a franchise that began with Priyadarshan\u2019s 2007 hit Bhool Bhulaiyaa, which starred Akshay Kumar in the iconic role of a ghostbuster. Kartik first stepped into the franchise with Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 in 2022, a film that redefined horror-comedy and became a runaway hit. This time, the franchise brings back Vidya Balan as the infamous Manjulika after 17 years, adding even more excitement to the mix.\nWith Anees Bazmee once again at the helm, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is set to continue the franchise\u2019s legacy of blending horror with humour, while Kartik\u2019s Rooh Baba and Vidya\u2019s Manjulika promise an unforgettable showdown. Fans and critics alike are already calling it one of the best releases of the year, and the film\u2019s box office journey seems unstoppable as it heads into its first full week.",

        "text": "The CBSE will open a sub-regional office in Agartala amid outrage over the dismal performance of state-run schools affiliated to it in board examinations, an official said on Monday.\nAfter the BJP came to power in Tripura in 2018, 125 state-run schools were rechristened as Vidyajyoti Schools, and the CBSE\u2019s English-medium curriculum was introduced.\nThis year, while 61 per cent of students of these schools cleared the CBSE class 10 examinations, 59 per cent of students were successful in the class 12 exams.\nThe medium of education in these schools was earlier Bengali, and they used to function under the Tripura Board of Secondary Education (TBSE).\nThe state government will allocate suitable land for the CBSE office to strengthen educational infrastructure in the state, Education Department\u2019s Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Abhijit Samajpati said.\nThe office will operate temporarily from a building of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, he said.\nThe sub-regional office will provide various services to the CBSE-affiliated schools, including admission assistance, subject corrections, student record updates, exam centre coordination, mark sheet corrections, grievance redressal and teacher training facilitation, Samajpati said.\n\u201dIt will also work closely with state education bodies and other regional educational institutions to support smooth operations of the examination process and student development activities. This initiative will foster a stronger educational environment and expand learning opportunities for students throughout the state,\u201d he said.\nFollowing the poor results, the opposition has been alleging that the government was playing with the future of thousands of students, who studied in Bengali-medium schools till class 8 and were forced to appear in the board examinations in English, which resulted in the disaster.",

        "title": "US Elections 2024: Why Does New York's Ballot Paper Have Bengali But Not Hindi?",
        "text": "As Americans await the November 5 election day to elect their next president, New York\u2019s ballot paper has caught everyone\u2019s attention for a unique reason. New York has included the Bengali language on its 2024 presidential ballot this year. This move surprises many, as Hindi is also widely spoken by the Indian community.\nA large number of immigrants live in New York City, 66% of whom do not speak English as their first language. Asian Americans form a significant part of this demography.\nWith this in mind, Michael J Ryan, Executive Director of the New York City Board of Elections, decided to include languages like Chinese, Spanish, Korean and Bengali on the ballot to make voting easier for more people.\n\u201cBy including Asian languages, we are fulfilling our duty to make it easier for every voter to understand the voting process,\u201d Ryan said.\nData from the Asian American Federation reveals that Bengali is the second most spoken Asian language in New York. It is spoken by 12.2% of Asian New Yorkers, encompassing residents originally from both India and Bangladesh. In contrast, Hindi ranks sixth, spoken by 3.3% of the residents in New York. This prevalence led to Bengali being chosen to facilitate voting access for a larger segment of the community.\nThe inclusion of the Bengali language in New York\u2019s ballot is not just an amicable step, but there was also a legal requirement behind it. In the early 2010s, following a lawsuit over language access, New York had to provide voting assistance in at least one South Asian language. Bengali was chosen after negotiations because it had the largest number of speakers. Since then, the first Bengali ballot was made available in Queens in 2013.\nThe decision is in line with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which requires that language assistance should be provided to enable minority groups to fully participate in the electoral process.\nUnder this law, New York is required to provide not only ballots but other voting materials as well, in Bengali so that Bengali-speaking residents can participate in elections without language barriers.\nThe Bengali-speaking community in New York has warmly welcomed the move. Subhasesh, a Bengali-origin sales agent working in Times Square, expressed his happiness and said, \u201cIt will be easier for my father to vote in Queens. Many elders in our community feel more comfortable in their mother tongue. The Bengali ballot will help them a lot.\u201d\nDr Avinash Gupta, President of the Federation of Indian Associations, also considered it a positive step for the Indian community. He said, \u201cThis will encourage more Indians to vote and raise their voice. Political participation of the community is increasing, and this step supports them.\u201d",

This ancient tradition honours the Sun God and spans four days, during which devotees observe fasting from sunrise to sunset. The timings of Suryodaya (sunrise) and Suryast (sunset) are particularly important for those participating in the rituals.\nThe festivities begin with Nahay Khay, which occurs on the Chaturthi Tithi of Kartik Shukla Paksha. This is followed by Kharna on Panchami Tithi, Chhath Puja on Sashti, and concludes with Usha Arghya on Saptami Tithi. This year, Chhath Puja will be celebrated from November 5 to November 8.\nNahay Khay Date And Muhurat\n\nNahay Khay is on November 5.\nTimings: According to Drik Panchang, the sunrise is at 6:16 am, and sunset at 5:43 pm.\n\nNAHAY KHAY RITUALS\nOn the first day of Chhath Puja, devotees wake up early to worship Lord Surya before breaking their fast.

        "title": "What If The US Election Ends In A Trump-Harris Tie?",
        "text": "So what exactly happens if neither Kamala Harris or Donald Trump achieves the Electoral College majority required to win the US election?\nWhile not highly likely, such an outcome remains possible, tormenting Americans already perched painfully on the edge of their seats ahead of the November 5 election. Under the US system, it is not the national popular vote that decides who becomes president, but a 538-member \u201cElectoral College,\u201d in which each state gets as many \u201celectors\u201d as their representation in Congress.\nEvery state except Nebraska and Maine award all of their electors to whomever comes first in the state-wide popular vote. If both Harris and Trump fail to reach the majority threshold of 270 electors, the US Constitution says that Congress would play a deciding role. Specifically, the newly elected House of Representatives would select the president in January, while the Senate would designate the next vice president. Several possible scenarios could produce a 269-269 Electoral College split.\nOne example would occur if Democrat Harris prevails in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while the Republican former president carries Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina, plus a single left-leaning district in Nebraska.\n\u2013 200 years \u2013\nA tie would force a so-called contingent election in Congress \u2014 something which has never happened in modern American history. The last time a tie forced Congress to pick the president was in the 1800 election, which pitted Thomas Jefferson against incumbent president John Adams.\nLawmakers in a badly divided House struggled mightily to agree, finally selecting Jefferson on their 36th ballot. The excruciating muddle led to the adoption four years later of the 12th Amendment to the US Constitution, to somewhat clarify procedures around the election. This time, if such a House vote should be necessary, it would take place on January 6, 2025. How would that vote proceed?\n\u2013 One state, one vote \u2013\n\u201cEach state, regardless of population, casts a single vote for President in a contingent election,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). In other words, Republican-leaning Wyoming with its city-sized population of 500,000 would have the same influence as Democratic California, where 39 million people live.\nThough the US capital city Washington has three Electoral College votes, it would not get a vote in a contingent election, as it is not a state. States with two or more representatives would need to hold an internal vote to determine which candidate to support, a CRS report said.\nA candidate needs to win a majority of the 50 states, or 26 votes. At present, that would likely give Republicans the edge. Specific rules to govern the process would likely have to be adopted by the House, potentially leading to intense disagreements and a protracted period of constitutional crisis.\nIt is not hard to imagine how such a process, at the end of a razor-close campaign, would weigh on the already badly frayed nerves of American voters, many of whom are convinced that the vote has been rife with irregularities.",

For interest due above Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore, the CCIT rank officer will decide on the waiver/reduction, while PrCIT or Income Tax Commissioners can decide on interest due up to Rs 50 lakh.\nConditions for Waiver or Reduction\nThe power of reduction or waiver of the interest payable under Section 220(2A) would be subject to satisfaction of three specified conditions \u2014 payment of such amount has caused or would cause genuine hardship to the assessee; default in interest payment was due to circumstances beyond the control of the assessee; the assessee has cooperated in inquiry relating to assessment or proceeding of the recovery of any amount due from him.\nExpert Opinions\nNangia & Co LLP Partner Sachin Garg said, \u201cThis move of CBDT is expected to facilitate expeditious disposal of applications by a taxpayer for waiver or reduction of interest under section 220.

This year, it commences on November 5, with the first day observed as Nahay-Khay. This festival of devotion is dedicated to Surya Dev and his sister, Chhathi Maiyya, and is celebrated for the well-being and prosperity of children.\nOn the first day, people perform a ritual bath and begin their preparations for the festival.\nAstrologer and Vastu expert Rakesh Chaturvedi of Ghaziabad explains the rituals of Nahay-Khay and provides the auspicious timing for Arghya during Chhath.\nHe says the Chhath Mahaparv is celebrated from Chaturthi Tithi to Saptami Tithi of Shukla Paksha in the Kartik month. The festival begins with Nahay-Khay, followed by Kharna the next day. Arghya is offered to the setting sun on the Shashthi Tithi and to the rising sun on the Saptami Tithi, marking the festival\u2019s conclusion.\nDevotees observe a 36-hour fast without even water after Kharna Puja.\nSunrise-Sunset Timing For Nahay-Khay\nThe astrologer further added that all the auspicious timings for Chhath Puja depend on the sunrise and sunset. \u201cToday in Delhi, sunrise occurred at 6:36 am, and sunset is expected at 5:33 pm.
