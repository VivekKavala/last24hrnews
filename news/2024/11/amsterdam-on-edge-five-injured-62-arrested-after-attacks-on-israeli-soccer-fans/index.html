Amsterdam: Israeli fans and protesters clashed overnight after a soccer match in Amsterdam, leaving five people hospitalized and 62 arrested, police said Friday.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Dutch authorities said attackers systematically targeted Israeli fans.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

It was not clear how the violence began.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Dutch and Israeli leaders denounced the violence as antisemitic.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Video also showed Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans in the streets at some point.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema told reporters Friday that the Dutch counterterror watchdog said there was no concrete threat to Israeli soccer fans before the game.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Peter Holla, the city's acting police chief, said at the news conference that the fans were “willfully attacked.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>"

Condemnation of the violence poured in from Jewish groups.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Israel's foreign minister left on an urgent diplomatic trip to the Netherlands.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The Amsterdam police said in a post on social media platform X that they have started a major investigation into multiple violent incidents.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The post did not provide further details about those injured or detained in Thursday night’s violence following the Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Authorities said extra police would patrol Amsterdam in coming days, and security will be beefed up at Jewish institutions in the city that has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Earlier, a statement issued by the Dutch capital’s municipality, police and prosecution office said that the night “was very turbulent with several incidents of violence aimed at Maccabi supporters'' after antisemitic rioters “actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>''

It was not immediately clear when and where violence erupted after the match.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

“In several places in the city, supporters were attacked.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The police had to intervene several times, protect Israeli supporters and escort them to hotels.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Despite the massive police presence in the city, Israeli supporters have been injured,” the Amsterdam statement said.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

“This outburst of violence toward Israeli supporters is unacceptable and cannot be defended in any way.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There is no excuse for the antisemitic behavior exhibited last night,” it added.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The violence erupted despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the soccer stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who had feared that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli soccer club.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

There were also incidents involving fans ahead of the match.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Dutch broadcaster NOS reported that a Palestinian flag was ripped off a building in the center of the city and riot police blocked pro-Palestinian supporters trying to march toward the Johan Cruyff Arena stadium where the match was being played.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Israel initially ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the Israelis home, but later the prime minister's office said it would work on "providing civil aviation solutions for the return of our citizens.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>''

A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said that “the harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked," and that Netanyahu "views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>" He demanded that the Dutch government take “vigorous and swift action" against those involved.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Netanyahu's office added that he had called for increased security for the Jewish community in the Netherlands.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on X that he followed reports of the violence “with horror.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

“Completely unacceptable antisemitic attacks on Israelis.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> I am in close contact with everyone involved,” he added, saying that he had spoken to Netanyahu and “emphasized that the perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It is now quiet in the capital.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Security issues around hosting games against visiting Israeli teams led the Belgian soccer federation to decline to stage a men’s Nations League game in September.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> That game against Israel was played in Hungary with no fans in the stadium.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

The violence in Amsterdam will no doubt lead to a review of security at upcoming matches involving Israeli teams.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>

European soccer body UEFA announced already on Monday that Maccabi’s next Europa League match, scheduled in Istanbul on Nov.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 28 against Turkish team Besiktas, would be moved to a yet-to-be-decided neutral venue “following a decision by the Turkish authorities.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>”

Meanwhile, Israel’s national team is scheduled to play France in Paris next Thursday in the Nations League.</p>
