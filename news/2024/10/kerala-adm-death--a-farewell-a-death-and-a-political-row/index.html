The previous evening, the Revenue Staff Council had thrown a farewell party for Babu, 55.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He was to then leave Kannur and reach Pathanamthitta, his native district, nearly 400 km away, early on October 15 to take charge as ADM for the remaining seven months of his service.</p>

Shamsudeen says the drive to Pallikunnu was probably the longest and the most difficult in his 13 years as a driver.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He was filled with a sense of foreboding given the time of the call and the confidential assistant’s strange and urgent ask.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Ranjith was equally scared.</p>

A farewell that took an unexpected turn

On October 14, as people milled around and chatted with one another at Babu’s farewell, the District Panchayat President, P.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> She announced that she would have more to say on the subject in two days and walked out in a huff.</p>
