Addressing the villagers, he said a section of media and political parties have started propagating the financial disputes in his family to divert the attention of the people. \u201cThese kinds of issues are common in every household.

        "text": "Atlanta, Oct 24 (IANS) Early votes hit a record high in the US major battleground state of Georgia as a big proportion of voters have already made up their minds on key issues and who to vote for.\n\nAs many as 2.15 million, among 7.2 million active voters in total, have cast their ballots in the Peach State\u2019s early voting as of Wednesday, according to data issued by the Election Lab with the University of Florida as well as the Georgia Secretary of State, Xinhua reported.\n\nGeorgia also saw a record turnout of voters on the first day of early voting, which lasts from October 15 to November 1, shortly before the general election is held on November 5.\n\nThough voters\u2019 first priorities vary, especially between urban and rural people, the cost of living is seen as the most common concern in the voters\u2019 minds.\n\nSedrick Hamner, an African American from the College Park area in the southwest of Atlanta city, said that he cast his vote in support of the candidate who hopefully is going to promote democracy.\n\nStill, kitchen table issues such as inflation, taxes, prices of goods and wages are vitally important, said Hamner, a pastor who voted on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI used to be middle class, perhaps. Now, I\u2019m probably closer to the lower class just due to inflation,\u201d said Hamner, adding that the US dollar doesn\u2019t go as far as it used to go while wages have been stagnant.\n\nHe was not able to eat out or go travelling as much as he used to do due to the expenses, he said.\n\nNancy Goude, a voter from Molena, a town around 100 km south of Atlanta, told Xinhua on Wednesday that her change jars were not as full as a few years ago because she no longer has spare change. \u201cIt takes everything we have to survive,\u201d she said.\n\nGoude added she would like her grandchildren to have opportunities like she herself and her children had enjoyed. She said that everybody in her family has voted and she herself voted early this year.\n\nRomy Goldman, a resident from Buckhead, Atlanta, said that her main considerations were electing someone who\u2019s good for the country, and someone who believes in human rights and women\u2019s rights.\n\nGoldman told Xinhua that she had made her decision on who to vote for early on and had voted early so she could take part in volunteer work in this year\u2019s election cycle.\n\nGeorge Pilibosian, a retired businessman who voted on Tuesday inside Buckhead Library, said that people\u2019s rights to take care of their own bodies are important.\n\n\u201cThe government should not tell us what to do with our own bodies, whether you\u2019re a woman or a man,\u201d said Pilibosian.\n\nJohn Duncan, a retired painter from La Grange, a city which is about 112.6 km southwest of Atlanta, said the US priority should be to secure the border as people cannot go out and enjoy themselves as they could back in 2020.\n\nDuncan said that the new President should get the economy straightened out so that people can buy food for their families.\n\n\u201cI have a family of six. It costs me a good 120 (dollars) a day to feed my family. That\u2019s hard to do when you are retired,\u201d Duncan said.",

He will also meet the Prime Minister. There is no harm if Omar has put forth his demand for restoration of statehood. When Gagangir-type attacks stop only then can a final call be taken by the Centre on restoration of statehood to J&K.

Perhaps the timing of the attack at Gagangir was wrong for the terrorists otherwise there would have been casualties of hundreds of workers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that former Chief Minister and National Conference (NC) president Dr Farooq Abdullah has already condemned the incident, and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti has also condemned the attack though guardedly.\n\n\u201cThese incidents need the highest form of condemnation. These are attempts to destabilise the peace and the new government in J&K. Earlier such attacks were carried out in Kathua, Reasi, Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu division, where innocents were targeted and now it is Kashmir. Today also a non-local labourer was injured in Tral which again is highly condemnable,\u201d he said.\n\nReplying to a question whether there should be talks with Pakistan, Koul said no talks can be held with the neighbouring country unless it hands over militant commanders, including Syed Salahuddin to India. \u201cLet Pakistan hand over Salahuddin to India, only then talks can happen,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe BJP leader dismissed any future possibility of restoration of Article 370.

        "text": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu announced that the state will become the \u201cDrone Capital of India\u201d during the Amaravati Drone Summit 2024, held in Mangalagiri. As part of his vision to make Andhra Pradesh a leader in drone technology, Naidu revealed plans to allocate 300 acres of land in Orvakal, Kurnool District, for a dedicated drone hub. This initiative aims to make Andhra Pradesh the top destination for drone manufacturing, innovation, and research.In addition to developing the drone hub, Naidu also outlined an ambitious plan to train 35,000 drone pilots to meet the growing demand for skilled professionals in this industry. \u201cDrones will play a crucial role in agriculture, healthcare, traffic management, and even disaster relief,\u201d Naidu said, pointing to the use of drones during the recent floods in Vijayawada, where they delivered food and water to stranded people.During the two-day summit, Naidu promised that within 15 days, the state government would release a comprehensive drone policy designed to attract drone manufacturers and create a business-friendly environment for innovators. This policy will make Andhra Pradesh a testing ground for drone applications, with successful pilot projects set to expand across the state and the country.He assured that drones would be used extensively in police work for surveillance and monitoring, especially to keep an eye on criminal activities.Reflecting on his role in driving India\u2019s IT revolution in the 1990s, Naidu shared how his initiatives, such as launching Hyderabad's HiTech City through a public-private partnership, helped establish the city as a major technology hub. He credited his collaboration with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for opening up India\u2019s telecom sector, which paved the way for the country\u2019s mobile technology boom. \u201cBack then, we brought global tech giants like Microsoft to India, and now, we\u2019re doing the same with drones,\u201d Naidu said.The Chief Minister praised the current leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating, \u201cIndia is on track to becoming the third-largest economy by 2047 under Modi's leadership, and with initiatives like JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) and Ayushman Bharat, we\u2019ve strengthened the country\u2019s digital and healthcare infrastructure.\u201dPublished By: Deepthi Published On: Oct 24, 2024Trending Reel",

Andhra Pradesh Minister Nara Lokesh was quick to jump on this, and extended an \"invitation\" to all multinational companies (MNC) in Bengaluru to shift to his state.Nara Lokesh's response came to a tweet by Pai, also known to be a vocal critic of civic issues in Karnataka, in which he claimed that several MNCs in Bengaluru were being forced to consider expanding their operations out of the state capital due to severe infrastructure issues.He said the Karnataka Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister were not fulfilling their promises, leading to a fall in trust among Bengaluru residents.\"Never seen this kind of anger and pain in the last 20 years. Very sad at the misgovernance of the city. False promises, lack of action. Sad day for all of us to have such a non-performing, callous, indifferent govt which treats its own citizens so badly,\" Pai added. Responding to the tweet, Nara Lokesh said on Thursday that he \"would like to extend an invitation to all MNCs to Andhra Pradesh\", where Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has introduced new, business-friendly policies.\"We view industries as vital stakeholders in our state\u2019s welfare and growth. We are ready to offer world-class infrastructure and an exceptional business ecosystem, ensuring both ease and speed of doing business,\" he tweeted. Record-breaking rain in Bengaluru due to the unprecedented has led to flooding in tech parks, forcing companies to adopt work-from-home policies. The heavy downpour has also led to severe traffic jams and water entering offices and homes.In an effort to tackle Bengaluru's infrastructure issues, the Karnataka government on Wednesday announced the formation of a high-level committee to provide long-term solutions to the flooding and traffic issues plaguing the city\u2019s tech hubs.The committee will be chaired by Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar and vice-chaired by state Minister Priyank Kharge.On Wednesday night, thousands of commuters were forced to abandon their vehicles on the Electronic City flyover in Bengaluru due to a massive traffic jam caused by heavy flooding.After being stuck for more than three hours, the commuters chose to walk home. A video doing the rounds on social media captured the chaos, showing people getting off their vehicles and walking.Published By: Karishma Saurabh KalitaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024",

The prosecution had alleged that the accused had instigated the survivor, a student of class seven, to accompany him to Ooty, where he subsequently raped her. The accused was arrested after the girl\u2019s family traced her to Ooty and reported her missing. The Sessions Court, in 2016, convicted him under Section 376 IPC, sentencing him to seven years imprisonment. This decision was challenged by the accused before the High Court.\nThe court, presided over by Justice CS Sudha, clarified that the court in no way justifies the act committed by the accused, however, considering the circumstances of the case, it stated that \u201cIn criminal jurisprudence the concept of punishment has evolved from a retributive approach to a reformative approach. The facts and circumstances of the case call for a lenient approach to be taken against A1 (accused), who was just 19 years old at the time of the incident.\u201d\nDuring the trial, it was also revealed that the survivor had admitted to voluntarily accompanying the accused to Ooty with the intention of getting married, despite her father\u2019s opposition to the relationship. The trial court had acquitted the accused under Section 366A IPC, finding no evidence of compulsion or deceit. The High Court, therefore, noted, \u201cThis is not a case where A1, by deceit or fraud, enticed PW2 out of her lawful guardianship.\u201d\nHowever, the court reiterated that the survivor\u2019s age rendered her consent invalid, citing that she was a minor at the time of the incident. The court observed that the survivor, who had turned 17 by the time of her examination before the trial court, had sent letters to the accused expressing her continued desire to be with him. \u201cThere is no case for PW2 that she was forced or seduced into having illicit intercourse with another person. Her testimony shows that she had voluntarily joined A1,\u201d the court remarked.\nThe court invoked the proviso to Section 376(1) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which, prior to its amendment in 2013, allowed courts to impose a lesser sentence than the prescribed minimum of seven years if there were \u201cadequate and special reasons,\u201d highlighting that \u201cThe legislature itself contemplated such a situation and hence the reason why such a proviso was brought into the statute despite a minimum sentence of seven years being prescribed.\u201d\nReferencing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Sukhwinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2000), where it was established that when the survivor herself is a consenting party, proviso to Section 376 of IPC cannot be overlooked. The High Court concluded that \u201cfacts and circumstances of the case made out an adequate and special reason to invoke the proviso,\u201d particularly given the age of the accused and his expression of remorse.\nAs a result, the court modified the sentence imposed by the trial court and reduced it to a period of simple imprisonment for one year.",

He then capitalised on width from Bumrah\u2019s deliveries by punching off the backfoot and opening the face of the bat late to get back-to-back boundaries.\r\n\r\nFrom the other end, Rachin Ravindra began to find his groove by using Bumrah\u2019s pace to run through the gap between slip and gully for four. Conway continued to be impressive with his drive and reverse sweeps, before poking at a short on a spinning away ball from Ashwin, with the edge caught by Rishabh Pant.\r\n\r\nRavindra took over the run-scoring mantle by lofting Ravindra Jadeja for six, before beautifully flicking Akash Deep for four more. After getting his fifty with a stylish flick going through the hands of short mid-wicket for four, Ravindra had two more boundaries coming off Akash via cut and outside edge.\r\n\r\nThe 59-run stand for the fourth wicket between Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell was brought to a halt by Washington, who turned the tide for India at the fag end of the second session with his dip and drift. Washington got a tossed-up delivery to turn away sharply from the middle stump and hit the top of the off-stump.\r\n\r\nOn outclassing Ravindra with a peach of a delivery, Washington leapt highly in the air. At the stroke of tea, Washington again brought joy to himself and the Indian team by getting a length ball to grip and turn sharply into Tom Blundell, who aimed for a flick but was castled through the gate. Big wickets from Washington in the last 10 minutes of the second session mean India have set themselves a chance to bowl out New Zealand in the final period of the day.\r\n\r\nBrief scores: New Zealand 201/5 in 62 overs (Devon Conway 76, Rachin Ravindra 66; Ravichandran Ashwin 3-48, Washington Sundar 2-34) against India.",

        "text": "Lucknow, Oct 24 (KNN) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced on Wednesday that the state\u2019s economy is set to reach Rs 32 lakh crore by March 2025, positioning it as a vital contributor to India\u2019s USD 5 trillion economy goal.\n\nSpeaking at a function organised by Business Standard, the Chief Minister emphasised that UP's economy, currently at Rs 26 lakh crore, has seen unprecedented growth from Rs 12 lakh crore during previous administrations.\n\nCalling Uttar Pradesh the \u201cfastest-growing economy,\u201d Adityanath projected the creation of employment for 1.5 crore youth through investments and policy reforms. \u201cToday, we have received investment proposals worth Rs 40 lakh crore, compared to the earlier achievement threshold of Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis transformation is due to robust economic policies and strict action against criminal elements,\u201d he stated, crediting the state's crackdown on land mafia and improved law enforcement.\n\nAdityanath highlighted the \"One District, One Product\" (ODOP) initiative, which replaced what he referred to as the previous \u201cOne District, One Mafia\u201d policy. He added that 75 districts have secured 75 Geographical Indication (GI) tags, with Varanasi leading the effort.\n\nKey economic hubs like Moradabad, Bhadohi, and Meerut were cited for their export success. \u201cMoradabad now exports goods worth Rs 16,000 crore, while Bhadohi's carpets have touched Rs 8,000 crore in exports,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Chief Minister also underscored the government\u2019s initiatives to develop UP as a logistics hub. He mentioned the operational multimodal terminal in Varanasi, a logistics hub planned in Gautam Buddha Nagar, and significant expressway projects.\n\n\u201cWe have completed the Purvanchal and Bundelkhand Expressways, and the Ganga Expressway\u2019s main carriageway will be ready by year-end,\u201d he said. Other infrastructure developments include the Delhi-Meerut 12-lane expressway and metro rail projects in six cities.\n\nOn the security front, Adityanath highlighted reforms within the police force, with 1.54 lakh personnel recruited and advanced technologies integrated.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s law enforcement is now equipped to instill fear in wrongdoers, unlike earlier times when criminals had police backing,\u201d he remarked. The creation of the Anti-Land Mafia Task Force has reclaimed 64,000 acres of illegally occupied land.\n\nHe concluded by linking commerce, agriculture, and business growth, drawing on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, and praised central initiatives like the Vishwakarma Yojana for complementing the state\u2019s ODOP scheme in generating employment and attracting investments.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

It also has the MNS headquarters. \n\nThe iconic Shivaji Park ground is also located in nearby Dadar where both the MNS and Sena (UBT) hold their annual Padwa and Dussehra rallies, respectively. \n\nThe constituency has always been with the undivided Shiv Sena or the MNS since 1990. \n\nIn 2009, MNS candidate Nitin Sardesai won from Mahim. \n\nElections to the 288-member State Assembly will be held on November 20 and votes will be counted on November 23.",

Meta\u2019s generative AI, including its open-source Llama technology, will support the development of e-governance solutions to streamline processes, improve transparency, and reduce document tampering risks.Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh emphasised that this collaboration aligns with the state's vision of making governance user-friendly and accessible to all. Meta India\u2019s Vice President Sandhya Devanathan added that the partnership will democratise access to AI models and facilitate smoother governance through digital innovations.This MoU is part of Andhra Pradesh\u2019s larger digital transformation initiative, aiming to provide 100 key government services through WhatsApp by November 2024. The collaboration hopes to improve public services across multiple domains, including land records, civil supplies, education, and transportation, benefiting millions of citizens.This comes only a few days after Nara Lokesh announced that, within the next 100 days, the state will implement a \u2018digital twin\u2019 for every cabinet minister.

The two-term former US president who has visited India twice before, had also mentioned how Mahatma Gandhi has inspired him and that his fascination with India has also largely been around the Independence icon, his writings, and how his thoughts resonated Obama\u2019s deepest instincts as well.\nIn his book A Promised Land, Obama speaks of Gandhi and how his \u201csuccessful non-violent campaign against British rule became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups\u201d.\nKarnataka minister of law HK Patil said that this special invitation is expected to be sent soon and the state government is hopeful that Obama, who called Mahatma Gandhi the leader of the world, will accept it.\n\u201cThe CM will be writing to Obama this week and the former President\u2019s office has already been informed previously of the Karnataka government\u2019s wish to extend this invitation to him,\u201d confirmed a source in the chief minister\u2019s office.\nThis special celebration was announced by Siddaramaiah in the Budget 2024-25 and an allocation of Rs 2 crore has been set aside for it.\nThe centenary event in Belagavi commemorates Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s leadership at the 39th session of the Indian National Congress in 1924, the only time he presided over a Congress session. It was during this session that Gandhi laid out the strategy for India\u2019s independence from British rule.\nThe session, held from December 26-28, 1924, was organised under the leadership of Gangadhar Rao Deshpande, known as the Lion of Karnataka. Gandhi emphasised non-violence, non-cooperation, satyagraha, and civil disobedience as the key strategies for achieving independence.\nThe event in 1924 was held in an open field on the outskirts of Belagavi, now called Congress Road, and saw over 75,000 participants from across India who landed in this border area between Karnataka and Goa to pledge their unity against the British Raj.\nThe session saw stalwarts of the Indian freedom movement such as Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Morarji Desai, C Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya among others in attendance.\nAs part of the centenary celebrations, minister Patil outlined plans for a series of events, including a photo exhibition, a year-long display of historical artefacts, the installation of a memorial pillar, and several other commemorative programmes.\nPatil also emphasised that the focus will be on rural development and Gandhian Swaraj principles. The celebrations will also feature a comprehensive documentary on the 1924 Congress session, discounts on khadi clothing, the publication and distribution of a mini booklet to raise public awareness, and a photographic exhibition from the historic session. Additionally, a group of Gandhians is organising a Charkha Marathon as part of the celebrations.",

        "text": "Colombo, Oct 24 (IANS) Sri Lankan Foreign and Public Security Minister Vijitha Herath revealed on Thursday that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the security threats to Israeli nationals in the Arugam Bay area of the island nation\u2019s Eastern Province.\n\nThe action follows after several countries have issued travel alerts over the past 24 hours considering intelligence information received about a possible terror attack targeting foreigners, especially Israelis, across popular tourist locations in coastal Sri Lanka.\n\nSome reports cited that the intelligence has been provided by India, like it was also reportedly done before the horrific 2019 Easter Sunday bombings which the Lankan security agencies had failed to act on in time.\n\nThe suspects, all Sri Lankan nationals, caught on Thursday are currently being questioned regarding the incident, Herath said at a special media briefing.\n\n\u201cMinister Herath said Sri Lankan authorities received intelligence information from foreign intelligence services about a potential attack on Israeli nationals earlier this month. He said that similar information had also been received by the authorities during the previous government,\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s Daily Mirror reported.\n\nHe asserted that the new government didn\u2019t inform the public until the information was confirmed, but took security measures as soon as the information was received.\n\nHerath also urged the public not to fall victim to misleading reports and assured that comprehensive security measures are in place to protect tourists.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States issued a security alert, strongly advising US citizens of a potential attack on tourist locations in a coastal area of Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cThe Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area. Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice. US citizens are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice,\u201d stated the US Embassy in Colombo.\n\nSimilarly, Israel\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) called on Israeli citizens to immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe NSC said that it has raised the travel alert level for Sri Lanka due to \u201ccredible terrorism threats\u201d at the tourist and coastal areas.\n\n\u201cThe travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4. We recommend leaving these areas immediately. For those currently in these areas, we recommend leaving the country or at least traveling to the capital city Colombo, where there is a heavier presence of local security forces,\u201d the NSC alert detailed.\n\n\u201cFor the rest of Sri Lanka, the travel warning has been raised to level 3, and we recommend that Israelis planning to travel to Sri Lanka delay any non-necessary trips to the country. If you do travel to Sri Lanka, avoid the areas for which level-4 travel alerts have been issued,\u201d it added.\n\nAustralia too asked its citizens in Sri Lanka to \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and tourists, including in regional and coastal towns. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions,\u201d it mentioned.\n\nLankan Daily \u2018The Daily Mirror\u2019 revealed that a building in Arugam Bay, which had been converted into a \u2018Chabad House\u2019 by the Israeli nationals could have been a potential target.\n\n\u201cThe elite STF officers had taken control of the security situation and continue to be stationed to date. It was learnt that STF had also kept bomb squads standby for any emergency,\u201d it reported on Wednesday.\n\nSri Lanka remains on high alert even as it continues to investigate the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks carried out by the ISIS-backed suicide bombers that killed 270 people, including 45 foreign nationals and injured over 500.\n\nIn June, former Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe had appointed a Committee of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the actions taken by Lankan intelligence services on the prior information received from their Indian counterparts regarding the Easter Sunday bombings.\n\nWeeks before the coordinated bomb attacks on three churches and several hotels, the Indian intelligence agencies had reportedly alerted their Lankan counterparts about the Islamic State\u2019s plan to carry out such suicide missions.\n\nLast month, the country\u2019s newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had promised to thoroughly investigate the entire episode.",

Operating from the DEO office in Vadodara, the committee oversees fee-related decisions for private schools in seven districts: Vadodara, Anand, Kheda, Dahod, Mahisagar, Panchmahal, and Chhota Udepur. \n\nHowever, the Vadodara Parents\u2019 Association allegations previously claimed that the FRC has been lax in enforcing fee regulations.\n\nIn its recent decision, the FRC approved a 5 per cent increase for 76 schools, which has sparked optimism among school operators still in line for similar fee hikes. \n\nThe approvals are broken down as follows: 25 schools in Vadodara, 0 in Anand, 12 in Kheda, 6 in Dahod, 7 in Mahisagar, 24 in Panchmahal, and 2 in Chhota Udepur, highlighting Vadodara\u2019s position as having the most private schools awaiting fee hike approvals.\n\nLooking ahead, sources indicate that once the provisional fees are determined, school administrators can file appeals before the final fee structure is confirmed. It is common for schools to request increases greater than 5 per cent, leaving it to be seen which institutions will proceed with appeals in the coming days.\n\nGujarat has over 32,000 government primary schools, alongside the establishment of 84 model schools aimed at enhancing educational quality in the state. As of December 2023, only one teacher was staffed 1,606 of these government primary schools. \n\nIn response to the ongoing teacher shortage, the Gujarat government has implemented various measures, including appointing contractual teachers and organising teacher transfer camps to allocate teaching resources better.\n\nInitiated in 2014, the model schools in Gujarat aim to provide high-quality education within the government school system. Currently, 84 model schools across the state cater to upper primary, secondary, and higher secondary classes.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Nearly 93 per cent respondents in a survey have favoured making public spaces completely smoke-free while 97 per cent have pitched for declaring airports completely smoke-free, similar to railway stations. A recent poll conducted by the citizen-led initiative \"Tobacco Free India\", which garnered more than 65,000 responses, highlights the growing concern among Indians about the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.The survey has revealed that an astounding 92.72 per cent respondents are in favour of making public spaces completely smoke-free. Conducted in both Hindi and English, the poll included six key questions about smoke-free public places and the health risks associated with second-hand smoke. Across all questions, the majority supported stricter measures to protect women, children and other vulnerable groups from exposure to toxic tobacco smoke in public areas, such as restaurants, hotels and airports.\"While the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003 bans smoking in public places, it still permits designated smoking areas in airports, hotels with 30 or more rooms and restaurants with seating capacities above 30,\" said Dr Uma Kumar, head of the rheumatology department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here.\"This situation continues to pose a significant public health threat. Scientific evidence has unequivocally demonstrated that second-hand smoke can easily penetrate these designated areas, exposing non-smokers to harmful toxins and increasing their risk of various diseases,\" she said.The poll was conducted between October 2 and October 19 on X, involving 65,272 participants. While India has made significant strides in tobacco control -- strictly prohibiting smoking on trains, platforms and station premises as well as banning carrying or sale of tobacco products in railway campuses -- the continued presence of smoking areas in airports remains a concern, said international wrestler Sangram Singh.\"These designated areas, often placed in prominent and attractive locations, seem to invite people to smoke. The presence of smoking zones in places like airports often sends an inviting message to smoke, undermining public health efforts,\" emphasised Singh, a \"Fit India\" brand ambassador.\"The overwhelming support for smoke-free public places demonstrates a growing awareness among Indians about the dangers of second-hand smoke. It is a powerful message that reflects our nation's commitment to protecting public health,\" Kumar said.Dr Colonel Shekhar Kashyap, a renowned cardiologist, said, \"Nicotine is a highly-dangerous and addictive substance that poses serious risks to cardiovascular health and overall well-being. Consumed first hand or second hand, nicotine is equally harmful and can lead to a range of debilitating diseases.\"Launched on October 2, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of India's smoke-free rules, the poll comes at a pivotal time. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has proposed amendments to the COTPA to remove smoking zones altogether -- a move strongly supported by the public, as evidenced by the poll results.These efforts align with the ministry's ongoing countrywide Tobacco-Free Youth Campaign 2.0, which aims at protecting young Indians from the hazards of tobacco. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 13 lakh Indians die each year due to tobacco-related diseases, making it a major public health crisis.The poll also highlighted the particular vulnerability of women and children to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Many respondents expressed concern about the impact of smoke-free environments on the health and well-being of these vulnerable groups.Second-hand smoke imposes a significant economic burden on India. A recent study published in the Journal of Nicotine and Tobacco Research revealed that second-hand smoke causes healthcare costs of Rs 567 billion annually, accounting for 8 per cent of total annual healthcare expenditures.This figure, coupled with the staggering Rs 1,773.4 billion in annual economic losses due to tobacco use, underscores the urgent need for effective tobacco-control measures, including comprehensive smoke-free policies. Beyond cigarette smoking, the use of smokeless tobacco products remains a significant public health challenge in India. These products, which include chewing tobacco, gutkha and pan masala, pose serious health risks and contribute to a range of diseases, including oral cancer, heart diseases and digestive disorders.",

        "title": "Opinion: India At BRICS And The Curious Case Of Iran",
        "text": "All eyes have been on Iran for more than a year. Naturally, the first BRICS summit with Tehran's membership is bound to breed speculation about what the prospective new world order would look like. At home, there needs to be an examination of India's bilateral ties with a country that is seen firmly anti-West in its outlook. \n\nIran and India are sailing in the same boat, at least momentarily: of the West's castigation. The temptation may be high on both sides to form a joint front against Western hegemony in the security space. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held bilateral talks with the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, with a focus on strategic cooperation in and beyond the Middle East.\n\nGlobal Groupings vs Realpolitik\n\nIt can be endlessly debated without inching anywhere close to a resolution whether multilateral global groupings make any difference to realpolitik either domestically or internationally. The signalling, however, remains crucial. To begin with, the West is already perceiving the summit as Russia's show of strength. Headlines like 'Putin Gathers Allies' and 'Putin Hosts Global South Leaders at BRICS Summit Meant to Counterbalance Western Clout' in Western media outlets expose apprehension. \n\nA complex interplay of sectarian interests and regional dynamics shapes Iran's geopolitical strategy. It is in the direct line of fire, thanks to Israel's unchecked belligerence. Already reeling under economic pressure owing to the UN sanctions of 2011, the post-October 7 reality for Tehran is even grimmer. Iran blames the US for almost all of its problems. As such, during the last summit, former president Ebrahim Raisi had anointed Iran's proposed BRICS membership as one of the ways of getting even with the US and the West at large. \u201cIran's membership in the bloc is opposition to American unilateralism.\u201d\n\nIndia Needs To Defines Its Position\n\nRussia and China share this sentiment of BRICS emerging as a counterbalance to the West. But what about India? India has lauded and endorsed Iran's presence in BRICS, but will New Delhi also endorse Tehran's oppressive domestic policies in the name of this cooperative alliance? \n\nIndia has not stopped buying oil from Iran despite the sanctions and disapproving remarks from the West. Yet, bilateral trade between the two countries has dropped by 26% in one year. Geoeconomics informs Iranian perceptions of the bloc as a critical driver. Iran aims to secure increased volumes of oil and non-oil exports to fellow BRICS members, bypassing the dollar. \n\nLike Russia, Iran is engaged in a high-stakes battle with the West. China doesn't particularly enjoy a friendly status, either. New Delhi's balancing act, therefore, is set to be tested on many tricky issues in the near future, including the Israel-Palestine issue. \n\nIndia has been an outlier in a manner. At the last UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for the end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, India was the only founding BRICS country to abstain, along with the newcomer Ethiopia. \n\nDuring the Modi-Pezeshkian bilateral, India was urged to play a more substantial role in the Middle East peace process. But what are New Delhi's realistic options? Calling for peace does not usher in peace; arm-twisting the stakeholders does. \n\nA Sticky Question For New Delhi\n\nAny BRICS decision mandates unanimous agreement. In that sense, it is even trickier than the domestic coalition politics that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has found itself in the midst of after a decade. What will, for example, be India's stand should Iran want a revival of its nuclear plan? India's past tussles with the West over its own nuclear programme may trigger another round of strategic unpleasantness over New Delhi's stance.\n\nIndia has a long-standing policy of strategic autonomy, and the complexity of its relations with the West is par for the course. The question is only of degree. The scope of India's support to its alliance partners in any overtures, real or perceived, against the West needs to be clearly defined, if not announced. While BRICS has achieved precious little in tangible terms in the past 15 years, the symbolism of grouping may have consequences for India as ongoing conflicts stretch into the future and new challenges around them emerge.\n\nOn the other hand, the internal dynamics of the expanded BRICS are going to pose another challenge. BRICS, only a little more than an ad hoc grouping with diverse challenges and interests, has miles to go to emerge as a counterforce to alliances like the G7 or the Five Eyes, where members have been able to thrash out at least a common minimum programme. \n\n(Nishtha Gautam is a Delhi-based author and academic.)\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author",

        "text": "Colombo: Sri Lankan Foreign and Public Security Minister Vijitha Herath revealed on Thursday that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the security threats to Israeli nationals in the Arugam Bay area of the island nation's Eastern Province.\r\n\r\nThe action follows after several countries have issued travel alerts over the past 24 hours considering intelligence information received about a possible terror attack targeting foreigners, especially Israelis, across popular tourist locations in coastal Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nSome reports cited that the intelligence has been provided by India, like it was also reportedly done before the horrific 2019 Easter Sunday bombings which the Lankan security agencies had failed to act on in time.\r\n\r\nThe suspects, all Sri Lankan nationals, caught on Thursday are currently being questioned regarding the incident, Herath said at a special media briefing.\r\n\r\n\"Minister Herath said Sri Lankan authorities received intelligence information from foreign intelligence services about a potential attack on Israeli nationals earlier this month. He said that similar information had also been received by the authorities during the previous government,\" Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror reported.\r\n\r\nHe asserted that the new government didn't inform the public until the information was confirmed, but took security measures as soon as the information was received.\r\n\r\nHerath also urged the public not to fall victim to misleading reports and assured that comprehensive security measures are in place to protect tourists.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the United States issued a security alert, strongly advising US citizens of a potential attack on tourist locations in a coastal area of Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\n\"The Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area. Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice. US citizens are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice,\" stated the US Embassy in Colombo.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Israel's National Security Council (NSC) called on Israeli citizens to immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nThe NSC said that it has raised the travel alert level for Sri Lanka due to \"credible terrorism threats\" at the tourist and coastal areas.\r\n\r\n\"The travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4. We recommend leaving these areas immediately. For those currently in these areas, we recommend leaving the country or at least traveling to the capital city Colombo, where there is a heavier presence of local security forces,\" the NSC alert detailed.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest of Sri Lanka, the travel warning has been raised to level 3, and we recommend that Israelis planning to travel to Sri Lanka delay any non-necessary trips to the country. If you do travel to Sri Lanka, avoid the areas for which level-4 travel alerts have been issued,\" it added.\r\n\r\nAustralia too asked its citizens in Sri Lanka to \"exercise a high degree of caution\".\r\n\r\n\"There is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and tourists, including in regional and coastal towns. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions,\" it mentioned.\r\n\r\nLankan Daily 'The Daily Mirror' revealed that a building in Arugam Bay, which had been converted into a 'Chabad House' by the Israeli nationals could have been a potential target.\r\n\r\n\"The elite STF officers had taken control of the security situation and continue to be stationed to date. It was learnt that STF had also kept bomb squads standby for any emergency,\" it reported on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nSri Lanka remains on high alert even as it continues to investigate the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks carried out by the ISIS-backed suicide bombers that killed 270 people, including 45 foreign nationals and injured over 500.\r\n\r\nIn June, former Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe had appointed a Committee of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the actions taken by Lankan intelligence services on the prior information received from their Indian counterparts regarding the Easter Sunday bombings.\r\n\r\nWeeks before the coordinated bomb attacks on three churches and several hotels, the Indian intelligence agencies had reportedly alerted their Lankan counterparts about the Islamic State's plan to carry out such suicide missions.\r\n\r\nLast month, the country's newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had promised to thoroughly investigate the entire episode.",

This JCW version is based on the same Cooper that was launched in India earlier this year in July. The British brand also revealed the JCW Electric with 258 hp and the JCW Aceman at the Paris Motor Show, which took place a few weeks ago.\n\nMechanical Updates\n\nThe petrol-powered JCW versions are equipped with the same potent 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder turbo petrol engine that delivers 228 hp and 380 Nm of peak torque. This offers 27 hp more power and 80 Nm higher torque than the Cooper S sold in India. All this power is sent to the front wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nThe John Cooper Works claims a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 6.1 seconds for the hatchback, while the heavier convertible variant achieves it in 6.4 seconds. The top speed for the hatchback is rated at 250 km/h, with the convertible capable of 245 km/h.\n\nVisual Updates\n\nCosmetic updates to the Mini John Cooper Works include JCW badging on the grille, centrally mounted exhaust unit, a blacked-out rear diffuser, JCW-branded red brake callipers, and 17-inch JCW alloy wheels. There are also optional 18-inch two-tone spoke alloy wheels available.\n\nThe interior features black synthetic leather upholstery with knitted red accents. The dashboard has a knitted surface with a chequered flag pattern. The pedals are finished in stainless steel, and the steering wheel features JCW branding with bespoke fabric trim.\n\nIt is priced between Rs 42.43 lakh and Rs 49.5 lakh (converted from Euro) in Europe.

Nataraj, representing the UP government, said that demolition was carried out to remove encroachments on footpaths and the plea was filed by a third-party organisation on the basis of newspaper reports.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in an interim order passed on September 17, directed that no demolition will take place anywhere across the country except without its permission after several petitions were filed before the apex court alleging that bulldozer action was taken by various state authorities without sufficient notice. However, the top court clarified that its \u201corder would not be applicable if there is an unauthorised structure in any public place such as road, street, footpath, abutting railway line or any river body or water bodies and also to cases where there is an order for demolition made by a court\u201d.\n\nLast week, the top court refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking direction to recover from administrative authorities the costs of bulldozed houses of individuals accused of criminal activities, riots, or other offences.

He emphasised that agreements, once reached, should be followed to the letter. \u201cPrime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception,\u201d Jaishankar said.The minister\u2019s remark comes just days after India and China made a major breakthrough over the border row and reached an agreement to end a four-year-long military standoff in eastern Ladakh. The deal marks a return to patrolling agreements that were in place before the 2020 Galwan clash. The disengagement agreement came after 17 rounds of working mechanism meetings and 21 rounds of military dialogue. The agreement also set the stage for the first bilateral talks between PM Modi and China\u2019s Xi Jinping in five years. PM Modi welcomed the border agreement and said that India-China ties were important for global peace and stability. \u201cMutual trust, respect and sensitivity will guide bilateral relations,\u201d PM Modi said during the delegation-level talks on the sidelines of Brics Summit.At the Brics Summit, PM Modi reiterated India's stance on resolving global conflicts, emphasising that this is not an era of war. The Prime Minister\u2019s peace message came at a time when Russia is at war with Ukraine while Isreal has declared war on Hamas and is in conflict with Iran-backed proxies. Addressing the Brics Outreach session, Jaishankar stressed that there should be zero tolerance for terrorism. He also discussed the escalating situation in West Asia and expressed concern over the potential for the conflict to spread further in the region. \u201cThe situation in the Middle East, West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected. The human and material consequences of further escalation are truly serious. Any approach has to be fair and durable, leading to a two-state solution,\" Jaishankar said.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024Tune InMust Watch",

        "title": "Ahead Of UP Bypolls, Akhilesh Posts Pic With Rahul: 'Will Save Constitution, Reservation, Harmony'",
        "text": "A day after facing flak over its defeat in the Haryana elections - a loss partly attributed to not sharing seats with its state allies - Congress has decided not to contest any of the nine Uttar Pradesh Assembly bypolls scheduled for next month.The party had initially requested to contest at least five seats, including Milkipur in Ayodhya district, which it hasnt won since 1989.Instead, the Samajwadi Party (SP), a member of the Congress-led INDIA bloc, will field candidates for all nine seats, with each candidate standing against the ruling BJP as INDIA bloc nominees.We have decided to save the Constitution... reservation... and harmony. We have decided to build the country as envisioned by Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi) - Babasaheb (Ambedkar) - Lohia (Ram Manohar, an iconic freedom fighter and socialist leader), Akhilesh Yadav posted on X.In his Hindi post, the former UP Chief Minister also shared a photograph of himself standing alongside Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, their hands clasped and raised in victory.Yadav said that the alliance was not based on seat-sharing calculations but on the necessity of cutting into BJPs lead in the UP Assembly.With this unprecedented cooperation, every worker of the INDIA bloc is filled with new energy and the resolve to win all nine Assembly seats, he said.SP-Congress AgreementNews of this Congress-SP alliance followed a prolonged disagreement between the two parties, as the Congress was reportedly pushing to contest at least five seats, while the SP was hesitant to concede more than two, given Congress poor performance in recent Assembly and general elections in the state.In the 2022 Assembly elections, the BJP won 255 seats, while the Samajwadi Party secured 111.The Congress only managed to win two seats - Rampur Khas and Pharenda.The SP also won in the April-June general election in the state, taking 37 of the 80 seats, with the BJP winning 33 and the Congress reclaiming six, including their traditional stronghold of Amethi from Smriti Irani.The Congress position was further weakened after the Haryana and Jammu Kashmir election results, where the party faced criticism from its INDIA bloc partners for failing to cooperate with the SP in Haryana. A day after the election results, the SP announced candidates for six of the nine seats, effectively denying the Congress its request for five.Congress Strategy in Maharashtra?According to sources, standing down in Uttar Pradesh was not what the Congress wanted, but the backlash after the Haryana defeat left the party with limited options.There are suggestions that by conceding in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress could be positioning itself strategically to resist the Samajwadi Partys demand for 12 seats in the upcoming Maharashtra elections.The Congress, reluctant to oblige the SP in Maharashtra, believes that allowing the SP to dominate in Uttar Pradesh could strengthen its argument against conceding seats in Maharashtra, particularly since the Congress performed well there in the general elections, winning 13 seats to become the largest single party.In Maharashtra, the Congress has now reached a seat-sharing agreement with the Shiv Sena and NCP factions led by Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Each party will contest 85 seats.The remaining 33 seats will be allocated to smaller parties, with the SP expected to be among them.Symbol Not Important: CongressSurendra Rajput, a senior Congress leader, told ANI that the decision to step aside in Uttar Pradesh was driven by the need to defeat the BJP.INDIA is contesting all nine seats. For us, the symbol is not important... for us, ending the BJPs misgovernance is important... he said.He also referenced Akhilesh Yadavs big-heartedness in Haryana - a nod to the SP leader not, at least publicly, pressing for a seat-sharing deal in that election.Yadav rounded off the joint appeal by saying that his partys strength had increased manifold with the support of the Congress top leadership and booth-level workers.BJPs ResponseRakesh Tripathi, a spokesperson for the BJPs state unit, claimed that the Samajwadi Party was exacting revenge for the Haryana and Madhya Pradesh elections, where the Congress ignored its allys requests for seat-sharing; the Congress was soundly defeated by the BJP in both states.Tripathi also used a wrestling analogy, saying the Congress had been thrown and pinned to the mat.He further claimed that the INDIA alliance has been broken into pieces and that the SP is making the BJPs Congress-mukt Bharat (Congress-free India) slogan a reality.Uttar Pradesh By-election DatesVoting for the nine by-elections will take place on 13 November, with the results announced on 23 November.A by-election for a tenth seat - Milkipur in Ayodhya district - will be held at a later date.",

They made Congress candidate Rahul Gandhi win the elections first. Then, for 5 years he didn\u2019t do any work for the people. Despite that, he won again but he (Rahul Gandhi) left them.

Sadly, that opportunity was not afforded to me, leaving both my children and me completely blindsided by this announcement.

Medical University in Chennai. A total of 35,793 candidates, both in-person and in-absentia, were awarded post-doctoral, doctoral, postgraduate, undergraduate degrees and diplomas under the faculties of medical, dental, AYUSH, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and allied health science courses. \n\nSpeaking at the function, Vivek Lal, Director, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, stressed the importance of commitment in medical practice. \u201cThis degree is the result of a big asset that all of you have. That is the commitment. It comes before equipment. Medicine is all about committed healthcare professionals. Equipment and technology do play a part. But if you want to exploit technology, you have to be committed.\u201d \n\nHe said Indian doctors and health care professionals are the best in the world. \u201cIn the United States, the second largest [health] caregivers to US citizens are Indians\u2026Our health care professionals and doctors are a class apart.\u201d Because of doctors\u2019 commitment, the country was able to bounce back from COVID-19, even though India has a rudimentary infrastructure compared to Western countries, he said.\n\n\u201cIn our ecosystem, our patients think of us [doctors] as Gods. Not so in the West. They think if a doctor cures a patient, it is his duty. The relationship between a doctor and a patient is through insurance and everything ends there. In India, if a doctor cures a patient, he becomes a family member of that patient.\u201d \n\nK. Narayanasamy, Vice-Chancellor of The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R.

        "text": "SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch skipped a Parliament's Public Accounts Committee meeting on Thursday, prompting panel head KC Venugopal to postpone the sitting, with NDA members accusing him of taking unilateral decisions and lodging a protest with the Lok Sabha Speaker.\n\nMr Venugopal told reporters that the committee received a communication from Ms Buch at 9.30 am that she and her team will not be able to appear before the panel due to \"exigencies\".\n\nHe indicated his disapproval of her decision noting that Ms Buch had confirmed her presence after her earlier request for an exemption was denied.\n\n\"Considering a woman's request, we thought it better to postpone today's meeting for another day,\" Mr Venugopal said as he along with other Opposition members left the venue minutes after the meeting began amid sharp exchanges between the ruling alliance and INDIA bloc MPs.\n\nAn Opposition member alleged that Ms Buch informing the committee about her decision with less than two hours to go for the meeting to begin virtually amounts to contempt of the parliamentary panel.\n\nBJP members accused Mr Venugopal, a senior Congress leader, of not letting them put across their views. They later charged him with acting in a \"suo motu\" manner, suggesting that his decision to summon Ms Buch and even some other regulatory bodies established by the acts of parliament was his own and guided by partisan politics.\n\nPAC member and BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters that many standing committees review the performance of various bodies e.g. the panel on finance scrutinises the work of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe Communication and Information Technology panel scrutinises the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, he added.\n\n\"Your (Mr Venugopal) own words are suo motu. How did you decide? The PAC's job is to consider CAG reports. We have this information from reliable sources that the CAG has made no mention of SEBI. This entire conduct is unparliamentary. The conduct of the chairperson in the way he adjourned, did not allow us to speak. And (he) walked out (which) shows he has extraneous political considerations,\" Mr Prasad said.\n\nThe former Union law minister said the ruling National Democratic Alliance was in a majority.\n\n\"Our main objection was how did he (Mr Venugopal) make suo motu selection of subjects without consulting other members? Nobody had an inkling of the list that was prepared,\" said Mr Prasad, flanked by other NDA members of the panel.\n\nHe also objected to the PAC secretariat officials leaving the venue after Mr Venugopal adjourned the meeting when many other members remained inside. The NDA members met Speaker Om Birla later to register their protest against Mr Venugopal.\n\nUS short seller Hindenburg Research's accusation of conflict of interest against Ms Buch over the SEBI's probe into the short-seller's allegations against the Adani Group was seized upon by the Congress to seek her ouster and to attack the government, giving political dimensions to the panel's missive to her to appear before it.\n\nPAC member and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to Speaker Om Birla last month against Mr Venugopal, accusing the Congress leader of raking up \"non-existent\" issues to defame the central government and allegedly destabilise the country's financial structure and economy.\n\nAccusing Mr Venugopal of \"unconstitutional and disdainful\" conduct, Mr Dubey said the committee's chairperson actions are guided by political motivations after the Congress was \"compelled\" by voters to sit in the opposition benches following the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nClaiming that unverified allegations by a foreign company like Hindenburg against Ms Buch were part of such a campaign, he alleged that the \"India Chapter\" of this toolkit has become active.",

A bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma on October 21 noted it was conscious of the large-scale loss of human lives and property but it couldn't condone the \"long delay\" in filing of the appeal by the prosecution.The prosecution, while seeking the \"leave to appeal\", urged the court to condone the delay of 10,165 days in filing the appeal against the trial court's order of acquittal passed on July 29, 1995 in the murder and rioting case.Dismissing the plea, the bench held, \"Considering the long delay and the decisions of the coordinate bench in similar cases, upheld by the Supreme Court, the delay is not liable to be condoned. Thus, leave (to appeal) is not liable to be granted.\"The prosecution, on the other hand, had said the Justice S N Dhingra Committee was constituted in December 2018 to look into the cases in relation to violence and after its report came out in April 2019, internal reviews were conducted and the matters were processed for filing of appeals.Large-scale violence against the members of the Sikh community erupted in Delhi following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her Sikh security guards.",

        "text": "The Press Council of India has adopted a report on the arrests and wrongful detention of journalists in the country, albeit with a dissent note from its chairperson, former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai.\n\nThe report \u2013 Arrests, Wrongful Detentions and Intimidation of Media Personnel \u2013 has been authored by Press Council member Gurbir Singh. It was adopted by the council on September 27 and a copy was shared with Scroll on Thursday.\n\nThe Press Council is a statutory, adjudicating body established in 1966 and operates as per the provisions of the Press Council Act, 1978.\n\n\u201cFive journalists were killed and 226 others were targeted by state agencies, non-state political actors, anti-social elements and criminals across India during 2023,\u201d the report says, citing data from the India Press Freedom Annual Report released on May 3, the World Press Freedom Day.\n\nSingh also points out that, according to private surveys, the Indian news organisations are functioning under \u201csevere constraints\u201d. India was ranked 159 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index 2024, it points out.\n\n\u201cGiving a breakdown of the numbers, the report, released by the India Freedom of Expression Initiative, an alliance of press freedom NGOs, said while 148 journalists were targeted by state actors, 78 journalists were targeted by the non-state actors including political leaders, activists and criminals,\u201d it notes.\n\nThe report also details several cases and complaints that have been placed before the press body for examination, such as the Newsclick case in which the Delhi Police on October 3, 2023, raided the homes of 86 persons associated with the news portal. Of these, 61 persons were journalists. The portal\u2019s founder and editor Prabir Purkayastha and its human resources head Amit Chakraborty were arrested in the raids.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, journalists of The Caravan magazine who were covering the Delhi riots in August 2020 were charged with \u2018inciting communal violence\u2019,\u201d the report points out.\n\nThe report makes three broad recommendations to the Union government, the foremost being \u201cthe need to promulgate a national law for the security and protection of journalists\u201d.\n\nIt also asks that \u201cmore teeth\u201d be given to the Press Council of India Act \u201cso that the watchdog body is better equipped to meet the increasing challenges and threats faced by the Fourth Estate\u201d.\n\nThe Press Council currently can only issue advisory orders that are not enforceable. These do not work as deterrents for unscrupulous elements who may want to browbeat or intimidate press persons, Singh said in the report.\n\nThe report also calls for \u201csensitising police personnel and codifying norms of behaviour for law enforcement agencies towards the Fourth Estate\u201d.\n\nFor instance, before detaining or arresting a journalist, a law enforcement agency should be mandated to verify with the editor or publication if the concerned journalist is on assignment, the report suggests.\n\nSingh has called for \u201ca serious training programme for government personnel from the most senior level down to the junior-most constable to sensitise and generate respect for the constitutional rights and obligations of news networks, agencies and news persons\u201d.\n\nWhile the report has been adopted by the council, its Chairperson Ranjana Prakash Desai recorded a note of dissent.\n\nIn it, Desai questioned the methodology of the French non-governmental organisation Reporters Sans Frontiers, which publishes the World Press Freedom Index.\n\n\u201cThe ranking methodology is questionable and the Press Council of India, in past, has raised its concern about the authenticity and credibility of such reports prepared and published by RSF,\u201d Desai\u2019s dissenting note reads.\n\nShe said that \u201cthe authenticity and reliability of the India Press Freedom Annual Report\u2026by the India Freedom of Expression Initiative, an alliance of press freedom NGOs needs to be looked into\u201d.\n\nDesai said that since the Press Council has contested the ranking of India on the World Press Freedom Index 2024, \u201cthis portion of Shri Gurbir Singh\u2019s communication is not acceptable as it contradicts Press Council\u2019s stand\u201d.\n\nDesai also objected to several cases detailed in Singh\u2019s report as they did not contain the view of the law enforcement authorities.",

        "text": "Chip behemoth Nvidia expanded tie-ups on Thursday with India's big firms, such as Reliance Industries, and launched a lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) model for the widely-used Hindi language, as it looks to tap a growing market.The company NVDA.O is hosting an AI summit in the business capital of Mumbai, at which Chief Executive Jensen Huang chatted with the chairman of conglomerate Reliance RELI.NS, Mukesh Ambani, who is also Asia's richest man.\"Nvidia is AI in India,\" Huang said. \"In just one year's time, by the end of this year, we will have nearly 20 times more compute here in India than just a little over a year ago,\" he added, referring to the infrastructure for computing.From large companies to startups, businesses in India have focused on building AI models based on its diverse languages to grow consumer appeal and drive activities such as customer service AI assistants and content translation.Nvidia said it was rolling out the new small language model, dubbed Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi-4B, with 4 billion parameters, for firms to use in developing their own AI models.\"The model was pruned, distilled and trained with a combination of real-world Hindi data, synthetic Hindi data and an equal amount of English data,\" it said in a statement.Indian IT services firm Tech Mahindra TEML.NS is the first to use the Nvidia offering to develop a custom AI model called Indus 2.0, focused on Hindi and dozens of its dialects, the U.S. company said.Just a tenth of the population of 1.4 billion speaks English in India, where the constitution recognises 22 languages, it added.Besides Tech Mahindra, Nvidia is partnering with India's other IT giants Infosys INFY.NS, TCS TCS.NS and Wipro WIPR.NS, to train about half a million developers to design and deploy AI agents using its software.Reliance and Ola Electric OLAE.NS were among the companies that would use its \"Omniverse\" simulation technology, allowing them to test factory plans in a virtual world.Crowd at eventThursday's event was delayed more than half-an-hour, which managers blamed on the large crowd that gathered to see Huang, the face of the AI chip boom, a number an Nvidia NVDA.O employee described as \"easily a few thousand\".Unlike large-language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, used to power ChatGPT, small language models are trained on much smaller and more specific datasets. Typically cheaper as well, they are more attractive for companies with scarce resources.Global chip firms are investing and setting up facilities in India as it races to build up the semiconductor industry and compete with major hubs such as Taiwan, though analysts say the effort could take years.Since first setting up shop nearly two decades ago, Nvidia has engineering and design centers in India, as well as offices in key cities such as the southern tech hub of Bengaluru and neighbouring Hyderabad.In September last year, Reliance and Nvidia vowed to develop AI supercomputers in India and build large language models trained on its languages. Later that year, Nvidia unveiled a similar partnership with Tata Group.",

        "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found himself the target of sharp jabs in Parliament on Wednesday, as he attempted to defend his government\u2019s record on immigration. In the midst of a heated debate, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre tore into Trudeau, blaming him for the ongoing housing crisis, claiming the PM \"cannot fix what he broke because he\u2019s busy fighting his own caucus.\"But what really got people talking wasn\u2019t the debate on policy \u2014 it was Trudeau\u2019s unexpected vocabulary blunder.\u2018Brokenist\u2019 \u2014 Is that even a word?As Trudeau delivered a passionate rebuttal, he accused Poilievre of promoting a \"brokenist\" vision of Canada. The word instantly became the highlight of the day. Poilievre, with a grin, responded, \u201cMr Speaker, \u2018brokenist,\u2019 it\u2019s not even a word. He\u2019s even breaking the English language.\u201d\u2014 joshryanjames (@joshryanjames) That quip set the internet on fire. Social media was ablaze with memes mocking the Prime Minister\u2019s creative use of language. \u201cHere we go, folks. \u2018Brokenist,\u2019 the latest addition to Trudeau\u2019s dictionary,\u201d one user joked on X (formerly known as Twitter). Another chimed in, \u201cDid I miss a memo? Is \u2018brokenist\u2019 a thing now?\u201dMeme explosion: Trudeau\u2019s linguistic faux pasNew Trudeau\u2019s \u2018brokenist\u2019 moment quickly turned into meme material, with users having a field day mocking the PM\u2019s slip-up. \u201cFrom the most \u2018brokenist\u2019 PM we\u2019ve ever had!\u201d wrote one user, as another pointed out the irony of the leader who preaches fluency in two official languages accidentally coining a term that doesn\u2019t exist. The ridicule didn\u2019t stop there\u2014\u201cDear Leader is so flustered, he makes no sense. This is the \u2018brokenist\u2019 he\u2019s ever been,\u201d a popular post read.Fourth term drama: Will Trudeau run again?But while the memes may be fun, the political landscape Trudeau faces is anything but. Adding to the PM\u2019s woes, a significant number of his own party members have privately suggested he should bow out before the next election. A letter signed by more than 20 Liberal lawmakers urges Trudeau to step aside. His leadership, once seemingly untouchable, is now the subject of growing skepticism within the party.\u2014 RockwelderBlack (@RockwelderBlack) Although Trudeau didn\u2019t address the internal rebellion directly after the meeting, he\u2019s hinted he plans to run for an unprecedented fourth term. However, cracks are forming, with MPs like Charles Sousa saying Trudeau is \"reflecting\" on his future.\u2014 SassyBullfrog (@SassyBullfrog) Conservatives gain groundWith elections looming between now and October 2025, the Liberal Party's future seems uncertain. Recent losses in key special elections in Toronto and Montreal, combined with polling numbers that show the Conservatives leading by 13 points, spell trouble for Trudeau. Conservative leader Poilievre\u2019s sharp criticism may have hit harder than expected, resonating with a public increasingly disillusioned with the Liberals\u2019 performance.",

        "text": "Indian cricket team skipper Rohit Sharma had to pay the price of ignoring Virat Kohli's advice regarding a DRS review on Day 1 of the second Test match against New Zealand in Pune on Thursday. Rohit and Virat had contrasting views regarding a DRS decision involving New Zealand batter Devon Conway and it resulted in India losing a review. During the 25th over of the New Zealand innings, a delivery from Ravindra Jadeja crashed into Conway's pads and the Indian fielders went for a loud appeal. The umpire did not rule in their favour and although almost everyone seemed convinced that Rohit should go for a DRS, Kohli walked up to Rohit and insisted that the ball was going to miss the leg stump. However, Rohit eventually did go for the review and replays showed that Virat was correct in his assessment.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Off-spin all-rounder Washington Sundar ran through the New Zealand batting order to pick career-best figures of 7-59 as the visitors' were bowled out for 259 by India on day one of second Test at the MCA Stadium on Thursday.Electing to bat first, New Zealand were 197/3 at one stage and it felt like they would go past 300. But Washington displayed an exhibition of drift and dip, while varying his pace well and turned the game on its head for India and keep New Zealand to one below 260.His senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin chipped in with 3-64 as the innings marked the first-ever instance of all ten wickets taken by India's right-arm off-spinners in a Test match. Before the game, Washington being drafted in ahead of Kuldeep Yadav raised eyebrows, but his sensational bowling performance on a slow black-soil pitch shut down all those questions.In the morning, Devon Conway and captain Tom Latham hit five boundaries between themselves, before the latter fell early to Ashwin, who got the length ball to straighten after pitching on leg-stump and trapped the left-handed batter lbw for 15 off 22 balls.Conway and Will Young got some easy singles on offer, while hitting boundaries occasionally to stitch a 44-run stand for the second wicket, with India's spinners bowling quicker through the air. Ashwin then strangled Young down leg, and Sarfaraz Khan, stationed at short leg, prodded captain Rohit Sharma to take a review.Replays justified Sarfaraz's conviction as there was a spike detected on the ultra-edge when the ball passed off the gloves, before being pouched by Rishabh Pant, as Young was dismissed for 18. Conway was solid like a rock, especially in his sweeps, while Rachin Ravindra surviving a few close brushes till lunch came.Resuming from 92/2 in the post-lunch session, Conway started with a cracking cover drive off Jasprit Bumrah to get his fifty. He then capitalised on width from Bumrah's deliveries by punching off the backfoot and opening the face of the bat late to get back-to-back boundaries.From the other end, Ravindra began to find his groove by using Bumrah's pace to run through the gap between slip and gully for four. Conway continued to be impressive with his drive and reverse-sweeps, before poking at a short and spinning away ball from Ashwin, with the edge caught by Rishabh Pant.Ravindra took over the run-scoring mantle by lofting Jadeja for six, before beautifully flicking Akash Deep for four more. After getting his fifty with a stylish flick going through the hands of short mid-wicket for four, Ravindra had two more boundaries coming off Akash via cut and outside edge.The 59-run stand for the fourth wicket between Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell was brought to a halt by Washington, who turned the tide for India in the fag end of the second session with his dip and drift. Washington got a tossed-up delivery to turn away sharply from the middle stump and hit top of the off-stump with a peach of a delivery.At the stroke of tea, Washington again brought joy to himself and Indian team by getting a length ball to grip and turn sharply into Blundell, who aimed for a flick, but was castled through the gate.Post-tea, Washington asked for a review after rapping Daryl Mitchell on the pads with a sharp turning delivery, which proved to be a good review as replays showed ball going on to clip leg-stump. Mitchell Santner tried upping the ante by hitting boundaries, but Washington continued to hurt New Zealand.Glenn Phillips holed out to long-off off him, while Tim Southee and Ajaz Patel were castled by the young all-rounder, and Washington wrapped up the New Zealand innings in style by ratting Santner with grip and turn to take out the off-stump, as the visitors' lost their last seven wickets for 62 runs.(With IANS inputs)",

We have already addressed the water issue,\" MCA secretary Kamlesh Pisal later told the media.\"This time we (have) decided to provide the spectators with chilled drinking water and there were some sort of logistical issues as some of the stalls ran out of water during the lunch break owing to heavy rush,\" he explained.\"It took us 15 to 20 minutes to refill the water containers and since it was delayed, we decided to offer them free bottled water,\" he added.The drama unfolded at the Hill End of the stadium near the media and commentary centres.While the situation did not get any worse, it occurred because the vehicles carrying water to the stadium, which is located in the outskirts of the city, were reportedly delayed due to heavy traffic during morning hours.Another group of fans was seen arguing with the security to be allowed re-entry into the stadium while the rules strictly prohibit them from doing so. The situation was brought under control by the tea break.",

This is also regarding the role of Congress in the by-elections to be held there.\u201d\u201cThe Election Commission has announced by-elections in 9 out of 10 seats in UP. The BJP has been pursuing its political agenda for the last 10 years to weaken the constitution in the country and to serve its political interests, and to divide and break the brotherhood in the society,\u201d claimed Pandey. He further said, \u201cIn the recent Lok Sabha elections, the people of UP gave a befitting reply to them. Today, with values to protect and save the Constitution, Rahul Gandhi is touring the country and working to give justice to every section of the society.\u201d\u201cKeeping the same values in mind, as per the suggestion of the President of the UP Congress Committee and all the senior leaders there and after taking consent from the Congress President, we have decided that the Congress Party will not field its candidates in UP,\u201d announced Avinash Pandey.\u201cAll the candidates of the INDIA bloc will remain united, strong and support Samajwadi Party (SP) in UP,\u201d said the State Congress in-charge.Recently, under the leadership of UP Congress commitee the Congress held \u201cSamvidhan Bachao Sankalp Sammelan\u201d (save Constitution conferences) on all 10 seats.Avinash Pandey said that these conferences were successfully organised in all the 10 Assembly seats of UP and were attended by thousands of people and workers.\u201cAfter the success of these conferences, we have realized that if we do not stop BJP and NDA today, then in the coming times the constitution and brotherhood will weaken in the country,\u201d stated Avinash Pandey.Meanwhile, after announcing that INDIA bloc candidates would be contesting the Uttar Pradesh bypolls on the Samajwadi Party\u2019s \u2018cycle\u2019 symbol, party president Akhilesh Yadav said on Thursday \u2018humne yeh thana hai, \u2018samvidhan, arshan, sohardh (We have decided to save Constitution, Reservation, Harmony). We have to build the country of Bapu-Babasaheb-Lohia\u2019s dreams,\u201d he said in a post on X.Earlier, in another post, Yadav highlighted that the INDIA bloc candidates would be contesting the bypolls under his party\u2019s symbol.\u201cIt is not about seats but about winning. Under this strategy, the joint candidates of \u2018India Alliance\u2019 will contest on all the 9 seats on the Samajwadi Party\u2019s election symbol \u2018cycle\u2019. Congress and Samajwadi Party are united and standing shoulder to shoulder for a big victory. India Alliance is going to write a new chapter of victory in this by-election,\u201d read the post on X.Congress leader Surendra Rajput further confirmed that the main aim of the alliance will be to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instead of choosing the symbol.\u201cINDIA Alliance is contesting all 9 seats. For us, symbol is not important. For us, the end of BJP\u2019s misgovernance is important. For us, the end of Bahraich riot perpetrators is important. For us, it is important that there be security, peace and safeguarding of Constitution. INDIA Alliance is united against those who are against caste census and reservation and will contest all 9 seats. The manner in which Akhilesh Yadav showed big-heartedness in Haryana, we will contest with the same sentiment and win all 9 seats,\u201d he said.Additionally, Akhilesh Yadav also appealed to the people to stand united and vote without dividing the vote.On Tuesday, 15 candidates filed nominations in UP for by-polls and a total of 34 candidates filed nominations for Uttar Pradesh by-polls till Wednesday.

        "text": "In what promises to be a thriller in the bypolls, Channapatna Assembly constituency will witness a mega battle as Nikhil Kumaraswamy has been named the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate to take on C.P. Yogeshwar, who filed his nomination on a Congress ticket on October 24. \n\nMr. Nikhil\u2019s candidature as Janata Dal (Secular) candidate was announced by his grandfather and former Prime Minister H.D. Devegowda in Bengaluru after consultations with JD(S) party workers from Channapatna. Soon after, BJP strongman and former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa officially announced Mr. Nikhil as the NDA candidate. \n\nThis will be Mr Nikhil\u2019s third foray into electoral politics. In 2023, he lost in Ramanagara constituency during the Assembly elections in Karnataka. Earlier in 2019, he lost the Mandya Lok Sabha constituency to independent candidate Sumalatha. At that time, Mr. Nikhil had contested in Mandya as the Janata Dal Secular-Congress alliance candidate when the alliance was in power and the government was headed by his father H.D. Kumaraswamy. \n\nMr. Yogeshwar is seen as a turncoat in politics, but has won five times from Channapatna Assembly constituency. Interestingly, he lost the last two elections (2018 and 2023) to H.D. Kumaraswamy. \n\nIn 2020, BJP had got Mr Yogeshwar elected to the legislative Council. Earlier this week, Mr Yogeshwar resigned from the Council and the BJP.\n\nMr. Gowda announced that Mr. Nikhil will contest from Channapatna and will be filing his nomination on October 25. The former Prime Minister said he, along with BJP leaders, would be with Mr. Nikhil during filing of nomination papers at Channapatna. Besides, he would campaign for his grandson for the by-election. \n\nThe party had been wary of fielding him in the Channapatna by-poll, which was necessitated by the resignation of H.D. Kumaraswamy after he won the Mandya Lok Sabha seat. Mr. Kumaraswamy is now the Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel. \n\nWhile Mr. Nikhil was seen as a front-runner to contest on the NDA ticket and represent JD(S), Mr. Yogeshwar a five-time former MLA and former MLC was adamant on contesting from the BJP ticket. As there was no agreement on the issue, though JD S offered Mr Yogeshwar to contest on its symbol, he chose to join Congress on Wednesday. This development had put the JD S on the backdoor as it feared all forces opposed to it will align in this by polls. The Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh, who lost to Mr. Nikhil\u2019s uncle from Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha constituency, are looking to avenge the defeat. JD S leaders are also wary of support from certain Vokkaliga leaders in BJP though the central leaders are completely backing the JDS. \n\nMeanwhile, though Mr. Gowda announced Mr. Nikhil\u2019s name earlier, Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Nikhil along with several party leaders and BJP leaders met former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to discuss the developments before formally announcing Mr. Nikhil as the NDA candidate. Leader of Opposition in Legislative Assembly R. Ashok and Leader of Opposition in Legislative Council were among those present in the NDA meeting. \n\nThe Channapatna by poll promises to be a cracker of contest given the high political stakes involved. While Mr. Shivakumar and Mr. Yogeshwar will be looking to avenge defeat, Mr. Devegowda\u2019s family will be looking to retain the seat and their influence in the district. For, JD S could retain only Channapatna constituency in Ramanagar district and this constituency is now at stake.",

Jaishankar on Thursday said that there remains a \u201cwidespread anxiety\u201d that the ongoing conflict would spread further in the region.\n\n\u201cThe situation in the Middle East, West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected. The human and material consequences of further escalation are truly serious. Any approach has to be fair and durable, leading to a two-state solution,\u201d the EAM said at the BRICS Outreach session in Kazan.\n\nRepresenting Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the segment, Jaishankar emphasised that conflicts and tensions have to be handled effectively.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception. And there should be zero tolerance for terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting that as the old order changes while inequities of the past continue, the EAM mentioned that BRICS is a statement in itself and can make a real difference.\n\nHe made five key points to ensure that the benefits of change reach those who are currently left behind and a more equitable global order is created.\n\nIt included strengthening and expanding platforms of an independent nature to widen choices and avoid being leveraged; Reforming established institutions and mechanisms, especially the UN Security Council in the permanent and non-permanent categories; Democratizing the global economy through creating more production hubs to build resilient, redundant and shorter supply chains; Correct distortions in global infrastructure through connectivity options that enhance logistics and mitigate risks; and, sharing experiences and new initiatives that hold relevance and are of common interest.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s Digital Public Infrastructure, its Unified Payments Interface and the Gati Shakti infrastructure, all hold a larger relevance. The International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, the Global Biofuel Alliance, Mission LiFE and the International Big Cat Alliance are similarly initiatives of common interest. As a First Responder, be it for natural calamities, health emergencies or economic crises, we seek to do our fair share,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nThe plenary session of the 16th BRICS summit in the outreach/BRICS-plus format on Friday was attended by leaders of the CIS countries, delegations from Asian, African, Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, as well as heads of executive bodies of a number of international organisations.",

        "text": "The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) has urgently called on Chinese authorities to reveal the whereabouts of four Tibetans subjected to incommunicado detention in Ngaba (Aba), located in the Ngaba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province.In early September, Chinese officials arbitrarily detained four individuals, including two monks from Kirti Monastery, Lobsang Samten and Lobsang Trinley, alongside Tsering Tashi and Wangkyi. Since their arrest, no information has been provided regarding their location or the specific charges against them.Lobsang Samten, 53, has been a monk at Kirti Monastery since childhood and is currently a student in the Karampa (Geshe) class. As a junior chant master at the monastery\u2019s Prayer College, he is known for his commitment to monastic studies and previously faced detention in 2011 alongside 300 other monks. Lobsang Trinley, also known as Drenpo, is a monk in his 40s from Rongkhangsar town and plays a significant role in organising ritual ceremonies at Kirti Monastery.Wangkyi, 43, and Tsering Tashi, 41, are siblings from the Haritsang family in Rongkharsar. Wangkyi is married and has four daughters. Reports suggest that members of the Haritsang family may have been arrested for maintaining contacts in India, although details remain unclear.According to a source who spoke with TCHRD, \u201cThere have been reports of members of the Haritsang family being arrested for maintaining contacts in India, though specific details remain elusive. In recent months, repression in the Ngaba region has intensified, with increased restrictions particularly aimed at Kirti Monastery and nearby villages.Arbitrary detentions and secret sentencing of Tibetans have become alarmingly frequent. Local Tibetans are being silenced through intimidation, making it increasingly difficult for information to surface. Even those who are released from detention are prohibited from revealing the charges against them or where they were held, further obscuring the truth from the community.\u201dThis incident comes on the heels of China\u2019s closure of two prominent Buddhist monastery schools in July, which forced approximately 1,600 novice monks to enrol in government-run boarding schools. This move is part of a broader campaign aimed at assimilating Tibetan cultural and religious identity and promoting assimilation into the dominant Han Chinese culture.TCHRD calls on Chinese authorities to immediately cease these arbitrary detentions and to provide accurate information regarding the status and whereabouts of the four detained Tibetans. The organisation urges the international community to raise awareness of the situation and advocate for the rights of the Tibetan people.",

People would revolt against the government and thrash leaders of the Congress soon for failing to fulfill its poll promises soon. Listing out the broken promises of the Congress, he pointed out that even the one tola of gold to promised to the beneficiaries of the Kalyana Lakshmi scheme was not given yet.

No leader of the Congress would be left in the State if all sections lodged complaints against the government.\r\n\r\nRama Rao cautioned that the BRS would not remain silent if cases were booked against farmers. He stated that none would keep quiet if someone demolished their houses. He cited a case registered against Bodigam Ganganna for allegedly abusing Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy. Occupants were given house sites and permissions during the regime of the Congress. He also asked whether cases be booked against the Congress which claimed to keep its words within hundred days at the office or against the farmers or the poor. Cheating cases should be registered against those who duped the farmers and the public, he said, adding that illegal cases would not be tolerated.\r\n\r\nRama Rao also asked the public to warn people in Maharashtra about the Congress, since the State was going for polls soon, and inform them what was happening in Telangana, especially with regard to poll promises. Asking officials to discharge duties as per the law, he asked them not to cross the line by succumbing to pressure exerted by public representatives or ministers.",
        "summary": "Speaking at the 'Rythannala Poru Bata' meeting with farmers at Ramleela ground on Thursday, Rama Rao declared his willingness to go to jail for the sake of the people and farmers. He warned that the public would soon rise up against the government and confront Congress leaders for not fulfilling their election promises.",

Addressing media persons later here on Thursday, he said the turncoats MLAs and leaders were dominating party affairs and calling the shots in different constituencies.\r\n\r\n\"At this juncture, what is our position in the party?\" he asked, also alleging that former Minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy was the leader of the turncoats. He had held a meeting with turncoat MLAs and leaders and directed them to dominate the Congress leaders in the constituencies, he alleged, stating that the high command was against defections into the party. The Congress had got a clear majority in the Assembly and did not need support of any turncoats, he said.\r\n\u201cWill the Congress government not survive without support of turncoat MLAs? Is this the democratic governance Rahul Gandhi promised?\" Jeevan Reddy asked.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, TPCC president Mahesh Kumar Goud has been claiming that defections into the party were as per the high command's instructions. But Jeevan Reddy took strong objection to the defections into the party reminding that it was the Congress which was fighting against defections by elected public representatives. Defections were not only against the party's policy but also creating lot of unrest among loyal leaders. Still, Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy openly welcomed BRS MLA Dr Sanjay into the party.\r\n\u201cWhen his entry was opposed by the cadre in Jagtial, I was personally summoned to New Delhi after Ministers Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and D Sridhar Babu tried to pacify me. Even the party high command wanted me to be patient. Now, I appeal to Mallikarjun Kharge to guide my future course of action,\" Jeevan Reedy said.",

        "text": "Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hailed the breakthrough in resolving the longstanding border tensions between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue 2024 in New Delhi, Singh said that months of diplomatic and military talks have led to both nations achieving a consensus to resume patrolling and grazing rights in traditional areas.\u201cIndia and China have been involved in talks at both diplomatic and military levels to resolve differences along the LAC. Following these efforts, we have reached a broad consensus to restore the ground situation based on principles of equal and mutual security,\u201d Singh stated, marking his first public remarks on the issue.The border agreement between the two nations follows several intense high-level negotiations since the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes, which marked a significant downturn in India-China relations. The new agreement allows Indian forces to resume patrolling in key areas such as Depsang and Demchok, long-standing flashpoints in the standoff. The resumption of these activities is viewed as a confidence-building measure and a signal of both countries' willingness to reduce military tensions.Rajnath Singh emphasised that this breakthrough underscores the power of persistent dialogue. \u201cThe consensus includes patrolling and grazing in traditional areas. This is the power of continuous dialogue \u2014 sooner or later, solutions emerge,\u201d he remarked, highlighting India\u2019s commitment to diplomacy while ensuring national security.The agreement is seen as a critical step towards normalising ties between the two countries, with disputes in areas like Pangong Lake, Gogra-Hot Springs, and Galwan Valley already settled. However, Rajnath Singh was quick to remind that India remains vigilant. \u201cOur pursuit of peace does not mean compromising on security. India will always stand firm in protecting its borders,\u201d he asserted.This pact represents a diplomatic victory for India, particularly given China\u2019s earlier resistance to reverting to the status quo that existed prior to the 2020 clashes. The breakthrough comes after 21 rounds of military talks and 17 working mechanism meetings. With the resumption of patrolling in Depsang and Demchok, where Chinese forces had intruded up to 15 km into Indian-patrolled areas, the new agreement offers hope for easing broader Sino-India territorial disputes.India and China, sharing a 3,488 km long border, have differing perceptions of the LAC, which divides physical control rather than territorial claims. This latest step forward may offer a path towards further reconciliation in the complex territorial disputes that have long strained relations between the two Asian giants.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Oct 24, 2024Must Watch",

Having said this, what we must understand is that it\u2019s an agreement for disengagement and patrolling. The modalities will take time. The modalities have to be worked out by people on the ground. So far a decision has been taken which is very good. Now this decision, the nuts and bolts of this as to how it will happen will be done by people on the ground,\u201d Former Chief of Army Staff General VK Singh said while speaking to ANI. \n\nGeneral Singh stated that a very positive atmosphere has been created with the India-China agreement and the leaders engaged in talks will be able to come to a conclusion that is mutually beneficial to both of them. \u201cVarious meetings will take place and then only we will see the outcome of it. But with this, I think also a very positive atmosphere has been created where both the leaders who are meeting would meet in a positive environment in something which they would be able to talk about things which are mutually beneficial to both of them,\u201d General VK Singh added. \n\nIn a major development in the 10-month-long military standoff on the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh, India and China have reached an agreement to disengage their troops from the northern and southern banks of the contentious Pangong Lake where the Chinese troops would move back to east of the Finger 8 while the Indian side would go to its Dhan Singh Thapa post near Finger 3, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced on Thursday in Rajya Sabha\n\nIn a statement in Rajya Sabha, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that as per the agreement reached between the two sides, both countries will cease their forward deployments on the Pangong Lake in a \u201ccoordinated, phased and verified\u201d manner where they would restore the situation to the April 2020 status.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform the House today that as a result of our well thought out approach and sustained talks with the Chinese side, we have now been able to reach an agreement on disengagement in the North and South Bank of the Pangong Lake. It has also been agreed to convene the next meeting of the Senior Commanders within 48 hours after the complete disengagement in the Pangong Lake area so as to address and resolve all other remaining issues,\u201d the Minister announced. \n\nThe agreement reached between India and China on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh \u201cessentially pertains\u201d to the areas of Depsang and Demchok, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said.\n\n\u201cInsofar as Depsang and Demchok is concerned, if you see the statements that I have made over the last 48 to 72 hours, I think the answer should be quite clear. I have made the point that the last time we had an agreement on the several issues that had arisen in the India-China border areas since 2020, the last agreement was in 2022 in September,\u201d Misri said at a media briefing here on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for BRICS Summit.\n\n\u201cSince then, we had been involved in trying to find a resolution of the pending issues in the balance areas along the Line of Actual Control, which pertain to these areas that you have mentioned.

        "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to use the \"clock\" symbol in its publicity material in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections with a disclaimer that the matter was sub-judice before it. Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan passed the order on a plea filed by the rival Sharad Pawar-led NCP faction as it issued a notice to the Ajit Pawar-led faction.The top court on March 19 and April 4 had directed the Ajit Pawar-led faction to issue a public notice in the newspapers in English, Hindi and Marathi editions notifying that the allocation of \"clock\" symbol was sub-judice. The apex court had further said the Ajit faction was permitted to use the symbol subject to the case's final outcome.During the proceedings on Thursday, the bench took note of the submissions of senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the Sharad Pawar faction. Singhvi submitted the opponent group should be restrained from using the \"clock\" symbol as it didn't use the disclaimer in their campaign materials and \"misled\" voters.\"They have been blatantly not using the disclaimer. They want to piggyback on me. Nobody should enjoy the goodwill of the symbol which is sub-judice,\" submitted Singhvi. The top court directed Ajit Pawar to file a fresh undertaking over its March 19 and April 4 directions to issue a public notice -- \"NCP's 'clock' symbol is sub-judice\" -- was being meticulously complied with even during the process of the state assembly elections.\"File a fresh undertaking as well that you have not violated our directions in the past and till the end of elections. If there is any violation, we will take note of it. We expect both sides to comply with our directions. Please don't create an embarrassing situation,\" the bench said.Singhvi said the Ajit Pawar group should be allocated a new symbol for the assembly elections. Senior advocate Balbir Singh, appearing for Ajit Pawar, opposed Singhvi's submissions and said all pamphlets and campaign materials contained the disclaimers as directed by the apex court.\"They are showing false documents. We have given disclaimers in our publicity material. They came up with the same allegations during the Lok Sabha polls which was rejected. I am willing to file all documents and pamphlets,\" Singh said.The matter has been posted for hearing on November 6. Sharad Pawar moved the apex court against a February 6 order of the Election Commission of India (ECI) recognising Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.The ECI had allotted the NCP's \"clock\" symbol to the group led by Ajit Pawar. The NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar, had the \"clock\" as its election symbol before its split. On March 19, the top court allowed the Sharad Pawar faction to use \"Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar\" as its name along with the symbol of a man blowing \"turha\" ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in the country.It had passed the order on a plea by the Sharad Pawar group seeking to restrain the Ajit Pawar faction from using the \"clock\" symbol for the polls, as allotted by the ECI, on the ground that it was disrupting the level playing field.The top court had observed the name and photographs of Sharad Pawar could not be used by the Ajit Pawar faction for political gains. On February 19, the top court directed for the continuation of the ECI order allotting \"Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar\" as the party name for the Sharad Pawar faction.Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar had on February 15 held the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar to be the real NCP and said the anti-defection provisions in the Constitution couldn't be used to stifle internal dissent. Sharad Pawar had founded the NCP with former Lok Sabha speaker Purno Sangma and Tariq Anwar in 1999 after their expulsion from the Congress.Ajit Pawar had walked away with a majority of the NCP MLAs in July, 2023, and supported the BJP-Shiv Sena government led by Eknath Shinde.",

        "text": "The National Democratic Alliance on Thursday fielded Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of Union Minister and Karnataka JD(S) chief HD Kumaraswamy for the upcoming Channapatna by-poll.Nikhil Kumaraswamy, who is also the JD(S) State Youth Unit President, will be competing against CP Yogeshwara, who joined the Congress on Wednesday after resigning as BJP MLC on Monday. Notably, HD Kumaraswamy (HDK) defeated Yogeeshwara in the 2018 and 2023 assembly polls from the seat. The seat fell vacant after HDK won from the Mandya parliamentary segment in the last Lok Sabha polls.The announcement was made by former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa during a press conference. He also expressed confidence that the alliance would win all three seats in the upcoming by-polls.\u201cWe have announced Nikhil Kumaraswamy as NDA candidate. We are going to win all three seats\u2026 We are announcing, with the blessings of the high command leaders, that we field him. We\u2019ll meet after we win 100 per cent\u2026I don\u2019t speak about who left the party; we will do whatever is required to make sure Nikhil Kumaraswamy wins,\u201d he said.Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy added, \u201cFinally, we have decided, with the blessings of BS Yediyurappa and other leaders of both parties, to field Nikhil Kumaraswamy as a candidate.\u201d\u201cThis was not my decision or opinion. Our party workers pressurised him (to contest bypoll) and we took this decision,\u201d he added.Following the announcement, Nikhil Kumaraswamy said, \u201cI have been touring Panchayati Headquarters in my constituency and that is only because Kumaraswamy ji said that we should take all the workers and leaders into confidence. I have been doing my work as a Karyakarta and with the recent political developments that have taken place, the NDA has given me an opportunity. I have a lot of confidence in the Channapatna constituency people. They will bless me.\u201dEarlier today, Congress candidate Yogeshwara filed his nomination for the Channapatna by-poll in the presence of Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM DK Shivakumar.Earlier on October 15, the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced by-polls for 48 Assembly constituencies and two Parliamentary seats, scheduled to occur in two phases alongside the Maharashtra and Jharkhand Assembly elections.Voting for the first phase, covering 47 Assembly constituencies and the Wayanad parliamentary seat in Kerala will take place on November 13. The second phase will occur on November 20 for the Kedarnath Assembly constituency in Uttarakhand and the Nanded parliamentary seat in Maharashtra. The counting of votes will take place on November 23",

        "text": "Telangana Government is apparently saddled with the burden of interest payment due to the huge loans obtained from the financial institutions in the past 10 years.\n\nTelangana likely to pay interests higher than projection\n\nThe interest payments over the past few years are on the rise and surpassing the quantum projected in the budget estimates of the respective financial years. For instance, during the current fiscal, the State has incurred expenditure of Rs. 13,187 crore on account of interest payments by the end of September - second quarter. This is 74.38 per cent of the Rs. 17,729 crore interest payments projected in the budget estimates for the entire year. \n\nWith two more quarters still remaining, the State is likely to end up paying interests much higher than the amount projected in the budget estimates. \n\nInterest payment in the previous FYs\n\nThis is not an isolated case, the State Government remitted Rs. 23,337 crore interest in the previous financial year 2023-24, 104% of the Rs. 22,407 crore of the budget estimates.\n\nThe same was the case with the interest payment in 2022-23 when the State ended up paying Rs. 20,952 crore, 110% of the Rs. 18,911 crore projected for the fiscal. And, in 2021-22, the State had to pay Rs. 18,688 crore which is 105% of the projected Rs. 17,854 crore in the budget estimates. \n\nChief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has been expressing concern over the legacy of high interest loans handed over by the previous Government. The Congress Government had estimated that the State is saddled with borrowings of Rs. 6.85 lakh crore in the White Paper on State finances tabled in the assembly. \n\nThe Chief Minister accordingly made strong pitch with the XVI Finance Commission to allow Telangana Government to restructure its debt so that it could mitigate the burden of interest payment. Irrigation Minister N. Uttam Kumar Reddy visited the national capital more than once seeking the Union Finance Ministry\u2019s consent for rescheduling of loans so that the State could withstand the pressure on its finances.",

        "text": "In recent times, traffic violations of various kinds have reached a peak, making it difficult for law-abiding citizens to travel on the roads.\n\nSome common violations include riding without helmets by both rider and pillion, using mobile phones while driving, triple or quadruple riding, jumping traffic signals without restraint, driving on the wrong side and in no-entry zones at reckless speeds, drunk driving, overtaking from the left, and more. This menace can be curbed through the following measures:\n\n1. Imposing heavy fines on traffic violators in line with the penalties set by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (Government of India).\n\n2. Establishing a Traffic Violations Monitoring Cell (TVMC) equipped with advanced infrastructure, including PCs, laptops, and servers, by the Police Department in every district of Karnataka. TVMC should collaborate with the relevant RTOs to share vehicle databases.\n\n3. The TVMC should employ personnel with the necessary qualifications and computer skills, hired either on a contract or regular basis.\n\n4. Hiring physically capable personnel on contract or piecework, equipped with HD button cameras or mobile devices. These devices must feature tamper-proof software to ensure the integrity of videos/photos. The authority to alter footage should only lie with officials of SP rank or higher.\n\n5. Deploying personnel in special uniforms to patrol the roads and capture traffic violations on video or photo. Any attempt to assault these personnel should be treated seriously and prosecuted under relevant laws. Insurance must be provided to ensure compensation in the event of injury or loss of life.\n\n6. Developing software that automatically uploads captured videos / photos to the TVMC servers.\n\n7. TVMC personnel should immediately notify traffic offenders via WhatsApp or email, specifying the fine amount and due date. For those without access to these platforms, notices should be sent by mail.\n\nFailure to pay fines within the due date should result in doubled or tripled penalties until a final deadline. If payment is still not made, the Police should seize the vehicle, which can be traced using advanced TVMC software.\n\nIf these suggestions are implemented effectively, traffic violations could be reduced by 75-80 percent within 5-10 years, similar to the situation in the USA.\n\nHowever, the real question is whether the Government or Police Department will truly adopt these measures. It\u2019s doubtful, as enforcing these rules could reduce the illicit flow of money into both Government coffers and Police pockets, as more people would comply with traffic regulations.\n\nThe world rests on hope, as do the innocent citizens. Only time will reveal the outcome of these suggestions. These recommendations are based on over 46 years of driving experience and 40 years of dedicated service in a Central Government organisation.\n\n\u2013 N.

        "text": "Amaravati: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday promised that he will be the best ambassador for the drone industry to promote its ecosystem and transform the state into a drone hub. The chief minister called on drone players to use the southern state as a pilot or testing ground for producing use cases and proof of concepts. \"Andhra Pradesh will be a testing bed for drone applications. Give us your use cases and we will test them,\" said Naidu, addressing a two-day national drone summit at Mangalagiri in Guntur district. The chief minister inaugurated the summit accompanied by Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu. Naidu noted that the state government is keen on adopting at least 150 drone use cases during the two-day summit on October 22 and 23. Calling on drone ecosystem players, the CM requested them to put their data and use cases in a sandbox for further validation and enhancement. Highlighting that the drone industry is the \"game changer\" of the future, he said these unmanned aerial vehicles have multiple use cases, such as identifying traffic violations, criminals and in farming, among several others. The TD supremo observed that the state government aims to hand over 20,000 drone pilot certificates and achieve 80 per cent indigenisation in drone manufacturing. Promising to allot 300 acres to the Civil Aviation Ministry, Government of India, Naidu requested the Centre to set up a drone certification hub at Orvakal in Kurnool district, which is near to Hyderabad, Chennai and Amaravati. Further, the CM appealed to drone players to keep their costs reasonable and refrain from being \"greedy\" to enable wider adoption of this technology. On the occasion, the Andhra Pradesh government inked an agreement with the Quality Council of India (QCI) for certifying drone startups in the state. There was also an agreement between IIT-Tirupati and Technology Innovative Hub for collaboration in drone technology development, startups and skill initiatives. Later, Naidu released a concept note on drone policy and also inaugurated a drone expo at the venue. Earlier, Union Aviation Minister K Ram Mohan Naidu said that the government does not want to import drones as it envisages the people of the country to manufacture them. The aviation minister highlighted that the Centre has liberalised rules for the drone ecosystem and enabled 27 companies to benefit from the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Noting that India has emerged as a drone hub in the past few years, the union minister said the government wants to push the industry further. \"Looking at a drone hub in Andhra Pradesh in the future... want to ensure that Andhra Pradesh grows to the best of its ability,\" he said, adding that the government wants to ensure that the southern state will emerge as the drone hub of the world. The mega-drone summit will feature drone hackathons, exhibitions and participation from industry experts. As many as 1,711 delegates and 1,306 visitors are expected to attend the summit. Likewise, over 8,000 people are also expected to attend the summit, which will be followed by a drone show at Punnami Ghat in Vijayawada on Tuesday evening.",

        "text": "penText has transformed from on-premises content management (1.0) to information management in hybrid cloud (2.0). Now, OpenText 3.0 focuses on \u2018Information Reimagined\u2019, combining cloud-based information management with AI, security, and compliance.\n\nOpenText\u2019s 3.0 journey has been a transformative experience for us. We are building a new AI platform that will help in the automation of product development internally. It is around \u2018Information Re-imagined\u2019 which is basically an Information Management Cloud with AI and with full security and compliance. \n\nThe 3.0 journey pushed us to embrace a cloud-first, AI-driven mindset, and to focus on delivering innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. OpenText 3.0 is all about security, AI, and information management cloud. We are going to be fully on the cloud, but we keep in mind the local regulatory requirements and data sovereignty requirements of certain countries, which means we\u2019ll bring the hyperscaler cloud into the country. \n\n This is a platform that we intend to use internally for auto-generating the application codes for product development and automating testing. The application code generation will help our developers and especially testers. We can imagine a world in the future where there are some user stories, the business use case stories on which the product development has to happen. You feed into this platform and say that your core language to develop this is Python. It\u2019ll read the user stories and suggest a Python code which the developer can then edit and refine further and then move to the next step of unit testing. Once the developer is happy, then the platform will suggest a test plan or test script for that. The platform itself will help you to test it. Once you approve the test plan and test script. This is not for sale to a customer. This is in pilot with over 2,000 developers testing it. \n\nThe majority of AI and Automation initiatives are being fully developed in India. That\u2019s one of the key elements of India OpenText 3.0, which our CEO entrusted us with. It started like 9-10 months back and we are heavily invested in that. The Indian team played a pivotal role in the development of this platform. India is going to play a very pivotal role in OpenText 3.0. Security is a key focus area in our 3.0 strategy and as an example of the role of India in the security the managed security operations centre under our cybersecurity practice in India will grow significantly and most likely going to double in size. \n\nWill AI be fully successful? The answer is no. Can it replace everything perfectly? The answer is no. It\u2019s a simple common example. I can say critics and admirers are sitting on the left-hand, and right-hand side of the fence. But the answer is in the middle. You will not leave everything with AI, but you will leave a lot of things with AI. It just depends on how everybody is experimenting maybe the AI might fail in one area \u2013 let\u2019s say product development. Maybe it produces a code, then we have to put more effort into correcting it. The efficiency gain is 30 per cent but to rework is another 20 per cent, eventually, a 10 per cent gain is not worth it, but AI-assisted automated testing is most likely 100 per cent guaranteed that it will work well. Therefore in some areas, it will succeed, it will fail. That\u2019s my view.\n\n Price-wise, the Indian market is definitely challenging. The price point that customers expect here is different; North American pricing or other models won\u2019t work. So, we\u2019ve defined specific packages, solutions, and price points tailored for the Indian market. \n\nWe\u2019ve learned these lessons over time, and we\u2019re now seeing significant success. For example, just three months ago, we secured a multi-million dollar deal with a large telecom customer in India. This is a yearly renewable project, highlighting the growing demand for our products and services in the domestic market. This particular customer needed our solutions to streamline their business processes, and we were able to meet their needs effectively. A few other customers in India where we had success in last few years are L&T Technology Services with whom we are partnering to serve strategic Govt institutions, ITC, GAIL, IOCL, and ONGC. \n\nPreviously, we had success stories with only multinational companies that are rolling out in India. But the true India stories have started coming up in the last 24 months or so.\n\n We have a strong internship program that originated in Hyderabad. We hire close to 300 interns every year. Of those interns, 40 per cent get converted to full-time employees. We started with product development, then we replicated to other units as well - now professional services, customer success, and technical support. It is working very well. And in that process, we have a good affiliation with campuses both in Hyderabad and Bangalore and all India level as well. We have identified, certain universities we work with.",

        "text": "Berhampur (Odisha): Even though winter is yet to set in the state, winged guests have started to arrive at Odisha's Chilika lake, the biggest waterfowl habitat in the country, an official said. The migratory birds have already started to arrive in the lake from the first week of the current month, as the usual time of their arrival, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Chilika Wildlife Division, Amlan Nayak said on Tuesday. Their arrival was continuing daily, he said. Migratory birds of different species like northern pintail, Eurasian wigeon, gadwall, black-tailed gadwall, northern shoveller, greater flamingo, common sandpiper, common coot, mongolian plover, common snipe, black winged stilt, etc, have already swooped down in the lake, Nayak said. The DFO said the arrival of migratory birds to the lake is as usual, even though the day temperature in and around the blue lagoon was hovering at 32 to 35 degrees Celsius at present. The onset of winter and some other causes in their native places might have forced the birds to fly to Chilika, he added. Several birds are also seen to fly in the sky near Chilika without settling on the lake. They might land once the water level recedes in the lake, Nayak said, adding, \"We expected their number might be in large by the end of the current month.\" The winged guests mostly from beyond the Himalayas in Northern Eurasia, Caspian region, Siberia, Kazakh, Lake Baikal and remote areas of Russia and neighbouring countries visit the Chilika lake every winter and start their homeward journey before the onset of summer in the second week of March. In the last winter, a total of 11,37,759 birds of 187 species visited Chilika and the majority of them settled in the Nalabana sanctuary area inside the lake. To prevent bird poaching in the lake during the period, the wildlife division has set up 21 temporary camps in the lake. They have also hired around a dozen boats for patrolling in the lake. Besides, they have decided to make surveillance through drones like the previous year. The camps have already started functioning from October 1 and will continue till the end of March. With the setting up of the camps, patrolling was also intensified in the lake. The drive to create awareness among the people to prevent bird poaching was also launched in the vulnerable areas, said the forest official.",

He said that the political families in these MVA and INDIA only want to come to power, asserting that Congress can\u2019t walk together with its allies. Naqvi further attacked the Congress and said that the opposition party didn\u2019t give importance to small and regional parties. He suggested that Congress should learn from BJP and Narendra Modi in handling the allies. While speaking on the seat-sharing tussle of INDIA Alliance in Jharkhand and MVA in Maharashtra, Naqvi said, \u201cBe it Jharkhand or Maharashtra, there is more of \u2018siyasi khurpench\u2019 than \u2018seats ka pench\u2019. Be it Aghadi or alliance, their \u2018khaandani khiladi\u2019 have the same aspiration \u2013 to come into power. Today, whichever alliance will be led by Congress party will have \u2018pench\u2019 as well as \u2018khurpench\u2019 because Congress has no DNA or mindset to walk ahead together with all allies. Congress thinks that small parties and regional parties have no importance.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) had earlier announced that elections in Maharashtra are to be held on November 20 and the counting for all 288 assembly constituencies will be held on November 23. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, while Shiv Sena won 56 seats and the Congress won 44 seats.

The victim's father wrote an email to Amit Shah on his birthday and sought time from him to get guidance on the ways to get the case expedited and get justice for his daughter. In the letter, the victim's father said that the family were \"under tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless\". \"After that heinous unforeseen incident happened to our daughter, we have been going through tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless. I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you and gain your insights on the issue, as I believe your experience and guidance would be invaluable,\" the victim's father wrote in the email. Massive protests broke out after the rape-murder of the trainee doctor in Kolkata. Doctors went on strike demanding better working conditions and guarantees of safety. Doctors all over the country took to the streets demanding action against the accused. Sanjay Roy, believed to be the main accused in the case, was arrested, and the case was handed over to the CBI. The CBI, in its investigation, refuted claims of a gangrape and stated that Sanjay Roy committed the crime alone. Over 45 senior doctors and faculty members of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital collectively resigned in solidarity with their junior colleagues, who were protesting against the murder of the trainee doctor. In their resignation letters, the senior doctors stated that the demands of the junior doctors had not been addressed and that there had been \"no progress\" in the investigation of the trainee doctor\u2019s rape and murder.Furthermore, junior doctors, who sat on a hunger strike in protest against the government ended their strike on Monday after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The doctors, who had been demanding better working conditions and infrastructure improvements in the healthcare sector, also announced the withdrawal of the general medical strike they had earlier called.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) leader Sanjay Raut dropped a bombshell, alleging that the cash was part of a massive \u20b975 crore fund being distributed by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to his party candidates. Raut claimed the seized \u20b95 crore was just the tip of the iceberg, insisting that \u20b915 crore was in transit, but only \u20b95 crore was officially accounted for. According to Raut, the cash was on its way to Shinde\u2019s loyal MLA, Shahjibapu Patil, in Sangola, Solapur district.\n\nHowever, MLA Patil vehemently denied any involvement, branding the accusations as slanderous. \u201cEver since we broke away from Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s Shiv Sena, they\u2019ve been targeting us. I have no knowledge of the cash or the people carrying it,\u201d Patil said, calling Raut\u2019s claims an act of political vendetta. The car carrying the money has been impounded, and four individuals are now being grilled by police at the Rajgad police station.\n\nCash in Stream\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2014this explosive cash drama takes an even more bizarre twist. Far from the police checkpoints, in the sleepy town of Atpadi in Sangli, a different kind of treasure hunt was unfolding. Just before Diwali, the quiet banks of a local stream near the Ambabai temple transformed into a chaotic scene as rumors spread of cash notes flowing in the water. \n\nShocked villagers rushed to the site, scooping up thousands of rupees as they fished currency notes from the stream, unsure where the sudden windfall came from. Videos of the surreal event went viral, adding to the mounting mystery. As locals scramble for answers, police are now investigating the source of this aquatic cash flow.\n\nMeanwhile, in the midst of the frenzy, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MLA Rohit Pawar fired yet another salvo at the ruling BJP-led alliance, accusing them of resorting to cash-for-votes tactics. \u201cLike in the Lok Sabha elections, they are trying to buy votes with dirty money, but the people of Maharashtra won\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Pawar declared. He confidently asserted that this \u201ccorruption money\u201d wouldn\u2019t be enough to secure power for the ruling coalition.",

        "text": "Congress MP Kumari Selja on Tuesday welcomed Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s decision to enter full-time electoral politics, expressing her happiness that Gandhi will contest the upcoming elections from Wayanad.Selja criticised the BJP, claiming that they attempt to communalize issues where they face electoral challenges. \u201cThe BJP always communalizes issues where they are losing. This is an old tactic of the BJP. The country has been waiting for a long time. There has been a nationwide demand for Priyanka to enter full-time politics and contest elections. We are happy that she is going to fight from Wayanad. Today is the nomination day, and I wish her all the best. I am confident she will win there with record votes,\u201d she said. The senior Congress leader added, \u201cThe Minister said that machines should not overpower humanity. The Election Commission must pay attention to this. The issue of EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) has been raised repeatedly, and it is their responsibility to ensure that there should be no doubt anywhere in the country. Everything must be completely fair.\u201d Earlier, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met party chief Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi on Monday to discuss campaign strategies as she prepares to file her nomination for the by-elections in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Wayanad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23. After the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Wayanad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also be present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. After being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. The election commission also announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. If Priyanka Gandhi wins from Wayanad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. Gandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation councillor. Rahul Gandhi had said both Rae Bareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Rae Bareli before entering active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party. Meanwhile, Congress appointed Saral Patel as the media coordinator for Wayanad ahead of the by-election with immediate effect",

        "title": "India-China Agreement Explained: After 4 Years Eastern Ladakh Border Standoff Resolves - Key Details",
        "text": "In a significant development that could mark a turning point in India-China relations, China officially confirmed on October 22, 2024, that it had reached a resolution with India to resolve the prolonged border standoff in eastern Ladakh. This breakthrough comes after years of military tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which escalated in 2020 and has remained a source of concern in regional geopolitics.Diplomatic and Military Dialogue Yields ResultsChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced the resolution at a press briefing in Beijing, stating that China and India had been in close communication through both diplomatic and military channels to address the border issues.Over a recent period, China and India have been in close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues related to the China-India border, Lin Jian stated. Now the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters, which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions.While the Chinese government did not provide specifics of the agreement, the news comes as a positive step towards resolving one of the most tense and dangerous flashpoints in the region.Indias Announcement of DisengagementIndia, too, confirmed that the disengagement process with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh had been completed. On October 21, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that an agreement had been reached on restoring patrolling rights along the LAC, a key aspect of the border tension that had been unresolved since the violent clashes in 2020.Jaishankar said, We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed... We will be able to resume the patrolling that we were doing in 2020. I think its a good development.The disengagement likely covers the critical areas of Depsang and Demchok, regions that had been points of contention since the military standoff began over four years ago. These areas hold strategic importance due to their proximity to supply routes and military outposts.The Four-Year-Long Standoff: A Brief OverviewThe border dispute between India and China reached its peak in June 2020, when both nations troops engaged in violent clashes in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops. The skirmish, fought with sticks, stones, and improvised weapons, was the deadliest confrontation between the two countries in over four decades and marked a major escalation in a border conflict that had simmered for decades.Since then, both sides have maintained a heightened military presence along the disputed areas, particularly in eastern Ladakh. While rounds of diplomatic and military talks followed, they failed to produce any tangible results until now. The lack of a clear demarcation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and competing territorial claims have made the situation highly volatile.BRICS Summit and Potential for Improved Bilateral TiesThe announcement of the agreement coincides with the ongoing 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping were expected to discuss bilateral issues on the sidelines of the summit. While the specific details of their conversation are yet to be disclosed, the confirmation of the border agreement points to a broader effort to improve relations between the two Asian giants.When asked about the bilateral meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, We will keep you updated if anything comes up, indicating the possibility of further developments in the India-China relationship.This agreement could serve as a catalyst for broader discussions aimed at stabilizing bilateral ties, which have been strained since the Galwan Valley clashes. Both sides appear keen to avoid further military confrontations and work towards peaceful coexistence, at least in the immediate future.Historical Context of the India-China Border DisputeThe India-China border dispute dates back to the early years of post-colonial India. The two nations share a 3,488-kilometer-long border, much of which is not clearly demarcated, leading to frequent skirmishes and confrontations. The most significant conflict between the two nations occurred in 1962, when China defeated India in a brief but decisive war over disputed territories in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.Since then, tensions have flared periodically, with both sides accusing the other of transgressing into their territory. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash was a stark reminder of how quickly such tensions can escalate into violence, even in an era of nuclear deterrence.The recent standoff in eastern Ladakh added another layer of complexity to the border issue, as both nations were forced to divert military resources to maintain an uneasy peace in the region.Implications of the AgreementThe successful resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff could have far-reaching implications for regional stability. Here are some of the key takeaways:Resumption of Patrolling: India will now be able to resume patrolling in areas along the LAC, particularly in Depsang and Demchok, where both sides had fortified their positions.Easing of Military Tensions: With the disengagement process complete, both India and China can now focus on reducing their military presence in the region, potentially lowering the risk of accidental escalations or clashes.Bilateral Cooperation: The agreement signals a willingness on both sides to resolve disputes through dialogue rather than military force. This could pave the way for broader discussions on trade, security, and regional cooperation.Geopolitical Impact: With both India and China being key players in regional and global politics, their ability to manage bilateral relations peacefully will have a stabilizing effect on South Asia and beyond.Strategic Positioning: The resolution allows India to focus more on other security concerns, such as its borders with Pakistan and internal issues, while China can turn its attention to other geopolitical interests, such as its ambitions in the South China Sea.Future ChallengesWhile the agreement marks a major step forward, several challenges remain. The border between India and China is still not clearly defined, and periodic confrontations could arise in the future. Additionally, the resolution does not address broader territorial claims, such as Chinas claims over Arunachal Pradesh, which remains a contentious issue.The effectiveness of this agreement will depend largely on how both nations implement the disengagement process and manage future disagreements along the LAC. Continued dialogue and trust-building measures will be critical in preventing future flare-ups.Conclusion: A New Chapter in India-China Relations?The resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff is being hailed as a diplomatic victory for both India and China. It marks the end of one of the most tense periods in their bilateral relationship in recent history.

        "title": "PCOS: Watch Out For These Common Myths",
        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age, causing a variety of symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, excessive levels of androgens (male hormones), and the presence of small cysts on the ovaries. The exact cause of PCOS is unclear, but it is often linked to insulin resistance, genetics, and inflammation. Symptoms may include weight gain, acne, hair thinning, and difficulty in conceiving. While PCOS can lead to complications like infertility and metabolic issues, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medical treatments. There are various myths surrounding PCOS, read on to find out the most common ones.\n\nCommon myths about PCOS\n\n1. Myth: PCOS always causes infertility\n\nMany women with PCOS worry that they won't be able to have children. However, PCOS doesn't make pregnancy impossible. It can make conception more difficult due to irregular ovulation, but with proper medical treatment and lifestyle changes, many women with PCOS can conceive.\n\n2. Myth: You need to have cysts on your ovaries to have PCOS\n\nDespite its name, not all women with PCOS have ovarian cysts. The term \"polycystic\" refers to the appearance of the ovaries in some women, but PCOS is primarily a hormonal imbalance and doesn't necessarily require the presence of cysts.\n\n3. Myth: PCOS only affects overweight women\n\nWhile weight gain is a common symptom, PCOS can affect women of all body types. Lean women can also suffer from PCOS and may face challenges related to hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, and insulin resistance.\n\n4. Myth: Weight loss can cure PCOS\n\nWeight loss can help alleviate some symptoms of PCOS, particularly for those who are overweight, but it is not a cure. PCOS is a chronic condition that can be managed but not entirely eliminated. Even women at a healthy weight can have PCOS.\n\n5. Myth: Irregular periods are the only symptom of PCOS\n\nPCOS is more than just irregular periods. It can also cause symptoms such as acne, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), hair thinning, and insulin resistance. The condition affects multiple systems in the body, not just the reproductive system.\n\n6. Myth: PCOS goes away after menopause\n\nPCOS does not disappear after menopause. While some symptoms, like irregular periods, may no longer be an issue, other symptoms such as insulin resistance, metabolic issues, and an increased risk of heart disease can continue into later life.\n\n7. Myth: Birth control pills cure PCOS\n\nBirth control pills are often used to manage PCOS symptoms, such as regulating periods and reducing acne, but they do not cure the condition. They help manage symptoms temporarily, and stopping them usually leads to the return of symptoms.\n\n8. Myth: PCOS is a rare condition\n\nPCOS is actually quite common, affecting about 1 in 10 women worldwide. Many women go undiagnosed because symptoms can vary widely and mimic other conditions, leading to a lack of proper diagnosis and awareness.\n\n9. Myth: Diet alone can fix PCOS\n\nWhile a healthy diet is essential for managing PCOS symptoms, it is not always enough on its own. PCOS often requires a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, hormonal treatments. A balanced diet can improve insulin sensitivity and help with weight management, but it may not resolve all symptoms.\n\nKeep these points in mind if you have or might have PCOS.\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Beirut: Lebanon\u2019s state media reported Israeli airstrikes near the southern city of Tyre on Tuesday, shortly after Israel's military issued an evacuation warning. Video footage showed smoke rising after Israel warned residents of Al-Hawsh, just south of Tyre, to evacuate. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that \"enemy aircraft launched a series of strikes\" on the area. This escalation comes after Lebanon's health ministry revised the death toll from an Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Beirut on Monday night, stating that 13 people, including a child, were killed. The previous estimate had been four. The strike, which took place near the Rafik Hariri Hospital, Lebanon\u2019s largest public health facility, also left 57 people injured and flattened four buildings in the area, according to reports. Rescuers were still searching for survivors under the rubble on Tuesday, as locals described hearing a cell phone ringing beneath the debris. Monday night\u2019s strike followed Israel's evacuation warnings and targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The Ouzai neighborhood, minutes away from the Jnah area, was hit for the first time in the conflict, sparking an exodus of residents. No warnings were issued for the densely populated area around Rafik Hariri Hospital, which has seen an influx of displaced people from southern Lebanon. Lebanese authorities report that nearly a month of war between Israel and Hezbollah has claimed at least 1,489 lives in Lebanon, with more than a million people displaced, many of whom have fled to neighboring Syria. The ongoing conflict has heavily strained shelters and relief efforts. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel to push for a ceasefire, as diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza and Lebanon conflicts continue.",

The police department has been instructed to immediately communicate these orders to all arms license holders. They must ensure that the weapons are returned to their owners in the same condition as they were surrendered after the deposit period ends.\n\nMumbai: MMRDA To Expand Railway Flyover Near Shahad Station On Kalyan-Ahilyanagar Route, Floats \u20b9320 Crore Tender\n\nBritish Man Who Once Tasted Jhal Muri During Kolkata Trip Is Now Viral Chaatwala In London\n\nMumbai: Edutainment Park To Come Up On 4 Acre Land At DN Nagar In Andheri (West)\n\nIndian Airlines Face Bomb Threats On 30 Domestic & International Flights, Authorities On High Alert\n\nPune: Traffic Diversions Announced In City Ahead Of Diwali\n\nAny violation of this order will result in legal action under Section 223 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nFollow us on\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\nPune District Collector Suhas Diwase Orders Surrender Of Licensed Weapons Ahead Of Assembly Polls\n\nAttention Punekars!

She was barely a child of 3.5 years of age, however, instead of showing any love, affection and protection to the victim, the convict, on the contrary, made her a victim of lust,\" it noted.The court found it a \"clear case\" of betrayal.Apart from Pocso law, the man was convicted under Section 376 AB (punishment for committing rape on a woman under 12 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code.In addition to the 20-year RI, the court saddled the convict with Rs 50,000 fine and awarded Rs 1.2 lakh compensation to the minor survivor.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: The Bombay high court refused pre-arrest bail to a man who allegedly thrashed a 71-year-old man on suspicion that the latter was carrying beef on a train both were travelling. A single bench of Justice R N Laddha, in the order dated October 18, refused anticipatory bail to Akash Avhad, while noting that the elderly man was \"mercilessly assaulted\".The high court said that his custodial interrogation may be required as the investigation in the case was at an initial stage.\"The informant (victim), a senior citizen aged about 71 years, was assaulted mercilessly. The investigation is at a nascent stage. Thus, to facilitate further investigation, custodial interrogation of the applicant (Avhad) would be necessary,\" the court was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The court further added that giving relief to Avhad in the form of pre-arrest bail could \"jeopardise the course of effective investigation\".The accused moved court fearing that he may be arrested again as the cops invoked fresh charges against him under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita. The charges included sections mandating punishment if someone intentionally hurts the religious feelings of another person through words, gestures, or objects and dacoity and causes grievous hurt.What is the case?On August 28, the 71-year-old man was travelling from Chalisgaon to Kalyan on the Dhule-CSMT (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) express. Upon the train reaching the Kalyan railway station, when he picked up his bag to alight, a few passengers suspected him of carrying beef and stopped him.Despite explaining what he carried was buffalo meat, which is not banned in Maharashtra, the men abused and thrashed him.The police have claimed that Avhad recorded the assault on his mobile phone.The bench, in its order, noted that the victim was assaulted by five to six unknown men, including Avhad, over a jar of alleged beef.After the incident, the man registered a case at Thane police station. The accused, however, were later released on bail.\"The applicant (Avhad) and the others restrained the informant (victim) from alighting at Kalyan railway station and assaulted and threatened to kill him. Prima facie, there is material to indicate that the applicant assaulted the informant and recorded the assault on his mobile phone,\" the court said.",
        "summary": "The Bombay high court has denied pre-arrest bail to Akash Avhad, accused of assaulting a 71-year-old man on suspicion of carrying beef. The court emphasized that Avhad's custodial interrogation is essential for the ongoing investigation, which involves serious charges including hurting religious sentiments. The victim man registered a case at Thane police station.",

        "title": "Video Does Not Show Shooter of Baba Siddique Giving a Press Conference",
        "text": "A video of a man talking to the press with police personnel around him is circulating on social media. It is being claimed that he shot politician Baba Siddique. Siddique, a close aide of actor Salman Khan and Nationalist Congress Party (Ajit Pawar faction) leader was shot and killed by people allegedly with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang on 12 October. What does the man say?: Speaking to the press, the man said that Siddique was not a good man. He added that there were charges against him under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). It is said that he was associated with Dawood Ibrahim, the man behind the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts. He also added details about the number of members in Bishnoi's gang, how they are contacted and how he became a part of this nexus. (Archives of similar claims can be found here and here.)Fact-Check: Old Clip of Pappu Yadav Crying Falsely Linked to Baba Siddique CaseIs this true?: The person in the video is Yogesh alias Raju, who is allegedly a part of the Bishnoi gang. He was arrested on 16 October in connection to the murder of Nadir Shah, a gym owner in Delhi. Mumbai Police have arrested around 10 individuals in Siddique's case. Yogesh is not named as one of the suspects.Devendra Fadnavis\u2019 Poster With Gun Falsely Linked to Baba Siddique MurderWhat we found: At first, we ran a Google reverse image search on one of the frames of the video and came across the clip on the official X page of News24 from 18 October. We, then, ran a relevant keyword search and came across multiple news reports about an arrest related to a murder case in Delhi. An Indian Express report from 18 October stated that Delhi police arrested the second suspect in the shooting of gym owner Nadir Shah in Greater Kailash-1. The report noted the suspect's name as Yogesh alias Raju, who was apprehended during a short confrontation on the Mathura highway. They mentioned that he suffered a gunshot wound to his left leg during the gun battle and was treated at a facility in the city. The Indian Express quoting police officials stated that Yogesh was part of Bishnoi's nexus. Seven suspects - Akash Yadav, Nitalesh Tiwari, Vishal Verma, Naveen Baliyan, Mohammed Sajid, Pankaj Kumar, and Sachin Yadav had already been arrested. Old Video of Vivek Oberoi Praising Bishnoi Community Viral as RecentDelhi police comments: Taking to its official X page, the capital's police stated that it had arrested the main shooter in the GK gym murder case, with the help of Mathura police. The Special Cell of Delhi Police also posted on its X page, stating. \"Yogesh Raju, a sharp shooter of Lawrence Bishnoi & Hasim Baba gang arrested by Special Cell (SR) in a joint operation with Mathura Police. He was involved in the murder of Nadir Shah of South Delhi. 01 pistol, 07 live cartridges & a stolen bike recovered.\" (sic) Baba Siddique case: Mumbai police have arrested the two alleged shooters Gurmail Baljit Singh (23) and Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap (19), Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23) and Pravin Lonkar. Five other arrests of the following - Nitin Gautam Sapre (32), Sambhaji Kisan Pardhi (44), Pradeep Dattu Thombre (37), Chetan Dilip Pardhi (27), and Ram Fulchand Kanoujia (43) - have been made in the case. However, the alleged primary shooter, Shivkumar Gautam, along with conspirators Shubham Lonkar and Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar, remain at large. Mumbai police has not named Yogesh as one of the suspects. A report by India Today from 19 October stated that he did not have links with Siddique's murder. The Quint has reached out to Delhi police to confirm the same. Conclusion: The person in the video is not related to the murder of Siddique, but the killing of Nadir Shah.

Twenty of them are Muslims.\n\nThey were asked to vacate their properties in three days as per provisions of the Road Control Act, 1964.\n\nOne of the shops that received an eviction notice belongs to 62-year-old jeweller Abdul Hameed, who was allegedly involved in the killing of a 22-year-old named Ram Gopal Mishra last Sunday.\n\nThe incident led to riots in Bahraich. A total of 104 people have been arrested in connection with the violence.\n\nIn response to a petition challenging the notices, the Supreme Court cautioned the state\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party government against carrying out any demolition works in violation of its past orders.\n\nOn September 17, the Supreme Court stayed all demolitions in the country until further notice without its permission. In a subsequent hearing, the court said: \u201cWe will clarify demolition can\u2019t be carried out merely because someone is an accused or convict.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they [Uttar Pradesh government] want to take risk of flouting our order, it\u2019s their choice,\u201d said the bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan on Tuesday.\n\nThe Allahabad High Court on Sunday granted 15 days to the 23 residents to respond to the demolition notices. The High Court is scheduled to hear a plea filed in connection with the demolition notices on Wednesday.\n\nThere are no provisions in Indian law that allow for the demolition of property as a punitive measure. Nevertheless, the practice has become commonplace mainly in states ruled by the BJP.\n\nAuthorities in four BJP-ruled states and one Aam Aadmi Party-governed state punitively bulldozed 128 structures, mostly belonging to Muslims, between April 2022 and June 2022, human rights group Amnesty International said in a report in February.\n\nAnother FIR filed based on complaint by BJP MLA\n\nThe police in Bahraich have registered another FIR related to the communal violence, bringing the number of cases to 12, officials said on Monday.\n\nThe latest case, based on a complaint by Sureshwar Singh, the BJP MLA from Mahasi. The FIR names seven individuals including the Hindutva party\u2019s city youth wing chief Arpit Srivastava, for rioting and other charges.\n\nSingh has alleged that Srivastava led a mob that attacked his group on October 13 when Mishra\u2019s body was being taken to a mortuary. This led to clashes in which stones were thrown and guns fired.\n\nSingh urged the police to review security camera footage to identify more rioters involved in the clashes.\n\nThe FIR, registered on October 18, names Srivastava, Anuj Singh Raikwar, Shubham Mishra, Kushmendra Chaudhary, Manish Chandra Shukla, Pundrik Pandey and Sudhanshu Singh Rana.",

        "text": "With a semifinal spot already secured, India will look to reaffirm their dominance when they take on Bangladesh in their final Group A match of the SAFF Women's Championship in Kathmandu on Wednesday. For Bangladesh, this is a do-or-die clash. A win would crown them group champions, while a defeat would see Pakistan advance to the semifinals, with a superior goal difference. Pakistan, also on four points, would join India in the semifinals if the Blue Tigresses triumph. A draw would leave Bangladesh as group runners-up with four points, but they need a victory to top the group.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The Blue Tigresses clinched their place in the semifinals with a commanding 5-2 victory over Pakistan but now their focus shifts to topping the group and avenging a painful memory of 2022.In that edition, Bangladesh dealt a shocking blow on India by ending their unbeaten streak in the championship with a decisive 3-0 win in the group stage.It marked the first time India had lost to their South Asian rivals in SAFF history, and the Blue Tigresses will be eager to set the record straight.\"We have faced Bangladesh before, and we watched their last game against Pakistan. Our sole focus now is to win this match,\" skipper Bala Devi said.\"We have both senior and young players and we are prepared to push for a win. We have had productive training sessions, and I hope we can put what we have practiced into action.\" \"As the captain, I aim to lead by example and support the team in every way. Bangladesh has some fast and youthful players, but I believe our mental strength gives us an edge, which will be crucial in tomorrow's game,\" added the 34-year-old from Manipur.Head coach Santosh Kashyap has led the team through five days of training in Kathmandu, preparing for the challenges that lie ahead against Bangladesh.He has carefully assessed all the potential threats posed by the opposition.\"Tomorrow's match will be challenging, as Bangladesh are a strong side with a foreign coach and have solid tactical plans. Although we have already booked a spot in the semi-finals, we are taking it one game at a time, aiming to win every match.\"I prefer playing attacking football because it's not only effective but also entertaining for everyone. It's a style that I, as well as the players, enjoy, and we will try to maintain that momentum,\" Kashyap said.Defender Dalima Chhibber, who was named the Most Valuable Player in the 2019 SAFF Women's Championship, is making her return to the tournament after missing the 2022 edition.She was absent last time due to playing three seasons in Canada, but now she's back and ready to compete in the SAFF Championship once again.Bangladesh and Pakistan are currently tied on one point each after a 1-1 draw in their group-stage match.For Bangladesh, the absence of coach Golam Rabbani Choton, along with key players like defender Akhi Khatun and Anai Mogini, will be felt.However, the team have brought in fresh talents, including young players such as Afeida Khandakar, Matsushima Sumaya, and Airin Khatun.\"We are coming up against an Indian team, who, in my opinion, are probably the best team in the tournament,\" Bangladesh head coach Peter Butler said.\"They are very disciplined and organised in their manner and their demeanour of actually how they walk around the hotel. I think it'll be quite an attacking game. The most important thing is to try and share out the workload with all our players.\"It's a do or die game. It's a game we don't want to lose. India's already booked their semi-final berth and I'm quietly optimistic,\" he added.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

This facility is said to become useful for enabling UPI payments in emergencies and isolated regions. It is also rolling out an encrypted communications platform for government and relief agencies which may come in use in times of crisis. This service will leverage balloon-based and drone-based systems to widen the coverage in disaster-struck areas.\r\n\r\nThe telecom provider has also announced a partnership with C-DAC for the introduction of a private 5G network for mining services. It will enable artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT applications in underground and opencast mines. The high-speed, low latency connectivity is claimed to benefit safety analytics, real-time control of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), remote maintenance courtesy of augmented reality (AR), and fleet tracking and optimisation.\r\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

        "text": "Eight students from Balochistan have reportedly gone missing from their shared residence in Gulistan-i-Jauhar in Pakistan\u2019s biggest city Karachi, according to a report by Dawn. Family members allege that law enforcement agencies \u201ctook away\u201d the students, but police have declined to comment on these allegations.According to reports, the missing students\u2013Shoaib Ali, Haneef, Ishfaq , Shahzad, Bebarg Ameer, Zubair, Qambar Ali, and Saeedullah disappeared on October 16. Three of them are enrolled at Karachi University, three attend a seminary, one is an intermediate student, and another studies at Urdu University. Families maintain that the students were picked up by law enforcement from their residence in Rustam Zikri Goth.Talking to Dawn, Wazir Ahmed, the elder brother of missing student Qambar Ali, stated, \u201cQambar is an intermediate student in Mashkey, Awaran, but he was taking coaching classes at a tuition academy near Nipa.\u201d He, along with the families of other missing students, approached the police on October 17, but the SHO refused to file their report. Ahmed emphasised that they have no political affiliations or involvement in any suspicious activities, demanding the immediate release of the students.In response to the situation, Riaz Ahmed, a member of the Karachi University syndicate, condemned the disappearances, stating, \u201cIt is horrifying that students are apprehended and made to disappear without charges. Young students should not be subjected to the harsh realities of state actions.\u201dThe issue of enforced appearances is a significant human rights concern that reflects the broader challenges facing the region. In Balochistan, enforced disappearances have been reported extensively, with individuals, often activists, political leaders, and students, going missing under mysterious circumstances, frequently attributed to state security forces or non-state actors.These disappearances create a climate of fear and insecurity, impacting the social fabric of communities. Families of the disappeared face immense challenges, including emotional distress and a lack of access to justice. The government has been criticized for its insufficient response to these cases, with many families left without answers about the fate of their loved ones.",

While 293.81 kg of heroin was seized from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port (Navi Mumbai) by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Delhi police Special Cell had impounded 352.71 kg of drugs from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana.\n\nAccording to the ED, the arrested people coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. \n\n\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder. The accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED uncovered a highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions and operational expenses by the accused has been made, said the agency. \n\nThe accused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. \n\n\u201cThe syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local market. Further, the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles...from second-hand market for supplying the drugs from the storage hubs to other points of distribution,\u201d said an official. \n\nThe agency said cash was used for purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities. \n\n\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via Nava Sheva port, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri (Madhya Pradesh) and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. The transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED has attached a property in Jandoli village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of the accused and fixed deposits.",

        "text": "Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) president Anbumani Ramadoss on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) urged the State government to drop the Transport Department\u2019s proposal to hire and operate private buses on a contractual basis during the Deepavali festival, expressing concern that it would lead to privatisation.\n\nIn a statement, he said the State government had announced last month that it would operate private buses on a contractual basis during festivals to cater to the needs of commuters. \u201cTransport Minister S.S. Sivasankar had recently announced that the Department would operate private buses by hiring them at \u20b951.25 per kilometre on a rental basis for the Deepavali festival. Operating private buses on behalf of the State government under the guise of people\u2019s convenience cannot be allowed,\u201d Mr. Anbumani said.\n\n\u201cThough the State government had said it would operate only a limited number of private buses, the reasons given by it are false. The private buses will be operated on a Gross Cost Contract basis. Initially, this system will be implemented only on additional buses. But in the future, it is likely that when there is a need to replace old buses operated by transport corporations, they will be replaced by private buses without purchasing new buses,\u201d he alleged.\n\nHe further said: \u201cLack of buses has been created only to impose private buses onto transport corporations. After the DMK came to power, it ordered 8,182 buses but procured only 1,088 buses. Why is there a delay in purchasing new buses?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the State government has any real intention to develop the transport corporations, it should allocate sufficient funds to purchase buses and recruit drivers and conductors,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "The Caribbean nation of Cuba has been left reeling in the aftermath of Hurricane Oscar, with at least six lives lost and large parts of the country plunged into an ongoing electricity blackout. The capital city of Havana has been largely paralyzed for several days as residents and business struggle without power. Other regions are now bracing for a fourth night without lights as repair efforts continue.\n\nHurricane Oscar made landfall on Cuba's eastern coast over the weekend as a tropical storm, bringing strong winds and heavy rains. In its wake, preliminary reports indicate at least six deaths have occurred. Beyond loss of life, the hurricane has exacerbated an existing energy crisis on the island. A massive outage first hit on Thursday and remains unresolved, halting daily activities across Cuba. The prolonged lack of power has renewed frustrations among some in the population.\n\nIn a handful of neighborhoods in Havana, small protests have emerged. Demonstrators have been heard banging pots and pans in the streets or staging demonstrations from their balconies. One group blocked a road using garbage in an apparent expression of discontent. The demonstrations come amidst a time of deep economic troubles in Cuba, which some partially attribute to a long-standing US embargo. Though small so far, any unrest is being closely monitored by authorities.\n\nCuba's Energy Minister stated hopes that reliable electricity may return in the next couple days. However, damage from both the hurricane and pre-existing infrastructure problems could prolong the blackout. Schools and many workplaces will also stay closed through mid-week. Officials are asking the public to conserve power however possible until full restoration is achieved. Meanwhile, residents do what they can to cope with the aftermath of the deadly storm and resulting drawn out period in the dark.",

        "title": "'Sexually Abused Minors Most Vulnerable; Statutory Rights Key to Empowerment': Allahabad HC Denies Bail to Man Accused of Trafficking Daughter",
        "text": "The Allahabad High Court recently emphasised the critical importance of ensuring statutory rights for child victims under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, stating that realisation of these rights is the key to empowering them to engage with the legal process on a fair footing.\nWhile hearing a bail plea in a child abuse case, the court expressed concern that the victim, despite being a minor entitled to multiple protections under the POCSO Act, had not been made aware of her rights. The case records revealed that no support person or legal aid was provided, and the State failed to ensure the victim had access to government schemes, medical care, or counselling services.\nThe bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot remarked that child victims of sexual abuse belong to the most vulnerable class of citizens. They are often hindered in their pursuit of justice by circumstances such as trauma, social marginalisation, poverty, and a lack of legal awareness, it added.\nThe court observed that without the support systems guaranteed by the POCSO Act, child victims are unable to prosecute their cases effectively.\nEmpowering these victims, the court stressed, is vital to dismantling the barriers that impede their search for justice, and this can only be achieved by ensuring the enforcement of their statutory rights, the single-judge bench emphasised.\nThe court further emphasised that authorities\u2014including the police, Child Welfare Committees (CWC), District Legal Services Authorities, and medical and administrative bodies\u2014are obligated under the POCSO Act to provide victims with essential support services, such as legal aid, medical specialists, and access to government welfare schemes.\nThe court also noted that the responsibility is cast on the courts/magistrates considering the bail applications in POCSO offences to ensure that entitlements of the victims are provided and the rights conferred by the said enactment are enforced.\nJustice Bhanot pointed out that the rights and entitlements of victims under the POCSO Act must be safeguarded not only during bail proceedings but throughout the trial process.\nHe stressed that Child Welfare Committees, medical authorities, and police officials must be brought under the jurisdiction of the trial courts to ensure they fulfil their statutory duties.\nThese bodies must submit reports detailing the support provided to victims, and trial courts are legally bound to review these reports and ensure compliance with the POCSO Act, the court stressed.\n\u201cThe above mandate of the POCSO Act has to be rigorously followed and meticulously implemented,\u201d the court said.\nThe court warned that the current implementation is inadequate and risks frustrating the legislative intent behind the law. \u201cLegislation cannot be reduced to a dead letter by the apathy of the statutory authorities\u201d, it said.\nAccordingly, the court directed the Uttar Pradesh Secretary of the Department of Women and Child Development to create standardised formats for the reports that Child Welfare Committees must submit during bail hearings.\nThese reports should detail the support extended to victims, including counselling, legal aid, and access to government schemes. The court also ordered that regular training programs be conducted for CWC members to ensure compliance with the Act.\nIn the case at hand, the court denied bail to Rajendra Prasad, who is accused of trafficking his 14-year-old daughter for sexual exploitation.\nPrasad, who had been in custody since November 2022, had applied for bail on charges under Sections 376 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 16 and 17 of the POCSO Act.\nThe court rejected his bail application, citing the victim\u2019s vulnerability and the fact that she had identified Prasad as the principal offender who trafficked her for money.",

        "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday had a light-hearted moment when a lawyer accidentally referred to Justice Hrishikesh Roy as Justice Hrishikesh Mukherjee, mixing up the judge\u2019s name with that of the legendary filmmaker. Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud immediately corrected the lawyer, reminding him that it's essential for an advocate to know the names of the judges. While referring a previous case, the lawyer said, \"This matter was before Justice Hrishikesh Mukherjee.\" Chandrachud, quick to step in, humorously responded, \u201cHrishikesh Mukherjee or Justice Hrishikesh Roy? If you make Roy into Mukherjee, then... you must know your judges. This is the limit. Please go and check the website.\u201d The mix-up was particularly amusing because Hrishikesh Mukherjee is one of Indian cinema's most beloved filmmakers, known for his timeless films like Anand, Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Guddi, Bawarchi, and Abhimaan. His movies, which blended humor, emotion, and subtle social commentary, continue to be adored across generations. Justice Hrishikesh Roy, who took oath as a Supreme Court judge in September 2019, has had a distinguished career. Before his Supreme Court appointment, he served as the Chief Justice of Kerala High Court and as a judge in the Gauhati High Court. Prior to his judicial role, he was a senior lawyer. Despite the amusing slip-up, the Chief Justice's light correction ensured the moment ended with a smile, adding a touch of humor to the court proceedings.",

The parody account mocks Sitharaman's role as the finance minister and there was mixed reaction towards it from the netizens.

The bio reads: \"\u201cI don\u2019t believe in love at first sight, but I do believe in GST on everything you own. I\u2019ve raised more taxes than your ex raised red flags. Swipe right if you're into women who can deduct happiness, itemize suffering, and maximize your stress. I'm not your girlfriend; I'm your liability.\" The profile has more quirky description.

        "text": "Uncertainty shocks for India tend to mimic aggregate supply shocks, with heightened uncertainty leading to slower growth but higher inflation, said RBI Deputy Governor Michael D Patra, even as he emphasised that this presents a dilemma for monetary policy -- tighten to control high inflation or ease to respond to lower growth.\n\n Applying a one standard deviation shock to the (text mining-based policy uncertainty) index in a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework on quarterly data for India produces an interesting result. In the case of advanced economies such as the US, research suggests that uncertainty shocks lead to lower output and lower prices.\n\nAlso read: RBI imposes restrictions on Asirvad Micro Finance, Arohan Financial Services, DMI Finance and Navi Finserv\n\n \u201cIn the Indian context, however, uncertainty shocks tend to mimic aggregate supply shocks such that heightened uncertainty leads to slower growth but higher inflation\u201d Patra said in his inaugural address at the New York Fed Central Banking Seminar organised by the Federal Reserve Bank, New York, USA.\n\nIndia\u2019s time has come\n\nThe Deputy Governor emphasised that he does believe with all the strength of his conviction that India\u2019s time has come. \n\n \u201cIndia heads into its future with the youngest population in the world with a median age of 28 years. Unlike in many parts of the world, the working age population is growing \u2013 every sixth working age person is an Indian,\u201d he said. \n\nPatra noted that since independence in 1947, India\u2019s growth path has undergone three structural shifts with trend growth, having risen to 7 per cent during 2002-2019. \n\nAlso read: India\u2019s overall growth outlook remains strong despite temporary dip in momentum: RBI Bulletin\n\n After the severe contraction in the pandemic, a new growth trajectory averaging 8 per cent seems to be forming during 2021-24, he added. \n\nGrowth to revert to 8% trend\n\n \u201cIndia is now regarded as the fastest growing major economy in the world. Already the fifth largest economy in terms of market exchange rates, it is poised to become the third largest economy by 2030.\n\n \u201cIt is already the third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. Our projections show that India\u2019s real GDP growth will be 7.2 per cent in 2024-25 and around 7.0 per cent in 2025-26 in a cyclical correction to the rebound from the pandemic. Thereafter, there is a strong likelihood that India\u2019s growth will revert to the 8 per cent trend,\u201d he said.\n\nPrice pressures\n\n Patra observed that the front-loaded monetary policy tightening with a cumulative 250 basis points (bps) increase in the policy rate and a stance of withdrawal of accommodation guided inflation down to an average of 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 -- back into the tolerance band (2-6 per cent). \n\n \u201cIt is projected to average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 and 4.1 per cent in 2025-26. Inflation fell below (4 pe per cent) target during July-August but rose to 5.5 per cent in September on the back of a pickup in price momentum in some food items and adverse base effects inherent in year-on-year measurement. \n\nAlso read: MPC keeps repo rate unchanged; changes stance to neutral\n\n \u201cOur projection indicates that these price pressures will persist in October and November before headline inflation realigns with the target from December 2024 and remains aligned in 2025-26,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "No questions please: Kamala Harris mocked for holding 'staged' townhall",
        "text": "Former California first lady and journalist Maria Shriver recently disclosed that only pre-arranged questions were allowed to be posed to Vice President Kamala Harris during a town hall event held in Michigan on Monday.At the Oakland County event, a woman in the audience inquired if it would be possible to ask a question, just before Harris was set to appear alongside former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, according to the Daily Mail. Shriver responded by informing her that audience members would not be allowed to ask questions, as there were already pre-determined questions. Shriver added that she hoped to raise some questions that might be on the audience's minds.A video clip of Shriver\u2019s exchange soon went viral on social media, leading to widespread criticism. Many users remarked that the event appeared more like a staged production rather than a genuine town hall, where candidates typically engage with unscripted questions from voters. Comments on X (formerly Twitter) were filled with scepticism, with one user remarking that the event resembled a \"stage production\" rather than an authentic town hall, claiming that Harris was unable to handle spontaneous interactions.\u2014 TimMurtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) Fox News political analyst Brit Hume similarly criticised the format, while other users referred to the event as a \u201cprepped answer show,\u201d indicating their frustration at the lack of genuine interaction. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung even went so far as to say the event was no longer pretending to hide its scripted nature.During the hour-long event, Harris took just three questions from the audience, while Shriver praised Cheney as a courageous public servant. Shriver later took to social media, expressing her view that the event embodied what prioritising the country over party politics looked like.Harris held a similar town hall with Cheney in Wisconsin, moderated by anti-Trump commentator Charlie Sykes, although it remains unclear if the questions in that forum were also pre-determined. Harris's campaign has not responded to requests for comment on the matter.The criticism surrounding this town hall ties into the broader challenge Harris has faced during media appearances. Venture capitalist David Sacks predicted a \u201cdoom loop\u201d scenario for Harris, suggesting that if she falls behind in the polls, she will be forced to give more media interviews, which could, in turn, lead to further declines in her polling numbers due to her difficulty in handling interviews. He pointed out that this could exacerbate her already existing issues with public perception.Harris\u2019s recent media engagements, including an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, have been particularly challenging. In this interview, Harris appeared unprepared on key issues such as immigration and President Biden\u2019s mental fitness. Critics argued that her inability to address these concerns effectively and her tendency to deflect difficult questions highlighted the difficulties she faces when under media scrutiny. As this cycle continues, it has become increasingly evident that engaging with the press could further harm her standing unless she manages to deliver a strong, confident performance.",

        "text": "Mysuru, Oct 22 (IANS) Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah asked people will they tolerate false allegations against him while also accusing the BJP and JD-S of making false allegations against him (Siddaramaiah) in connection with the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) and Valmiki tribal welfare cases, \n\n\u201cCan anyone point to a single instance where I took even a rupee as a bribe? Will you tolerate these false allegations against me which the BJP & JD-S is making against me in MUDA case,\u201d said the Chief Minister while inaugurating and laying the foundation for development works worth Rs 501.81 crores in the Varuna constituency, which he represents.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI have served as a minister for 45 years without a single stain on my record. Being from the backward classes, the fact that I became Chief Minister twice has caused envy in the BJP. I have been Chief Minister twice, yet I do not own a single house in Mysuru. I live in Mariswamy\u2019s house. I\u2019ve been building a house on Kuvempu Road for three years, but it\u2019s still not completed. It is you who give me the respect I have. I stand before you with honesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my masters. You are my true owners. Your blessings are my true protection,\u201d he underlined.\n\nHe added that no matter how envious the BJP and JD-S leaders are, his reputation will not be diminished. \u201c\n\n\u201cMy respect comes from the people of Varuna and the people of this state,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nHe said that as long as the people of the state are with him, he will not be afraid of the conspiracies of the BJP and JD-S.\n\n\u201cI will defeat all their plots. I will not bow down to their games, nor will I step back from the cause of social justice,\u201d said the Chief Minister.\n\nHe added that he has been blessed by the people of Varuna Constituency to become the Chief Minister twice.\n\n\u201cVaruna is a stronghold of the Congress. Even in the Lok Sabha elections, you gave more votes to the Congress than to the BJP. I am immensely grateful to the voters of this constituency for their special support,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further stated that continuous funding has been provided for the development of the Varuna constituency.\n\nHe claimed that whenever the Congress government has been in power, they have implemented programmes to empower the poor across the state, not just in Varuna.\n\n\u201cAlong with introducing many welfare schemes, we have waived off loans from several corporations. In line with Ambedkar\u2019s vision, we have created and implemented programmes to provide economic empowerment to the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe claimed that even after becoming the Chief Minister for the second time, we have introduced five guarantee schemes designed to support the poor and middle class of all castes and religions.\n\n\u201cThrough these guarantees, we are directly transferring Rs 56,000 crores into the accounts of the people every year. Our party, the Congress, is a party that does what it says,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nLashing out at the BJP, Siddaramaiah said that whether it\u2019s the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government at the Centre or former Chief Ministers B.S. Yediyurappa, Basavaraj Bommai, or Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, they looted without contributing to the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is an opponent of social justice and the poor. Can you point to a single instance where the Central government, which has come to power three times, has followed through on its promises? In all his years as Prime Minister, has the union government implemented a single scheme that benefits the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that Karnataka contributes the highest taxes to the Central government.\n\n\u201cShould we beg to receive our rightful share? Recently, the central government gave Uttar Pradesh and Bihar the largest share of taxes but only gave our state a paltry Rs 6,000 crores, which is a gross injustice. This cannot be tolerated,\u201d he said.\n\nSiddaramaiah also criticised Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, saying that she had recommended Rs 5,495 crores for irrigation projects and special grants for the state but didn\u2019t release the funds.\n\n\u201cShe also announced Rs 3,000 crores for peripheral road development and lake improvement in the state but has not released a single rupee. Is it wrong for the people of the state to speak out against this injustice? Is it wrong for us to protest,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Multiple Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) schools nationwide received hoax bomb threats late on Monday night, sources said. The schools affected by the hoax threats include two in Delhi--one in Rohini and another in Dwarka--as well as one in Hyderabad. Sources indicate that the threats were communicated through email to the management of these institutions. Authorities are investigating the incident, with the matter being reviewed by higher officials from various organizations, including the CRPF, Intelligence Bureau, and Delhi Police. The threat email specified a potential bomb blast in the classrooms of these schools at 11 am on Tuesday. However, the threat has since been determined to be a hoax. The hoax threat was received a day after the blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi's Rohini on Sunday for which a pro-Khalistani group claimed responsibility that sent shockwaves through the national capital. Delhi Police reached out to social media platforms and the messaging app Telegram, requesting details about the channel where the post was made, and the matter is being investigated. The Sunday blast in the Prashant Vihar school was so powerful that it tore through the wall of the school. No injuries were reported in the incident however some of the nearby buildings and vehicles were damaged. Such hoax bomb threats on domestic and international flights have been received for several days. So far this week, more than 90 flights have received bomb threats and most of them have turned out to be hoaxes. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) Director General Zulfiqar Hasan on Monday met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan and apprised him about the recent hoax bomb threats in domestic and international flights. In the nearly half-an-hour meeting with the Home Ministry, both the DGs informed the Home Secretary about a series of recent hoax calls threatening domestic and international flights that has created panic situations on many occasions forcing the officials in the Indian aviation sector, intelligence wing, and other departments to go through rigorous security check process. Sources said that the officials discussed the potential implications for aviation security and measures being taken to address the situation, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and coordination among security agencies.",

PM Modi arrived in Kazan earlier in the day and was welcomed at the airport by Rustam Minnikhanov, the head of the Republic of Tatarstan. The summit brings together leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa to discuss important global issues under the theme \"Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security.\" During the meeting, PM Modi emphasized the need for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. He reiterated India's stance on promoting dialogue and diplomacy as the path to resolving the war, which has been ongoing for two years. \u201cI have been in constant touch with you regarding the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As I have said earlier, we believe that the problems should be resolved in a peaceful manner. We fully support the early establishment of peace and stability. All our efforts give priority to humanity,\u201d PM Modi stated, adding that India is ready to provide any possible cooperation for peace efforts. #WATCH | Russia: Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets and holds a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Kazan on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS Summit. (Source: Host Broadcaster) pic.twitter.com/FARmZH7T0U \u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 22, 2024 The Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Kazan aims to strengthen India-Russia relations further, building on the \"Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership\" shared between the two nations. The bilateral meeting also follows last month's acknowledgment by Putin, who called Modi a \"friend\" and expressed gratitude for India's support in seeking a peaceful end to the war. The invitation to attend the BRICS Summit was extended during this time, and it comes after PM Modi had urged Putin to work towards a resolution in a call two months ago. In August, Modi had also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, underlining India's balanced diplomatic efforts to foster peace. In addition to meeting Putin, PM Modi is expected to hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other BRICS leaders during the summit. The summit offers a crucial platform to discuss global developmental issues, climate change, economic cooperation, supply chain resilience, and cultural exchanges among member nations. A significant development occurred just before the summit when India and China agreed to resume patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, marking a breakthrough in their strained diplomatic relations. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri indicated that efforts were underway to arrange a meeting between PM Modi and President Xi during the summit. This visit to Russia marks Modi's second trip to the country this year. In July, he attended the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit in Moscow, where he not only engaged in bilateral talks but was also awarded Russia's highest civilian honor, the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle. The two-day BRICS Summit provides a valuable opportunity for leaders to evaluate the progress of initiatives and explore future collaboration, especially amid ongoing global unrest, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East crisis.

The court expressed concern over the speed and manner in which Tuteja was summoned and arrested.During the hearing, the Supreme Court asked the ED to clarify the process it followed in summoning Tuteja, particularly why there was an apparent rush in serving the summons and taking him into custody. The court was responding to Tuteja\u2019s plea challenging the Chhattisgarh High Court's refusal to quash the corruption and money laundering charges against him.The court noted that Tuteja was already being questioned by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) when the ED issued its summons. The first summons was served at noon, and another followed just a few hours later. \u201cPlease explain to us this procedure. He is in the ACB office, ED issues summons at 12.00 pm and then 5.30 pm. What is this hurry?\u201d the bench questioned.The justices further asked why the ED insisted on summoning Tuteja at a specific time, despite knowing he was being interrogated by ACB officers. The court sought an explanation from the probe agency regarding why officers from the ACB escorted Tuteja to the ED\u2019s office and whether he appeared voluntarily.Tuteja\u2019s counsel informed the court that his client was questioned by the ED throughout the night. Expressing disapproval, the court remarked, \u201cWhat kind of practice is this? Full night the person is interrogated.

        "text": "Sudhakar Adapa, founder and CEO of BIA Brands, explained the difference between e-commerce and quick commerce and how quick commerce will have to be 'not so quick' to become sustainable. \"E-commerce is thriving these days while quick commerce or q commerce is probably the new version of e-commerce. The fundamentals of business are going to be the same, it's just about how we are going to deliver, that is going to change,\" Mr Adapa said at the NDTV World Summit 2024.He also said the definition of quick will have to change for the model to be sustainable.\"Is quick commerce going to be a sustainable thing? I would say yes and no. Yes, because it will be another kind of commerce which will survive but I think the definition of quick will change. Right now the consumer wants everything to be delivered in under 10 minutes and if you say 20 minutes, the consumer will say I can't wait for 10 more minutes. India has a huge population density which is why it is one of the few countries where quick commerce worked. But, I think the definition of quick will change from 10 minutes to 60 minutes because not everything can be delivered in 10 minutes time. If this model has to be sustainable it will become not-so-quick commerce,\" he said.Mr Adapa said that in today's day and age social media has become a potent weapon for brands: \"The use of social media is across all the sectors. As brands, if we have to survive then social media has become a potent weapon and the advantage of private labels is such that it is actually giving space to smaller brands to compete with Unilever and P&Gs of the world. For example, if I had to launch a cosmetics brand 10 years ago, you need to own a brand, you need to formulate yourself, you need to have a manufacturing plant, a quality control department, you need to control R&D, the whole ecosystem has huge costs and it's not feasible for a small entrepreneur to launch a company. Now today if you want to launch a beauty brand, all you need to do is maybe go to a contract manufacturer, make some sampling, get some 1,000 pieces up, put it up online and boom you have a brand. It has become so easy these days.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");He, however, also stressed that \"everything has its own advantages and disadvantages\".\"The advantage is that you could pull your company with no capital, if you have a great product, you could build a company with almost next to nothing. The flip side is the kind of competition is there in the market. Differentiation has become really difficult for us. But the good thing is that the customers are spoilt for choice. they have great products and great prices there. Customers are making merry at the time, enjoying the great discounts,\" Mr Adapa said.",

Charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) were filed, including conspiracy and promoting enmity. Gogoi was charged under UAPA Section 18 (conspiracy) and IPC Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 153A (promoting enmity), and 153B (assertions prejudicial to national integration). His associates, Dhaijya Konwar, Bittu Sonowal, and Manash Konwar, faced similar charges. However, the court rejected NIA's suggestions to invoke UAPA Section 39 (support for terrorism) and IPC Section 124A (sedition). Reacting to it, Gogoi said, \u201cThis again proves that we are with the people and this government wants us to be kept inside the jail. The fight against a fascist and communal government is a very troublesome and expensive affair.\u201d He said that all four will approach the Gauhati High Court against the framing of charges against them.

The team management will be closely examining the optimal squad composition to ensure a competitive performance.With spin all-rounder Washington Sundar being added to the squad, and Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant have been declared fit for the Pune game, the spotlight will be on the playing eleven selected for this crucial encounter, as Team India aims to level the three-match series.Young Sarfaraz Khan, who replaced injured Gill, scored a brilliant 150 in the second-innings of the first Test, while KL Rahul remained off-colour in both the innings.Will Gill is all set to return in the Pune Test, India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate categorically stated that it is a battle between Sarfaraz and Rahul as both are fighting for a place in the XI.\"Yeah, there's no point in sugarcoating it, there's a fight for a spot,\" Ten Doeschate said at the presser, ahead of India's training session, when asked if Rahul and Sarfaraz were battling for a place in the team.\"Sarfaraz was obviously brilliant in the last Test. I went to KL after the last Test (and) said how many balls do you play at (and) miss at? He didn't play at (and) miss at one ball and that's what tends to happen when you're not getting runs.\"There's certainly no concerns about KL, he's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space. But we are certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team,\" he said.Admitting that it's difficult to exclude Rahul from the Test format equation, ten Doeschate revealed that head coach Gautam Gambhir is \"eager\" to give him an extended run.\"It's not like we're worried about his form. If you go on just the past three months since Gauti has been in here, he's keen to give him (Rahul) as much rope as we can. We have a lot of faith in him,\" Ten Doeschate said.\"But at the same time, it's a very competitive environment, with Sarfaraz getting 150 plus runs (222 not out) in the Irani Trophy final.

He had already spoken thrice and wanted to get a chance again during the presentation. But BJP MP Abhijit Gangopadhyay objected. This ensued a heated exchange between them, where sources said both used abusive language. \nMeanwhile, Kalyan Banerjee picked up a glass water bottle, hit it on the table and hurt himself. After this, he threw the broken bottle towards the chairman. Due to the incident, the meeting adjourned for some time. Soon after, Banerjee was taken for medical aid, wherein he received four stitches in his hand. \nIn today\u2019s meeting, the committee is hearing views and suggestions from representatives of Justice in Reality and Panchasakha Prachar, both based in Cuttack, Odisha. \nA delegation of five MPs from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is also presenting their perspectives on the bill. \nThe committee met on Monday, inviting officials from the Ministry of Minority Affairs to provide oral evidence regarding the bill. This meeting is part of a larger national initiative to address long-standing issues related to the management of waqf properties.On Monday, discussions during the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) meeting became heated as opposition members questioned the consultative process behind the legislation. \nThey accused the government of introducing the bill for political reasons, alleging it targeted the Muslim community. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi presented a nearly one-hour critique of the bill, raising concerns about its implications. Trinamool Congress leader Kalyan Banerjee even asked whether Waqf, which exists in the name of Allah, is legally recognized by the state. Despite the tensions, BJP members defended the bill, arguing that it is necessary for reforming Waqf property management and ensuring transparency. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to bring significant reforms, including digitization of records, stricter audits, increased transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied waqf properties. \n(Note: Only the headline has been reworked by the India.com staff; the rest of the content has been taken from ANI.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "text": "Samsung India Electronics Private Limited (SIEPL) on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) claimed it had suffered a loss to the tune of around $100 million due to the recent strike by a section of employees, who wanted their trade union \u2014 Samsung India Thozhilalar Sangam, affiliated with the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) \u2014 to be registered. \n\nAppearing before Justice R.N. Manjula, who was seized of a writ petition filed by P. Ellan, general secretary of the new trade union, senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing SIEPL, contended that trade unions could not be allowed to use the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their name since their activities would affect the company\u2019s reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, advocate N.G.R. Prasad, representing the writ petitioner, contended it was not a trademark dispute for the company to raise objections over the use of its name by a trade union. He said SIEPL was not a necessary party to the writ petition and hence, its impleading petition must be dismissed.\n\nMr. Prasad also told the court that Samsung was a South Korea-based multinational manufacturing conglomerate and that even over there, its trade unions had been using the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their names. He argued the present writ petition was only between the trade union and the Registrar of Trade Unions.\n\nHowever, Mr. Rajagopalan said SIEPL must necessarily be impleaded as a respondent to the writ petition, seeking a direction to the Registrar to register the trade union, and permitted to file a detailed counter-affidavit explaining as to why trade unions could not use the word \u2018Samsung\u2019 in their names.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, the judge allowed the impleading application filed by SIEPL and granted it time till November 11 to file its counter-affidavit to the writ petition. She observed that the company must be given an opportunity to make its submissions to the plea for registering the trade union.",

The statement further said that the expansion of BRICS with the addition of new members last year has added to its inclusivity and agenda for the global good. \"Building upon the Annual Summit held in July 2024 in Moscow, my visit to Kazan will further reinforce the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia. I look forward to meeting other leaders from BRICS as well,\" the PMO statement said. The 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan is being held under the chairmanship of Russia from October 22-24. During his visit, PM Modi is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from BRICS member countries and invited leaders in Kazan. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said, \"The Summit, themed 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security,' will provide an important platform for leaders to discuss key global issues.\" It further said, \"The Summit will offer a valuable opportunity to assess the progress of initiatives launched by BRICS and to identify potential areas for future collaboration.\" This visit marks, PM Modi's second visit to Russia this year. He travelled to Moscow in July to attend the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit where he held a bilateral meeting with President Putin. He was also conferred with Russia's highest civilian award, the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle at the Kremlin in Moscow. BRIC, as a formal grouping, started after the meeting of the Leaders of Russia, India and China in St Petersburg on the margins of G8 Outreach Summit in 2006. The grouping was formalized during the first meeting of BRIC Foreign Ministers...",

        "title": "Video forensics uncover loopholes in terror group's propaganda footage",
        "text": "A video circulated by the banned terror outfit, The Resistance Front (TRF)\u2014a self-proclaimed Kashmiri militant group\u2014following the gruesome attack that killed seven in Kashmir, reveals the propaganda machinery behind such terror incidents. The footage, shared widely on social media after Sunday evening\u2019s attack at the Z-Morh tunnel on the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway, bears TRF's text, \u201cWe were here,\u201d implying it was shot during the attack.However, forensic analysis conducted by India Today\u2019s Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) team reveals that the footage was originally filmed at least a month earlier. A version of the same video, without the TRF text and logo, was initially posted by a local Instagram account on September 21, who often shares travel photos and videos from that locality. It appears that the terror outfit repurposed this footage for its propaganda. The original video was likely filmed by someone driving a white SUV with an antenna on the bonnet. While the cropped TRF version doesn\u2019t show the vehicle, a brief glimpse of the antenna is visible as the footage approaches the tunnel\u2019s exit. (The video footage released by TRF was likely sourced from an earlier video posted on Instagram) SUV bonnet mounted antenna can be seen in both videos Another intriguing aspect is the software used to edit the footage. The video appears to have been edited using CapCut, a popular mobile application, though it is banned in India due to its Chinese origin. Following the June 2020 clashes in Galwan Valley between Indian and Chinese forces, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology banned over 100 Chinese apps under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. The ban was based on concerns that these apps were involved in activities prejudicial to India\u2019s sovereignty, defense, security, and public order.While it\u2019s still possible to use a VPN to access CapCut in India, the associated lag and slowness, along with the availability of alternative apps, make it an impractical choice for local users. This raises the likelihood that the video was edited outside India using a non-Indian internet service provider (ISP) to manipulate the footage and provide a different context.According to Indian intelligence assessments, TRF is a proxy for the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, providing a cosmetic local identity for the organization. An earlier India Today investigation highlighted how TRF's debunked propaganda was once shared and later deleted by Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Imran Khan. TRF emerged in the cyberspace in 2019 amid a communications blackout in the Kashmir Valley following the abrogation of Article 370 and was designated a terrorist organization by the Indian government under the UAPA in 2023.On Monday, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha confirmed that two foreign terrorists, believed to have infiltrated from North Kashmir's Bandipora area, were involved in the attack that claimed seven lives in Ganderbal district. \"According to an initial investigation, two masked individuals\u2014likely foreign terrorists\u2014entered the mess hall of the company constructing the Z-Morh tunnel and opened indiscriminate fire. Seven people were killed, and four were injured,\" he stated.The victims included a doctor and six labourers who were attacked at the tunnel-construction site along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited the home of Dr. Shahnawaz Dar on Tuesday, one of the victims of the Ganderbal attack.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024ALSO READ | Pak-based Lashkar front claims J&K attack that killed doctor, 6 others: Sources",

        "text": "In Wayanad's 3-way electoral contest, BJP's Navya Haridas is banking on her political experience to take on Congress' Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the November 13 bypoll, which also will be the AICC general secretary's maiden electoral fight.\n\nA software engineer with international experience in Singapore and the Netherlands, and a decade as a councillor in Kozhikode, Ms. Haridas is confident her background equips her to challenge Ms. Vadra, who is keen to extend the Congress' winning streak in this hilly Lok Sabha segment vacated by her brother Rahul Gandhi.\n\nMs. Haridas told PTI in an interview on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) that although Ms. Vadra holds a position in the AICC, she lacks experience as a people's representative.\n\nAlso Read: U.P. Congress welcomes Rahul Gandhi\u2019s decision to retain Rae Bareli \n\n\"Priyanka Gandhi is a national figure due to her Nehru family background, but this is her first election. I, on the other hand, have served as a councillor in the Kozhikode Corporation for two consecutive terms and contested the 2021 Assembly elections.\" \n\n\"I have been representing the people for many years, so contesting against Priyanka Gandhi doesn't feel any different to me. I believe I have more experience than she does,\" the BJP candidate said, a day ahead of the Congress leader's entry into Wayanad, where she is seeking votes with a roadshow in Kalpetta.\n\nThe by-election for the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency was necessitated after Rahul Gandhi vacated it following his victory in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\n\nEminent CPI leader and former MLA, Sathyan Mokeri, is contesting on the CPIM-led ruling LDF ticket.\n\n\"The fight is only between Congress and BJP. See, this election was necessitated due to the irresponsibility of Congress. In many parts of Wayanad, you still see flex boards asking for votes for Rahul Gandhi. However, he chose to keep the Rae Bareli seat and handed Wayanad over to his sister. This is an example of family dominance, and the BJP will highlight this issue before the voters,\" Ms. Haridas said.\n\nNavya, who is also the State general secretary of the Mahila Morcha, BJP's women's wing, believes PM Narendra Modi's development agenda will work in favour of the party in Wayanad.\n\n\"BJP always puts forward the agenda of development. There has been no intervention from the people's representatives in the issues demanded by the people here for the past several years.\" \n\nShe said Wayanad is not a constituency where the BJP has a strong organisational foothold but pointed out at its electoral gains.\n\n\"However, the party's vote share doubled compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Moreover, we saw that people voted for the BJP in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, and it showed that people want the BJP in power. We expect that kind of change will happen here also,\" she said.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, the BJP saw its vote share in Wayanad rise to 5.75 per cent, when its state president K Surendran took on Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe NDA candidate secured 1,41,045 votes, a significant increase from the 78,816 votes in 2019 when the seat was contested by BDJS, an NDA ally.\n\nMeanwhile, Rahul Gandhi's victory margin decreased to 3,64,422, down from the 4,31,770 votes polled in 2019.\n\nMs. Haridas, an engineering graduate, entered politics almost by accident.\n\nAfter earning her B.Tech degree, she worked as a software professional. In 2009, she married marine engineer Shobin Shyam and moved to Singapore, where she worked for four years.\n\nShe also worked in the Netherlands and Azerbaijan. Then, during a vacation trip to Kozhikode in 2015, she was unexpectedly nominated as a candidate in Kerala's local body elections, thanks to her family's RSS connect.\n\n\"Politics was never on my mind, and my entry into it was purely accidental. The BJP approached me with a ticket, considering my family's political background. I was fielded from Karaparamba, a ward where the BJP traditionally finishes third in Kozhikode Corporation. However, I won and have been representing the ward for the past 10 years,\" she explained.\n\nReflecting on her campaign for Wayanad, Ms. Haridas mentioned the challenges of travelling through the region.\n\n\"It takes hours to reach Kalpetta, especially crossing the Thamarassery Ghat Road, where traffic jams last for several hours. The traffic problems and the backwardness in the health sector here must be addressed immediately. Wayanad still lacks a fully equipped medical college. Currently, a district hospital has been upgraded as a medical college,\" she said.\n\n\"Another pressing issue is the upliftment of the tribal communities. The tribal people are still suffering. The funds allocated for them by the Central Government are not reaching their hands due to the lapses of the people's representatives. Besides, there are no plans for the educational facilities for the tribal students,\" she added.\n\nThe Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency consists of seven Assembly segments \u2014 Mananthavady (ST), Sulthan Bathery (ST) and Kalpetta in Wayanad district, Thiruvambady in Kozhikode district and Eranad, Nilambur, and Wandoor in Malappuram district.\n\nOf these Wandoor, Kalpetta abd Sulthan Bathery are represented by the Congress The Eranad seat is held by P K Basheer of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), an ally of the Congress-led UDF.\n\nIndependent Nilambur MLA P V Anwar, who recently parted ways with the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF, has already expressed support for Vadra.\n\nThiruvambady and Mananthavady have CPI(M) MLAs. The constituency has a significant population of minorities and tribal communities.",

It will also produce two metric tonnes of french fries per hour and the produce will be sold under the \u201cSafal\u201d brand of Mother Dairy. \n\n\u201cIn one of the NDDB board meetings, I had asked them not to limit themselves to milk and expand NDDB\u2019s scope. I am happy that they have extended themselves to processing vegetables and fruits. The farmers who grow vegetables and fruits do not get proper remuneration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey end up getting exploited after the market gets flooded with their produce. If these vegetables are processed, then farmers produce will go across the world and the profits will percolate down through the cooperative model.\u201d said Shah while speaking at the event held at Anand.\n\nAlso read: Gujarat 8th state to seek larger share from 16th Finance Commission: Dr Panagariya\n\nSimilarly, Shah also laid the foundation stone for a \u20b974 crore polyfilm plant at Narela, New Delhi. This plant with a capacity of 8400 metric tonne per annum will provide packing needs for milk, curd and ghee. It will provide employment for 100 persons and is expected to be commissioned by 2026.\n\n\u201cToday we are the biggest milk producer of the world. With a cumulative milk production of 231 million tonnes, we have left the United States behind. We will maintain the number one position for long as we are growing at six percent per annum, while the rest of the world is growing at two percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are 8 crore milk producing families in rural India. However, only 1.5 crore are within the cooperative framework, while the remaining 6.5 crore are in the unorganised sector and are being exploited. NDDB should try and see that the all the 8 crore families are included within the cooperative framework,\u201d Shah added.\n\nPointing out that a number of states have inked MoUs with NDDB, Shah said, \u201cGood work is happening, but it needs to be fast tracked.\u201d \n\nShah also laid the foundation stone for a new NDDB office building at Anand. At Anand, Shah also launched Gir Ghee from Mother Dairy and Badri Ghee from Uttarakhand Cooperative Dairy Federation. Several MoUs were also signed to highlight NDDB\u2019s continued efforts in advancing the dairy sector. \n\nKey agreements included a collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to conduct cutting-edge research in One-Health, focusing on innovation in animal health and sustainability; a partnership between National Cooperative Organics Limited, Mother Dairy and NDDB Mrida Limited to promote organic farming practices; NDDB, Suzuki R&D Center India (SRDI) and Amul/Mehsana Milk Union to establish a compressed biogas plant, enhancing sustainable energy production. \n\nFurther partnerships comprise an MoU between NDDB and the Space Applications Centre (SAC), ISRO, which will use remote sensing technology to assess fodder resources, facilitating improved resource management.\n\nAlso read: New textile policy will help attract \u20b930,000 cr investments to Gujarat: CM",

The state is positioned as a critical engine in driving India\u2019s overall economic performance.\n\nAn initial projection from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) anticipated a modest growth rate of just 4 percent for Karnataka, a figure that was later revised to a robust 13.1 percent.\n\nThe CMO noted this drastic revision as indicative of an early measurement error, underscoring the underestimated potential of Karnataka\u2019s economy.\n\nWith the final GSDP growth of 10.2 percent, Karnataka has not only surpassed the national average growth rate of 8.2 percent but also set the stage for a promising outlook.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the NSE forecasts a GSDP growth rate of 9.4 percent for Karnataka, while the Ministry of Finance has provided an even more optimistic projection of 14 percent.\n\nFurther supporting this growth narrative are strong economic indicators, including a year-on-year growth of 10 percent in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections and a notable 24 percent increase in stamp duty revenue as of September 2024. These figures reinforce the perception of Karnataka as a state in dynamic economic expansion.\n\nKarnataka's GSDP per capita remains among the highest in India, aligning closely with Telangana, both states led by Congress and showcasing robust economic performances.\n\nThe CMO emphasised that Karnataka\u2019s pro-people policies, including various welfare guarantees, ensure that the benefits of economic growth are distributed equitably among its citizens, promoting inclusive development.\n\nDespite these achievements, Karnataka faces significant challenges. The state has endured its worst drought in a decade, severely affecting agricultural productivity and contributing to negative growth in that sector.\n\nAdditionally, Karnataka\u2019s reliance on the IT and hardware sectors, which account for 28 percent of its Gross State Value Added (GSVA), has exposed it to the impacts of a global economic slowdown.\n\nIn conclusion, Karnataka\u2019s impressive GSDP growth is not only a testament to its economic strategy but also a beacon of resilience amid adversity, positioning the state as a vital player in India's economic landscape.\n\n(KNN Bureau)",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday received assurance from the Uttar Pradesh government that no demolition action will be taken against buildings belonging to individuals allegedly involved in the Bahraich violence on October 13 until tomorrow.This comes in the wake of communal clashes that occurred during the Durga idol immersion procession, resulting in the death of Ram Gopal Mishra (22) and heightened tensions in the area.This comes after the state's Public Works Department (PWD) issued a demolition notice on October 18 for the residence of Abdul Hameed, one of the accused in the violence, citing illegal construction on his property. Similar orders were subsequently issued against other individuals allegedly involved in the Bahraich incident.In response, three petitioners, including Hameed, filed a petition with the Supreme Court through their advocate Mrigank Prabhakar, challenging the demolition notices. They argued that the action was not about unauthorized construction but rather \"a punitive measure disguised as a legal step.\"The petitioners claimed, \"The defence of \"unauthorized construction\" is being used as a ruse to carry out punitive demolition and also to illegally overcome the interim protective orders passed by this Court on 17-09-2024.\"The petitioners further alleged that the swift initiation of the demolition process reflected malice and was directly linked to the communal violence. They said in their plea, \"The trigger for the proposed demolition notices is the close proximity of the communal flare-up and violent incident and the impugned notice, based on the perception of OR the alleged involvement of the owners/ residents/occupants in that alleged criminal activity.\"The Supreme Court has not yet made a ruling on the petition.

        "title": "BJP Demonising Rohingyas for Political Gains Harms India's International Stature",
        "text": "Amidst the ongoing assembly elections in Jharkhand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to have accused the government led by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) of promoting the \u2018infiltration\u2019 of Rohingya refugees. Even though many BJP workers have been running hate campaigns for a long time against the Rohingyas, this is the first time the Prime Minister himself has used the issue in an election campaign to garner votes. Home Minster Amit Shah and BJP President JP Nadda have done the same.India hosts many refugee communities who have arrived not only from our neighbourhood but also from other parts of Asia and far-off countries in Africa. At present, India hosts more than 92,000 Sri Lankan and 73,000 Tibetan refugees. There are more than 30,000 from Myanmar and 12,000 Afghan refugees in the country. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), about 22,000 Rohingya refugees are registered with them, while the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has claimed there are more than 40,000 of them in the country. BJP's Demographic Fear-mongering in Jharkhand Ahead of Elections25 Days On, 160 Rohingya Refugees on Boat Still Stranded, Still StarvingWhatever the number, even 40,000 Rohingyas, as claimed by the MHA, is much less than some of the other refugee communities in the country. The number is a mere fraction of not only India\u2019s population but also of Jharkhand's, which is estimated to be around\u202f40.6 million in 2023. Moreover, in none of the registries that maintain data on the presence of Rohingya in India, is Jharkhand mentioned as a major location. In the last few years, minor BJP functionaries and party workers have indulged in attacks and hate campaigns targeting the Rohingya refugees in India. Why is Prime Minister Modi singling out one just refugee community, that too in a manner bordering on xenophobia?This kind of exclusion and hate is not the only way the Rohingya refugees are being treated differently from other refugee communities. They also face mass detention and threats of being deported back to Myanmar. According to several informal sources, more than 1000 Rohingyas including about 200 children are in detention across different states of India. Most of them were charged with \u2018illegal entry\u2019 under the Foreigners Act of 1946 and the Passport Act of 1967. A majority have served the sentences they got from the local courts, and yet, they continue to be held indefinitely. Jammu, West Bengal, and Assam hold the maximum number of these refugees in indefinite detention. Though the continued detention of refugees, even after serving their sentences, is ostensibly to deport them back to Myanmar, not more than 40 Rohingyas have been sent back since 2017, while the number of detainees exceeds 1000. Some of them have been in detention for more than 12 years. While the non-refoulement of refugees back to their country where they face persecution is a part of international law, India has been bent upon sending these Rohingyas back to Myanmar where they indeed face persecution and death.A more pertinent question is \u2014 why is India unable to deport the Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar? It is simply because Myanmar refuses to accept the Rohingya as its citizens. In such a situation, what purpose is served by keeping more than 1000 Rohingyas in detention?Rohingya Refugees & Their Deaths at Sea: What Can Neighboring Countries Do?\u2018Chained Like an Animal\u2019: Rohingya Mother Brought to Baby\u2019s Funeral in HandcuffsRohingya refugees have been in India since the early 2000s. Their status determination, as persons requiring international protection, is done by the UNHCR as per the mandate under the UN Refugee Convention, 1951. The refugees are mostly concentrated in Hyderabad, Delhi, Jammu, Rajasthan and Haryana. Most of them live in shanties and eke out a living by collecting urban recyclable waste and engaging in daily wage labour. They have very little access to public health care and education facilities despite a 2018 Supreme Court interim order in Jaffar Ullah vs the Union of India in which the government gave assurances that the refugees would get the same services as Indian citizens. India being an important country in the Asia Pacific region, its treatment of the Rohingya refugees has been an issue of concern for the international community. It has remained aloof to their arrival in the country during the period between 2012 and 2015 but its treatment of the Rohingyas began to change in 2017 when the then Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said the government was planning to deport Rohingyas from India because they are \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. Since then, India has incarcerated more than a thousand Rohingyas and deported about not more than 40.India\u2019s singling out of the Rohingya refugees (on the basis of harsh treatment) was noted by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\u202f(CERD) in 2018 when it said that it was \u201cconcerned that the manifestations of racial discrimination against the Rohingya in India and [that] their return to Myanmar will infringe their rights protected under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\" In July this year, the committee again called on India \u201cto end the arbitrary detention of the Rohingyas who fled Myanmar to India and refrain from forcible deportation and returns to Myanmar, where they would risk being subjected to serious human rights violations and abuses.\u201dIt was also \u201cdeeply concerned about reports regarding the spread of racist hate speech and the dissemination of negative stereotypes against Rohingya\u201d and the \u201cracist hate speech by politicians and public figures, and the lack of information on investigations, prosecutions and convictions of public figures and politicians for hate speech.\u201d None of this bodes well for India in its quest to become a world leader. No country will accept the leadership of another country that engages in fomenting hate against a community like the Rohingyas whose situation is a major international concern.

The arrested accused are identified as Lovejit Singh alias Labba, Manjeet Singh alias Manna, Prabhjit Singh, Gurjot Singh, Ramandeep Singh, and Gurpreet Singh.\u201cA major drug trafficking operation involving smuggling of heroin from Afghanistan into India was unearthed during investigation,\u201d said the ED in a statement.The PMLA investigation was initiated on the basis of seizure of 293.81 kg of heroin from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and seizure of 352.71 kg of heroin from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana, by the Delhi Police Special Cell.Thus, a total of 646.52 kg of heroin has been seized so far. ED investigation revealed that the arrested persons, Lovejit Singh, Manjeet Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Gurjot Singh, Gurpreet Singh and Prabhjit Singh, coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi.\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran, concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder,\u201d said the ED.Accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs, informed the federal agency.ED uncovered the highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions, and operational expenses by the accused has been made. \u201cAccused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. It was also revealed that the syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local markets.\u201dFurther, the agency said the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles including Toyota Fortuner, Etios and Hyundai Verna etc in second hand market for trafficking from the storage Hubs to further distribution. The ED investigation revealed that cash was used for the purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities.\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via the Nava Sheva port in Mumbai, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. Transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies.Earlier, a property in Jandoli Village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of accused persons, and fixed deposits have been attached by ED,\u201d added the agency",

Sources indicate that the threats were communicated through email to the management of these institutions.Authorities are investigating the incident, with the matter being reviewed by higher officials from various organizations, including the CRPF, Intelligence Bureau, and Delhi Police. The threat email specified a potential bomb blast in the classrooms of these schools at 11 am on Tuesday. However, the threat has since been determined to be a hoax.The hoax threat was received a day after the blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi\u2019s Rohini on Sunday for which a pro-Khalistani group claimed responsibility that sent shockwaves through the national capital. Delhi Police reached out to social media platforms and the messaging app Telegram, requesting details about the channel where the post was made, and the matter is being investigated. The Sunday blast in the Prashant Vihar school was so powerful that it tore through the wall of the school. No injuries were reported in the incident however some of the nearby buildings and vehicles were damaged.Such hoax bomb threats on domestic and international flights have been received for several days. So far this week, more than 90 flights have received bomb threats and most of them have turned out to be hoaxes.

Subramanian.\n\nSpeaking to the media at Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on Tuesday (October 22, 2024), Mr. Subramanian said according to the National Medical Commission\u2019s rules, a non-medical person operating inside an operation theatre of a hospital was a serious offence. \n\nA notice was already served on the YouTuber, seeking an explanation from him. A police complaint would also be lodged against him as he was involved in other offences in the past, the Minister added. \n\nFurther, action would be taken against the private hospital and the woman doctor who assisted the YouTuber in performing the act, he added. \n\n\u201cIn addition to the notice issued to the female doctor, a recommendation has been sent to the Tamil Nadu Medical Council to ban her from medical practice,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said. \n\n\u201cIn the previous instance, he revealed the gender of the foetus in a video using the test done in Dubai where the law permits to know the gender ... But since it is against the law here, a notice was issued to him and he was excused only after he apologised,\u201d he noted. \n\nThe video of his newborn, uploaded on Irfan\u2019s YouTube channel, had fetched 14 lakh views in two days.

Facing Scott Boland, Smith didn\u2019t offer a shot to an in-swinging delivery and was adjudged leg before wicket for a duck.\n\nSmith had scored just 3 runs in the first innings of the match. This was Smith\u2019s first Sheffield Shield appearance in three years, having last represented NSW in the competition in February 2021.

The right hander has scored just 738 runs in 12 matches and 24 innings at an average of 35.14.\n\nWith David Warner recently retiring, the openers slot is vacant with Smith being tipped to take the role into the opener\u2019s role alongside Usman Khawaja. Whiule batting at top, Smith has scored a total of just 171 runs at an average of 28.50, with one half-century. His highest score as an opener is 91*.

        "text": "President Droupadi Murmu on Tuesday stressed the need for collective responsibility in water conservation and urged the citizens of the country to actively participate in building a water-secure India.Addressing the gathering at the 5th National Water Awards ceremony in the national capital, President Murmu said, \u201cWe must remember that conservation of water resources is a collective responsibility and building a water-secure India is not possible without our active participation.\u201d\u201cAlmost all civilizations have developed around rivers. It can be said that this relationship between water and humans has given direction to human history. But it also seems that we deliberately forget the importance of water,\u201d she said. President Murmu expressed concern over the contamination of freshwater resources. \u201cDespite it being known that freshwater resources are available in limited quantities on earth, we ignore water conservation and management. Due to man-made reasons these resources are getting contaminated and are also getting exhausted,\u201d she said. The per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. Based on the study titled \u201cReassessment of Water Availability in India using Space Inputs, 2019\u201d conducted by Central Water Commission, the average annual per capita water availability for year 2021 and 2031 has been assessed as 1486 cubic meter and 1367 cubic meter respectively. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meter is considered as water stressed condition whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition.The Centre has taken several initiatives to conserve water and provide people with safe drinking water. It is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024.The central government launched AMRUT 2.0 on October 1, 2021, covering all the statutory towns of the country to ensure universal coverage of water supply and make cities \u2018water secure\u2019.To ensure optimum utilization of water, the Centre has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) from 2015-16. Under PMKSY-Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), 99 ongoing major/medium irrigation projects and 7 phases were prioritized during 2016-17, in consultation with states.The Centre has approved the extension of PMKSY till 2025-26 with an overall outlay of Rs. 93,068.56 crore.The Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM) Programme has been brought under PMKSY \u2013 Har Khet Ko Pani from 2015-16. The Bureau of Water Use Efficiency (BWUE) has been set up for promotion, regulation and control of efficient use of water in irrigation, industrial and domestic sector. \u201cSahi Fasal\u201d campaign was launched to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which are not water intensive.The Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched on National Panchayati Raj Day in 2022 with an objective to conserve water for future. The Mission is aimed at developing and rejuvenating 75 water bodies in each district of the country",

        "text": "Stay Hydrated: The first and foremost way to manage a sore throat is to keep yourself hydrated by drinking a lot of warm fluids. Consuming fluids alleviate sore throat symptoms. Drinking warm herbal teas, water, soups, and broths provides relief from sore throat pain. Avoid drinking chilled water, alcoholic beverages, and caffeinated drinks.\n\nUse Throat Lozenges: Throat lozenges provide temporary relief from pain and irritation. They work by moistening your throat, reducing the urge to cough, and making you feel more comfortable. For more relief opt for lozenges containing soothing ingredients such as honey or menthol.\n\nInhale Steam: Steam inhalation can also offer relief for a sore throat by adding moisture to the sore throat\u2019s dry or irritated tissues. You can take a hot shower, or you can fill a bowl with hot water, lean over it with a towel over your head, and breathe in the steam. It can loosen mucus and provide relief from throat pain.\n\nGargling with Antiseptic Solutions: One of the most effective remedies for a sore throat is using a gargle liquid. Betadine Gargle is an antiseptic gargle liquid that can help alleviate throat discomfort. With its active ingredient, povidone-iodine, it helps reduce bacteria in the throat, promoting healing and providing instant relief from pain. Gargling with it can help clear out irritants and germs, giving your throat a chance to heal faster. Mix the solution as directed and gargle for at least 30 seconds before spitting it out.",

Virat Kohli and Sarfaraz added 70 and 99 runs, respectively, building on the initial momentum.

Now, the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters during a daily media briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had reflected on the longstanding issue, with a nearly identical statement.\n\n\u201cI can share with you that over the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums. And as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020. And we will be taking the next steps on this,\u201d Misri had told reporters in New Delhi.\n\nThe Indian Foreign Secretary had neither confirmed nor denied any possibility of both leaders holding bilateral discussions in Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting.\n\n\u201cThis is a multilateral event, though of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall programme of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve as soon as feasible,\u201d stated Misri, who was India\u2019s Ambassador to China during the violent Galwan Valley face-off between the soldiers of the two countries at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in June 2020.\n\nAs the Chinese side attempted to transgress the LAC in other areas of the Western Sector of the India-China border areas, the two sides have been engaged in discussions through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation.\n\nOn Monday, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar said that the latest agreement creates the basis for peace and tranquillity which should be there in the border areas and existed before 2020 \u2013 something which had been India\u2019s major concern over the past few years for the bilateral relationship to turn normal.\n\n\u201cAt various points of time, people almost gave up. We have always maintained that on the one hand, we had to obviously do the counter deployments\u2026 But, side by side, we have been negotiating since September 2020 when I met my Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow. It has been a very patient process, maybe more complicated than what it could and should have been. The fact is that if we are able to, as we now have, reach an understanding regarding patrolling and observing the sanctity of the LAC, then, I think, it creates the basis for peace and tranquillity which there should be in border areas and existed there before 2020,\u201d remarked Jaishankar while speaking at the NDTV World Summit.\n\nBeijing\u2019s confirmation on the border patrolling agreement came just after Chinese President Xi Jinping left for Kazan to attend the 16th BRICS Leaders\u2019 Meeting which is also being attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAccompanying Xi Jinping on the visit are Cai Qi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also the member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.",

The price of onion has also increased to Rs 60 per kg from Rs 40 in the market, which is one of the largest vegetable markets in Odisha.Tomatoes are being sold for Rs 80 to 100 in the local markets in Bhubaneswar, traders said.The price of other vegetables like bins, brinjal, ladyfinger, cauliflower has also increased by Rs 10 to 20 per kilogramme.There was a huge rush in the vegetable markets as consumers wanted to store sufficient amounts of vegetables, especially potato and onion in view of the cyclone, which is expected to hit the Odisha coast by October 25.\"We don't know how the market will be after the cyclone hits the state. If the supply chain is disrupted, it may lead to a further increase in price. So, I bought a sufficient amount of potato and onion for my family,\" said Nibedita Behera, a housewife from Cuttack.Local vendors have attributed the price hike to the scarcity of potato-laden trucks and the anticipation of further disruptions if the cyclone makes landfall.\"We bought potatoes at a hiked price from the wholesale market... There is a shortfall in the supply compared to the demand, so the price has gone up,\" a trader from Chhatra Bazaar said.Meanwhile, Odisha Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare minister Krushna Chandra Patra warned that strong action will be taken against traders who will indulge in black marketing and illegal hoarding of essential consumable items.\"I have directed our departmental officials to conduct raids on markets to check illegal hoarding of vegetables,\" he said.Patra said he has called a meeting with traders this afternoon to appeal to them to cooperate with the government during this period.The minister also appealed to the people not to resort to panic buying as the state has a sufficient amount of vegetables and food items.On Monday, while holding a cyclone preparedness meeting, Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi had instructed concerned officials to check the black marketing of essential goods.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024",

I went to KL after the last Test (and) said how many balls do you play at (and) miss at? He didn't play at (and) miss at one ball and that's what tends to happen when you're not getting runs.\"There's certainly no concerns about KL, he's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space. But we are certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team,\" he said.Sarfaraz scored a second-innings 150 in the Bengaluru game, while Rahul remained off-colour in both essays.While admitting that it is difficult to keep Rahul out of the equation in the Test format, ten Doeschate said head coach Gautam Gambhir is \"keen to\" give him a long rope.\"It's not like we're worried about his form. If you go on just the past three months since Gauti has been in here, he's keen to give him (Rahul) as much rope as we can. We have a lot of faith in him,\" he said.\"But at the same time, it's a very competitive environment, with Sarfaraz getting 150 plus runs (222 not out) in the Irani Trophy final. The decision will be what's best for the team, but we'll certainly back all the guys in,\" he added.Pant, who did not keep wickets for a significant part of the opening Test, and Shubman Gill, who missed the match due to stiffness in his neck, are close to attaining their full fitness.\"Rishabh is pretty good. I think Rohit (Sharmna) touched on it the other day. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee. But fingers crossed, he'll be good to keep in the Test as well,\" he said.\"He (Gill) looks so (available for this Test).

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 22 (IANS) A panel discussion of the country\u2019s leading businesswomen at the NDTV World Summit 2024 on Tuesday, highlighted the vital role of women workforce in fostering a better future, creating a new paradigm of leadership and also breaking new benchmarks on the global stage. \n\nThe panel included leading Indian businesswomen such as Kami Swaminath, President of FedEx, Preeti Bajaj, CEO and MD of Luminous Power Technologies, and Padmaja Ruparel, Co-Founder of the Indian Angel Network.\n\nFedEx President Kami Swaminath, addressed the traditionally male-dominated business sectors said that glass ceilings are being broken in every spehere.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot more work to be done. At FedEx, as a global corporation operating across multiple international markets, we recognise the power of building a global culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Currently, 36 per cent of our board is made up of women, and we have 26 per cent women in management globally. Our approach is quite structured, and we recently added more focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, rededicating ourselves to inclusive hiring, promotions, and supporting career paths,\u201d she remarked.\n\nSwaminath emphasised the challenge of increasing women\u2019s representation in logistics and supply chain sectors and said, \u201cA key area of focus is middle management, where there is often a drop-off in women\u2019s participation due to societal expectations around childcare, elder care, and other responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cFedEx is a people-centric culture, and much of our effort is aimed at building an environment where DEI thrives. Our senior team members are specifically working on being more inclusive. There is a lot more to be done, and it is an ongoing journey for us\u2014especially in bringing more women into senior management and increasing their representation,\u201d she said.\n\nOn India\u2019s expanding economy, Swaminath commented, \u201cWe see tremendous growth opportunities in India with its expanding economy. As a global connector, FedEx is focusing on optimising supply chains to better serve our customers.\u201d\n\nPreeti Bajaj, CEO and MD of Luminous Power Technologies, spoke about the importance of women in senior management. She informed that 33 per cent of Luminous\u2019 senior team consists of women.\n\nShe described the work needed in the energy sector in three stages: \u201cFirst, there is equity of access to opportunities, which is critical. Second is ambition\u2014women must aspire to reach senior-level roles and fuel their own desire to pioneer such positions. Finally, there is attainment, which involves creating supportive environments and policies that can address these challenges. My call to action for women in the energy sector is that this is an evolutionary time, and we are part of the Viksit Bharat 2047 initiative.\u201d\n\nPadmaja Ruparel, Co-Founder of the Indian Angel Network, shared her experience as an early-stage investor, saying, \u201cWhen I started, there were no women in this field, and I went through many evolutions myself. I can\u2019t be an investor if there are no entrepreneurs. In 2022, only 14.7 per cent of funding went to women, which is not encouraging. The number of women investors is also very low, and growth capital is much less for women partners. We need to create a \u2018BlackRock of India\u2019 led by women.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report, only 38 of India\u2019s 100 leading publicly listed corporations have more than 20 per cent women employees in their workforce, underscoring the need for faster inclusion to achieve gender equality in business and other sectors.",

The Sessions Court and the Gujarat High Court have already dismissed Kejriwal\u2019s petition, and now, the Supreme Court has upheld those decisions.\n\nPrasad claimed that Kejriwal had even hinted during the court proceedings that he might apologise for his remarks, but the Supreme Court noted that such an apology should have been made earlier. Now, with his petition withdrawn, the criminal defamation case against him will proceed in Gujarat.\n\nHighlighting Kejriwal\u2019s pattern of making accusations and later apologising, Prasad listed several instances where the Delhi CM issued apologies, including to late Arun Jaitley, to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, to Punjab leader Vikram Majithia, to Kapil Sibal and others.\n\nPrasad argued that while criticism is a fundamental right in politics, making false and defamatory allegations is not.\n\n\u201cThe true face of Arvind Kejriwal, who lectures the world on honesty and anti-corruption, has been revealed,\u201d Prasad remarked, adding, \u201cKejriwal has apologised on 10 separate occasions for various remarks.\u201d\n\nHe also drew a parallel between Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, suggesting that both have displayed similar carelessness in their public conduct.\n\nPrasad also addressed questions on the BJP\u2019s stance on population control and the challenges in Wayanad where Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is contesting. He dismissed concerns about Priyanka\u2019s chances of electoral success, saying the BJP and its leaders do not fear competition.\n\nHe also touched upon India-China relations, noting that sensitive diplomatic matters should be handled by experienced officials and questioned the understanding of diplomacy among some opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal.\n\nResponding to Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav\u2019s controversial remarks about the Chief Justice of India, Prasad reaffirmed the importance of respecting the judiciary, which he described as vital to the country\u2019s democracy and constitutional traditions.",

        "text": "China on Tuesday said that it has reached a resolution with India on resolving their border conflict and will work to implement solutions, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular press briefing,\"We have reached a resolution on the relevant matter, will work with the Indian side to implement the solution. We are in close communication through diplomatic and military channels.\" On October 21, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that an agreement has been reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border area. The announcement came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kazan, Russia, for the 16th BRICS summit that begins today and is scheduled to run till October 24. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media, stating, \"This agreement is the outcome of extensive discussions over the past several weeks with Chinese interlocutors at both diplomatic and military levels.\" He noted that military commanders have been involved in negotiations aimed at addressing the tensions that have persisted since 2020. Misri explained that the agreement signifies a path toward disengagement and a potential resolution of the issues that arose during the significant confrontations in 2020. Misri recalled the clashes between the People's Liberation Army of China and the Indian Army, particularly highlighting the violent encounters in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. He added that this agreement marks a critical step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations seek to manage their border disputes and prevent further military confrontations. Misri said,\"On several areas along the Line of Actual Control, we held discussions with Chinese interlocutors both at the diplomatic as well as military levels through meetings with military commanders at various levels. These discussions had in the past resulted in the resolution of standoffs at various locations. There are some locations and areas where stand-offs had not been resolved.\" \"Now, as a result of the discussions over the last several weeks, an agreement has been reached on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas. This is leading to disengagement and eventually a resolution of the issues that arose in these areas in 2020,\" he said. Earlier today, Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi addressing an event in Delhi said that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo. \"We are working to rebuild trust, and restoring that trust will take time,\" he said, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations. He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions. \"This normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that as well,\" the COAS said. The agreement marks a crucial step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations work to manage their border disputes and avoid further military confrontations.In early May 2020, troops from China's People's Liberation Army and the Indian Army clashed at locations along the LAC, the disputed boundary between China and India. The situation escalated on June 15-16, 2020, resulting in casualties on both sides. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)",

With less than three weeks to go before the election, Trump\u2019s latest viral moment has become a social media sensation.The video, which showcases Trump humorously tumbling out of the drive-thru window, has sparked a wave of reactions online. One user said, \"OMFG Who made this!?!\" while others couldn't help but notice a strange resemblance to Russian President Vladimir Putin as Trump falls dramatically from the window.\u2014 aliensupershow (@aliensupershow) A sea of humorous remarks followed, with one user jokingly questioning the authenticity of the clip: \"Wait, isn\u2019t this just a video of what actually happened?\" Others chimed in with witty observations, like, \u201cIf this were a preview for a sitcom, I would totally watch it!\u201dOne particularly hilarious comment poked fun at Trump\u2019s customer service skills: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019d just convert their windshield into Sprite like that\u2026!?

His appearance followed vice president Kamala Harris\u2019 claims of working at the fast-food giant in the 1980s to fund her college education. Seizing the opportunity, Trump cheekily declared, \"I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala\u2026 She never worked here,\" in an apparent jab at Harris\u2019s relatable narrative.After the visit, Trump took to Truth Social to post, \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala Harris is now a confirmed liar in that she never worked at McDonald\u2019s\u2026 She is a liar, not a President!\" His campaign has further fueled the debate, suggesting that there are no records of Harris ever working at the fast-food chain.",

        "text": "Donald Trump recently appeared on \"Six Feet Under,\" the podcast of retired wrestling legend The Undertaker, real name Mark Calaway, where the former president revealed his fascination with professional wrestling. Over the course of the interview, Trump also quizzed the legendary wrestler on the realities of the ring, showcasing his curiosity and deep interest in the world of sports entertainment.During their exchange, Trump bombarded Calaway with rapid-fire questions, ranging from how wrestling rings absorb impact to the physical toll on wrestlers. \"Does that ring take great absorption?\" Trump asked, diving into specifics that highlighted his intrigue. \u2014 AutismCapital (@AutismCapital) Calaway responded by explaining the harshness of earlier rings and how wrestlers had to condition themselves to take the physical punishment.The conversation also took a humorous turn, with Trump recalling his involvement in WrestleMania, notably his appearance in the \"Battle of the Billionaires\" at WrestleMania 23, where he and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon squared off in a match represented by wrestlers, leading to McMahon getting his head shaved. Trump reminisced about the event, noting it drew record pay-per-view buys, and praised The Undertaker's iconic slow entrance, calling him one of the greatest sports entertainers.As the two delved deeper, Trump inquired about behind-the-scenes tensions in the wrestling world. \"How often did someone get really angry?\" Trump asked, curious about real fights in the scripted entertainment world. Calaway likened the professional relationships in wrestling to politics, stating that while wrestlers might not always like each other, they had to maintain professionalism\u2014a sentiment Trump found relatable.The interview also saw Trump praising Calaway\u2019s endurance in the ring, with the former president questioning whether the wrestler ever had to be carried out due to injury. \"What most people don\u2019t realise, Mr President, is that although we\u2019re entertainment, in any given match, you\u2019re two inches away from something really catastrophic happening,\u201d Calaway explained, making the former US President aware of the dangers of pro wrestling despite its scripted nature.Trump\u2019s passion for wrestling, along with his personal connections to WWE through longtime friend Vince McMahon, was evident throughout the interview. He praised the athleticism of the wrestlers and fondly recalled his role in several WWE events, even expressing awe at the intensity of their performances.

        "title": "Babita Phogat used protests to pursue WFI leadership, alleges Sakshi",
        "text": "New Delhi: Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik has revealed the controversial role of wrestler-turned-politician Babita Phogat in last year's wrestlers' agitation, alleging that Phogat encouraged the protests to position herself as the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president. Malik, a key figure in the protest, stated in a recent interview that Phogat called a meeting with several wrestlers, urging them to speak out against the alleged misconduct of former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and others in the federation. \u201cBabita Phogat approached us with the idea of protesting against Brij Bhushan Singh because she had her own agenda \u2014 she wanted to become the WFI president. There are rumors that Congress supported our protest, but that\u2019s false. In fact, two BJP leaders helped us secure permission to protest in Haryana \u2014 Babita Phogat and Tirath Rana,\u201d Malik said. Despite Phogat's initiation of the movement, Malik clarified that the wrestlers did not \u201cblindly follow her.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that we blindly followed her; we were aware of serious issues like sexual harassment and molestation within the federation. We believed that having a woman in charge, especially someone like Babita Phogat, who is also a sportsperson, would bring positive change. We trusted that she would understand our struggles. But we never anticipated that she would play such a big game with us. We thought she would stand with us in the protest and raise her voice against the wrongdoing as a fellow wrestler,\u201d Malik revealed. Malik also made striking claims regarding fellow wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, both prominent figures in the movement. In her memoir, Witness, Malik alleged that those close to Punia and Vinesh began to influence their decisions, leading to a troubling shift in focus. Their acceptance of exemption from the 2023 Asian Wrestling Championships trials, according to Malik, damaged the integrity of the protest that had sparked at Delhi\u2019s Jantar Mantar and spread throughout the country. \u201cThe old way of thinking selfishly was taking over again. The people close to Bajrang and Vinesh had started filling their minds with greed. Now they were discussing exemptions from trials for the Games. Nothing good came of Bajrang and Vinesh\u2019s decision to take the exemption. Their choice hurt the image of our protest, leading many supporters to think we were in it for selfish reasons,\u201d Malik wrote. Malik emphasised that claims of Congress party supporting their protest were unfounded, highlighting the assistance from BJP leaders like Phogat and Tirath Rana in securing permission for their protests in Haryana. The movement emerged as a powerful symbol against alleged misconduct within the federation, led by Malik, Vinesh Phogat, and Bajrang Punia, but unity began to fracture as external influences led to conflicting priorities. Brij Bhushan faced allegations of sexually harassing several female athletes and financial misconduct. The six-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Kaiserganj constituency stepped down as WFI chief, along with the entire Executive Committee, shortly after protests resumed in April following earlier demonstrations in January 2023.",

        "text": "Dubai: Former England captain Alastair Cook feels Joe Root has the potential to surpass the legendary Sachin Tendulkar as the leading run-getter in Test cricket thanks to his insatiable hunger and incredible talent.The 33-year-old Root currently has 12716 Test runs and is 3205 short of the Indian icon (15921).Root occupies the fifth spot in the leading run-getter's chart at the moment with Rahul Dravid (13,288), Jacques Kallis (13,289) and Ricky Ponting (13,378) and Tendulkar ahead of him.\"I think Joe Root could set a mark, certainly on an English side, that'll be very hard to beat. But, you just never know,\" Cook was quoted as saying by the ICC.\"I hope he can get very close, if not be the first person who scores 16,000 Test runs. It'd be a great achievement.\"Root overtook Cook as England's leading run-scorer in the longest format during the Multan Test against Pakistan earlier this month.Having watched his compatriot go past him to become England's most decorated batter, the 39-year-old Cook struggled to express his feelings and called up Root to congratulate him for his massive feat.\"I watched the moment, then I rang him after the end of the play. I couldn't think of the right words to write in a text message,\" Coon said.\"So, I thought I'd just ring him, see what he was up to, and make sure he had a beer in his hand, which I think he did.\"Root's remarkable form over the past four years has seen him score more than half of his total 35 Test centuries in that period, averaging close to 60.Cook believes that he is currently the best batter in the world with New Zealand's Kane Williamson coming close to matching him.\"I think at this precise moment in time, I find it hard to see anyone playing as well as Joe Root. Over the last year or so, of the so-called 'Big Four', I think Williamson and him are probably in the best form at the moment.\"They're all wonderful, wonderful players, all very different, actually, in their methods and ways of playing. But one thing, which kind of unites them is that hunger and desire to keep improving and keep churning out the runs,\" Cook said.Root will look to continue to amass big scores and add to his tally during the third Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, beginning on Thursday.Moving to another topic, Cook has expressed his support for England's 'Bazball' style of play in Test cricket.\"I think the game has certainly made a big jump forward in what is now deemed possible in Test cricket.\"I think the jump happened in one day cricket first, probably. The fundamental change, certainly from the English point of view, is when Owen Morgan took the side forward in 2015.

        "title": "Locker-room politics: What's behind Trump's lewd story about Arnold Palmer",
        "text": "As the 2024 presidential election enters its final weeks, Donald Trump is ramping up his use of vulgar and inflammatory language at campaign rallies. During a Pennsylvania event this weekend, the former president opened with a shocking anecdote about the late golf legend Arnold Palmer's genitalia. Trump\u2019s crude remarks about Palmer's masculinity were followed by insults directed at his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. These outbursts have stirred controversy but also energized his core supporters, raising questions about whether this unfiltered approach is an intentional election strategy to galvanize his base, particularly younger male voters.Why it mattersAs per a Politico report, Trump\u2019s use of foul language and crude humor is nothing new, but the frequency and intensity of his remarks in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign are noteworthy. The former president, who has long embraced controversial rhetoric, seems to be doubling down on hypermasculine, inflammatory comments, a tactic that appears designed to appeal to male voters, especially those disillusioned with traditional political correctness. At the same time, his behavior could alienate key demographics, particularly suburban women and moderate Republicans, who might be turned off by his lack of decorum.As Trump faces off against Kamala Harris, who could become the first female president of the US, the contrast in tone and demeanor between the two candidates is stark. Harris has largely avoided engaging directly with Trump's personal attacks, instead focusing on portraying him as unfit for office. Trump\u2019s supporters, however, often praise his directness and authenticity, seeing his crude humor as a refreshing alternative to what they view as the sanitized language of traditional politicians.The big pictureTrump\u2019s controversial remarks this weekend highlight a broader theme in his campaign: an emphasis on hypermasculinity and populism. During his Pennsylvania rally, Trump shared a 12-minute story about Palmer that included graphic details about the golf legend\u2019s body, eliciting laughs from the crowd.\u201cArnold Palmer was all man...This man was strong and tough, and I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros they came out of there, they said \u2018Oh, my God. That\u2019s unbelievable,\u2019\u201d Trump said.He followed this with a vulgar insult aimed at Kamala Harris, calling her a \"shit vice president,\" to the delight of his audience. This pattern of using locker-room talk to energize his base has become a hallmark of Trump\u2019s rallies, particularly in battleground states like Pennsylvania, where he is courting working-class voters and younger men.In a podcast last week, Trump made similarly crude remarks, using a slang term for male genitalia to describe the downfall of disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein. These moments are not accidental; they are part of a broader strategy to appeal to male voters who may feel disillusioned by political correctness and progressive movements. By positioning himself as an outsider who \"tells it like it is,\" Trump is tapping into frustrations among voters who feel left behind by cultural shifts in the country, the Politico report said.However, while these comments may energize his base, they also risk deepening the gender gap in the 2024 election. Polls suggest that Trump\u2019s aggressive, masculine rhetoric appeals more to male voters, while Harris is performing strongly with female voters, particularly in suburban areas. The result is shaping up to be one of the largest gender divides in modern political history, with both campaigns focusing heavily on turnout from these key groups.What they are sayingKamala Harris and other Democratic leaders have seized on Trump\u2019s vulgar remarks to argue that he is unfit for the presidency. Harris responded to Trump\u2019s attacks by saying, \u201cI do believe that Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences of him ever getting back into the White House are brutally serious.\u201d Harris has framed Trump\u2019s behavior as emblematic of a broader pattern of instability and recklessness, suggesting that his return to power would be dangerous for the country.Arnold Palmer\u2019s daughter, Peg Palmer Wears, also reacted to Trump\u2019s comments about her late father. In an interview with the Associated Press, she expressed disappointment but not outrage, saying, \u201cI think it was a poor choice of approaches to remembering my father, but what are you going to do?\u201d Wears added that while she wasn\u2019t upset, she felt Trump\u2019s comments didn\u2019t honor her father\u2019s legacy appropriately. She noted that her father, who passed away in 2016, had believed strongly in the Republican Party, but stopped short of saying whether she would vote for Trump in the upcoming election.On the Republican side, reactions have been mixed. Some party leaders, like House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La), have avoided directly condemning Trump\u2019s remarks, with Johnson telling CNN, \u201cHe says things that are off-the-cuff.\u201d Other Republicans, including Gov. Chris Sununu (R-N H), have been more critical, saying Trump\u2019s language, particularly his profanity-laced attacks on Kamala Harris, is unhelpful and distracting. However, Sununu also noted that such remarks are unlikely to sway voters one way or the other, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just par for the course.\u201dBetween the linesTrump\u2019s frequent use of locker-room talk and crude humor may be a calculated move to solidify his support among male voters, particularly young men who have become a key demographic for the Republican Party. Over the past few years, Republicans have made a concerted effort to court younger male voters, many of whom feel alienated by progressive social movements and the perceived political correctness of the left. Trump\u2019s crass language and unapologetic style resonate with these voters, who see him as a \"real\" candidate willing to say what others won\u2019t.For Trump, his emphasis on masculinity and strength is not new. In the 2016 election, he used similar tactics to portray himself as the alpha male candidate, contrasting himself with Hillary Clinton, whom he frequently belittled with sexist and derogatory remarks. His latest comments about Arnold Palmer and Kamala Harris are a continuation of this strategy, positioning himself as a strong, decisive leader who isn\u2019t afraid to break the rules.This strategy could be effective in energizing Trump\u2019s core supporters, but it also risks alienating moderate Republicans and undecided voters, especially women. The gender gap in this election is expected to be historic, with polls showing a significant divide between male and female voters. Harris, who has focused on presenting herself as a competent and serious leader, may benefit from Trump\u2019s controversial remarks, particularly among women who find his behavior off-putting.What\u2019s nextAs the November 5 election approaches, both candidates will continue to sharpen their closing arguments. For Trump, this likely means more rallies filled with unfiltered language and humor aimed at energizing his base. His team hopes that by appealing to male voters, particularly in swing states like Pennsylvania, he can overcome the deficits he faces with women and suburban voters.Harris, meanwhile, will likely continue her strategy of focusing on Trump\u2019s character and fitness for office, hoping to persuade undecided voters that his behavior makes him unfit for a second term. She will also seek to turn out women and moderate voters, who are critical to her path to victory.The final weeks of the campaign are set to be a battle of contrasting styles: Trump\u2019s brash, masculine rhetoric versus Harris\u2019s more reserved, policy-focused approach. The outcome could hinge on which message resonates more with voters in key battleground states.(With inputs from agencies)",

        "text": "As the 2024 presidential election approaches, many US Jews like Rona Kaufman, observe signs that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump. Jewish voters form a small segment of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u2014key states for Democrats. Any shift could have substantial implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes have determined past elections. Many Jewish voters consider the upcoming election unprecedented, especially in light of Hamas\u2019 recent attacks on Israelis.As per the news agency AP, she notes discomfort at a recent Democratic campaign event in Pittsburgh and reflects on her family\u2019s changing political views. \u201cThe family that is my generation and older generations, I don\u2019t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we\u2019ve never voted Republican, ever,\u201d 49-year-old Kaufman said, highlighting her sister's Trump sign as a significant shift.Surveys indicate most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, although Kaufman acknowledges her viewpoint is unusual. In a close election, their votes can be pivotal, prompting campaigns from both Harris and Trump to recognise the risk of losing support. This dynamic has led Harris to navigate complex sentiments among traditional Democratic constituencies regarding the Gaza conflict, trying to balance support for Israel with concerns about civilian casualties.Trump has aimed to exploit this situation, suggesting that Harris \u201cdoesn't like\u201d Jewish people and claiming he\u2019ll be the \u201cbest friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\u201dHistorically, Jewish voters have largely supported the Democratic Party; a recent Pew Research Center poll showed about two-thirds back Harris.However, rising antisemitism in the US and anti-Israel protests have made many feel unsafe. The 2018 massacre of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh remains a painful reminder. This election, campaigns have reported unprecedented outreach to Jewish voters, with Republicans emphasising divisions within the Democratic Party regarding Israel.Many Jewish voters, like Jeremy Kazzaz, feel scared and uncertain. Kaufman, a progressive, never imagined considering Trump but now sees him as a defender against threats posed by Iran.Conversely, Harris\u2019 supporters view Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to his past comments and actions, including praise for Hezbollah and criticism of Israeli leadership.",

We are in close communication through diplomatic and military channels.\u201dOn October 21, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that an agreement has been reached regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border area.The announcement came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Kazan, Russia, for the 16th BRICS summit that begins today and is scheduled to run till October 24.Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media, stating, \u201cThis agreement is the outcome of extensive discussions over the past several weeks with Chinese interlocutors at both diplomatic and military levels.\u201d He noted that military commanders have been involved in negotiations aimed at addressing the tensions that have persisted since 2020.Misri explained that the agreement signifies a path toward disengagement and a potential resolution of the issues that arose during the significant confrontations in 2020. Misri recalled the clashes between the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China and the Indian Army, particularly highlighting the violent encounters in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. He added that this agreement marks a critical step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations seek to manage their border disputes and prevent further military confrontations.Misri said,\u201dOn several areas along the Line of Actual Control, we held discussions with Chinese interlocutors both at the diplomatic as well as military levels through meetings with military commanders at various levels. These discussions had in the past resulted in the resolution of standoffs at various locations. There are some locations and areas where stand-offs had not been resolved.\u201d\u201cNow, as a result of the discussions over the last several weeks, an agreement has been reached on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas. This is leading to disengagement and eventually a resolution of the issues that arose in these areas in 2020,\u201d he said.Earlier today, Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi addressing an event in Delhi said that restoring trust along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a gradual process, to return to the April 2020 status quo.\u201cWe are working to rebuild trust, and restoring that trust will take time,\u201d he said, highlighting the steps of disengagement, de-escalation, and buffer zone management as crucial for easing tensions between the two nations.He further explained that the process will take place in phases, with each step aimed at reducing tensions. \u201cThis normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that as well,\u201d the COAS said.The agreement marks a crucial step in stabilising relations between India and China as both nations work to manage their border disputes and avoid further military confrontations.In early May 2020, troops from China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and the Indian Army clashed at locations along the LAC, the disputed boundary between China and India. The situation escalated on June 15-16, 2020, resulting in casualties on both sides.",

If you spend it and don\u2019t put it in front of the people, the money spent will not be useful. People should know what is in the report. Otherwise, there will be accusations against the government for covering it up,\u201d Parameshwara said.\u201cImplementation of the census report is a different matter. Shouldn\u2019t that information come out?\u201d he added.Earlier on October 4, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday said that the decision on the implementation of the caste census report will be taken in the cabinet meeting after holding a discussion on the matter.

The Chairman of the Commission for Backward Classes, Jayaprakash Hegde, submitted the report.The demand for the nationwide caste census has been a major Congress agenda item nationally, with other INDIA bloc parties also raising their voices.Several opposition parties in India, including Congress, RJD, NCP-SCP, etc. have a longstanding demand for the conduct of a caste-based census in India, that revolves around the need for accurate data on the population of different caste groups",

Bharatiya Janta Party leader Nalin Kohli took a jibe at the Congress party and its allies. He said this alliance is not born organically with any kind of commonality of agenda. Speaking to ANI on the MVA seat sharing in Maharashtra assembly elections, BJP leader Kohli said, \u201cAs far as the Congress and its so-called alliance partners are concerned, one has noticed a consistent trend not just in Maharashtra and Jharkhand presently, but in the Lok Sabha elections earlier as well. This is not an alliance born organically with any kind of commonality of agenda. It\u2019s an opportunistic political understanding that we will now oppose the BJP and we can therefore fight for power and seats\u2026\u201d\n\nKohli further added that the agenda for BJP-NDA is to serve the people and an agenda of positivity in terms of governance. \n\n\u201cThis is completely different to the model of BJP-NDA, where there is an agenda of serving people, an agenda of positivity in terms of governance and there is no war of words\u2026\u201d, he said.Earlier, Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole told ANI senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat had met Sharad Pawar and everything was on track.\u201cThe situation in Mahayuti is more messed up than MVA\u2026 Seat sharing takes time because we have to keep our party workers in mind. Our issue will be resolved in a day or two. Balasaheb Thorat held a meeting with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray and now I will meet Balasaheb Thorat. MVA seat-sharing meeting will be held after that. The problem lies in 25-30 seats but it will be resolved soon\u2026\u201d, he said.

        "text": "Amaravati: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday promised that he will be the best ambassador for the drone industry to promote its ecosystem and transform the state into a drone hub. The chief minister called on drone players to use the southern state as a pilot or testing ground for producing use cases and proof of concepts. \"Andhra Pradesh will be a testing bed for drone applications. Give us your use cases and we will test them,\" said Naidu, addressing a two-day national drone summit at Mangalagiri in Guntur district. The chief minister inaugurated the summit accompanied by Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu. Naidu noted that the state government is keen on adopting at least 150 drone use cases during the two-day summit on October 22 and 23. Calling on drone ecosystem players, the CM requested them to put their data and use cases in a sandbox for further validation and enhancement. Highlighting that the drone industry is the \"game changer\" of the future, he said these unmanned aerial vehicles have multiple use cases, such as identifying traffic violations, criminals and in farming, among several others. The TD supremo observed that the state government aims to hand over 20,000 drone pilot certificates and achieve 80 per cent indigenisation in drone manufacturing. Promising to allot 300 acres to the Civil Aviation Ministry, Government of India, Naidu requested the Centre to set up a drone certification hub at Orvakal in Kurnool district, which is near to Hyderabad, Chennai and Amaravati. Further, the CM appealed to drone players to keep their costs reasonable and refrain from being \"greedy\" to enable wider adoption of this technology. On the occasion, the Andhra Pradesh government inked an agreement with the Quality Council of India (QCI) for certifying drone startups in the state. There was also an agreement between IIT-Tirupati and Technology Innovative Hub for collaboration in drone technology development, startups and skill initiatives. Later, Naidu released a concept note on drone policy and also inaugurated a drone expo at the venue. Earlier, Union Aviation Minister K Ram Mohan Naidu said that the government does not want to import drones as it envisages the people of the country to manufacture them. The aviation minister highlighted that the Centre has liberalised rules for the drone ecosystem and enabled 27 companies to benefit from the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Noting that India has emerged as a drone hub in the past few years, the union minister said the government wants to push the industry further. \"Looking at a drone hub in Andhra Pradesh in the future... want to ensure that Andhra Pradesh grows to the best of its ability,\" he said, adding that the government wants to ensure that the southern state will emerge as the drone hub of the world. The mega-drone summit will feature drone hackathons, exhibitions and participation from industry experts. As many as 1,711 delegates and 1,306 visitors are expected to attend the summit. Likewise, over 8,000 people are also expected to attend the summit, which will be followed by a drone show at Punnami Ghat in Vijayawada on Tuesday evening.",

        "text": "penText has transformed from on-premises content management (1.0) to information management in hybrid cloud (2.0). Now, OpenText 3.0 focuses on \u2018Information Reimagined\u2019, combining cloud-based information management with AI, security, and compliance.\n\nOpenText\u2019s 3.0 journey has been a transformative experience for us. We are building a new AI platform that will help in the automation of product development internally. It is around \u2018Information Re-imagined\u2019 which is basically an Information Management Cloud with AI and with full security and compliance. \n\nThe 3.0 journey pushed us to embrace a cloud-first, AI-driven mindset, and to focus on delivering innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. OpenText 3.0 is all about security, AI, and information management cloud. We are going to be fully on the cloud, but we keep in mind the local regulatory requirements and data sovereignty requirements of certain countries, which means we\u2019ll bring the hyperscaler cloud into the country. \n\n This is a platform that we intend to use internally for auto-generating the application codes for product development and automating testing. The application code generation will help our developers and especially testers. We can imagine a world in the future where there are some user stories, the business use case stories on which the product development has to happen. You feed into this platform and say that your core language to develop this is Python. It\u2019ll read the user stories and suggest a Python code which the developer can then edit and refine further and then move to the next step of unit testing. Once the developer is happy, then the platform will suggest a test plan or test script for that. The platform itself will help you to test it. Once you approve the test plan and test script. This is not for sale to a customer. This is in pilot with over 2,000 developers testing it. \n\nThe majority of AI and Automation initiatives are being fully developed in India. That\u2019s one of the key elements of India OpenText 3.0, which our CEO entrusted us with. It started like 9-10 months back and we are heavily invested in that. The Indian team played a pivotal role in the development of this platform. India is going to play a very pivotal role in OpenText 3.0. Security is a key focus area in our 3.0 strategy and as an example of the role of India in the security the managed security operations centre under our cybersecurity practice in India will grow significantly and most likely going to double in size. \n\nWill AI be fully successful? The answer is no. Can it replace everything perfectly? The answer is no. It\u2019s a simple common example. I can say critics and admirers are sitting on the left-hand, and right-hand side of the fence. But the answer is in the middle. You will not leave everything with AI, but you will leave a lot of things with AI. It just depends on how everybody is experimenting maybe the AI might fail in one area \u2013 let\u2019s say product development. Maybe it produces a code, then we have to put more effort into correcting it. The efficiency gain is 30 per cent but to rework is another 20 per cent, eventually, a 10 per cent gain is not worth it, but AI-assisted automated testing is most likely 100 per cent guaranteed that it will work well. Therefore in some areas, it will succeed, it will fail. That\u2019s my view.\n\n Price-wise, the Indian market is definitely challenging. The price point that customers expect here is different; North American pricing or other models won\u2019t work. So, we\u2019ve defined specific packages, solutions, and price points tailored for the Indian market. \n\nWe\u2019ve learned these lessons over time, and we\u2019re now seeing significant success. For example, just three months ago, we secured a multi-million dollar deal with a large telecom customer in India. This is a yearly renewable project, highlighting the growing demand for our products and services in the domestic market. This particular customer needed our solutions to streamline their business processes, and we were able to meet their needs effectively. A few other customers in India where we had success in last few years are L&T Technology Services with whom we are partnering to serve strategic Govt institutions, ITC, GAIL, IOCL, and ONGC. \n\nPreviously, we had success stories with only multinational companies that are rolling out in India. But the true India stories have started coming up in the last 24 months or so.\n\n We have a strong internship program that originated in Hyderabad. We hire close to 300 interns every year. Of those interns, 40 per cent get converted to full-time employees. We started with product development, then we replicated to other units as well - now professional services, customer success, and technical support. It is working very well. And in that process, we have a good affiliation with campuses both in Hyderabad and Bangalore and all India level as well. We have identified, certain universities we work with.",

        "text": "Berhampur (Odisha): Even though winter is yet to set in the state, winged guests have started to arrive at Odisha's Chilika lake, the biggest waterfowl habitat in the country, an official said. The migratory birds have already started to arrive in the lake from the first week of the current month, as the usual time of their arrival, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Chilika Wildlife Division, Amlan Nayak said on Tuesday. Their arrival was continuing daily, he said. Migratory birds of different species like northern pintail, Eurasian wigeon, gadwall, black-tailed gadwall, northern shoveller, greater flamingo, common sandpiper, common coot, mongolian plover, common snipe, black winged stilt, etc, have already swooped down in the lake, Nayak said. The DFO said the arrival of migratory birds to the lake is as usual, even though the day temperature in and around the blue lagoon was hovering at 32 to 35 degrees Celsius at present. The onset of winter and some other causes in their native places might have forced the birds to fly to Chilika, he added. Several birds are also seen to fly in the sky near Chilika without settling on the lake. They might land once the water level recedes in the lake, Nayak said, adding, \"We expected their number might be in large by the end of the current month.\" The winged guests mostly from beyond the Himalayas in Northern Eurasia, Caspian region, Siberia, Kazakh, Lake Baikal and remote areas of Russia and neighbouring countries visit the Chilika lake every winter and start their homeward journey before the onset of summer in the second week of March. In the last winter, a total of 11,37,759 birds of 187 species visited Chilika and the majority of them settled in the Nalabana sanctuary area inside the lake. To prevent bird poaching in the lake during the period, the wildlife division has set up 21 temporary camps in the lake. They have also hired around a dozen boats for patrolling in the lake. Besides, they have decided to make surveillance through drones like the previous year. The camps have already started functioning from October 1 and will continue till the end of March. With the setting up of the camps, patrolling was also intensified in the lake. The drive to create awareness among the people to prevent bird poaching was also launched in the vulnerable areas, said the forest official.",

He said that the political families in these MVA and INDIA only want to come to power, asserting that Congress can\u2019t walk together with its allies. Naqvi further attacked the Congress and said that the opposition party didn\u2019t give importance to small and regional parties. He suggested that Congress should learn from BJP and Narendra Modi in handling the allies. While speaking on the seat-sharing tussle of INDIA Alliance in Jharkhand and MVA in Maharashtra, Naqvi said, \u201cBe it Jharkhand or Maharashtra, there is more of \u2018siyasi khurpench\u2019 than \u2018seats ka pench\u2019. Be it Aghadi or alliance, their \u2018khaandani khiladi\u2019 have the same aspiration \u2013 to come into power. Today, whichever alliance will be led by Congress party will have \u2018pench\u2019 as well as \u2018khurpench\u2019 because Congress has no DNA or mindset to walk ahead together with all allies. Congress thinks that small parties and regional parties have no importance. They should learn from the BJP and Narendra Modi.\u201dMeanwhile, Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat met Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) chief Sharad Pawar today ahead of the MVA\u2019s meeting to discuss seat sharing for the upcoming elections in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut informed that Thorat met Pawar in Delhi and will visit Matoshree in Mumbai to meet Uddhav Thackeray. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had earlier announced that elections in Maharashtra are to be held on November 20 and the counting for all 288 assembly constituencies will be held on November 23. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, while Shiv Sena won 56 seats and the Congress won 44 seats.

The victim's father wrote an email to Amit Shah on his birthday and sought time from him to get guidance on the ways to get the case expedited and get justice for his daughter. In the letter, the victim's father said that the family were \"under tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless\". \"After that heinous unforeseen incident happened to our daughter, we have been going through tremendous mental pressure and feeling helpless. I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you and gain your insights on the issue, as I believe your experience and guidance would be invaluable,\" the victim's father wrote in the email. Massive protests broke out after the rape-murder of the trainee doctor in Kolkata. Doctors went on strike demanding better working conditions and guarantees of safety. Doctors all over the country took to the streets demanding action against the accused. Sanjay Roy, believed to be the main accused in the case, was arrested, and the case was handed over to the CBI. The CBI, in its investigation, refuted claims of a gangrape and stated that Sanjay Roy committed the crime alone. Over 45 senior doctors and faculty members of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital collectively resigned in solidarity with their junior colleagues, who were protesting against the murder of the trainee doctor. In their resignation letters, the senior doctors stated that the demands of the junior doctors had not been addressed and that there had been \"no progress\" in the investigation of the trainee doctor\u2019s rape and murder.Furthermore, junior doctors, who sat on a hunger strike in protest against the government ended their strike on Monday after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The doctors, who had been demanding better working conditions and infrastructure improvements in the healthcare sector, also announced the withdrawal of the general medical strike they had earlier called.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

        "title": "Cash chaos ahead of Maharashtra elections: Crores in a car, water stream and allegations fly",
        "text": "In a dramatic turn of events, just weeks before the crucial November 20 Maharashtra Assembly elections, an electrifying scene unfolded late Monday night on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway. \n\nPune Rural police made a stunning seizure of \u20b95 crore in unaccounted cash at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza near Pune during a high-stakes nakabandi (on-road checking). The incident has sent shockwaves across the state, especially with the model code of conduct in force since October 15.\n\nWhile the police investigate, the political battlefield has erupted in accusations and counterclaims. Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) leader Sanjay Raut dropped a bombshell, alleging that the cash was part of a massive \u20b975 crore fund being distributed by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to his party candidates. Raut claimed the seized \u20b95 crore was just the tip of the iceberg, insisting that \u20b915 crore was in transit, but only \u20b95 crore was officially accounted for. According to Raut, the cash was on its way to Shinde\u2019s loyal MLA, Shahjibapu Patil, in Sangola, Solapur district.\n\nHowever, MLA Patil vehemently denied any involvement, branding the accusations as slanderous. \u201cEver since we broke away from Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s Shiv Sena, they\u2019ve been targeting us. I have no knowledge of the cash or the people carrying it,\u201d Patil said, calling Raut\u2019s claims an act of political vendetta. The car carrying the money has been impounded, and four individuals are now being grilled by police at the Rajgad police station.\n\nCash in Stream\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2014this explosive cash drama takes an even more bizarre twist. Far from the police checkpoints, in the sleepy town of Atpadi in Sangli, a different kind of treasure hunt was unfolding. Just before Diwali, the quiet banks of a local stream near the Ambabai temple transformed into a chaotic scene as rumors spread of cash notes flowing in the water. \n\nShocked villagers rushed to the site, scooping up thousands of rupees as they fished currency notes from the stream, unsure where the sudden windfall came from. Videos of the surreal event went viral, adding to the mounting mystery. As locals scramble for answers, police are now investigating the source of this aquatic cash flow.\n\nMeanwhile, in the midst of the frenzy, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MLA Rohit Pawar fired yet another salvo at the ruling BJP-led alliance, accusing them of resorting to cash-for-votes tactics. \u201cLike in the Lok Sabha elections, they are trying to buy votes with dirty money, but the people of Maharashtra won\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Pawar declared. He confidently asserted that this \u201ccorruption money\u201d wouldn\u2019t be enough to secure power for the ruling coalition.",

        "text": "Congress MP Kumari Selja on Tuesday welcomed Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s decision to enter full-time electoral politics, expressing her happiness that Gandhi will contest the upcoming elections from Wayanad.Selja criticised the BJP, claiming that they attempt to communalize issues where they face electoral challenges. \u201cThe BJP always communalizes issues where they are losing. This is an old tactic of the BJP. The country has been waiting for a long time. There has been a nationwide demand for Priyanka to enter full-time politics and contest elections. We are happy that she is going to fight from Wayanad. Today is the nomination day, and I wish her all the best. I am confident she will win there with record votes,\u201d she said. The senior Congress leader added, \u201cThe Minister said that machines should not overpower humanity. The Election Commission must pay attention to this. The issue of EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) has been raised repeatedly, and it is their responsibility to ensure that there should be no doubt anywhere in the country. Everything must be completely fair.\u201d Earlier, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met party chief Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi on Monday to discuss campaign strategies as she prepares to file her nomination for the by-elections in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. Vadra, along with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, will lead a roadshow from Wayanad\u2019s Kalpetta New Bus Stand in the morning before filing the nomination on October 23. After the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll, Congress declared Gandhi\u2019s candidature for the Wayanad seat as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala. Senior Congress leaders will also be present during Gandhi\u2019s nomination filing before the district collector in the afternoon. After being active in politics for five years, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Gandhi will make her electoral debut in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled to be held on November 13. The election commission also announced by-elections in 47 assembly seats across 15 states. If Priyanka Gandhi wins from Wayanad, she will be the third person from the Gandhi family to enter Parliament. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi retained the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacated the Wayanad seat, paving the way for his sister to make her electoral debut. Gandhi is contesting against Navya Haridas, a candidate fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Left Democratic Front\u2019s (LDF) candidate Sathyan Mokeri. Haridas is a two-time Kozhikode Corporation councillor. Rahul Gandhi had said both Rae Bareli and Wayanad would get two MPs and had also expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi winning from Wayanad. Priyanka Gandhi was responsible for taking care of the Gandhi family\u2019s stronghold in Amethi and Rae Bareli before entering active politics, where she emerged as an important strategist for her party. Meanwhile, Congress appointed Saral Patel as the media coordinator for Wayanad ahead of the by-election with immediate effect",

        "title": "India-China Agreement Explained: After 4 Years Eastern Ladakh Border Standoff Resolves - Key Details",
        "text": "In a significant development that could mark a turning point in India-China relations, China officially confirmed on October 22, 2024, that it had reached a resolution with India to resolve the prolonged border standoff in eastern Ladakh. This breakthrough comes after years of military tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which escalated in 2020 and has remained a source of concern in regional geopolitics.Diplomatic and Military Dialogue Yields ResultsChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced the resolution at a press briefing in Beijing, stating that China and India had been in close communication through both diplomatic and military channels to address the border issues.Over a recent period, China and India have been in close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues related to the China-India border, Lin Jian stated. Now the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant matters, which China speaks highly of. Going forward, China will work with India to implement these resolutions.While the Chinese government did not provide specifics of the agreement, the news comes as a positive step towards resolving one of the most tense and dangerous flashpoints in the region.Indias Announcement of DisengagementIndia, too, confirmed that the disengagement process with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh had been completed. On October 21, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that an agreement had been reached on restoring patrolling rights along the LAC, a key aspect of the border tension that had been unresolved since the violent clashes in 2020.Jaishankar said, We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed... We will be able to resume the patrolling that we were doing in 2020. I think its a good development.The disengagement likely covers the critical areas of Depsang and Demchok, regions that had been points of contention since the military standoff began over four years ago. These areas hold strategic importance due to their proximity to supply routes and military outposts.The Four-Year-Long Standoff: A Brief OverviewThe border dispute between India and China reached its peak in June 2020, when both nations troops engaged in violent clashes in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops. The skirmish, fought with sticks, stones, and improvised weapons, was the deadliest confrontation between the two countries in over four decades and marked a major escalation in a border conflict that had simmered for decades.Since then, both sides have maintained a heightened military presence along the disputed areas, particularly in eastern Ladakh. While rounds of diplomatic and military talks followed, they failed to produce any tangible results until now. The lack of a clear demarcation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and competing territorial claims have made the situation highly volatile.BRICS Summit and Potential for Improved Bilateral TiesThe announcement of the agreement coincides with the ongoing 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping were expected to discuss bilateral issues on the sidelines of the summit. While the specific details of their conversation are yet to be disclosed, the confirmation of the border agreement points to a broader effort to improve relations between the two Asian giants.When asked about the bilateral meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, We will keep you updated if anything comes up, indicating the possibility of further developments in the India-China relationship.This agreement could serve as a catalyst for broader discussions aimed at stabilizing bilateral ties, which have been strained since the Galwan Valley clashes. Both sides appear keen to avoid further military confrontations and work towards peaceful coexistence, at least in the immediate future.Historical Context of the India-China Border DisputeThe India-China border dispute dates back to the early years of post-colonial India. The two nations share a 3,488-kilometer-long border, much of which is not clearly demarcated, leading to frequent skirmishes and confrontations. The most significant conflict between the two nations occurred in 1962, when China defeated India in a brief but decisive war over disputed territories in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.Since then, tensions have flared periodically, with both sides accusing the other of transgressing into their territory. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash was a stark reminder of how quickly such tensions can escalate into violence, even in an era of nuclear deterrence.The recent standoff in eastern Ladakh added another layer of complexity to the border issue, as both nations were forced to divert military resources to maintain an uneasy peace in the region.Implications of the AgreementThe successful resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff could have far-reaching implications for regional stability. Here are some of the key takeaways:Resumption of Patrolling: India will now be able to resume patrolling in areas along the LAC, particularly in Depsang and Demchok, where both sides had fortified their positions.Easing of Military Tensions: With the disengagement process complete, both India and China can now focus on reducing their military presence in the region, potentially lowering the risk of accidental escalations or clashes.Bilateral Cooperation: The agreement signals a willingness on both sides to resolve disputes through dialogue rather than military force. This could pave the way for broader discussions on trade, security, and regional cooperation.Geopolitical Impact: With both India and China being key players in regional and global politics, their ability to manage bilateral relations peacefully will have a stabilizing effect on South Asia and beyond.Strategic Positioning: The resolution allows India to focus more on other security concerns, such as its borders with Pakistan and internal issues, while China can turn its attention to other geopolitical interests, such as its ambitions in the South China Sea.Future ChallengesWhile the agreement marks a major step forward, several challenges remain. The border between India and China is still not clearly defined, and periodic confrontations could arise in the future. Additionally, the resolution does not address broader territorial claims, such as Chinas claims over Arunachal Pradesh, which remains a contentious issue.The effectiveness of this agreement will depend largely on how both nations implement the disengagement process and manage future disagreements along the LAC. Continued dialogue and trust-building measures will be critical in preventing future flare-ups.Conclusion: A New Chapter in India-China Relations?The resolution of the eastern Ladakh standoff is being hailed as a diplomatic victory for both India and China. It marks the end of one of the most tense periods in their bilateral relationship in recent history. While challenges remain, the agreement offers hope that both nations can move towards a more stable and cooperative future.As the world watches closely, the successful implementation of this agreement could set a precedent for resolving other contentious issues between the two countries and contribute to broader regional peace and security.",

        "title": "PCOS: Watch Out For These Common Myths",
        "text": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age, causing a variety of symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, excessive levels of androgens (male hormones), and the presence of small cysts on the ovaries. The exact cause of PCOS is unclear, but it is often linked to insulin resistance, genetics, and inflammation. Symptoms may include weight gain, acne, hair thinning, and difficulty in conceiving. While PCOS can lead to complications like infertility and metabolic issues, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medical treatments. There are various myths surrounding PCOS, read on to find out the most common ones.\n\nCommon myths about PCOS\n\n1. Myth: PCOS always causes infertility\n\nMany women with PCOS worry that they won't be able to have children. However, PCOS doesn't make pregnancy impossible. It can make conception more difficult due to irregular ovulation, but with proper medical treatment and lifestyle changes, many women with PCOS can conceive.\n\n2. Myth: You need to have cysts on your ovaries to have PCOS\n\nDespite its name, not all women with PCOS have ovarian cysts. The term \"polycystic\" refers to the appearance of the ovaries in some women, but PCOS is primarily a hormonal imbalance and doesn't necessarily require the presence of cysts.\n\n3. Myth: PCOS only affects overweight women\n\nWhile weight gain is a common symptom, PCOS can affect women of all body types. Lean women can also suffer from PCOS and may face challenges related to hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, and insulin resistance.\n\n4. Myth: Weight loss can cure PCOS\n\nWeight loss can help alleviate some symptoms of PCOS, particularly for those who are overweight, but it is not a cure. PCOS is a chronic condition that can be managed but not entirely eliminated. Even women at a healthy weight can have PCOS.\n\n5. Myth: Irregular periods are the only symptom of PCOS\n\nPCOS is more than just irregular periods. It can also cause symptoms such as acne, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), hair thinning, and insulin resistance. The condition affects multiple systems in the body, not just the reproductive system.\n\n6. Myth: PCOS goes away after menopause\n\nPCOS does not disappear after menopause. While some symptoms, like irregular periods, may no longer be an issue, other symptoms such as insulin resistance, metabolic issues, and an increased risk of heart disease can continue into later life.\n\n7. Myth: Birth control pills cure PCOS\n\nBirth control pills are often used to manage PCOS symptoms, such as regulating periods and reducing acne, but they do not cure the condition. They help manage symptoms temporarily, and stopping them usually leads to the return of symptoms.\n\n8. Myth: PCOS is a rare condition\n\nPCOS is actually quite common, affecting about 1 in 10 women worldwide. Many women go undiagnosed because symptoms can vary widely and mimic other conditions, leading to a lack of proper diagnosis and awareness.\n\n9. Myth: Diet alone can fix PCOS\n\nWhile a healthy diet is essential for managing PCOS symptoms, it is not always enough on its own. PCOS often requires a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, hormonal treatments. A balanced diet can improve insulin sensitivity and help with weight management, but it may not resolve all symptoms.\n\nKeep these points in mind if you have or might have PCOS.\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

        "text": "Beirut: Lebanon\u2019s state media reported Israeli airstrikes near the southern city of Tyre on Tuesday, shortly after Israel's military issued an evacuation warning. Video footage showed smoke rising after Israel warned residents of Al-Hawsh, just south of Tyre, to evacuate. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that \"enemy aircraft launched a series of strikes\" on the area. This escalation comes after Lebanon's health ministry revised the death toll from an Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Beirut on Monday night, stating that 13 people, including a child, were killed. The previous estimate had been four. The strike, which took place near the Rafik Hariri Hospital, Lebanon\u2019s largest public health facility, also left 57 people injured and flattened four buildings in the area, according to reports. Rescuers were still searching for survivors under the rubble on Tuesday, as locals described hearing a cell phone ringing beneath the debris. Monday night\u2019s strike followed Israel's evacuation warnings and targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The Ouzai neighborhood, minutes away from the Jnah area, was hit for the first time in the conflict, sparking an exodus of residents. No warnings were issued for the densely populated area around Rafik Hariri Hospital, which has seen an influx of displaced people from southern Lebanon. Lebanese authorities report that nearly a month of war between Israel and Hezbollah has claimed at least 1,489 lives in Lebanon, with more than a million people displaced, many of whom have fled to neighboring Syria. The ongoing conflict has heavily strained shelters and relief efforts. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel to push for a ceasefire, as diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza and Lebanon conflicts continue.",

She was barely a child of 3.5 years of age, however, instead of showing any love, affection and protection to the victim, the convict, on the contrary, made her a victim of lust,\" it noted.The court found it a \"clear case\" of betrayal.Apart from Pocso law, the man was convicted under Section 376 AB (punishment for committing rape on a woman under 12 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code.In addition to the 20-year RI, the court saddled the convict with Rs 50,000 fine and awarded Rs 1.2 lakh compensation to the minor survivor.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Oct 22, 2024Must Watch",

        "text": "Eight students from Balochistan have reportedly gone missing from their shared residence in Gulistan-i-Jauhar in Pakistan\u2019s biggest city Karachi, according to a report by Dawn. Family members allege that law enforcement agencies \u201ctook away\u201d the students, but police have declined to comment on these allegations.According to reports, the missing students\u2013Shoaib Ali, Haneef, Ishfaq , Shahzad, Bebarg Ameer, Zubair, Qambar Ali, and Saeedullah disappeared on October 16. Three of them are enrolled at Karachi University, three attend a seminary, one is an intermediate student, and another studies at Urdu University. Families maintain that the students were picked up by law enforcement from their residence in Rustam Zikri Goth.Talking to Dawn, Wazir Ahmed, the elder brother of missing student Qambar Ali, stated, \u201cQambar is an intermediate student in Mashkey, Awaran, but he was taking coaching classes at a tuition academy near Nipa.\u201d He, along with the families of other missing students, approached the police on October 17, but the SHO refused to file their report. Ahmed emphasised that they have no political affiliations or involvement in any suspicious activities, demanding the immediate release of the students.In response to the situation, Riaz Ahmed, a member of the Karachi University syndicate, condemned the disappearances, stating, \u201cIt is horrifying that students are apprehended and made to disappear without charges. Young students should not be subjected to the harsh realities of state actions.\u201dThe issue of enforced appearances is a significant human rights concern that reflects the broader challenges facing the region. In Balochistan, enforced disappearances have been reported extensively, with individuals, often activists, political leaders, and students, going missing under mysterious circumstances, frequently attributed to state security forces or non-state actors.These disappearances create a climate of fear and insecurity, impacting the social fabric of communities. Families of the disappeared face immense challenges, including emotional distress and a lack of access to justice. The government has been criticized for its insufficient response to these cases, with many families left without answers about the fate of their loved ones.",

While 293.81 kg of heroin was seized from containers imported by Sandhu Exports at Nhava Sheva Port (Navi Mumbai) by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Delhi police Special Cell had impounded 352.71 kg of drugs from two vehicles and a flat in Faridabad, Haryana.\n\nAccording to the ED, the arrested people coordinated the smuggling, storage and distribution of heroin across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. \n\n\u201cThese individuals were key members of a syndicate that smuggled heroin from Afghanistan and Iran concealing them within shipments of talc stone and gypsum powder. The accused persons incorporated Sandhu Exports, a front company owned by Prabhjit Singh, to carry out the smuggling of drugs,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED uncovered a highly sophisticated heroin smuggling and money laundering network where identification of multiple bank accounts, cash transactions and operational expenses by the accused has been made, said the agency. \n\nThe accused disguised the origin of the illicit funds, which were further layered and integrated into seemingly legitimate financial activities. \n\n\u201cThe syndicate did not make any payments to Afghan suppliers until the drugs were sold in local market. Further, the accused used cash payments to purchase multiple vehicles...from second-hand market for supplying the drugs from the storage hubs to other points of distribution,\u201d said an official. \n\nThe agency said cash was used for purchase of high-end smartphones and encrypted communication apps were used to coordinate smuggling activities. \n\n\u201cDrugs smuggled from Iran and Afghanistan used to be imported via Nava Sheva port, later stored at a rented godown in Shivpuri (Madhya Pradesh) and further distributed for local supply in parts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. The transportation was carried out in lesser quantities of 10 kg to prevent detection by law enforcement agencies,\u201d it said. \n\nThe ED has attached a property in Jandoli village (Rajpura, Punjab), multiple bank accounts in the names of the accused and fixed deposits.",

        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 21 (IANS) Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar says the Mahayuti-led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) remains unified with a clear and mutually-agreed seat sharing formula, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Congress, Shiv Sena(UBT) and NCP(SP) is facing internal squabbles over constituency allocation.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with IANS, Shelar claims that the Mahayuti government will come back to power after the elections. Here are some excerpts:\n\nIANS: Although the BJP has announced the first list, talks for seat sharing among the Mahayuti are not yet concluded. Is it due to differences? The MVA is also struggling to arrive at an understanding. What is your take?\n\nShelar: There is remarkable unity and discipline within the Mahayuti alliance. We have finalised our seat-sharing proportions and accordingly our list of candidates has also been declared. There is also clarity that the elections will be contested under the leadership of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. However, within the MVA, there is no consensus, no balanced seat-sharing arrangement and all their allied partners are embroiled in internal debates. Either before arriving at a consensus over seat sharing or immediately after the results, the MVA is sure to be in tatters after November 23. The MVA\u2019s expiry date is arriving soon.\n\nIANS: How confident are you about the Mahayuti forming the government once again in Maharashtra?\n\nShelar: Absolutely confident. Every election is different in terms of the prevailing issues, subjects, developments and the overall ecosystem. We, as the Mahayuti, are confident of winning the elections as we have only focussed on working for the development of the state. We have decided to go out to the people of Maharashtra with the list of development works and initiatives undertaken.\n\nIANS: Do you fear fake narratives will impact the results like during the Lok Sabha elections?\n\nShelar: Fake narratives were spread during the Lok Sabha elections which had impacted us. Today, once again, conspiracies to spread lies and fake narratives are being made. It is our job to stop the fake narrative and to speak in the interest of the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray alleged that 1,000-odd acres of land has been transferred in the name of Adani. I challenged him to give evidence to prove his statement. If Aaditya Thackeray has the courage, he should come forward for an open discussion and counter our questions. He is behaving like a spokesperson of urban Naxals and deliberately trying to spread lies, disturbance and unrest and create an image that there is anarchy in the state.\n\nIANS: You have been targeting the MVA over \u2018Vote Jihad\u2019. What is your comment?\n\nShelar: The MVA leaders are resorting to doing politics of appeasement. We have always believed in \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019. Our Hindutva also revolves around development of all elements of society. We believe in taking everybody together in our march of progress. Why should Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya get worried about it? The Mahayuti government is working towards ensuring homes for the poor in Dharavi. But they are making attempts to incite Dharavikars and spread fear in the minds of the poor Marathi, Muslim, Dalits making them believe that they will never get their rightful homes in Dharavi.\n\nIANS: What is the Mahayuti\u2019s agenda for the forthcoming Assembly elections?\n\nShelar: Our agenda is development. The Mahayuti government believes in delivering on its promises. The government launched the Coastal Road, the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg, the Mumbai-Delhi corridor, bullet train and much more.

The clash led to the tragic death of Ram Gopal Mishra, a 22-year-old who succumbed to gunshot injuries.Following the incident, the area descended into chaos, with mobs engaging in widespread vandalism and arson, targeting homes, shops, showrooms, hospitals, and vehicles.Local authorities have responded by registering multiple FIRs against both unidentified rioters and some named individuals. As of now, the police have detained 55 suspects and increased security measures in the town, which has a mixed population.This marks the third major communal incident in Bahraich, following previous outbreaks in 2009 and 2014.In October 2009, violence erupted in the same area after rumors circulated about objectionable materials being thrown at a religious site, leading to arson and destruction. A similar incident occurred in January 2014, triggered by disputes over loud DJ music, which also affected the Nanpara area.",

        "text": "The Cyber Crime Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police has busted a six-member gang reportedly involved in running an online share trading scam and duping a person of \u20b914 crore. \n\nAdditional Director General of Police, Cyber Crime, Sandeep Mittal, said the online trading scam involved \u201cfraudulent individuals misleading victims into investing in fake share trading opportunities, promising high returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cCybercriminals, forming a group via WhatsApp, have created share investment apps, misleading people into believing they can earn up to 500 times their investment by trading shares online. They have circulated false information suggesting that many people are making significant profits through these apps, thereby cheating the public under the guise of online share trading,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\nThe police said the complainant in this case was contacted via WhatsApp by a member of the gang in April, introducing himself as someone who represented an institution called Black Rock Asset Management Business School. He falsely claimed that investing in Black Rock would yield a 500% profit within two months, while also stating that the company was SEBI-approved. \n\nThe man convinced the complainant to invest with a stipulation that he must pay a 20% service charge on the profits generated from the investment. The complainant was then persuaded to download a mobile app through a link and subsequently invested \u20b914 crore into various bank accounts, the police said. \n\nWhen the complainant realised that the invested money was not being returned, he filed a complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. Based on this, an FIR was registered at Cyber Crime Wing Headquarters, Chennai \u2013 SCCIC (State Cyber Crime Investigation Centre), and the police retrieved the money from 13 bank accounts. \n\nAfter analysing the call records and money trail, the special team of police arrested V. Subramanian, 39, from Chengalpattu, who is the first-layer beneficiary ICICI Bank account holder of the fraudulent transaction of \u20b921.5 lakh. \n\nBased on his confession, the other suspects were arrested. They are: M. Madan, 43, from Neelankarai, who owns a chit company in T. Nagar; R. Saravanapriyan, 34, from Thiruvallur, who is an associate producer in the film industry; Sathish Singh, 46, from Avadi, who is an associate of Saravanapriyan; Shafahed, 38, from Pulianthope, who owns a shop that converts currency; and D. Manikandan, 30, from Madurai, who previously worked at a cine producer\u2019s office in Chennai.\n\nAdditionally, two cryptocurrency wallet accounts were frozen. Action is being taken to arrest a gang based in north India that allegedly masterminded these cybercrimes and recover the defrauded money, said Mr. Mittal.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will file her nomination for the Wayanad Lok Sabha bypoll on Wednesday, party sources said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chiefs Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will be present on the occasion, they said.Ahead of her nomination filing, Priyanka Gandhi met party chief Kharge here on Monday and took his blessings. On Wednesady, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will also lead a roadshow from Kalpetta New Bus Stand at 11 AM. The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.Priyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary byeelection. \"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.Congress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said. With the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.Soon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, the Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate from the seat in Kerala. With the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.Days after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.If elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.The EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies. The bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.Since her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.However, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.She emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year. After her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi had said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\"\"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both the constituencies.Priyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.",

This development has come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia to attend the crucial BRICS summit. The patrolling arrangement between both countries can lead to disengagement and could be a stepping stone towards resolving the skirmishes that started in May 2020.\n\nWhile addressing the media during a special MEA briefing, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that diplomatic and military officials from both countries were in talks with each other. \u201cOver the last few weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums and as a result of these discussions, an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border area, leading to disengagement and resolution,\u201d he stated. \nResponding to a media question on possible meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS in Russia, Misri stated that there are chances of a bilateral meeting between both the leaders. \n\u201cAs far as the question on the bilateral meetings is concerned, this is a multilateral event, though there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking over the overall program of the prime minister. There are a lot of requests for bilateral meetings and we will update on the bilaterals as they evolve,\u201d Misri stated. \nPM Modi, will attend the BRICS summit in Kazan this week. Starting from Tuesday, his short, two-day journey comes as a response to the invitation extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a recent statement on Friday, Denis Alipov, who represents Russia as its ambassador to India, teased the possibility of welcoming new entrants into the BRICS assembly. Such an addition could hugely amplify the group\u2019s capacity as an influential frontier, upholding the interests of the Global South. \nAt an online \u2018BRICS 2.0 meet: New Members, New Horizons\u2019, this comment was made looking forward to the soon-to-be-held BRICS convention in Kazan, next week. At the moment, the holding of BRICS\u2019 chair position is in Russia\u2019s hands. This significant alliance brings together the advanced developing economies of the world. Initially, the four original countries were Brazil, Russia, India, and China, hence the name BRIC. South Africa hopped on board in 2010, sparking the change to the currently known name, BRICS. \n(Note: This is a developing story and further details will be added.) \n\n\r\n\r\nSource link",

        "title": "Priyanka Gandhi to file nomination for Wayanad bypoll on Wednesday",
        "text": "New Delhi:Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will file her nomination for the Wayanad Lok Sabha bypoll on Wednesday, party sources said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chiefs Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will be present on the occasion, they said. Ahead of her nomination filing, Priyanka Gandhi met party chief Kharge here on Monday and took his blessings. On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will also lead a roadshow from Kalpetta New Bus Stand at 11 AM. The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said. Priyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary byeelection. \"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said. Congress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said. With the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics. Soon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, the Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate from the seat in Kerala. With the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it. Days after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut. If elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together. The EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies. The bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23. Since her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli. However, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh. She emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year. After her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi had said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both the constituencies. Priyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.",

        "text": "The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Friday rejected the bail and anticipatory bail applications filed by suspended Janata Dal (S) leader Prajwal Revanna, who is accused of rape and sexual assault. The HC also dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking legal action against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged comments against former Hassan MP Prajwal during a Lok Sabha campaign speech in Karnataka earlier this year.\nThe All India Dalit Action Committee had filed the PIL, requesting the court to direct Gandhi to issue an unconditional apology to women for his statements, and disrespecting the Constitution. The petition claimed that Gandhi made the remarks on May 2 during election rallies in Shivamogga and Raichur, just prior to the polls on May 7, 2024.\nThe bench stated that the court must uphold a standard when determining whether a matter qualifies as a public interest issue, noting that not every grievance can be raised in court via a PIL. They acknowledged that Gandhi\u2019s remarks, while potentially controversial, do not meet the criteria for a PIL.\nIn dismissing the case, the court reiterated the importance of careful consideration regarding what constitutes a public interest issue, affirming its discretion in handling such petitions.\nAdditionally, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on the petitioner while dismissing the case.\nThe counsel representing the All India Dalit Action Committee argued that Gandhi\u2019s statements outraged the modesty of women and constituted fabricated accusations against Revanna. They contended that such speeches were damaging in a small town like Hassan, creating mistrust among households.\nThey sought the court to impose a token fine on Gandhi for the supposed misuse of his public position, breach of public trust, and violations of various legal provisions, including the Model Code of Conduct for the 2024 Parliamentary elections and the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\nDuring the hearing, the bench, consisting of Chief Justice N V Anjaria and Justice K V Aravind, indicated that the case did not qualify as a public interest litigation. The court stated, \u201cWe have not said anything on the merits; we are not saying anything on the merits of the speech. We have only said this cannot be the subject matter under public interest litigation,\u201d according to Live Law.",

        "text": "A budget of Rs 10 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Baoli Sahib temple in the Punjab province to address the long-standing demands of the Hindu community in Pakistan. This marks the first phase of reconstruction, 64 years after the temple was rendered dysfunctional.The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a federal body responsible for overseeing minority worship sites in Pakistan, has commenced work on restoring the Baoli Sahib temple, located in Zafarwal town in Narowal, a city along the western bank of the Ravi River. The temple has been out of service since 1960, according to Dawn News.Currently, there is no functional Hindu temple in the entire Narowal district, forcing the local Hindu population to either conduct religious ceremonies at home or travel to temples in Sialkot and Lahore. Ratan Lal Arya, the former president of the Pak Dharamsthan Committee, explained that the temple became non-functional after the ETPB took control of it. The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time. The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million. The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population resides in Sindh province, where they share cultural and linguistic ties with their Muslim neighbors.",

        "text": "In a dramatic development, India and China have reached an agreement on \u201cpatrolling arrangements \u201d and a resolution of the military standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) , the government announced on Monday (October 21, 2024). The patrolling arrangement agreement extends beyond the areas along the LAC where there has already been a disengagement of military personnel over the past few years, and include the so far unresolved areas of Demchok and Depsang, sources told The Hindu, indicating that the India-China standoff since April 2020 is now expected to be resolved.\n\nWhile the MEA did not give further details of the agreement, and whether there would be a reversion to the status quo pre-2020, and whether the \u201cbuffer zones\u201d more recently created would continue to exist for patrolling purposes\u201d, Mr. Misri said that the two sides had \u201creached an agreement on the issues that were being discussed\u201d\n\nThe announcement, by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, came amidst a media briefing on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit on Tuesday which he will attend along with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cOver the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other in a variety of forums, and as a result of these discussions, agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the line of actual control in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists adding that the two sides would now take the \u201cnext steps\u201d on this.\n\nThe timing of the India-China agreement announcement, just a day before the BRICS Summit indicates that a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi on the side-lines, that has been speculated about is now expected to take place. Although the two leaders met as many as 18 times prior to the Galwan clashes in June 2020 , where 20 Indian soldiers were killed, they have spoken only twice since then, on the side-lines of the G-20 summit in Indonesia in 2022, and the BRICS summit in South Africa in 2023.\n\n Mr. Misri did not confirm a meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi , he said that government is discussing the scheduling of a number of bilateral meetings in Kazan, the venue of the BRICS summit.\n\n\u201c[BRICS] is a multilateral event, though, of course, there is always a provision for bilateral meetings on the sidelines. We are currently looking into the overall program of the Prime Minister. There are a number of requests for bilateral meetings, and we will update you on the bilaterals as they evolve, as soon as feasible,\u201d Mr. Misri told journalists when asked, not denying that a meeting with the Chinese leader was among those.\n\nMr. Misri, who was previously India\u2019s Ambassador to China, and was no doubt, a key part of the recent negotiations, did not give further details of the agreement between both sides. He referred to recent meetings that had led to the breakthrough, which include two meetings between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Chinese FM Wang Yi in June-July, two meetings of the WMCC mechanism of diplomatic and military officials in July-August, followed by a meeting between NSA Ajit Doval and Mr. Wang, who is also the Special Representative on border talks in September. These were followed by intense negotiations of military commanders and MEA officials in the last few weeks. With Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi\u2019s travels to Russia for the BRICS confirmed, a deadline appeared to have emerged for the negotiations to conclude with a result.",

        "text": "Two crucial meetings between Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi in July, 31 rounds of diplomatic meetings and 21 rounds of military talks over four years paved the way for India and China to achieve an agreement over disengagement at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\nForeign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday said both sides have agreed to restart patrolling on the LAC, which is leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020. He said the diplomatic and military negotiators from both sides had been in close touch in recent weeks. Government sources called it a \u201cbig development\u201d.\nALSO READ | India, China Reach Agreement On Disengagement, Border Patrolling Ahead Of BRICS Meet\nThe statement came just a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit for the BRICS Summit to Kazan, Russia, where he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nThere were seven points of conflict on the LAC since the Galwan clash in 2020, five of which had seen disengagement, but the troops from both sides remained in an eyeball-to-eyeball conflict in Depsang Plains and Demchock. The issue also became a major political flashpoint in India with the Congress attacking the Modi government for alleged presence of Chinese troops on Indian soil.\n\n#IndiaChina Stand-off | India-China reach patrolling agreement on LAC\nIt has to translate on ground, Depsang and Demchok are really important: Lt.

EAM highlighted the need to redouble efforts to achieve complete disengagement from the remaining areas in Eastern Ladakh,\u201d the Indian side had said, after the meeting.\nThe two ministers met again on July 25 in Vientiane, Lao PDR on the sidelines of the ASEAN-related Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting to lay the groundwork. \u201cBoth the ministers agreed on the need to work with purpose and urgency to achieve complete disengagement at the earliest,\u201d an Indian statement had said about the meeting.\n\nThe meeting also resolved to hold an \u201cearly meeting\u201d of the Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) to take the discussions forward. This particular meeting of WMCC happened in Delhi on July 31 and again in China on August 29.\n\u201cIn line with the guidance provided by two Foreign Ministers\u2019 meetings in Astana and Vientiane in July 2024 to accelerate their discussion, and building on the WMCC meeting held last month, the two sides had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to narrow down the differences and find early resolution of the outstanding issues. For this, they further agreed for intensified contact through diplomatic and military channels,\u201d the Indian side had said after the August 29 meeting in Beijing.\nThere were total of 31 rounds of talks of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) and 21 rounds of India-China Corps Commander Level meetings over the past four years.\nThe opposition could now ask for more details about the said disengagement agreements arrived at between India and China. Meanwhile, the Modi government has attacked the Congress for squandering thousands of square kilometers of land to China under the Nehru rule.",

        "title": "Remarks on PM's degree: Kejriwal faces defamation trial in Gujarat as SC upholds summons",
        "text": "New Delhi: Former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal is facing criminal proceedings in a defamation case over his alleged remarks over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification after the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed his plea to quash summons. A Gujarat Metropolitan court had summoned Kejriwal and AAP's Sanjay Singh in the defamation case over their alleged \"sarcastic\" and \"derogatory\" statements related to PM Modi's educational degrees. Gujarat University Registrar Piyush Patel had filed the defamation case against the politicians over their alleged comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the chief information commissioner (CIC) for providing information about Modi's degrees under the Right to Information Act. A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S V N Bhatti noted that a separate bench of the apex court had junked the plea filed by AAP leader Sanjay Singh on April 8 in the same case, who is a co-accused in the case. \"We must have a consistent approach. Having regard to that view, we would not like to entertain the present plea. The same is dismissed,\" said the bench. The top court, however, said all contentions were left open to be decided in the trial and it was expressing no opinion on the merits of the case. Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, submitted Patel was not an aggrieved party in the matter. \"If at all the statement was defamatory, it is for Modi to file a criminal defamation case and not for the Gujarat University registrar,\" he said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the University, said a separate bench of the apex court had already dismissed Singh's petition on April 8. Mehta said the degree had been uploaded on the university website and referred to the dismissal of the CIC order by the Gujarat High Court. Arguing that no case of defamation was made out, Singhvi stated that Kejriwal merely asked why the university was not publishing Modi's degree. The bench, however, rejected Kejriwal's plea. The high court had on February 16 dismissed the pleas by Singh and Kejriwal seeking quashing of the summons issued against them in the defamation case. Both had challenged in the high court the summons issued by a trial court in the case filed by the Gujarat University and the subsequent order of the sessions court dismissing their revision pleas against the summons. According to the complainant, the two politicians made \"defamatory\" statements at press conferences and on microblogging platform X, targeting the university over Modi's degrees. Their comments against the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the institution, which has established its name among the public, he alleged. \"Their statements were sarcastic and intentionally made to hurt the prestige of the university,\" he added. On March 31, 2023, the high court quashed the 2016 order of the CIC asking Gujarat University to provide information on Modi's degrees to Kejriwal, and observed the AAP chief's RTI plea appeared to be \"politically vexatious and motivated\" instead of being based on \"sound public interest considerations\".",

We have concluded that there are two areas we can explore - 1) Amendment to Aircraft Security Rules... one of the ideas we wish to implement through these rule changes is that once we apprehend the perpetrator behind these threats, we aim to place them on the no-fly list... 2) Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Civil Aviation Act... Naidu explained.Bomb threats cripples Indian aviationOn Sunday alone, more than 20 flights from IndiGo, Akasa Air, and Vistara were disrupted by bomb threats.This led to a meeting between BCAS officials and airline CEOs, as the threats continue to cause alarm and necessitate extensive security checks.Additionally, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Director General RS Bhatti and BCAS Director General Zulfiquar Hasan met with Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan on Monday to discuss the recent surge in hoax calls.During the half-hour meeting at the Home Ministry, both director generals briefed the home secretary on the recent wave of hoax bomb threats, which have caused widespread panic and prompted exhaustive security measures by Indian aviation authorities, intelligence agencies, and other departments.",

The nomination will be filed before the district collector at 12 noon on October 23, they said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi is the UDF candidate for the Wayanad parliamentary by-election.\n\n\"The Congress general secretary will officially file her nomination on Wednesday before the Returning Officer in Kalpetta,\" a source said.\n\nCongress Chief Ministers, along with prominent national and state leaders, are also likely to be present to show their support, the sources said.\n\nWith the Election Commission (EC) announcing the bypoll to the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat last week, the stage was set for Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut from the Kerala constituency that could see her enter Parliament five years after joining active politics.\n\nSoon after the EC announced the Wayanad bypoll, Congress declared that Priyanka Gandhi (52) would be its candidate for the seat in Kerala.\n\nWith the Congress fielding the AICC general secretary from Wayanad, party workers had put up posters in the constituency which had \"Wayanadinte Priyankari (Wayanad's beloved)\" written on it.\n\nDays after the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had announced in June itself that Rahul Gandhi will retain the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh and vacate the Wayanad seat in Kerala, from where his sister Priyanka Gandhi will make her electoral debut.\n\nIf elected, this will be the first time that Priyanka Gandhi will enter Parliament as an MP. This will also be the first time that the three Gandhi family members -- Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka -- will be in Parliament together.\n\nThe EC last Tuesday announced bypolls to the Wayanad and Nanded Lok Sabha seats as well as in 48 Assembly constituencies.\n\nThe bypoll to the Wayanad parliamentary seat and 47 Assembly seats will be held on November 13, along with the first phase of polling for the Jharkhand Assembly. The results will be announced on November 23.\n\nSince her entry into active politics in 2019, Priyanka Gandhi has often been projected as a possible challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi and also, as a successor to Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi in the family pocket borough of Rae Bareli.\n\nHowever, the Congress has decided to field her from Wayanad, the parliamentary seat that her elder brother Rahul won for two consecutive elections. Priyanka Gandhi was earlier the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nShe emerged as the party's strategist and star campaigner, helping the Congress make impressive gains in some states as well as in the Lok Sabha polls held earlier in the year.\n\nAfter her name was announced for the Wayanad bypoll in June, Priyanka Gandhi said, \"I am not nervous at all.... I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad. All I will say is that I will not let them feel his (Rahul Gandhi's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative.\" \"I have a good relationship with Rae Bareli as I worked there for 20 years and that relationship will never break,\" she had said, adding that both she and her brother will work together in both constituencies.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi's poll debut comes at a time when the Congress has been jolted by an electoral defeat in Haryana and it would be interesting to see if she would be able to steer the Wayanad campaign, along with the canvassing for the Jharkhand and Maharashtra polls, to put the grand old party back on track.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Tata Consumer Products, one of the leading FMCG majors in India, witnessed its share prices tumble nearly 10% in yesterday's trading after reporting lackluster financial results for the second quarter of the current fiscal year.\n\nThe company's revenues from operations grew by a modest 13% to Rs. 4,214.5 crores compared to the same period last year. However, operating margins declined by 30 basis points to 14.9% due to rising input costs. Net profits increased by 6% to Rs. 359 crores year-on-year, but fell short of street expectations.\n\nWeak demand, especially in the urban markets, impacted the volume growth for Tata Consumer during the quarter. The tea business, which contributes over half of total revenues, registered muted sales. Rising inflation has also constrained discretionary spending by consumers.\n\nCommenting on the results, analysts at Elara Securities highlighted the competitive pressures in the FMCG sector and slowing demand trends in urban regions as near-term headwinds. Although they remain optimistic about the company's diverse portfolio and broader growth prospects, earnings estimates for the next two fiscal years have been cut to factor in the pressure on revenues and margins.\n\nWhile Tata Consumer looks well-positioned in the long run with its brands and distribution expansion plans, investors seem concerned about the soft demand environment squeezing profits in the immediate quarters. The company will need to efficiently manage costs and urgently revive volume growth in key categories to allay such concerns. For now, uncertainty over the macroeconomic outlook continues to impact sentiment around fast moving consumer goods players.",

        "text": "Indian and Chinese soldiers will be able to resume patrolling in the way they had been doing before the border face-off began in May 2020, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said today at the NDTV World Summit.\n\nEarlier today, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri announced India and China have arrived on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas, and it can lead to disengagement and resolution of tension.\n\nThe breakthrough came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia to attend the BRICS summit tomorrow.\n\n\"We reached an agreement on patrolling, and we have gone back to the 2020 position. With that we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia.\n\n\"There are areas which for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020,\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nThe External Affairs Minister said the LAC breakthrough is a good development that happened due to \"patient and persevering diplomacy\".\n\nREAD | India To Resume Patrolling In Ladakh After Big Breakthrough With China\n\n\"... At various points of time people almost gave up. We have always maintained on the one hand we obviously had to do counter deployment, and we have been negotiating since September 2020. It has been a very patient process, though more complicated than how it should have been,\" Mr Jaishankar told NDTV.\n\n\"The important thing is if we have reached an understanding, I think what it does is it creates a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border, which were there before 2020. That was a major concern. If there is no peace and tranquillity, how can other areas of bilateral ties improve?\" Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nWhile he agreed people may speculate on the LAC development, the External Affairs Minister said he would use \"caution\" in responding on whether this positive development would spread to trade ties.\n\n\"It (LAC breakthrough) has just happened. I would not go so fast at the moment,\" Mr Jaishankar said, referring to trade.\n\nThe last meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs was held on August 29 in Beijing. The two sides then had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the LAC to narrow down differences and find early resolution of outstanding issues.\n\nIt was agreed that restoration of peace and tranquillity, and respect for the LAC are the essential basis for restoration of normalcy in bilateral relations.\n\nEarlier this month, Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had said the two sides have resolved the \"low-hanging fruits\" and now need to address difficult situations, adding there was \"positive signalling\" from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries.\n\nIndian and Chinese military commanders too had been meeting regularly seeking complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh as an essential basis for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.\n\nSome areas still remained to be de-escalated after Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from Gogra-Hot Springs in Ladakh in September 2022. The Chinese forces in this area had returned to pre-2020 positions. Even then, Chinese soldiers were still believed to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north in the Depsang plains.\n\nFierce clashes between soldiers of both sides took place in eastern Ladakh's Galwan in June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action. Over 40 Chinese soldiers were killed or injured.",

Indian and Chinese military leaders have been meeting regularly to pursue complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, viewing this as crucial for restoring peace and tranquillity in the border regions.\n\nIndia and China relations became tense following the violent border clashes in 2020 in Eastern Ladakh, resulting in the death of about 20 Indian soldiers and more than 20 fatalities in the Chinese PLA.

We lost the Lok Sabha badly,\u201d said the Deputy Chief Minister. \n\nHe added that if we start to think that JD-S is weak, then \u201cwe will be the biggest fools\u201d. \n\n\u201cWe have discussed and gathered opinions of the ministers. Instead of a meeting of the election committee, we have discussed with the election in-charges. The decision on the party\u2019s candidates has been made.

We are moving towards forming a committee for this,\u201d the Deputy Chief Minister claimed.\n\nHe added that the citizens should also provide information about which areas are facing such problems. \n\n\u201cI have discussed this with the chief engineer and have been in touch with the BBMP control room since last night and received information.

One star who is most likely to be not picked for the Tour of Australia is Cheteshwar Pujara. The veteran batter, known for his dogged resistance in the face of strong challenge, has a proven record in Australia. The 36-year old has been overlooked from international matches, and the last match he played for India was in June, 2023.\r\n\r\n(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Pujara has now surpassed the great Brian Lara's tally of 65 first-clas tons with a century for Saurashtra against Chhattisgarh in a Ranjji Trophy match. Pujara has 66 tons now. He also went past the 21000-mark in first-class run tally. Regarding his absence, Australia star Pat Cummins said: \"It comes down to who wants to outlast each other, which I quite like that aspect of Test cricket. It's going to be a shame that he is not there, but I'm sure they'll pick someone else who's in a similar kind of style.\"\"It was always great playing (against) Pujara. He was one of those guys who never really felt like he was getting away from you. But then he would (just) bat, bat, bat and bat. I really enjoyed the contest against him. Some days he won, other days I won. It's going to have a bit of a different feel without him. Pujara is a great player.\" He also said that the India vs Australia rivalry is now at par with Ashes. I do think it is. Particularly, after the Indian team won the last couple of series at (our) home. We've had more success against England over the past decade. I think it's right up there,\" he said.\"You know when you play against India, you've got a few Indian fans that are watching. It's a slightly different rivalry to England-Australia rivalry. But again, now having a five-Test match series, it does mirror the Ashes series very closely,\" he said.",

They also urged the Governor to direct the police to trace all the people who took part in the training session.\r\n\r\nThe delegation also urged the governor to seek a detailed report of the desecration of the Muthyalamma temple and take action against the police personnel responsible for ordering lathi charge.

        "text": "In a surprising move, Indonesia's new President Prabowo Subianto has unveiled the country's biggest cabinet to date, with a whopping 109 ministers appointed. The cabinet, dubbed the \u201cRed and White Cabinet\u201d after Indonesia's national colors, dwarfs the 34-member team under predecessor Joko Widodo.\n\nSubianto, who was sworn in as Indonesia's eighth president last week, stated the cabinet's large size was necessary to create a \u201cstrong government\u201d that could unite the diverse nation and represent its many political voices. Analysts noted it allows him to reward the seven-party coalition that backed his election victory in February. Several ministers from Widodo's cabinet were also retained.\n\nA key reason for the cabinet's enormity appears to be Subianto's stated goal of accelerating Indonesia's economic growth to 8% annually through ambitious spending plans. These include salary hikes for civil servants, free school meals for 83 million children, and defense budget increases. To implement such broad programs, a huge team of ministers will be required.\n\nSome familiar faces staying on include respected Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the first person to hold the post under three separate presidencies. Other returnees are the ministers of trade, energy, state firms and interior. Indrawati's stewardship of the economy through various crises has made her a key stabilizing presence.\n\nInterestingly, Subianto had been a political rival of Widodo for years but did not contest his 2019 reelection defeat, even serving as his defense chief later. This paved the way for the unlikely alliance that saw Widodo tacitly endorse Subianto's recent candidacy. With his new giant cabinet, Indonesia's new leader is clearly ambitious in scale \u2013 whether this gamble to leverage broad coalition support pays off remains to be seen.",

Later, they filed a revision application in the Sessions court challenging the Metropolitan court\u2019s summons in the case. However, the Sessions court had declined their plea for an interim stay on trial, after which they approached the Gujarat High Court. According to the University, AAP leaders\u2019 comments targeting the Gujarat University were defamatory and hurt the prestige of the university which has established its name among the public.Earlier, the Gujarat High Court had quashed a 2016 order of the Central Information Commission which directed the Gujarat University to provide information on Modi\u2019s degree to Kejriwal",

With nearly all votes counted, around 50% of Moldovans voted \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether to amend the constitution to state that the nation\u2019s strategic goal is to join the EU.\n\nThis positive outcome puts Moldova on a path towards eventually applying for EU membership, a significant step considering the country\u2019s complex geopolitical situation. Nestled between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova has faced political influence from neighboring Russia for decades. However, the referendum results indicate that many Moldovans now favor deeper links with the West instead.\n\nThe referendum took place alongside a tightly contested presidential election, where pro-EU incumbent Maia Sandu claimed victory in the first round over her main challenger. Sandu had strongly advocated for the \u201cyes\u201d vote, and her continued presidency will help maintain Moldova\u2019s westward direction. However, the referendum passed with only a narrow margin, highlighting the country\u2019s internal divisions on this challenging foreign policy issue.\n\nAllegations of electoral meddling and voter intimidation marred the democratic process. Fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor was accused of trying to \u201cbuy\u201d hundreds of thousands of votes against the referendum through social media propaganda and illicit payments. The close call in favor of integration with the EU suggests Moldova\u2019s path towards the bloc will be long and difficult, requiring ongoing commitment to democratic reforms and weakening of Russian influence.",

Will take decisions in phases to cooperate with the police department and will clear all those bills, said Naidu during his speech as part of the Police Commemoration Day.Noting that investing in the police department is akin to investing in the state, the CM said he always gave importance to and cooperated with it.According to Naidu, the state government has already cleared pending bills worth Rs 100 crore of the department within 125 days of coming to power.Emphasising on the need for providing latest technologies to the police department, Naidu said policemen cannot fight criminals with old fashioned technological tools.Only when we have an upper hand over criminals in terms of surveillance and technology, can we control them, said Naidu, promising to improve and bring advanced technology.He accused the previous YSRCP government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of using the police department as a tool for political harassment.Slamming Reddy, the TDP supremo said the former could not release Rs 700 crore to the police department but allegedly splurged Rs 700 crore on survey stones, which bore the former CM's images.Assuring importance to police welfare, the CM promised to commit at least Rs 20 crore every year and also build a facility at Amaravati to observe the next Police Commemoration Day from there.I pay my tributes to police who died on duty. I assure you that I will always stand by the police who do justice and respect officials, Naidu added.",

The people of Delhi want to know the reason behind this, and I tell them, the real reason is the dirty politics of the BJP. Everyone is aware that stubble burning is a major contributor to rising pollution levels in Delhi during winter. The AAP government in Punjab has significantly reduced stubble burning over the past two years. According to the Centre's statistics, incidents of stubble burning have been halved since the AAP took charge in Punjab. In contrast, if you look at Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, stubble burning has increased,\" she told the media.\n\n\"If the Punjab government can reduce stubble burning, why can't the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana do the same? In Delhi, we have only CNG and electric buses, whereas 100% of the interstate buses coming from UP and Haryana are diesel-powered. Why can't the governments of Haryana and UP introduce electric buses? It's because they want to play dirty politics with the people of Delhi. While Delhi has no brick kilns, there are 3,800 brick kilns in the NCR region, contributing significantly to pollution levels in the capital,\" the Chief Minister added.\n\nOn the water pollution in Yamuna, she said, \"BJP leaders have been visiting Kalindi Kunj for photoshoots, but the real cause of the toxic foam in the Yamuna is industrial waste being dumped into the river by factories in Haryana. The UP government also contributes to the problem by releasing polluted water into the Yamuna.\"\n\nOver the past several winters, Delhiites have gasped for breath as stubble burning in neighbouring states, among other causes, has pushed up air pollution in the capital. With election in the city due in February, air pollution has now emerged as a key talking point.\n\nIn power for 10 years, AAP is pushing hard for a third term. AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, now out on bail after he was arrested in a corruption case linked to Delhi's now-scrapped liquor policy, stepped down as Chief Minister last month and said he would return to the top office only after the \"people's court\" elects him again. Senior party leader Atishi took over the job after Mr Kejriwal's exit.",

He pleaded the Court to issue a notice to Gandhi, compelling him to respond to the allegations.\u201cGandhi is a serial offender,\u201d the counsel contended, referencing past statements made by Gandhi, including comments regarding individuals with the surname Modi.'The petitioner also cited Gandhi's alleged citizenship issues, which are pending before the Delhi High Court, as further evidence of his misconduct.However, the Karnataka HC found no merit in the petition and dismissed it along with a fine.The petitioner's counsel sought waiver of the fine and argued that he should not be penalized for taking rightful action.The PIL highlighted that Gandhi's allegations, made without evidence, misled the public and disrespected the modesty of Indian women, particularly in light of the provisions under the new Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita.The plea argued that Gandhi's statement amounted to hate speech and promoted gender-based hatred. It also sought a directive from the court requiring Gandhi to issue a public apology and called for the National Commission for Women to take appropriate action against him.Despite the petitioner's appeal, the Court concluded that the matter did not warrant further consideration.",

        "text": "\"Have 16 children\" - Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin's eyebrow-raising 'solution' Monday to the possibility the southern state will be allotted fewer Lok Sabha seats - and therefore be less important to any political party looking to form the union government - after the delimitation in 2026, i.e., redrawing of parliamentary constituencies, before the 2029 election, based on revised population levels.\n\nThe DMK leader - presiding over the state-funded Hindu marriage ceremony of 31 couples - said the tradition in his state was for family elders to bless married couples with \"16 kinds of wealth\"; the benediction, translated from Tamil, reads \"Acquire 16 kinds of wealth and lead a prosperous life)\".\n\n\"That blessing does not mean you should have 16 children... but now a situation has arisen where people think they may have to, literally, raise 16 children and not a small and prosperous family.\"\n\nAs an aside (and in a comment seen as another jab at the BJP that is in power at the centre), Mr Stalin called on Tamil couples to give their children \"beautiful Tamil names\".\n\nREAD | \"Imposing Hindi Everywhere\": MK Stalin vs Governor In Anthem Row\n\nThe Chief Minister's comment about Tamil names for Tamil children comes amid yet another state-centre flare-up on the language row; last week Mr Stalin lobbed tough questions at Governor RN Ravi, the centre's rep in the state, for trying to \"impose Hindi everywhere\".\n\nThe Delimitation Row\n\nOver the past several months Tamil Nadu, and the other southern states, have expressed concern over a delimitation exercise that will see the number of seats jump from 543 now to 753.\n\nThe biggest increase will be in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state; the number of Lok Sabha seats will jump from 80 to 126 - a 57.5 per cent spike. Among the southern states, only Karnataka could see a measurable increase - from 28 seats to 36 - in representation in the Lower House.\n\nTamil Nadu's Lok Sabha share will likely only inch up - from 39 to 41, a five per cent increase, and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana may be given only three extra seats each.\n\nNDTV Explains | What India Will Look Like After 2026 Delimitation\n\nAnd Kerala - the state that has best controlled population growth, a critical factor as the country and world battles climate change, unemployment, and resource scarcity - could lose one of its 20 seats.\n\nThe opposition has been fiercely critical about the marked disparity between possible revised Lok Sabha representation for the northern states - a majority of which voted for the BJP in the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections - and for those in the south.\n\nAnd Mr Stalin's government has been among the most vocal in this regard.\n\nTamil Nadu's Anti-Delimitation Move\n\nIn February Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK adopted a resolution against the proposed delimitation, arguing that states that have best controlled population levels ought not to be penalised.\n\nREAD | In Tamil Nadu Assembly, A Challenge To Delimitation Exercise\n\nConversely, the DMK said, states that had failed to do so should not be rewarded.\n\nChandrababu Naidu's Remark\n\nMr Stalin's comment - in jest, yes, but with a definite edge - came shortly after his Andhra Pradesh counterpart, Chandrababu Naidu, also 'advised' people to have more children.\n\nMr Naidu's comment, however, was in the context of an aging state population.\n\nHe warned that a disproportionate number of elderly people could affect the state's finances and offered Japan as an example. \"In many villages, only elderly people remain... as the young have migrated to cities or overseas,\" he said, adding his government would pass laws in this regard.\n\nCentre Says...\n\nThe Narendra Modi government will be considerate of the fact southern states have, on average, controlled population better than the north, sources told NDTV in September last year. Fears southern states will be penalised by their Lok Sabha seats being affected, will be allayed, sources said.\n\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

There were no clues available from the spot and analysis is going on,\u201d they said.\nThe sources added: \u201cThe place is insignificant in terms of being picked as a target for a bomb blast. This is a busy area in terms of car parking and residential locality but the logistics ensured that no damage occurred. What is most surprising is that no bomb blast material is available and neither was any device found. In this case, it becomes a crude bomb.\u201d\nCrude bomb is used in Bengal and other parts of India, sources said, adding that they had never been used in the national capital.\n\u201cThe CCTV footage examination is crucial. There is no clue in CCTVs so far as no one is seen going closer to the spot where the blast took place.\u201d\nOn Monday, Delhi Police said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to the blast. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform.\nThe purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents. The claim was made by Justice League India using a clip of the blast with a \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d watermark at the bottom, and circulated on social media platforms.\nThe blast, which destroyed a portion of the school wall, window panes of nearby shops, and damaged a few cars parked nearby, was captured in a CCTV camera. Police suspect that the bomb might have been placed late at night as local residents said it went off between 7.35 am and 7.40 am.\nThe sound of the blast was heard several hundred metres away. Videos from the spot showed thick plumes rising from the site. Residents called the explosion \u201cintense\u201d and reported a foul smell in the area.\nPolice have filed a case under sections of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on charges of \u201cmischief through explosion\u201d and under the Explosives Act.",

        "text": "The newly elected members of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly were administered oath on Monday (October 21, 2024) by Pro-tem Speaker Mubarak Gul, with Chief Minister Omar Abdullah taking the pledge in the Kashmiri language.\n\nThe Chief Minister won both the Budgam and Ganderbal Assembly constituencies in the recently held elections. He vacated the Budgam seat and retained the Ganderbal constituency, the pro-tem speaker announced in the House on Monday. The Ganderbal seat is considered an Abdullah family stronghold.\n\nThe 54-year-old leader was an MLA from Ganderbal from 2009 to 2014 during his first tenure as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nWith this, the strength of the National Conference in the 95-member House has been reduced to 41 but the party still enjoys a comfortable majority with the support of six Congress MLA, five Independents and one MLA each of the AAP and the CPI(M). The BJP with 29 seats is the second-largest party - its best-ever performance in J&K.\n\nOmar takes pledge in Kashmiri\n\nOmar Abdullah, son of Farooq Abdullah and his British wife Mollie Abdullah, had often faced criticism for not being able to speak his native language.\n\nWhile the third generation politician from the Abdullah family is fluent in English, his fluency in vernaculars like Hindi, Urdu and Kashmiri was poor at the start of his political career in the late 1990s.\n\nHowever, during his first tenure as Chief Minister from 2009 to 2014, Mr. Omar Abdullah took lessons to improve his speaking skills in these three languages. And on Monday, he took the oath as MLA in Kashmiri.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Surinder Kumar Choudhary took oath in English.\n\nThe oath-taking ceremony of the MLAs marks an end to the six-year-long legislative hiatus.\n\nThere are 51 first-time members including BJP MLA from Kishtwar Shagun Parihar, who is the youngest member at 29. The NC veteran and MLA from Chrar-e-Sharief, Abdul Rahim Rather, is the oldest at 80.\n\nMr. Rather and party colleague Ali Mohammad Sagar (MLA Khanyar) have been elected to the Assembly for a record seven terms. While Mr. Sagar has been a member of the Legislative Assembly since 1983, Mr. Rather started his long stint as a legislator in 1977. However, the former finance minister lost the 2014 Assembly elections.",

It is a problem for us and we have been going through it for years now. I have been seeing it for 30 years now. I have told them many times to stop it but their thinking is like that only.\n\u201cHow can there be talks? You kill our innocent people and then you call for talks. First stop the killings,\u201d Abdullah said while commenting on the terror attack at a construction site in Ganderbal district on Sunday.\nThe former chief minister said the attack was a painful incident as it led to killing of poor people who had come here for earning a livelihood.\n\u201cIt is a very painful incident. Poor labourers who come here for a livelihood so that they can feed their families back home. These beasts martyred them. There was one of our doctors with them who serve the people. He also lost his life,\u201d Abdullah said.\nSeven persons\u2013 ? one local doctor and six non-local labourers \u2014 were killed while five others sustained injuries in the attack.\nAbdullah said if the terrorists think they can establish Pakistani writ in Jammu and Kashmir by indulging in such acts, they are mistaken.\n\u201cWhat will these beasts get? Do they think that they will establish Pakistan here? We have been seeing it for many years that they (terrorists) are coming from there. We are trying to settle this problem so that we can come out of our difficulties. I want to tell the rulers of Pakistan that if they really want friendship with India, they should stop this. Kashmir will not become (part of) Pakistan,\u201d the NC president said.\nHe said Pakistan should allow people of Kashmir to live in peace and dignity and focus on their own country's development.\n\u201cPlease let us live with dignity, allow us to develop. For how long will you put us in miseries? You started in 1947 by sending the tribal raiders and killing the innocents. Were you able to make it to Pakistan here? If you did not succeed in 75 years, how will you succeed now? \u201cFor Allah's sake look after your own country and focus on development and leave us at the mercy of our God. We want to remove poverty and unemployment here. It cannot be achieved through terrorism,\u201d he said.\nAbdullah said the impact of the attack will be felt by all people of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\u201cHow will we progress if this (bloodshed) continues? The time has come that they should stop it or later the consequences will be hard,\u201d he added.",

After that, I hope I can not be in politics. That would be my hope. I'm doing this because I think it's critical to the future of the country.

During a speech at the New York Economic Club, Trump outlined his vision, vowing to perform a thorough audit of federal spending to eliminate \"fraud and improper payments.\" He said, \u201cI will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.\u201d In response, Musk expressed enthusiasm for the role on X, saying, \u201cI look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises.

        "text": "Maputo: Police in Mozambique fired tear gas on Monday to disperse a small crowd in Maputo, where shops were closed ahead of a planned protest against alleged electoral fraud. Tensions escalated after attackers killed two Opposition figures\u2014a lawyer and a party official\u2014who were shot while traveling in a car, prompting condemnation from the EU and human rights groups.The new Opposition Podemos party and its presidential candidate, Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, have rejected provisional results that indicate a probable win for the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for half a century. They called for a nationwide strike in response to the results.Mozambique Elections: Police fire tear gas at Mondlane, journalists \u2013 Watch | O Pa\u00eds #Mozambique #Mo\u00e7ambique #Mocambique #MozambiqueElections #News https://t.co/BeZrRxo0NA\u2014 Club of Mozambique (@clubOmozambique) October 21, 2024 \">Also Read: The Mozambican civil society election observer group More Integrity reported that the shooting occurred in the Bairro da Coop neighborhood of Maputo, resulting in the deaths of Podemos lawyer Elvino Dias and party representative Paulo Guambe. Several dozen people, including journalists, scattered as heavily armed police patrolled the area, according to videos posted on social media. Adriano Nuvunga, director of Mozambique\u2019s Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD), described the killings as \u201ca cold-blooded murder,\u201d noting that around 10 to 15 bullets were fired. The EU condemned the violence, demanding an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation. \u201cIn a democracy, there is no place for politically motivated killings,\u201d the EU's diplomatic service stated, adding that its election observers are still assessing the electoral process. As of now, Frelimo leads in all 11 provinces, with Daniel Chapo expected to win the 9 October election, despite external observers raising concerns about the poll's integrity due to reports of vote-buying and intimidation. Full results are due on 24 October, but fears mount that Monday\u2019s protests could turn violent, given the history of police brutality against political dissent. The city of Maputo resembled a ghost town, with shops closed and helicopters hovering above, as the nation awaits official presidential and parliamentary results.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed that secularism has long been regarded as an integral part of the Constitution's basic structure. The top court made the statement orally while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the removal of the terms 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Preamble to the Constitution.\"You don't want India to be secular?\" Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked, while hearing the plea alongside Justice Sanjay Kumar. The Supreme Court bench said that the term 'socialism' should not necessarily be interpreted in the western context and the term can also mean that there has to be an equal opportunity for all. \"There are a number of judgments of this court which hold that Secularism was always part of the basic structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and word fraternity used in the Constitution as well as the rights under Part III, there is a clear indication that secular has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,\" Live Law quoted Justice Khanna as saying. Khanna also pointed out that, unlike the French model of secularism, India adopted a new model of secularism.The plea, filed by senior BJP leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy and one Balram Singh, challenged the 42nd amendment to the Indian Constitution that was made by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi-led government during the Emergency.Responding to the top court judge, Advocate Jain said, \"We are not saying that India is not secular, we are challenging the amendment\". Jain further argued that Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar had opined that the inclusion of the word 'socialism' would curtail personal liberty.In response, Justice Khanna said, \"Socialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of country should be distributed equally. Let's not take the Western meaning\".It was also argued by the petitioner that the Preamble of the Constitution, as it stood on November 26, 1949, was a definitive declaration, contending that any subsequent amendment adding words such as 'socialist\" and 'secular' was arbitrary, according to Live Law.To this, Justice Khanna highlighted that the words introduced by the 1976 amendment were clearly indicated by brackets, making it evident that they were additions. Khanna also pointed out that terms such as 'unity' and 'integrity' of the nation were also incorporated through this amendment.The bench then agreed to examine the issue in detail and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Oct 21, 2024ALSO READ | Supreme Court dismisses Arvind Kejriwal's plea in case over remark on PM's degreeALSO READ | Supreme Court junks plea to replace 'Hindutva' with 'Indian constitutionalism",

        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 21 (KNN) In a significant shift in trade policy, India has temporarily halted negotiations on new free trade agreements (FTAs) as it reassesses its approach to international trade pacts.\n\nThis decision comes as part of a broader strategy to ensure more carefully structured agreements that better serve the country's economic interests.\n\nThe Indian government's move is aimed at addressing several key concerns that have emerged fr0m its existing trade partnerships.\n\nThese include preventing unintended concessions, curbing the influx of third-country goods (particularly fr0m China) through partner nations, enhancing market access for domestic industries, resisting stringent sustainability clauses, and striking a more equitable balance in trade terms.\n\nWhile discussions on FTAs at early stages, such as those with Peru and Chile, have been suspended pending high-level approval, negotiations with major partners like the United Kingdom and the European Union, which are at advanced stages, continue uninterrupted.\n\nThis selective approach underscores India's commitment to maintaining progress on strategically important trade relationships while revaluating others.\n\nRecent data analysis by the Global Trade Research Initiative highlights the impetus behind India's cautious stance. Over the past five years, imports fr0m FTA partners increased by 37.9 per cent to USD 187.92 billion, significantly outpacing export growth, which rose by 14.48 per cent to USD 122.72 billion.\n\nThis trade imbalance has been particularly pronounced with ASEAN countries, the UAE, Japan, and nations within the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).\n\nThe revised strategy draws on lessons fr0m past agreements, such as the challenges encountered with gold, silver, platinum, and date imports under the India-UAE FTA.\n\nBy adopting a more meticulous approach to concessions, India aims to mitigate potential risks and unforeseen consequences in future trade deals.\n\nA key focus of the new policy is to address the issue of third-country products, especially those originating fr0m China, entering India through FTA partner countries at preferential rates.\n\nThis practice, observed notably with Indonesian and Vietnamese imports under the India-ASEAN FTA, has prompted calls for more robust rules of origin to close existing loopholes.\n\nAdditionally, India is taking a firmer stance against non-tariff barriers proposed by developed nations, particularly those related to sustainability, labour standards, and environmental regulations.\n\nThe country is also advocating for a more balanced approach in negotiations with smaller nations to ensure proportionate gains.\n\nTo refine its FTA strategy and develop standard operating procedures for trade negotiations, the Commerce Department organised a strategic planning session in May.\n\nThis event brought together officials and trade experts, including former negotiators, to brainstorm and shape India's future approach to international trade agreements.",

        "text": "In Madhya Pradesh, a significant debate has emerged regarding the use of loudspeakers in temples, ignited by a recent social media post from IAS officer Shailbala Martin. The 2009-batch officer, currently serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department, raised pertinent questions that garnered widespread attention.\nWho Is Shailbala Martin?\nShailbala Martin, originally from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, was born on April 9, 1965. According to the state government website, she began her career in the State Civil Service (SCS) before being promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) on June 12, 2017. With a BA and an MA in Arts from Holkar Science College in Indore, Martin joined the State Civil Service in 2009.\nThroughout her career, Martin has held various positions, including roles in the Health Department in 2014, Municipal Commissioner of Burhanpur in 2019, and Collector of Niwari district the same year. Since January 25, 2022, she has been serving as Additional Secretary in the General Administration Department.\nThe Loudspeaker Controversy\nThe recent controversy can be traced back to guidelines issued by the state government last year to mitigate noise pollution, which specifically aimed to regulate loudspeakers in religious venues. A journalist on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) questioned the disparity in enforcement, focusing on the use of loudspeakers in mosques and the prevalence of DJs playing music outside these spaces.\nIn response, Martin highlighted the noise pollution caused by loudspeakers in temples, questioning why such disturbances, which can be heard several streets away and continue late into the night, are often overlooked. Her tweet sparked a mix of reactions, with some users supporting her stance while others criticised her for raising the issue.",

        "text": "Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra on Monday (October 21, 2024) ruled out the possibility of an alliance with any regional party for the upcoming bypolls to seven assembly seats.\n\nTalking to reporters after a meeting of the Congress Coordination Committee, Mr. Dotasra said the State unit has made panels of probable candidates for the seven seats and the final announcement will be made by the party's high command in Delhi.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha election held this year, the Congress entered into an alliance with the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) for the Nagaur seat and with the CPI(M) for the Sikar seat.\n\nRLP convener Hanuman Beniwal, who had won the Khinvsar assembly seat in Nagaur district in last year's assembly election, emerged victorious from the Nagaur parliamentary constituency this year. As a result, the Khinsvar assembly seat fell vacant.\n\nThere was speculation about a Congress-RLP alliance for the bypoll to the Khinvsar seat but Mr. Dotasra said the Congress' State unit was not looking for a tie-up.\n\nHe said the Congress' Rajasthan in-charge Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa would take the panels for all seven seats to Delhi and candidates would be declared after a discussion with the high command.\n\nDungarpur's Chorasi assembly seat fell vacant after Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) MLA Rajkumar Roat won the Lok Sabha election from the Banswara-Dungarpur district.\n\nThe Congress did not announce any alliance with the BAP in the general election but asked its candidate to withdraw their nominations from the Banswara-Dungarpur constituency. The move was aimed at supporting the BAP.\n\n\"There are no talks of alliance with any party in the assembly bypolls in Rajasthan. We have prepared panels for all seven seats in the meeting today,\" Mr. Dotasra said.\n\nHe also exuded confidence that the party would win all seven assembly seats.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Assembly Tikaram Jully, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, former assembly Speaker CP Joshi and other party leaders attended the meeting chaired by Randhawa.\n\nVoting on seven assembly seats -- Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Deoli-Uniara, Khinvsar, Chorasi, Salumbar and Ramgarh -- will be held on November 13 and the results will be declared on November 23.\n\nBypolls on two seats are being held due to the death of the MLAs -- Congress's Zubair Khan from Ramgarh and BJP's Amritlal Meena from Salumbar.\n\nIn the other five constituencies, the MLAs were elected as MPs, necessitating the bypolls.\n\nCongress MLAs Brijendra Ola (Jhunjhunu), Harish Chandra Meena (Deoli-Uniara) and Murari Lal Meena (Dasau) were elected as MPs in the Lok Sabha election. The other two are Beniwal and Roat.\n\nFour of the seven seats where bypolls will be held were with the Congress, while the BJP, BAP and the RLP held one each.\n\nThe BJP has declared candidates for all seats except Chorasi.\n\nThe BAP has already declared its candidate for the Chorasi seat.\n\nCurrently, the 200-seat state assembly has 114 MLAs of the BJP, 65 of the Congress, three of the BAP, two of the BSP, one of the Rashtriya Lok Dal and eight Independents.",

It's mind-boggling - you are one nation but you are speaking different languages and even the written languages are different. The first thing he (PM Modi) did was unify the tax system. This is an incredible accomplishment. This is something that probably would have taken a century.\"The investor said India's diversity results in incredible creativity and the future belongs to those who are creative.\"I definitely think India is going to become a leader or the leader in semiconductor production in the future. One reason I say that is the demand - you have got a market here that is one of the biggest in the world. Secondly, it is a relatively open economy, so you are going to be able to take technology from Taiwan, China, the United States, wherever. Thirdly, you have got an incredible software industry already, you are the largest exporter of software in the world,\" Mr Mobius said, adding that many large semiconductor companies already have software bases in India.The investor said semiconductor fabrication will happen in India because the country has the labour force. \"I remember I was meeting an Indian friend of mine a few years ago and I said India will become a big semiconductor manufacturer. He said Indians are not as patient and not so good with small things like the Chinese are and I asked him if he had seen the places where they are polishing these tiny diamonds in India. They will do a very good job here, no questions about it. But it will require a huge amount of capital,\" he added.In terms of return on capital, it's \"India, China and the US\", Mr Mobius said, adding that India still presents plenty of opportunities despite stock prices climbing.

        "text": "Jammu, Oct 21: Dressed in her finery, she waited for the phone to ring so she could break the Karwa Chauth fast she had kept for his long life. What came instead was the pronouncement of his death \u2013 Shashi Abrol had been killed in a terror attack in Kashmir's Ganderbal district.\n\nNews of his death came late on Sunday night, long after the moon had risen, the sight millions of Hindu women look out for to break their daylong fast on the day. Fate could not have dealt Ruchi Abrol a crueller blow.\nShashi Abrol, an architectural designer, was among the seven people killed when terrorists attacked a tunnel construction site on the Srinagar-Leh national highway on Sunday.\nThe attack took place when the team had returned from work to their camp late in the evening. The morning after, his wife held on to their three-year-old daughter, angry, anguished and bewildered at the same time. The couple also has a son studying engineering.\n\u201cI spoke to him in the evening. He didn't mention any threats. I was going to the temple as part of my Karwa Chauth fast, and we had a brief conversation. I tried calling him after I returned but he didn't pick up. After that, his phone was switched off,\u201d a sobbing Ruchi told PTI.\n\u201cI waited for his call but had no idea about the attack,\u201d she added at her home in Jammu's Talab Tillo area, her mother-in-law by her side.\nNo one told them what had happened until late at night. And then too, it came through the media, the family said.\nRuchi was refusing to break her fast, said her sister-in-law Divya.\n\u201cHer life is shattered. The festival of Karwa Chauth has turned into a day of catastrophe for us. Our dear Shashi Ji was killed in a cowardly act by terrorists,\u201d she said.\nAnxiety mounted as the hours passed by.\nRuchi had completed her rituals and was waiting for a video call from her husband, everyone unaware of the magnitude of the tragedy that had befallen them.\n\u201cWe tried to comfort Ruchi as we grew worried when his phone switched off late at night. We only learned about his death through the media, which shocked us all,\u201d Divya said.\nShashi was the family's sole breadwinner.\n\u201cWhat have they gained from this? How will she feed her children now?

        "text": "Russia has never done anything to impact India's interests negatively, and there is an economic and strategic logic behind New Delhi maintaining strong ties with Moscow, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said at the NDTV World Summit today.During an interaction with NDTV Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia, the veteran diplomat was asked how India-Russia ties would develop in the coming years.\"The Prime Minister is going to Russia tomorrow, so this is a timely question. If you look at our history with Russia after Independence, Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively. Among the major countries, there are not many about who we can say this. Today Russia's situation is different, I think Russia's relationship with the West has broken down, so you have a Russia which is turning much more towards Asia. Should Russia not have multiple options in Asia? Should we not take what is good for us in national interests?\"\"And clearly, Russia as a major natural resources power has a complementarity with India at this stage of development where we are big resource consumers. It isn't just Russian oil, it could be fertilisers, metals, coal. There is a whole economic logic to it. There is also a basic strategic logic, if you look at the Eurasian landmass, there are three big countries. You always keep a balance, a relationship,\" the minister said.New Delhi's ties with Moscow have been a key geopolitical talking point over the past few years, especially after the Ukraine War began. With the West siding with Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia, India's decision to buy Russian oil had come under scrutiny.India has consistently refused to take sides in the conflict and said it is on the side of peace. This was also reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Earlier, articulating the Indian position over the decision to procure Russian oil, Dr Jaishankar had said New Delhi has a right to prioritise the interests of its people.\"I understand that there is a conflict situation (in Ukraine). I also understand that Europe has a point of view and Europe will make the choices it will make that is Europe's right. But for Europe to make choices which prioritises its energy needs and then ask India to do something else..,\" he had said.",

So far, six doctors on hunger strike had been hospitalised due to deteriorating health, while eight others remained on indefinite fast.\n\nBanerjee spoke with the protesting doctors over the phone on Saturday, urging them to end their fast, asserting that most of their demands had been met.

He highlights that a State task force was promised for the fulfilment of infrastructural demands. \u201cYou had earlier said that 5-7 junior doctors should be part of the State Task Force, but we had suggested more representatives be present from WBJDF on a rotational basis.
