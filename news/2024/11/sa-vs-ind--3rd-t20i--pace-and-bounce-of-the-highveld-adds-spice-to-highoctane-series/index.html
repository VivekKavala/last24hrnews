                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Big picture - both teams have issues to addressThis series is a bit of an oddity, with two sides at below full strength, with a number of big names rested for more pressing engagements, facing off in a format that's taken a bit of a back seat in terms of wider relevance, with no immediate world event to build towards.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> It's also an oddity in that it's four matches long, rather than three or five.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>For all that, it's been extremely competitive, and at 1-1 could be shaping up for a blockbuster second half.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> After sharing honours on the coast, South Africa and India now move to the pace, true bounce and high altitude of the Highveld with all to play for.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Given that both sides are testing out young players and new combinations, neither team will read too much into how individuals have fared so far.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> But there are broad, team-level issues they may want to look into.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>South Africa have faced 16 overs from India's two wristspinners, and scored 91 while losing 12 wickets.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The format is different, but Ravi Bishnoi and, in particular, Varun Chakravarthy seem to be exerting the same sort of influence that Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal did on the ODI leg of India's tour of this country in 2017-18, when they shared 35 wickets in five games.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>India's issue is structural, and one that's cropped up from time to time over recent years: their batting in the first two T20Is seemed to stop at No.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> 7.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> They only scored 40 runs in the last six overs of the first match, and failed to turn Sanju Samson's storming century into a truly awe-inspiring total.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> In the second, they lost early wickets, and never recovered thanks in part to this lack of depth.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>How the two teams sort out or work around these issues could well determine how this series finishes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Form guideSouth Africa WLLWL (last five completed T20Is, most recent first)India LWWWWIn the spotlight - David Miller and Abhishek SharmaIn this series so far, David Miller has been out twice to Varun - the second off a peach that turned past his outside edge and bowled him for a golden duck - in 13 balls, while scoring 14 runs off them.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Miller prides himself on his spin game, which he has transformed over the last three years, and will undoubtedly be working extra-hard on picking Varun's variations and getting on top of him.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>He announced himself with an audacious 47-ball 100 against Zimbabwe in only his second appearance, but his eight other T20I innings have brought Abhishek Sharma only 70 runs, with only two of them going past the ten-ball mark.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Abhishek's no-holds-barred approach, which is exactly what earned him his international call-up, comes with the in-built risk of early failure, and getting the best out of him will require India's team management to ensure they judge him on processes and not outcomes, helping him become a more rounded player while backing his attacking instincts.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'>Lutho Sipamla has been brought in for the last two T20Is, and he has form behind him•Getty ImagesTeam newsLutho Sipamla has joined South Africa's squad for the third and fourth T20Is, and the fast bowler comes into the series with form behind him.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If South Africa bring him into their XI, either Andile Simelane or the legspinner Nqaba Peter may have to make way.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Three players in their squad are still awaiting their first T20I caps: fast bowlers Vijaykumar Vyshak and Yash Dayal and the explosive lower-middle-order hitter Ramandeep Singh.</p>

 Varun already has eight wickets in this series, and has a great chance, with two matches remaining, of going past the Indian record of most wickets in a bilateral T20I series of nine, held jointly by R Ashwin and Bishnoi.</p>
