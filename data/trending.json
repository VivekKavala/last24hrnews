        "text": "A Class 12 student jumped to death from Jam Gate, a historical site in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Khargone, after the authorities of his school objected to his use of a mobile phone and attempts to click selfies on its premises, police said.\nThe 17-year-old tribal student, Raj Osari, who studied in a government higher secondary school at Gulwad in Mandleshwar area and stayed in a government-run hostel, ended his life before Thursday noon despite attempts by his relatives and a guard to dissuade him from taking the extreme step, a police official said.\n\u201cRaj jumped from the Jam Gate and was then found in a ditch. While he was trying to jump, his relatives and the security guard posted at the site asked him not to do so, but he did not listen to them and took the extreme step,\u201d Khargone district Superintendent of Police Dharamraj Meena said.\nHe was rushed to a government hospital in Mandleshwar where doctors declared him dead, the official said, adding that he was a resident of Kakad Khodri village in Mandleshwar area.\nThe deceased\u2019s uncle Jitendra Osari told the police in a statement that hostel superintendent Prakash Girwal had called him to complain about Raj using mobile phones at the school, the police official said.\n\u201cSchool principal K C Saand had also objected to Raj taking selfies at the school on Wednesday. But he threatened to commit suicide or run away from the school,\u201d he said, the principal then asked the hostel superintendent to call Raj\u2019s family members and sort out the matter.\nBut when his relatives, Krishna and his son Ganesh, came to meet him at the school, Raj ran away. They all went looking for him, but could not find him. Raj came to the school later and the hostel superintendent immediately informed his relatives. They again reached the hostel at 9.30 pm, but Raj escaped by scaling the boundary wall of the hostel, the official said.\n\u201cHe came to the school again late at night and ran away from the hostel after having breakfast on Thursday morning. The principal asked the staff to catch him but they were unable to do so,\u201d he said.\nHis mobile phone has also been recovered from the spot. On the basis of the investigation conducted so far, there is a possibility that he has taken this step due to fear of being scolded by his family members, the SP added.\nThe police are probing the case thoroughly as there could be some other motive as well behind the incident, he said.\nDISCLAIMER: If you or someone you know needs help, call any of these helplines: Aasra (Mumbai) 022-27546669, Sneha (Chennai) 044-24640050, Sumaitri (Delhi) 011-23389090, Cooj (Goa) 0832- 2252525, Jeevan (Jamshedpur) 065-76453841, Pratheeksha (Kochi) 048-42448830, Maithri (Kochi) 0484-2540530, Roshni (Hyderabad) 040-66202000, Lifeline 033-64643267 (Kolkata)",

        "text": "Billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s estranged transgender daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, announced that she would leave the United States (US) citing that she doesn\u2019t see a future in the country following Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2024 Presidential elections.\nIn a post on Threads, Wilson said, \u201cI\u2019ve thought this for a while, but yesterday confirmed it for me. I don\u2019t see my future being in the United States.\u201d\nShe cited concerns over anti-trans regulations and the unwavering support for Trump among voters.\n\u201cEven if he\u2019s only in office for 4 years, even if the anti-trans regulations magically don\u2019t happen, the people who willingly voted this in are not going anywhere anytime soon,\u201d she added.\n\nView on Threads\n\nAfter her post, the Tesla CEO weighed in saying, \u201cThe woke mind killed my son,\u201d in a post on X. Wilson responded her father\u2019s reaction with sharp criticism. She took to Threads with a scathing message, \u201cSo, you\u2019re still going with the sob-story about how \u201cwoe is me, my child was infected by something-or-other and that\u2019s totally the only reason why they hate me. Just don\u2019t\u2026 please don\u2019t look into it, god forbid I\u2019m anything but the victim in every scenario imaginable.\u201d\n\nThe woke mind virus killed my son\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 7, 2024\n\n\u201cDid anyone ever actually believe this? It\u2019s just tired, it\u2019s overdone. I\u2019m just bored honestly, like is this really the best you could come up with?\u201d she added.\nShe further suggested that Musk\u2019s frustration may stem from his lack of control over her decision to leave. She said, \u201cIf I\u2019m correct, the reason why this particular post is the one that got to you is that you\u2019re mad that you finally don\u2019t have power over someone.\u201d\nWilson recognises herself as a transgender and has been estranged from her billionaire father since 2022 after she filed a petition to legally change her name and gender, seeking to distance herself from Musk.\nIn interviews, Musk expressed deep pain over the rift, describing it as worse than the death of his firstborn son, Nevada. He also accused Wilson of adopting extreme ideologies, saying, \u201cShe went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil.\u201d\nThe SpaceX CEO during an interview had said, \u201cI lost my son, essentially.\u2026 My son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus \u2026 so I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Wilson had described Musk as a cold and narcissistic father, claiming he was an absent parent who did not support her transition. She claimed that the billionaire harassed her as a young child over her effeminate traits.",

The Global NCAP tests evaluate frontal and side impacts, as well as the vehicle\u2019s stability and pedestrian safety.\nDavid Ward, Executive President of the Towards Zero Foundation, praised the new Dzire, stating, \u201cThe new Dzire\u2019s five star rating sets a significant safety benchmark for Maruti Suzuki compared to the previous version of this model and others from Maruti we have tested. Global NCAP warmly welcomes this milestone voluntary test result.\u201d\nThe new Dzire, voluntarily submitted by Maruti Suzuki for testing, scored high in stability, with a solid structure and footwell area that can handle further impact. The frontal crash test showed marginal protection for the driver\u2019s chest, but side and pole impact tests demonstrated excellent protection for adult occupants.\nFor child safety, the 18-month-old dummy received full protection, and the 3-year-old dummy showed good head and chest protection, though neck safety could be improved with a rearward-facing child restraint system (CRS).\nWith its standard six airbags, ESC, and pedestrian safety features, the Dzire sets a new standard for safety in its segment, paving the way for safer cars for Indian consumers.",

The actress and her cricketer husband recently went out to a restaurant in Mumbai and posed with the staff. The fan-favourite couple enjoyed a dosa date and Virat held Anushka close as they posed with the restaurant\u2019s staff.\nAnushka Sharma and Virat Kohli were seen dressed in chic casuals. They smiled as they posed with the staff. Virat held closely to his actress wife in the viral photo. They also signed a cap for the restaurant. Have a look at the photos here:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Benne (@benne.bombay)\n\nOn Thursday, Anushka Sharma hinted that she\u2019s in Mumbai after she posted a photo of Juhu Beach on her Instagram Story to greet her followers on Chhath Puja. Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have been living in London since the actress was pregnant with their son, Akaay. It was reported that Akaay was born in London. Even after Akaay\u2019s birth, Anushka is rarely seen in India. This led to buzz that Anushka and Virat are slowly moving to London permanently.\nAnushka Sharma\u2019s absence from Bollywood events and films also has led to this speculation. Last year, the actress said that she didn\u2019t want to do too many films anymore and spend time with her family instead. Virat Kohli has often expressed that he loves spending time with his family in London where they are not recognised. \u201cWe were not in the country. Just to feel normal for two months \u2013 for me, my family \u2013 it was a surreal experience. Couldn\u2019t have been more grateful to God for the opportunity to spend time with the family. It\u2019s an amazing experience to just be another person on the road and not be recognised,\u201d Virat Kohli said in March this year.\nAs per a Hindustan Times report, Anushka and Virat are also directors of a UK-based company. The report mentions that as per the UK government\u2019s Find and Update company information service, the couple are two of the three directors of Magik Lamp. It is a management consultancy incorporated on August 1, 2022. The company\u2019s official office address is in West Yorkshire, UK.",

He was on a fishing trip when his flip-flops tangled in a rope while boarding a boat and fell into the Moyle River. Botham\u2019s old friend and on-field rival, former Australia pacer Merve Huges, came to his rescue.\nBotham, who was pulled out of the water by Huges, suffered bruises along his torso. Most importantly, the England legend narrowly survived after falling into a river which is also home to bull sharks that feed on the scraps left behind by crocodiles.\nAccording to The Guardian, Botham and Huges were crossing a stretch of water to join other members of the expedition when the former English cricketer fell in the water. Revealing his story, Botham called himself the English version of Crocodile Dundee.\n\u201cAt the end of the day Crocodile Beefy survived,\u201d Botham was quoted as saying by the Guardian.\n\u201cI was out of the water quicker than I went in it. Quite a few sets of eyes were having a peep at me. Luckily I had no time to think about what was in the water.\u201d\n\u201cThe guys were brilliant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just one of those accidents.

We chose to honor the positive aspects of the previous owner\u2019s life, his immense talent, and all the joy he brought to so many people. The decision to purchase the home had nothing to do with the previous owner, just our love of the home,\u201d a part of her post read.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Anita Lallian (@anitavermalallian)\n\nAfter Perry, let\u2019s get to know more about the owner of the luxurious property, which was originally purchased in 2020. \nWho Is Anita-Verma Lallian?\nAs per a Forbes report, Anita Lallian is the founder of Camelback Productions, which mainly represents South Asians in films. She is also a well-known real estate consultant in Arizona, where she has invested most of her career in helping investors find their ideal space, only to build a portfolio worth over $1 billion. \nShe began her consulting firm, Arizona Land Consulting, in 2020 after leaving her family business. \u201cWe have been instrumental in large businesses coming to Arizona and the development of Phoenix, focusing on attracting companies that will positively affect the landscape,\u201d she told Canvas Rebel, as quoted by the South China Morning Post. \nOn her personal front, Anita\u2019s parents immigrated from India to the US and created Vermaland, a land banking company in Arizona.

        "text": "A couple was forced to solemnise their wedding over a video call after the groom\u2019s boss did not approve his leave for the ceremony. The groom, based in Turkey, and the bride, residing in Himachal Pradesh, said \u201cQubool Hai\u201d through a video call. \nAdnan Muhammad, who is a native of Bilaspur, had originally planned to travel to India for his wedding. However, his Turkish boss denied his leave request, complicating the situation. Adding to the urgency was the bride\u2019s ailing grandfather\u2019s heartfelt wish to witness his granddaughter\u2019s marriage. This prompted the couple and their families to seek alternative solutions, ultimately agreeing to hold the wedding ceremony via video call.\nRead| \u2018We Are Disappointed\u2019: Manali Woman\u2019s Rant About Tourists From Delhi, Punjab And Haryana Goes Viral\nThe groom\u2019s family travelled with the baraat from Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh to Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. Under the guidance of a qazi, the marriage rituals were performed via video call, as per a report by PTI. \nThis, however, is not the first instance of a couple marrying over a video call. In July 2023, another couple in Himachal Pradesh exchanged vows online after flash floods, incessant rainfall, and landslides brought life in the mountainous region to a standstill. Ashish Singha and Shivani Thakur had planned for the groom to bring the baraat from Kotgarh, a village in Shimla, to Bhuntar, the bride\u2019s hometown in Kullu. However, the harsh weather conditions forced the families to have them marry over a video call.\nAlso Read| Himachal Pradesh: Teacher Booked for Sexually Harassing Teen Schoolgirl\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world came to a standstill, numerous weddings were conducted over video calls. One such example was a couple in Kerala, Vignesh KM and Anjali Ranjith, who exchanged vows via Zoom. They created an e-invitation featuring a Zoom ID and password, enabling guests to join the virtual celebration. The ceremony took place at the groom\u2019s residence, with Vignesh\u2019s roommates assisting in performing the wedding rituals. The groom\u2019s parents sent the mangalsutra and wedding attire through speed post.",

        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan starrer The Buckingham Murders has finally been released on the digital platform. The actress has recently announced that the mystery thriller is releasing on November 8, i.e. today. But looks like netizens are facing some issues in watching the film online. A fan has shared his disappointment with the X handle. He called the Hindi dubbing bad. Hansal Mehta also reacted and apologised.\nThe fan wrote, \u201cI started watching #TheBukinghamMurders but the hindi dubbing is so bad. I couldn\u2019t go beyond a few mins. Dear @mehtahansal was the movie shot in English? Why isn\u2019t @NetflixIndia showing us the original version? Watching all the Brits speak in Hindi makes it sound so artificial.\u201d Immediately Hansal Mehta replied, \u201cDue to a technical error on the service @NetflixIndia will be uploading the original language version in a few hours. Thank you for your patience. And yes it can be quite irritating to watch a dubbed version of the film. Apologies.\u201d\nTake a look here:\n\nDue to a technical error on the service @NetflixIndia will be uploading the original language version in a few hours. Thank you for your patience.

Apologies. https://t.co/bX6nkhIHf9 pic.twitter.com/HX2enRWksY\n\u2014 Hansal Mehta (@mehtahansal) November 8, 2024\n\nTaking to her Instagram handle, Kareena shared the poster and wrote, \u201cHere\u2019s a tip-off: The Buckingham Murders is coming to Netflix on 8 November.\u201d Released exclusively in cinemas on September 13, 2024, the film boasts a stellar cast, including Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ash Tandon, Ranveer Brar, and Keith Allen. Directed by Hansal Mehta and written by Aseem Arrora, Kashyap Kapoor, and Raghav Raj Kakker, The Buckingham Murders is produced by Mahana Films and TBM Films, presented by Balaji Telefilms. The production is helmed by Shobha Kapoor, Ektaa R Kapoor, and marks Kareena Kapoor Khan\u2019s debut as a producer.\nNews18 gave the film 4 out of 5 stars for its powerful performances, intention and brilliant cinematography. Our review read, \u201cThe Buckingham Murders is a slow-burn police procedural, mounted on the able shoulders of Kareena Kapoor Khan. It is a two-hour testament to Kareena\u2019s brilliance as an actor. Mehta brings out the best in her. The actress, who once called herself \u2018the most commercial heroine\u2019, impresses with her unglamorous, nuanced expression of unresolved grief and devastation. Her silent desolation and subtle ways of rebellion become the film\u2019s driving force.\u201d",
