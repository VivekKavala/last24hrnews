                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The main sign of this disease is an increase in blood sugar (glucose) levels above normal values.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition occurs when the sufferer’s body is no longer able to take sugar (glucose) into the cells and use it as energy.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This condition ultimately results in the accumulation of extra sugar in the body’s bloodstream.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Uncontrolled diabetes can have serious consequences, causing damage to various organs and tissues of the body.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> For example, organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> There are two main types of diabetes, namely type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> If explained, here is an explanation of both, namely: Type 1 diabetes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This type is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body’s immune system will attack itself.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Increased frequency of urination.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Geographical factors, people who live in areas far from the equator, such as Finland and Sardinia, are at risk of developing type 1 diabetes.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> This is due to the lack of vitamin D that can be obtained from sunlight, which ultimately triggers autoimmune diseases.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Other triggering factors include consuming cow’s milk at too early an age, water containing sodium nitrate, cereals, and gluten before the age of 4 months or after 7 months, having a mother with a history of preeclampsia, and suffering from jaundice at birth.</p>
