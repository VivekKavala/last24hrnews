        "text": "West Indies batter Nicholas Pooran, Indian stars Mayank Yadav and Ravi Bishnoi and uncapped pair of Mohsin Khan and Ayush Badoni are likely to be retained by Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.With batter KL Rahul, who has captained the side since its inception in 2022, is unlikely to be retained, barring any last-minute change of mind from both parties, LSG will have one right-to-match (RTM) card at the auction, as per ESPNCricinfo. The exact amount of money for which these five stars have been signed for is not known yet, but based on retention slabs of the IPL, Rs 51 crores will be deducted from LSG\u2019s purse. In case the sum paid exceeds that, then a higher amount will be deducted from Rs 120 crore purse of each franchise that they have been given to build their squads. It is understood the top retention will be Pooran, followed by Mayank and Bishnoi. In the 2024 IPL, with 499 runs in 14 matches and three fifties, the left-hander was only behind KL (520 runs in 14 matches with four fifties) in run-scoring charts and has dominated T20 cricket this year, with 2,251 runs in 68 matches with a century and 15 fifties at a strike rate of 160.90. He was also the interim captain and wicketkeeper during the first half when KL missed out due to injury. Pooran is considered as one of the best hitters in the game and the 29-year-old was brought by LSG in the 2023 season for Rs 16 crore. Mayank picked up two Player of the Match awards in his first IPL, which was an injury-cut affair. He still impressed with seven wickets in four matches, clocking 150 kmph consistently. His performances saw him being handed over a fast bowling contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and made his international debut against Bangladesh recently. He was brought by LSG for Rs 20 lakhs in the 2024 season. Bishnoi was one of three players picked by LSG ahead of IPL 2022 for Rs 4 crores as an uncapped player. After LSG made it to the playoffs that season, in which he took 13 wickets at an average of 13.44, he was given his international debut that year and has been impressive In the last season though, he could pick up 10 wickets in 14 matches at 8.77, as compared to 16 wickets in 2023. Badoni and Mohsin, two uncapped youngsters were brought for Rs 20 lakh each in 2022 auction and have been crucial to the franchise\u2019s success. Badoni is an aggressive middle-order batter and his best season came in 2023, scoring 238 runs in 12 innings at a strike rate of 138. He has played some crucial knocks for the franchise in pressure situations. He also recently played for India A in Emerging Team\u2019s Asia Cup. Mohsin is a tall, 6\u20193\" left-arm fast bowler from Uttar Pradesh, impressed in his maiden season back in 2022, taking 14 scalps at an economy of below six in just nine matches. After an injury, he was not considered for next season initially after he almost lost his arm, but bounced back by taking 10 wickets in 10 matches during 2023 IPL. (ANI)",

        "text": "Certain areas of the national capital witnessed a layer of smog engulfing the area as the air quality remained in the \u2018Very Poor\u2019 category on Monday. Delhi\u2019s Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 328, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). This is only slightly better than Sunday\u2019s average AQI recorded at 356. According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI at Anand Vihar area was recorded at 357 at 7 AM, in the \u2018very poor\u2019 category, dropping down from 405, from the \u2018severe\u2019 category recorded on Sunday. AQI around the Akshardham temple was recorded at 357, being worse than yesterday\u2019s AQI of 261 at 7 am.SAFAR has predicted that despite the ban on firecrackers till January 1 in Delhi, the additional emissions from the use of firecrackers and stubble burning, air quality in the capital is likely to remain in the \u2018Very Poor\u2019 category for the coming week. \u201cThe meteorological conditions are unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants,\u201d read a notice by SAFAR.One of the students in Delhi, Vansh Aggarwal urged the government to use \u201cnew techniques and innovation\u201d to control the pollution in the capital city. \u201cThere are many reasons for the increase in pollution including vehicle and industrial pollution. Even though it is said that it is increasing due to Diwali, but there are a lot of reasons for it, it would be wrong to attribute it to just Diwali. There should be a proper system to tackle the issue of pollution. There are a lot of engineering colleges here, some way we should use new techniques and innovation, the government should control it and take some steps instead of politicising it,\u201d he told ANI.He further compared the air quality between greater Noida and Delhi, saying that he feels it is worse in the national capital. \u201cNow as a student I travel, so if I compare to greater Noida and Delhi, I think the air quality here is worse,\u201d he added.Another person, Sukhram said that he has had trouble breathing and been sick due to pollution for the past few days, which is forcing him to return to his village. \u201cThere is a lot of pollution here in Delhi, for the last 7 days I have been sick. I am returning to my village in Meerut (Uttar Pradesh), I came to Delhi to celebrate Diwali with my children who live here in Trilokpuri. I could not sleep properly due to pollution and was also facing difficulty in breathing, and there is a lot of heat too, so I am going home now,\u201d he told ANI.Notably, the floating toxic foam on the Yamuna River in the Kalindi Kunj area persisted, as the water pollution remained high. The pollution in the river has become a widely debated between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva was hospitalised on Saturday morning after taking a dip in the Yamuna river to protest against the \u201ccorruption\u201d of the Delhi government, which he said deprived the city of the funds meant for the cleaning of the river.Delhi environment minister and AAP leader Gopal Rai criticised the BJP earlier, accusing it of contributing to the increasing pollution in the national capital.\u201cThe BJP is the party that creates pollution and seems to believe that only drama can solve it. I think all governments and parties need to work together. I wish them good health, but stopping these theatrics alone won\u2019t reduce pollution. This reflects the BJP leaders\u2019 level of understanding. When I was preparing the winter action plan, I had written to the BJP President, but no response or suggestions have come so far,\u201d he told ANI on October 26",

        "text": "Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and NCP chief Ajit Pawar on Monday filed his nomination papers from the Baramati assembly seat. Earlier in the day, exuding confidence, Ajit Pawar said, \u201cEveryone has the right to contest. Whenever any candidate is fielded against me I take them as a strong candidate and campaign accordingly. This time too the people of Baramati will elect me and I have faith in them.\u201dNotably, Ajit Pawar\u2019s nephew and grandson of Sharad Pawar, Yugendra Pawar, is contesting from the same constituency as the NCP-SP candidate.Baramati will see another Pawar versus Pawar contest after Supriya Sule, daughter of Sharad Pawar, defeated Sunetra Pawar, wife of Ajit Pawar, during the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year.Speaking to ANI, when asked about contesting the election against his uncle, who has won this seat seven times, Yugendra Pawar said that he feels it is quite sad and quite unfortunate.\u201dI feel it is quite sad, quite unfortunate that this had to come in the family. Not in Vidhan Sabha but it started in Lok Sabha and we were always together and even the incumbent MLA was always under the guidance of the founder of the party and family patriarch Sharad Pawar Sahab. What happened all of India has seen. The party split and the symbol was given to them by the election commission,\u201d he told ANI.Yugendra Pawar added, \u201cThis was unfortunate but all of us in the family decided that we need to stay with Pawar Sahab because he is the founder of the NCP, he is the patriarch of the family and it is because of him that not only Baramati but everybody around also prospered.\u201dYugendra Pawar feels that the fight against his own uncle won\u2019t be tough but won\u2019t be easy either.He said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be tough but I don\u2019t even think that it will be easy either. But initially Pawar Sahab was supporting Ajit Pawar, we fondly call him Dada but people of Baramati in large numbers are behind Pawar Sahab and that is what they showed in Lok Sabha. They will show this in the upcoming assembly as well as other elections also.The Maharashtra Assembly elections are scheduled for November 20, with counting for all 288 constituencies set for November 23.In the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, the Shiv Sena 56, and the Congress 44. In 2014, the BJP secured 122 seats, the Shiv Sena 63, and the Congress 42",
