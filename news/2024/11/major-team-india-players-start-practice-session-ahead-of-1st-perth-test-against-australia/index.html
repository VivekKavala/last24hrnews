                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> On Tuesday, experienced stars like Virat, Bumrah, Jadeja and Ashwin were not present while players like Pant, KL and Jaiswal toiled hard in the nets, having hour-long sessions.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The batters tried to get used to the fast and bouncy conditions common in Australia and several local Perth club bowlers were selected to unleash their bowling to Indian stars.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Back-of-a-length balls were encouraged while bouncers were rare, as per ESPNCricinfo.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Jaiswal was batting with the same attacking avatar he has displayed in his Test career so far, with one of his big hits clearing the nets and sailing into the Braithwaite Street.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> Pant looked fluent while batting but got hit on his body.</p>

                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> The 36-year-old looked extremely sharp and focused against pace bowling which he faced for more than an hour.</p>
                            
                            <p class='m-b-5 small-txt'> He spent time in each of four nets.</p>
